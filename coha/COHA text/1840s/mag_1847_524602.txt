txt TuE design of this work , manifestly , was formed directly upon that of the singularly successful volumes by the same author- " Napoleon and his Marshals . " It is simply carrying out a fortunate idea into a similar field-an extension , we are bound to say , which no other could have thought of , much less attempted to put into execution , without resting subject to the charge of a species of plagiarizing ; and as it appeals , if not so strongly to our imagination and love of magnificent scenes , yet immediately to our patriotism and national pride , it can hardly fail of being equally successful . To the publisher-we are not sure but to the author-this is perhaps the chief consideration . Not that they are to be considered ( like most of those among us , who make or put forth what they call books ) as abiding by the feeling of Flaccus ' satirical maxim : " qunrenda pecunia prima est ; Virtus post nummos. " which may be freely translated , " No matter what the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accusation for those to make who have seen their own judicious sheets used to bind the backs of a more popular commodity . Such are apt to profess a light estimation for what so nimbly runs away from them . They are suspicious of a want of weight in a book WASHINGTON AND HIS GENERALS . By J. T. Headley , author of " Napoleon and his Marshals , " the " Sacred Mountains , " etc. : in two volumes . Vol . I. New York : Baker &amp; Scribner. // which possesses such an alacrity at moving off , forgetting that the indiscriminate binder spoken of hath clapped upon its shoulders the heaviness of their lucubrations . But in truth it is neither gratifying to the author , nor of benefit to the publisher or the public , for a book to be so excellent and heavy that no one will either buy or read it . For a thing is written to be read-else it were as well for the seller , or the private gentleman , to paint certain blocks of wood , as " Histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permanently arranged around their shelves . True , literary " virtue " ( excellence ) is doubtless like moral , " its own exceeding great reward ; " but then it must be of a lively turn , or , in a mere temporal point of view , it will not pay . Posterity , indeed , will sometimes command that a volume be popular which has been gathering dust for half a century . But posterity sits with his laurels , &amp;c. , on a very distant hill ; his money-bag , at least , is always emptied down the other declivity . On the whole , we do not ourselves know that one should act in authorship the part of the witless fellow , who , hearing that a raven would live a hundred years , bought one to see how it would talk the second century ; nor , ( were we liable ever to be an author , ) should we prefer , all things considered , the existence of the toad , which , by some inherent " virtue , " maintains a torpid vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary life at the end of five hundred years . Besides , on account of our salutary policy in relation to copyrights , foreign works of quality have such facilities for making their way among us , that author and publisher may very reasonably congratulate themselves , if a native book shows such winning qualities as to carry treble " weight , " ( pretium major , ) and yet distance interlopers . In brief , a very pretty general defence might be made for a book that sells ; and as the present volumes , by all indications , are to undergo that stigma , we proffer our service to the publishers for this purpose , provided they will-pay for it ! Meanwhile , however-that is , till they come down handsomely in some shape , an advertisement extraordinary , or something more private-we think of following the example of a portion of the daily press , intimating chiefly the faults of the work . We have known cases where this course was followed with the happiest results . Of course , it is necessary not to go so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the most efficient praise , when " something has occurred " to give the critic a clearer view of things . Troubled with indigestion , we feel grammatically inclined . " Hence , " we have to remark , with regret , that the warlike author , though much mare careful , has not entirely reformed his ways in this respect . We are aware that in reviewing works of renown , we are not expected to descend to Syntax ; - in short , that we risk all credit for enlarged and comprehensive criticism by remembering the scruples of Murray . But then what can a nervous man do , when the second paragraph of an author 's Preface opens like this ? - " It is a little strange that a war , embracing more of the romantic and heroic of any that ever transpired , &amp;c. , "  --  and ends after this manner : " In writing the account of a campaign , or battle , for a military man , one needs to look on it from a djfferent point of view than he would in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbles in beginning to run  --  but a preface is generally the last thing written , and most persons are particularly careful therein , designing it to be the first thing read . " Laid " and " laying , " ( pp. 52 and 103 ) for " lay " and " lying , " are a recreation in language which might be given over exclusively to the country press ; and " never did troops charge braver than they , " is a forgetfulness of the office of prose adverbs " most tolerable and not to be endured . " Again- " When Lord Percy , marching through Roxbury , &amp;c. , asked a youth , &amp;c. , why he laughed , received for reply , " &amp;c. ; - qu. what is so fortunate as to be nominative to " received ? " Also : " Bonaparte was never confused , and Washington never lost his composure in battle , and hence were so hard to be beat . " However , Mr. Headley relies on other qualities ; all the principal grammarians are dead , and the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to fear . In respect to images and comparisons - Mr . Headley 's peculiar forte  --  the present volume , though sufficiently profuse in them , is quite beyond censure-except that we were a little startled at the " Volcano of fire that mowed down whole ranks at a time , "  --  and were still more struck with the efficiency of the expression , " covering the field with a perfect carpet of corpses I , ' // This word " perfect , " by the way , used in this manner , is a vulgarism-employed quite too frequently by one possessing so facile a command of vigorous and varied language . On p. 18 we have , " It is a perfect wonder-p. 103 , " Those thirtyfive ( 1 ) muskets sent a perfect shower of balls " - p. 118 , " pe*fect hurricane of fire and lead " - p. 242 , " perfect deluge of rain " - p. 268 , " perfect carpet of corpses , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . It is a kind of natural contortion of the author 's mind , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene or action , than can well be twisted out of it . The same thing is observable in other similar phrases , as , " That lonely height fairly rocked under the bombs , " &amp;c. - and , two lines afterwards , " It absolutely rained shots and shells . " What is the use of such epithets ? They add nothing to the force of description ; by avoiding them , greater elegance of style is obtained with equal power . But this is , in fact , Mr. Headley 's chief fault  --  and every popular author must have one  --  to seize , for the moment , the strongest possible expressions , quite regardless of what has previously been used , and not always careful as to the character of the epithets themselves . " Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof ; " the past is past , and the future must take care of itself ; the immediate occasion demands the utmost power of simile , image , appellative . A clergyman asked the brightest of his scripture pupils , whether " the leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the satisfactory reply ; " when he 's got tired of one spot , he goes to another ! " Our author has a faculty of changing his place but taking his " spots " with him . Like a bold man , indeed ,  --  and we like him the better for it-he defends his repetition . In his preface , speaking of his former work , he observes , that " the intense words of our language are easily exhausted ; and one is often compelled , in describing thrilling scenes , to choose between a weak sentence and the repetition of strong words , and perhaps similar comparisons ; " and that such sketches " are not designed to have any relation to each other , any more than a separate collection of paintings ; and to make one tame , in order to relieve the other appears a very questionable mode of treating men or their actions . " We certainly think this a good defence against those who censure the general similarity of his battle-scenes . They could not have been managed otherwise . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless slighted at the expense of others , must have certain features and colors in common with the rest  --  the movement of dark masses of men  --  the belching of cannon  --  the onset  --  the encounter " the war-cloud rolling duo "  --  the torn banners  --  the confused retreat  --  the wreck of artillery , and the many heaps of mangled soldiers and steeds scattered over a field of blood . He would of course draw around each what was peculiar in its action . and especially in its external scenery . This , we believe , Mr. Headley , with his quick eye , has uniformly done ! except that he has hardly spent as much time , for variety 's sake , as a painter would have employed , in the manner of his coloring . But so far the author 's defence is good . We submit , however , whether it is politic , or at all necessary for him to make repeated use of the same rery peculiar word ; still more of the same compound expression . It was sufficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that tall and commanding form " twice , ( - with " tall form " and " tall person " intermediate , ) without employing the phrase a third and fourth time . It was enough to have declared within the compass of two and a half pages that " the bullets rained like hail-stones about him " - " bullets whistle about him , " - " shot fell like hail about him , " and soon after , " where the shot fell like hail about him " - without ever using the phrase again in the same volume . So also of the beautiful image of the snow " weaving a winding-sheet , " or wrapping a shroud * around the dead-which , used two or three times in " Napoleon and his Marshals , " is employed twice in the brief sketch of the gallant and noble Montgomery . By the way , Mr. Headley may not remember it , but the image is original , we think , with Campbell : " The snow shall be their winding-sheet . " We can not but object , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " eagle of Liberty " - which were given up , we thought , long ago , to fourth of July orations . In one place it has very nearly a ludicrous effect : - " Into these the Sons of Liberty crept , many so naked , they could not come forth again into the camp . " Some other carelessnesses of style might be noticed-especially the little attention often paid , where considerate // writers bestow a great deal , to the variety and grace of transition from one paragraph to another , and the manner of introducing quotations . In respect to the latter , for instance , five out of six of all quotations are brought in with " he says , " says he , " " he said , " said he , " and " saying . " We remember being troubled with the sight of it throughout both volumes of his former work . The author may accuse us of noticing matters of small moment . We can not think so . Taken separately , they are nothing . But frequently recurring they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the impression of a general loose-jointedness of style . And what right has an author so widely popular by reason of his other qualities , to exhibit any such carelessness ? Mr. Headley 's freshness and force of language , his scenic eye , his singular vividness of imagery and graphic power , all of which make up the remarkable movement of his style , aided by the peculiar interest of the topics he has chosen , send his books by thousands to the remotest parts of the country . No book within our memory has gone so fast and so far . But it needs no argument , to show that a popular work , loosely , carelessly , or defectively written , is , in some respects , an injury to our literature , and the more so the more widely it is circulated . For if all were such , we should soon become a nation of heedless writers . The truth is , Mr. Headley will not " take the time . " With his resources of language , he was perfectly able , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings , the defects we have mentioned-except that similarity of many battle-scenes , in which we unhesitatingly defend him . He is fruitful in imagery : why should he use over that which he himself has stereotyped , when nature will furnish to his seeking enough such striking similes as that which he has so happily hit upon in this volume-of a dark rank of men suddenly and continuously crumbling away like a sand-bank before the rapid fire of musketry ? And even as to old expressions , and the transitions of the narrative , there are a hundred ways of attaining variety with them ; the student of style must find them out . We beg Mr. Headley to believe that we are as serious as we are sincere . We are admirers , with any one , of vivid rapidity and power ; but we are equally so of those proprieties of language by which alone any writings have lived . Unquestionably , the two can be united ; and they ought to be , even in sketches . But if we must take him as he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches have stirringly occupied a field to which no American writer-or English writer , except Allison-has ever done any justice . The " great Homer sometimes slept " - till Jove wakened him with his thunder . Mr. Headley is waked up by the roar of cannon . With the first booming sound he is thoroughly aroused . Suddenly he stands , like Campbell at Hohen-Linden , on some hill , or watch-tower  --  and looks over the whole battle-field . He takes in at a glance the surrounding scenery of hill , valley , plain , winding stream and the skirtings of forest . He marks the array of hostile armies-vast black centreswide wings-deep battalions of reserve in the rear-on the outskirts hovering cohorts-and frowning batteries waiting silently on strong positions . Officers plumed and restless hurry from line to line ; he bears the terrible beating of drums , the braying of trumpets , and the long wail of the war-bugle ; and he sees the dark masses of men moving steadily towards each other , like opposing thunder-clouds . He sees the plunging charge of cavalry  --  the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the deep roar shaking the hills where he stands - the day-long struggle  --  the storming , the repulse , banners wavering wildly amid smoke-clouds  --  the retreat , the flight , the pursuit , the victory , and the bloody sun sinking down over a wide field covered with armies fallen " Rider and horse , friend , foe , in one red burial blent . " All this-caught from whatever obscure annals , traditions , or rude newspaper chronicles of the day-Mr . Headley sees as if he had been present ; and seeing , he is able to put it all on paper . Having this ability , we would add , we do not know why he should not exercise it . The objections which some have made we think quite idle ; as if great battles were not a part of all history , and to be described , like everything else , with whatevergrapbic power is in the historian. , I It is better indeed , when Freedom triumphs ; and nothing , at least , will be urged against the scenes of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means lies entirely in describing battles , // or any kind of mere scenes . When he chooses to labor upon them , his summaries of personal qualities and characteristics are quite equal to anything else in his writings . There are good instances in the present work ; there were still more in the former . On the sketch of Washington , aside from its great length , we have no doubt he spent more labor than on that of Napoleon . Yet we question if it will generally be considered as effective a piece of writing . There is a good reason , and a plain one . For Napoleon he is the advocate ; for Washington , the eulogist . But a defence is apt always to be more vigorous , stirring , interesting , than a eulogy . The heart of both speaker and hearer is more thoroughly engrossed in it . The plea for a great criminal will usually draw a larger throng than the funeral of a good man . The essay , however , though embracing , in passages , some defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our mind more truthful , comprehensive and satisfactory than any yet given by writers of history or narrative . These writersMr . Sparks included-have always set him up as a kind of statue , massive and wonderful , but cold and distant . Mr. Headley presents him -- from thetoils of his youth as surveyor in the wilds of Virginia to his calm retirement at Mount Vernon , before his death-as a man of feelings and passions like those of other men , but subdued by a native loftiness of deportment , a dignity of soul , and the serenity of a great and fearless heart . All accumulated information about him , for many years past , shows this to be the true portrait . We will quote a few detached passages , which will give in part Mr. Headley 's view of his nature and character : " In youth , the whistling of bullets was music to his ear ; but in riper age there was no sound so sweet to him as the song of the husbandman A certain amount of combativeness , destructiveness , if you please-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power . Every good and great man , from Moses to Paul , and Paul to Luther , has possessed it ; much more every wicked or ambitious spirit , which has succeeded in changing the world . A warm and fiery heart is necessary to great resolution and force . It is when this gets the mastery over the moral qualities and over the judgment , that the man becomes unbalanced and renders himself either depraved or untrustworthy . Had Washington been the meek and gentle child so many of our public teachers represent him to be , he would never have preferred the adventurous life of a xnidshipman to that of his quiet home ;  --  or the marshalling into companies his young playmates in mimic battle , or afterwards , the vigorous leap and stern wrestle to the more innocent sports of the fireside and company of gentler children . The truth is , George Washington was a boy of ardent and fiery feelings , and a youth of strong and terrible passions . The military spirit , so conspicuous in a lad of fifteen years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards so severely tried . His favorite sport , which was to arrange his companies into columns of attack , and himself lead them to the charge , did not indicate any natural love of war , but simply a spirit of fire and force . His athletic sports and the character of his amusements , show even at this early age the surplus energy he possessed , and which must out in some way . This sent him off , when but seventeen years of age , into the Allegliany mountains , as surveyor None but a man of immense energy and great courage would have undertaken , as he did , at twenty-one years of age , to go as a commissioner , accompanied only by seven men , seven hundred miles , half the ; way through an untrodden forest , to the French commandant on the Ohio river The next year , when a lieutenant.colonel , he marched back into the wilderness and attacked the French This was Washington 's first engagement , and the kind of feeling he carried into it , and indeed brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a letter home , said he , Iheard the bullets whistle , and believe me , there is something charming in the sound . ' . . . . But it was at Braddock 's defeat that he exhibited those striking qualities which form the great commander , and that cool intrepidity and reckless daring for which he was distin guished That morning , as Washington gazed on the British columns , moving in beautiful order to the sound of stirring music along the banks of the Monongahela , the gentle river on one side and the green forest on the other , while the beams of the uprisen sun were sent back in dazzling splendor from the nearly two thousand steel bayonetsthat shook in their light , his eye flashed with delight . He was at this time 23 years old , six foot two or three inches high , and strongly made . As he had predicted , the army fell into an ambuscade . As the advance party of three hundred men were ascending a hill , flanked on either side by a ravine , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a girdle of flame . So close and deadly was the fire , that the soldiers could not bear up against it , and after a few volleys broke and fled down the hill . // Falling on the columns and artillery below , they threw them also into confusion , and the whole army became a disordered multitude , driven hither and thither , while whole ranks were falling at every discharge . In this dilemma , Braddock prohibited the Virginia regiment from placing themselves behind trees and fighting the Indians in their own way , and began to order UI ) his men in platoons , and wheel them into close columns , as he had been accustomed to do on the l ) lains of Europe . Young Washington gazed with indignation on this sacrifice of life , and without the power to order a single company , stood and saw his brave Virginians fall . At length Gen. Braddock was struck down , and his two aids borne wounded from the fight , leaving Washington alone to distribute orders . Here his military qualities shone forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every side of him , yet reckless of danger , he spurred his steed over the dead and dying alike , straining every nerve to stay the reversed tide of battle . At length his horse sunk under him , and he fell amid his wounded and dead companions . Springing on the back of another he pressed amid the throng , pointing in this and that direction with his sword , and sending his calm and resolute voice amid the frightened ranks , but without avail . A second horse fell beneath him , and he leaped to the saddle of a third , while the bullets rained like hailstones about him . Four passed through his coat , and he knew that he was a sure mark for the Indian rifles as he thus rode from point to point . But he seemed to possess a charmed life ; for while nearly half the entire army that had three hours before crossed the Monongahela in such beautiful order and proud array , had sunk on the bloody field , and three-fourths of the whole eighty-seven officers were dead or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rouse him , but when his anger was up , it was the more terrible , from the very strength against which it had risen . Thus , at Kipp 's Bay , in New York , during his retreat to Harlaem Heights , it broke over all bounds . The new levies stationed to support this point fled , and the two brigades ordered up broke and fled also at the advance of only sixty men . Washington , astonished and indignant at such cowardice , rode in among them , and endeavored to rally and lead them back . Finding all his efforts vain , his indignation burst forth like a torrent , and he spurred upon them with his drawn sword , and snapped his pistol in their faces . Finding all this of no avail , with his lip curled in scorn and his blue eye flashing fire , he wheeled and halted alone in front of the enemy , and there , like Murat before the Russian battery , stood and let the bullets whistle about him . At length one of his attendants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and turned him off the field . So at Germantown , finding his troops hard pressed , he rode into the very vortex of battle , where the shot fell like hail about him . His friends urged him away , but in a few moments that tall form was again seen enveloped in smoke , and no power could stir him from the deadly fire till his men began to retreat . At Monmouth , where he burst in such stern wrath on Lee , and amid the thunder of artillery and shouts of the victorious pursuers , rallied his broken ranks , and rolled back the tide of battle with his mighty arm , he exhibits both the impetuosity of his character and that cool and determined bravery which made him such a fearful antagonist in the field . At Princeton , too , he performed one of thnse heroic deeds which spring impulsively from a soul on fire with daring , and carried away by a sudden and lofty enthusiasm . Stealing by night from the overwhelming English army , he came in the morning upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in pieces , or be ruined . In the very heat and crisis of battle , seeing his men begin to waver and break , he snatched a standard , and plunging the rowels in his steed , spurred midway between the contending lines , and , with his manly breast turned full on the foe , said , in a language more eloquent than words , ' Follow your General . ' . . . I do not believe that Washington knew the sensation of fear . There was no amount of danger that could daunt him , and the great exposure of his person in battle was a source of constant anxiety to his friends . Circumstances made him the American Fabius , while nature designed him for a far different warrior . Had he in his youth commanded in the French army , he would have been one of the most terrible men in an onset , and the steadiest , coolest in repelling an assault that ever led a host to battle . Like Ney , he would have hurled his columns on the foe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , in the height of a panic and in the midst of his flying troops , he would have stood as calm and self-collected and fearless as he did on the bloody field of Monongahela . But circumstances placed him in a l ) osition where caution and hesitation and delays were indispensable* Those mistake who suppose his slowness in coming to an engagement , and his great prudence , were the result of his inclination . He dared not hazard everything on a single throw , where not himself but his country , and the hopes of freedom would be the stake at issue . Moreover , he had not the means to make a bold push with . Had he possessed a small army , composed // of such materials as those which the young Bonaparte found in the army in Italy , he would not have stood merely on the defensive so long as he did . But without amrnunition ,  --  without discipline ,  --  indeed , without thorough organization ,  --  his troops could not be relied on , and he knew it . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few rounds of ammunition to each man . His judgment forced him to the cautious course he pursued , though at first he chafed like a lion in the toils . Said he once , in referring to his difficulties , and the disinclination of the soldiers whose term of service had expired , to re-enlist , Could I have known that such backwardness would have been discovered by the old soldiers to the service , all the generals upon earth would not have convinced me of the propriety of delaying an attack on Boston till this time . ' And again , writing in the bitterness and even irritation of his great heart , as he still lies inactive around Boston , he says , I know the unhappy predicament in which I stand . I know what is expected of me ; I know that I can not stand justified to the world without exposing my own weakness , and injuring the cause by declaring my wants , which I am determined not to do farther than unavoidable necessity brings every man acquainted with them . . A'Jy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did not consult the public good more than my own tranquillity , Ishould long ere this have put cvery thing on the cast of a die . ' That is , had it been a matter of simple reputation with him , he would have ended the suspense he endured by one of those desperate movements that make or ruin a man forever . But his judgment and his conscience both held firm sway over his feelings , and guided him in the only safe course he could have gone . " * * * * * , I ' " His constancy and firmness were equal to his self-control . The changeless aspect and steadfast heart he maintained during those seven years of trouble and gloom which make up the history of the American Revolution , will be a wonder to the end of time . Cast down by no reverses , elated by no successes , he could be neither driven into despondency nor carried away by extravagant hopes . It is one of the remarkable traits in his character , that he never would stay beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish and dishearten his army till only a handful were left around him , he showed the same firm presence and unalterable resolution . Defeat never affected him , and his voice of hope sounded just as clear and cheerful though nothing but murmurs and complaint* filled the land . Thus , just before the close of the disastrous campaign of 1770 , that most critical period of the whole war , when a general gloom hung over the continent , and panic and despair were on every side , his constancy never shook . Instead of beating back the enemy , we ourselves had been beaten back at every point . Rhode Island , Long Island , Staten Island , New York , and nearly all of New Jersey , were in possession of the enemy , who were now moving down on Philadelphia . City after city had been captured , and nothing seemed able to resist their progress . Fort after fort had fallen . Lee had been taken prisoner , and the army , dwindled from twenty thousand to four thousand , was closely pursued by Cornwallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a proclamation , offering pardon to all who would take the oath of allegiance within sixty days . Crowds , and among them men of wealth and influence , accepted the terms ; and the panic spreading , all seemed lost . Yet even in this crisis , Washington never wavered for a moment . Calm and serene , he surveyed the troubled night about him , with his eye fixed steadily on the deepening gloom , and even lifted his voice of encouragement , declaring that he saw the morning beyond it all . And when asked what he would do if Philadelphia should be taken , replied , We will retreat beyond the Susquehannoh ; and thence sf necessary to the . **lleghany mountains . ' No sublimer speech ever fell from ancient or modern hero . " " No man took a beating more coolly than Washington , or turned on his heel with fiercer courage the moment his enemy relaxed his watchfulness . Cornwallis was one of the ablest generals of his time , yet his energies gave out at last , and he suffered himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had he shown but half the activity in his campaign against Lafayette that he did in the one against Greene , his fate would have been different ; but he was tired out-his energies had been taxed till they were exhausted , and he relaxed into comparative sluggishness ; yet one can not designate the single moment when Washingtun 's vigor became enfeebled by long , constant , and wasting toil . " But a man may possess all these necessary qualifications , fitting him to control a single army with admirable skill , and yet fail as commander-in-chief over forces scattered over a large territory . A mind of deep combinations is necessary to this a mind which , embracing the whole field of operations , and estimating the comparative strength of the forces that will be brought forward , and their progress , can come to correct conclusions and form accurate plans . That Washington possessed such a mind no one can doubt who reads his letters to Congress . The invasion of Canada  --  the destruction of Burgoynethe attack on Rhode Island  --  the management // of the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the work of his all-embracing plans . So correct was his judgment , that one is troubled to put his finger on a single error that he ever committed . There always must be failures , resulting from the inefficiency of subordinates , and the intervention of obstacles no human mind can foresee or prevent . " Hence , in contemplating the man alone , one finds in him every characteristic belonging to a military leader of the highest rank . In comparison with the renowned warriors of Europe , he fails only in the number and brilliancy of his victories . Now , in the first place , taken apart from the forces which accomplished them , there can be no more unsafe crit*-non by which to judge of a commander 's ability , than simple victories . Bonaparte considered Suchet th$3 best general in his army , and yet how few of the mass of mankind adopt his opinion . His whole career after he obtained a separate command was passed in the Peninsula , in a war against walled cities and strong fortresses , furnishing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be judged only by comparing his means with his success . " Great pitched battles , in which the eye is dazzled by the movements of two vast armies , and the senses stunned by the din and uproar of two hundred thousand men mixed in mortal combat , often fix forever in public estimation the fame of a leader , while the same end reached without this tumult excites no astonishment or applause . Thus Wellington 's fame , among the mass of his countrymen , rests on the battle of Waterloo , where nothing but an accident saved him from an utter overthrow , and from proving at once , what is now universally conceded , that the campaign was badly conducted ; while his campaigns in the Peninsula , where his military genius shines out in true splendor , are almost entirely forgotten . Washington 's situation was unlike that in which any other military chieftain had ever been placed . Napoleon , when he took command of the army of Italy , and with which he performed such prodigies , found himself over a body of veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively few , hut they had seen hard service , and needed only a fit leader to become a most formidable army . Besides , they were well supplied with arms , and were enlisted for life . But Washington had to create an army out of raw recruits , and then furnish them with arms and ammunition . No sooner was this done , than the term of enlistment expired , and he saw with the keenest anguish the force he had collected with so much labor dissolve like mist before him . What could be done with troops that sim ply passed and repassed the field of vision . There was no powder even for these recruits , raw as they were , and two thousand of them had not a musket to handle in case of a fight In moral elevation no warrior of ancient or modern times approaches him . Given to no excess himself , he sternly rebuked it in others . The principles of religion were deeply engrafted in his heart , and as there was no stain on his blade , he could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - A Brutus in justice , he did not allow personal friendship to sway his decision , or influence him in the bestowment of favors . Fearing neither the carnage of battle nor the hatred of men , threats moved him no more than flatteries ; and what is stranger still , the strong aversion to giving pain to his friends never swerved him from the path of duty . Sincere in all his declarations , his word was never doubted and his promise never broken . Intrusted finally with almost supreme power , he never abused it , and laid it down at last more cheerfully than he had taken it up . Bonaparte , vaulting to supreme command , seized it with avidity , and wielded it without restraint . The Directory obstructing his plans he broke it up with the bayonet . Cromwell did the same with the Rump Parliament , and installed himself Protector of England , and even hesitated long about the title of king . Washington , fettered worse than both , submitted to disgrace and defeat without using even a disrespectful word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indignation that forever crushed the hopes of those who presented it . Calm and strong in council , untiring in effort , wise in policy , terrible as a storm in battle , unconquered in defeat , and incorruptible in virtue , he rises in moral grandeur so far above the Alexanders , and Cnsars , and Napoleons of the world , that even comparison seems injus tice Riding out one day on horseback to visit his farm , he was overtaken with a storm of sleet and rain which chilled him through . A severe cold followed this exposure , which settling in his throat hurried him rapidly into his grave . On the night of the 14th of December , 1799 , two days after his attack , he ceased to breathe . Not in the delirium of battle did his soul , like that of Napoleon , take its flight , hot calmly sunk to rest amid the lamentations of a heart-broken people . Solemn ceremonies attended the funeral , and thousands followed the slow procession  --  but the mourners were not all therethey were scattered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minute guns were fired as his body was borne to the place of burial , and his old war-horse , saddled and bridled , walked riderless beside // the coffin . That noble steed he should never mount again , and to that could cheek the loud pealing cannon could never again send the blood as of yore . His work was done-his fierce battles over , and crowned with the noblest laurels ever worn by a created brow , the more than kingly sleeper was laid in his last resting place . The land was hung in crape , and one convulsive sob shook the heart of the nation . No people ever mourned a leader so , and no leader before was ever worthy such a sorrow . Even the young republic of France , then wading in blood , put on crape , and imposing ceremonies were decreed in his honor by the young Napoleon . " The principal battles fought by Washington are given in the Sketches of his Generals . We may refer to them on the appearance of a second volume . At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . In most of these the narration is more free than in that of Washington ; containing less of the labored portrait . Taken together , they are not , to the American reader , of less interest than those of Napoleon and his Marshals . There is not , indeed , that immense paraphernalia of war , the movement of those splendid armies , and such terrific carnage and sacking of cities as makes the blood turn chill . The whole series of events related makes up no wonderful drama , such as moves and gathers itself about the boy-Corsicanthe Conqueror of Europe  --  the Exile of St. Helena . But the battles have greater variety , and often more of the picturesque . Much of the Revolutionary struggle was warfare in the wilderness , with the deep glens of the forest and the painted Indian in the back-ground . And then the moral character of our contest as far transcends that of Napoleon 's wars , as the physical array of his great campaigns surpasses that of our ill-furnished , scattered and desultory movements . The cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear but that the interest of his readers will be sustained to the end of his volumes . The sketch of Putnam is excellent , and does full justice to a brave man , ngainst whose reputation , so long matter of history and tradition , absurd charges have of late been made . The description of the battle of Bunker Hill is the best yet written , unless Cooper 's glowing description of it in " Lionel Lincoln , " which is more dramatic , be judged equal to it . The brief account of the noble Montgomery , who fell , one of the first great sacrifices to the cause of a continent , is beautifully told . The " Storming of Quebec " is graphic , yet hardly as ample and clear as it might be , or as it would have been if the author had ever visited that quaint , bold place  --  the American Gibraltar . The best sketch in the volume is that of Arnold . It partakes partly of the spirit of a defence . Not that the author for one instant attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how fearless , enterprising and indomitable a man he was ; that much of our success np to the time of his treason , including the important battle of Saratoga , was due to him ; that Congress all alongneglecting to honor him for his great services , and advancing inferior officers to the generalship over him , when they had not a tithe of his high qualities for the station-did him sad injustice , even in the view and expressed opinion of Washington himself ; and that history , since his treason , by refusing to take note of these things , as well as of that fatal crime and his subsequent cruel career , has done him equal injustice . We have always taken this view , in part ; and we predict that this sketch will modify the opinions of many men xVith respect to Benedict Arnold . He was naturally cruel , proud , vindictive ; hut so much the greater need was there that such a man should not suffer greatwrongs . We will quote detached passages from this sketch also . It will be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to see how Nature can form , and a revolution turn up and mould , two such characters as Washington and Arnold . " Arnold , " says Mr. Headley , " was one of those rash , reckless persons , like Murat and Junot , who in times of peace become bold speculators , roving adventurers , or dissipated young men . The fierce life within them must out in some form or other , and expend itself somewhere . In war they form the leading characters , for they are at home in the excitement of battle , and delight to struggle on a field of great risks . " From his boyhood , Arnold exhibited the leading traits of his character . Reckless , pitiless , and daring , he was the terror of his playmates , and disliked by all . . . He would scatter broken glass in the road , where the school-children passed barefoot , and tempt them round the druggist-shop in which he was employed , with broken phials , only to scourge them away with a horsewhip . He was bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feats which none of his companions dared imitate . It was a favorite amusement with him at a grist-mill , to which he sometimes carried grain , to seize the large waterwheel by the arms , and go round and round with it in its huge evolutions-now buried under the foaming water , and now hanging above , in fierce delight , while his companions looked on in silent terror . " The colonies had endured as much as they could of British arrogance and oppression ; the Revolution broke out ; the news of the battles of Concord and Lexington reached New Haven , throwing the town into an uproar ; the bells were set ringing ; men ran to and fro in the streets ; Arnold , a captain of town guards , made an exciting speech to the tumultuous throngs on the green ; the keys of the magazine were seized , and helping his men to the king 's ammunition , he hurried them away to Boston . The Massachusetts Committee gave him four hundred men , with which he marched rapidly three hundred miles to Ticonderoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ethan Allen . A few days after , he sailed down with one schooner and fifty men , upon St. John 's , surprised the garrison , seized a British sloop , destroy ? d five batteaux , and captured four others . Unjustly superseded in his command , he hastened back to Cambridge . Washington had planned the invasion of Canada . He had formed the strikingly bold resolution to send an army , with provisions and artillery , through the forests of Maine and New Hampshire to Quebec . " Knowing the energy , daring and indomitable will of Arnold , he appointed him commander-in-chief of the forces . " This expedition of eleven hundred men , with all the equipage necessary , in conjunction with Montgomery 's , to storm that strong citadel , was to ascend the Kennebec , strike across to the Dead - River , follow up this stream through the vast forest , among swamps and constant waterfalls , cross glens and steep mountains to the Chaudiere , and thence down through still deeper forests to the St. Lawrence-two hundred miles of " blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through streams filled with ice , drenched with rain and sleet , their whole encampment swept away in the darkness by a sudden flood rising eight feet through the forest , losing boats , arms , provisions , among torrents and roaring waterfalls , till they roasted their miserable dogs and boiled their moose-skin moccasins , to allay the rage of hunger-through all this that body of a thousand men was carried by the skill and unconquerable energy of Arnold , and finally drawn up on the shores of the St. Lawrence , opposite Quebec . We do not know that we would say with Mr. Headley , that " Bonaparte 's passage of San Bernard with twenty thousand men will not compare with it " - though he gives very good reasons for it ; hut we will assert with him , that it is " one of the most remarkable marches on record . " The fate of the expedition is well known . Montgomery fell , and the command devolved upon Arnold . He passed the severe Canadian winter with his army in huts , and fortifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Canadas , by the way of Lake Champlain . On that lake Arnold fought so singular and desperate a battle , yet one which has never been much noticed , or had even a name till Mr. Headley gave it one , that we extract it entire . BATTLE OF VALCOUR ISLAND . " The British , in pursuing their advantage , had constructed a fleet at St John 's , with which to advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga . Every effort was made to repel this armament , and at length , after the greatest exertion , one sloop , three schooners , and five galleys were manned and placed under the command of Arnold . With these he set sail in the middle of August , 1770 , designing to take his station at the Isle-aux-T*tes , but finding the Island in possession of the enemy , he stopped at Windmill Point . On examination he found this position disadvantageous , so retreated to the Isle la Motte , and finally to Valcour Island , where he determined to make a stand . He had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three schooners , two sloops , three galleys , and eight gondolas as they were called , carrying in all seventy guns , many of them eighteen pounders . Valcour Island lies somewhat parallel to the shore , and so nearly connected with it at the northern extremity , that it is difficult to pass between even in small vessels . T.hus a deep channel is formed between it and the main land , opening towards the south . In the upper end of this Arnold moored his fleet , and hence was entirely concealed from the enemy until they had passed beyond him up the lake . He had completely shut himself in , so that when the British closed upon him , there would be no getting away but through their ships . He thus secured two objects-first , the co-operation of every one of his vessels , and secondly , pre // 527 vented himself from being outflanked , for his line of battle extended from the Island to the shore . He had not waited long in this position before the British fleet hove in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern point of the island Arnold 's boats were discovered , when hauling close to the wind , it bore up and hemmed him completely in . The fleet consisted of one ship , two schooners , two gondolas , twenty gun-boats , four long-boats , and forty-four smaller boats , containing in all seven hundred chosen seamen , and carrying ninety-three guns , some of them of heavy calibre . Over seventy vessels and boats in all , gathered like birds of prey around the mouth of this channel . Arnold saw at a glance that nothing but determined bravery could over come this immense superiority of force ; indeed it seemed that nothing but a miracle could save him . It was the eleventh of October , one of those sweet autumnal days , when the gentle wind creeps over the water , just stirring it into dimples . Arnold determined to take advantage of the wind , and attack some of the foremost boats , before the larger vessels could beat up to their aid . Ordering the schooner Royal Savage and three galleys to get under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gradually forced back by the superior strength of the enemy , and returned to the line . In this manouvre the Royal Savage went ashore and was abandoned . At noon , the British having brought one schooner and all their gunboats within musket shot of the Americans , the battle became general . Arnold , in the Congress galley , anchored himself in the hottest part of the fire , and never left his position . A large body of Indians on shore , kept up a constant blaze with their rifles , while between the island and main-land were two parallel lines of fire . The peaceful lake trembled like a frightened thing to the tremendous explosions , as nearly a hundred and sixty cannon thundered at once over the water . The deafening roar was heard even at Ticonderoga , filling the hearts of the garrison with anxious forebodings . " The light clouds trooping over the sky  --  the quiet nook in which the fleet lay at anchor  --  the embosoming forest-the crowds of shouting , swarthy savages on the shore , all added strange interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rolled towards the western hills , looked down on as brave a battle as ever was fought . The smoke , lifted up by the north wind , rolled sluggishly up the lake , leaving open and unobscured the contending fleets , as they thus lay and vomited forth fire on each other . The Congress and Washington galleys received the weight of the shock . Arnold , in the former , with two eighteen VOL . V-NO. v. 35 pounders , two twelves , and six sixes , fought like a desperado . Seeing the dreadful odds against him , and maddened at the thought of defeat , he seemed to scoff at death . Cheering on his men by his thrilling words , and still more by his fierce courage , he maintained the fight hour after hour , with a tenacity that nothing seemed able to shake . With his vessel riddled through and through , and filled with the dead , he still maintained his ground . Having no good engineers , he pointed his own guns , and multiplied himself with the dangers that encompassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shattered boats , and now along his heated cannon , to make the shots tell-blackened with powder and smoke , he bore up for five mortal hours in the driving tempest . The water was churned into foam around him by the raining balls-his mainmast had been struck twice , his rigging was cut into fragmentshe had received seven shots between wind and water , and been hulled twelve times ; yet still he refused to stir , and seemed resolved to sink at his anchors . A more gallant crew never rallied around a brave commander ; and though thinned and wasted , stood ready to go down at their post . " But night coming on , the British withdrew their forces , and after dark stretched their vessels in one line from the island to the shore , to prevent the retreat of the Americans , whom they now considered completely in their power . Arnold , however , had no thought of surrendering , and after a short consultation with his officers , resolved to pass through the enemy 's fleet and sail for Crown Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , all that were left , one schooner and one gondola being wrecked , and set sail . The wind had luckily changed , and each vessel , with a single light in the stern to guide the one that followed , passed in silent succession through the British line without being discovered . It was skillfully , bravely done , and the released little fleet bore steadily away up the lake till it reached Schoyler 's Island , where it was compelled to lay at anchor half a day in order to stop leaks and repair damages . Two of the gondolas being found too much crippled to proceed , were here sunk . In the afternoon they again weighed anchor , but the wind had now changed to the south , and they could make but little headway . The next morning a dense fog lay on the lake , blotting even the shores from view , but as the sun rose , it lifted and rolled gently away before the morning breeze , revealing the whole British fleet within a few miles of them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon them , presenting a beautiful appearance in the rising sun . Arnold 's galley together with the Washington and four gondolas , were so disabled // that they had fallen astern during the night , while the rest of the fleet , now barely discernible in the distance , was crowding all sail for Crown Point . On these disabled vessels the whole force of the enemy now advanced . At the first broadside , the Washington shamefully struck , and Arnold in his riddled galley , with only four gondolas , was left to meet the shock alone . To fight seemed utterly useless , nay , madness itself , but he had never yet learned the word surrender , and so gathered his few boats around him and opened the battle . A ship of eighteen guns , two schooners , one of fourteen and another of twelve , making in all forty-four guns , poured at once their concentrated and destructive fire upon his single vessel . Shattered so dreadfully from its former engagement , and enveloped in such a destructive fire , that poor galley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a look of stern defiance on his foe as the first broadside thundered over the water , then pointing his own guns , closed fiercely in with him . Nothing could exceed the excitement of the conflict at this moment . That single galley , too crippled to fly and too proud to surrender , enveloped by her foes , keeping her flag flying amid the smoke and carnage , was one of the subliinest sights the eye ever rested upon . Beneath those heavy and concentrated broadsides she trembled from stein to stern , and reeled and rocked on the water ; but when the smoke lifted , there still floated the flag , and beneath its folds stood Arnold , the impersonation of calm courage and heroic daring . The planks were splitting about him , and the splinters of the shivered timbers flying through the air on every side , yet he still maintained the fight . Thus hour after hour he struggled in this unequal contest , until at length other boats of the enemy arrived , and advanced to the attack . With seven vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after broadside , he still disdained to surrender . In the very centre of this fleet , covering him with a cloud of canvas , and drawing their circle of fire nearer and nearer every moment , he stood like a tiger at bay . For four terrible hours he had continued this unequal combat , and now a perfect wreck , he saw his vessel must inevitably be lost . But scorning to fall into the hands of the enemy . he put forth one of those great and desperate efforts for which he was remarkable , and breaking fiercely through the ships , run his galley and four gondolas ashore in a small creek and set fire to them . He then ordered the marines to leap overhoard , musket in hand , and wade to the heach , and there fire on the small boats if they ventured to approach . For himself he remained all alone aboard his burning galley , with his flags flying over his head . Enveloped in smoke , he stood and watched the fierce flames as they gained on the vessel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sprung into the water and joined his men on shore . There never was a more gallant achievement performed than this , or a nobler exhibition of courage and daring . " Notwithstanding all these brilliant achievements of Arnold , with which the country rung , Congress , creating five new major-generals , left him out ; and all those appointed were his juniors in rank ! Arnold was justly indignant and ready to throw up his commission , but Washington wrote him , " begging him to do nothing hasty , assuring him it was a mistake and should he rectified . " Arnold magnanimously refrained from doing what , we think , Washington himself would have done instantly ; and while waiting for justice , attacked , with five hundred militia , two thousand British regulars who had just burned Danhury . Two horses were shot under him , and for three days he assailed them at every turn , till they fled on board their ships . Forced , by this gallant behavior , Congress made him major-general , but withheld his rank . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined Gen. Schuyler . While there he learned that " Congress had voted on the question of his rank , and decided against him . " The fact is , that Arnold had some hitter enemies in Congress , who misrepresented things and carried votes against him . That Congress , as a body , though often wavering and inefficient , was certainly not disposed to act unjustly . Stung to the quick , Arnod was yet persuaded to remain , Schuyler urging the ? ? eed his country had of him , when the strong army of Burgoyne was sweeping down upon them from the North . He consented to stay and help him face the immediate danger ; and , on the 19th of September , fought skillfully , with his division alone , the first sanguinary engagement with a part of Burgoyne 's army . Gen. Gates , an envious , pompous and ambitious man , now began to treat him with great injustice and meanness , making no mention of him in his official report , and finally taking away his division and giving it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 7th of October , was fought , he , the best , bravest , and most successful general in the army , was without a comn*. mand . " " He was in the camp when the can nonading of the 7th of October commenced and listened , one may guess with what // feelings , to the roar of battle , which was ever music to his stormy nature . As the thunder of artillery shook the ground on which he stood , followed by the sharp rattle of musketry , his impatience and excitement could be no longer restrained . He walked about in the greatest agitationnow pausing to listen to the din of war , and now watching the fiercely ascending volumes of smoke that told where the fight was raging . Ah who can tell what gloomy thoughts and fierce purposes of revenge were then and there born in his maddened soul-it is terrible to drive the brave to despair . The hero of Quebec , Champlain , and Ridgefield , to whom the headlong charge and perilous march were a delight , who panted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an inefficient commander to remain inactive . His brave followers were rushing on death without him , and sudden resolves and overwhelming emotions kept up such a tumult in his bosom , that his excitement at length amounted almost to madness . FLIES TO THE BATTLE-FIELD . " Unable longer to restrain his impulses , he called like the helpless Augereau for his horse . Vaulting to the saddle , he rode for a while around the camp in a tempest of passion . At length a heavy explosion of artillery , making the earth tremble beneath him , burst on his ear . He paused a moment and leaned over his saddle-bow , then plunging his rowels up to the gaffs in his horse , launched like a thunderbolt away . He was mounted on a beautiful dark Spanish mare , named Warren after the hero of Bunker Hill , worthy such a rider , and which bore him like the wind into the battle . " It was told to Gates that Arnold had gone to the field , and he immediately sent Col. Armstrong after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called back as he had been before , spurred furiously amid the ranks , and as the former approached him galloped into the volleys , and thus the chase was kept up for half an hour , until at length Armstrong gave it up , and the fierce chieftain had it all his own way . Goaded by rage and disappointment almost into insanity , he evidently was resolved to throw away his life , and end at once his troubles and his career . Where the shot fell thickest , there that black steed was seen plunging through the smoke , and where death reaped down the brave fastest , there his shout was heard ringing over the din and tumult . He was no longer the cool and skillful officer , but the headlong warrior reckless of life . His splendid horse was flecked with foam , and it seemed impossible that his rider could long survive amid the fire through which he so wildly galloped . Some of the officers thought him intoxicated , so furious and vehement were his movements , and so thrilling his shout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head he summoned his followers to the charge . Once , wishing to go from one extremity of the line to the other , instead of passing behind his troops , he wheeled in front and galloped the whole distance through the cross-fire of the combatants , while a long huxxa followed him . Holding the highest rank on the field , his orders were obeyedexcept when too desperate for the bravest to fulfil  --  and receiving no orders himself , he conducted the whole battle . His frenzied manner , exciting appeals , and fearful daring , infused new spirit into the troops , and they charged after him , shouting like madmen . So perfectly beside himself was he with excitement , that he dashed up to an officer who did not lead on his men as he wished , and opened his head with his sword . He was everywhere present , and pushed the first line of the enemy so vigorously that it at length gave way . Burgoyne moving up his right wing to cover its retreat , he hurled three regiments with such terrible impetuosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the British officers were making desperate efforts in other parts of the field to stay the re*versed tide of battle , he pressed on after Burgoyne - storming over the batteries , and clearing every obstacle , till at length he forced him and the whole army back into their camp . Not satisfied with this he prepared to storm the camp also . But once behind their intrenchments , the British rallied and fought with the fury of men struggling for life . The grape shot and balls swept every inch of the ground , and it rained an iron tempest on the American ranks , but nothing could resist their fiery valor . On , on they swept in the track of their leader , carrying everything before them . The sun had now sunk in the west , and night was drawing its mantle over the scene . Arnold , enraged at the obstinacy of the enemy , and resolved to make one more desperate effort for a complete victory , rallied a few of his bravest troops about him , and rousing them by his enthushsstic appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " You , " said he to one , " was with me at Quebec , you in the wilderness , and you on Champlain-Follow me ! " His sword was seen glancing like a beam of light along their serried array-the next moment he galloped in front , and riding right gallantly at their head through the devouring fire , broke with a clatter and a crash into the very sally port of the enemy , where horse and ridersunk together to the earth  --  the good*steed dead , and Arnold beneath him , with his leg shattered to pieces , the same leg that was broken at the storming of Quebec . // " This ended the fight , and the wounded hero was borne pale and bleeding from the field of his fame only to awaken to chagrin and disappointment . There is but little doubt that when he violated his orders and galloped to the field , he had made up his mind to bury his sorrows and disappointments in a bloody grave . Would that he had succeeded , and saved himself from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arnold never fought again for freedom . Congress , at last , after all these victories , gave him his rank ; but he had become , at Philadelphia , involved deeply in debt , and in difficulties with the Council ; a court-martial declared him , with justice no doubt , to have acted " imprudently and unwisely ; " and , like Coriolanus , he remembered his services and his wrongs . At one time he thought of quitting the army and , like a Roman General , establishing a settlement in the wilderness of Western New York , with his old officers and soldiers ; would he had so ended his career . Pressed by immediate difficulties , and actuated by revenge , he obtained the key of the Hudson river , then gave it up to the enemy and blackened his name forever . Mr. Headley , we think , has drawn his character with much justice . " He was a man of decided genius-sudden and daring in his plans , and brilliant in their execution . As an officer he possessed great merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shield of his person between him and his enemies . Like Bonaparte he wantedpower and sksll at the head of his armies . Impelled by broader and nobler views than Con. gress , and governed by a juster spirit , he would , if left to himself , have hound Arnold to the cause of freedom with cords of iron . He would not have visited too severely on him his extravagances , or held him too closely accountable for the use of his power . Knowing him to be impetuous and headlong , nay , arrogant and overbearing , and often unscrupulous , he would have curbed him by remonstrance rather than by disgrace , and directed all those vast energies so eager for action on the foes of his country . But with all Arnold 's impetuosity , he was prudent and skilful . He laid his plans with judgment , then pressed them with a vigor and energy that astonished every one . He could be safely trusted with an army , for although he could scarcely resist the temptation to fight when battle was afforded , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful skill . He would struggle with the most stubborn obstinacy to maintain his ground against an overwhelming force , and when compelled to retreat , do it with consummate address . One great cause of his success was his celerity of movement . His mind worked with singular rapidity , and what he resolved to do he urged on with all the power of which he was possessed . His blow was no sooner planned than it fell , and in the heati of a close fight , he was prompt and deadly as a bolt from heaven . Shattering that he might reach , and shattering what he reached , ' he was one of those few fearful men in the world that make us tremble at ourselves . His power over his troops , and even over militia , was so great , that they became veterans at once under his eye , and closed like walls of iron around him . A braver man never led an army . He not only seemed unconscious of fear , but loved the excitement of danger , and was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . Place a column of twenty thousand veteran troops under him , and not a marshal of Bonaparte 's could carry it farther , or hurl it with greater strength and terror on an enemy than he . Caught by no surprise-patient and steady under trials , energetic and determined amid obstacles , equal to any emergency , and daring even to rashness-he was a terrible man on the battle-field . But his pride and passions were too strong for his principles , and he fell like Lucifer from heaven . Placing his personal feelings above , everything else , he sacrificed even his country to them . Revenge was stronger than patriotism . " " Arnold 's treason has sunk in oblivion all his noble deeds-covered his career with infamy , and fixed a deep and damning curse on his name . Men turn abhorrent from his grave-friends and foes speak ot him alike with scorn , and children learn to shudder at the name of Benedict Arnold . This is all right and just , but there is another lesson beside the guilt of treason to be learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let party spirit or personal friendship promote the less deserving over their superiors in rank . The enemies of Arnold have a heavy account to render for their injustice , and our Congress would do well to take warning from their example . " As we have touched above upon the battle-ground of Saratoga , we will add here a full description of that most complete and important , perhaps , of all the baffles of the Revolution . The description occurs in the sketch of Gen. Gates : " It was now about three o'clock , and a sudden cessation of arms took place , while the two divisions prepared for the final encounter . An oblong clearing , about sixty rods in extent , and entirely surrounde dwith woods , separated them , as they stood out of // musket-shot of each other , like the opposite sides of a parallelogram . This clearing sloped down from the northern side towards the southern , on which the Americans were posted . A deep wood sheltered them , while the British were drawn up in an open pine forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Americans looked out from their leafy covering , they saw amid the dark pine trees on the farther side , long rows of brass cannon shining through the green foliage , and beside them the gunners , with lighted matches , while still farther on gleamed the solid lines of steel bayonets . Noueht broke the silence that wrapped the heigi*ts , save the hurried orders , as regiment after regiment wheeled into its place ; while the sun shone sweetly down on the springing grass , gently waving in the mild September h reeze . Thus slept that quiet clearing on the top of the hills , with the long shadows of the trees stretching across its bosom  --  and all around a lay that slumbering volcano , soon to move into its midst , and make it tremble as if in the grasp of an earthquake . The Americans could hear distinctly the orders given in the English army , and waited , with beating hearts , the shock that was preparing for them . At length the word " fire " rang through the woods  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next moment the balls came crashing through the trees , followed by an explosion that shook the hills , and the battle commenced . The Americans stood firm before that iron storm , watching the shattered boughs that were hurled about their heads , but not a shot replied . Finding that the cannonade prodiiced no impression , the English commander ordered the woods to be cleared with the bayonet . " In perfect order and close array that veteran infantry emerged from the pine trees into the clearing , reddening the whole extent with their scarlet uniforms . Jn double-quick time , with their standards streaming in the wind , and the drums beating their wildest notes , they swept over the open ground , and steadily moved up to the farther margin . All there was still and motionless , though thousands of flashing eyes were on the advancing battalions , and thousands of sinewy hands were clutching convulsively their trusty muskets . At length those steady troops approached the American lines ; when suddenly halting , they poured in one deep volley  --  the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with deafening shouts , they rushed to the charge . A single order echoed along the concealed ranks , and in an instant that silent wood was a mass of flame rolling on the foe . The firmset ranks staegered back before it , like a strong ship sriiitten by a wave , then with a noble effort closed up the huge gaps in their line , and again rushed shouting to the charge . But that same astonishing fire mowed them down , till torn and rent into fragments , they turned and fled . Then like a tiger springing from his covert , the Americans leaped from their concealment , and poured in one wild torrent upon them . Over their dead and dying enemies , across the clearing , up to the very British lines , and over the guns , they go in one black resistless wave . The artillery was captured , and the exulting victors seizing the drag-ropes , attempted to carry it away , but the pieces were too heavy , and the wood too dense . They can not turn them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches . One only is seized , and Colonel Cilley has mountedit , and with his sword administered the oath of allegiance , and thus in triumph is borne over the field . " The British , rallying in the woods , made a desperate charge to recover their guns , and finally drove the brave militia-men back , down the slope to their covert . Bu. $ here again they were met by those destructive volleys-whole companies sunk at once on the field , and the solid formation which is necessary to give terror to the shock of the bayonet , was utterly broken . Falling back , they attempted to re-form in the clearing , but the Americans were upon them with such fury , that they broke , and fled to the protection of their iruns But up to the very muzzles the madcTened patriots rush , and bayonet the gunners at their pieces , and hurl the whol* British line back into the woods . Here Burgoyne again rallied his men , and with levelled bayonets they advanced to the shock . Forced slowly back , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm of round and grape-shot into their ranks , and all over the field are seen wounded men crawling away to the wood . But rallying behind their covert , they present the same wall of fire on which the bravest grenadiers dash in vain . " Thus the battle swayed to and fro across this clearing for three fearful hours . It was one continued thunder-clap and driving mass of flame over its bosom , while the cries and shouts of maddened men added still greater terror to the scene . Now closing in with the bayonet , now retiring before the destructive discharges of grape-s ot and now sweeping with loud huzzas over the captured guns , they fought with an energy and desperation that perfectly astonished their adversaries . The oldest officers declared they had never witnessed such destructive work with smallarms , or such terrible firing from infantry . Before their onset , the firmest troops went down , and again and again did they charge those strong batteries home , and wrench them from the grasp of the enemy . Out of forty-eight men who commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaps amid the wheels of the carriages , while the blood stood in pools over the clearing . In the midst of this carnage the sun went down-his farewell beams just gleamed a moment through the sulphurous cloud that curtained in the field , and then twilight slowly settled over the landscape . Through the deepening gloom , bright flashes were seen as the dark columns still rushed to the encounter ; but at length deep night came on , and the battle ceas&amp;d . Here and there detached parties still maintained the fight , lighting up the forest with their vollies , but the great strugole was over , and night and death remaine Jsol e masters of the field . On that single clearing were piled nearly a thousand men , covering it with a perfect carpet of corpses , and all around was scattered the wreck of the fi*ht . Here lay a trampled plume , there a neglected sword , further on a rent banner , while the Nue frocks of the American militia-men and the scarlet uni 1S474 531 // forms of the British soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour before in hate and rage , now lay across each other in the repose of death , and over the still scowling brow the dews of night slowly gathered . " * * * * " During the interval between the 19th of September and the 7th of October , constant skirmishes took place between detached parties , resulting from the efforts of the Americans to prevent the enemy from foraging . Bur oyne , though taught a sad lesson , by the *ttle that had been fought , of American valor and steadiness , still clung to his first dream , and looked long and wistfully for aid from New York ? and refused to retreat . At length , his provisions becoming nearly exhausted , he resolved to make aiiother desperate effort to cut his way through the American lines , and push on to Albany . SECOND BATTLE OF BEMIS 5 ItEiGIiTS . " To understand the general plan of the battle-field , imagine the American camp pitched on a branch of the Hudson , and extending back about half a mile from the shore . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British camp , similarly situated . A little to the north and west of the British encampment , was a large redoubt occupied by the Hessians , and the one which Arnold entered . Between the two armies were two creeks running nearly parallel to each ether , along which the American pickets were stationed . These presented serious obstacles to the advance of an army , while towards their sources , and to the left of Gates , the approach was easier . It was on this account Bur*royne resolved to make his attack in that A'irection . Accordingly , on the 7th of October , moving his troops in three columns , he advanced to the American left , and taking up his position in an open wheat field , displayed his line . The fierce and rapid roll of drums in the American advance guard , beating to arms , announced their approach , and Gates immediately sent out Morgan with his riflemen to open the battle . Burgoyne , sustained by his best officers , occupied a rising ground , and Morgan took a wide circuit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march straight up the hill against the left , and if possible separate it from the main army . Burgoyne had with him twenty cannon ; and with these , at halfpast two in the afternoon , he opened on the advancing column of Poor . But this gallant officer led his brigade steadily forward up the hill ; and with the orders not to fire till the summit was reached , pressed rapidly on through the storm of grape-shot . With the same coolness he entered the deadly volleys of musketry , then as he gained the brow of the height , opened to the right and left , and poured in a close and rapid fire with terrible effect . Moving resolutely forward upon the dense masses of the grenadiers , the Americans mowed them down with volley after volley , and stood within close musket-shot of the artillery , and let it play upon their ranks . But nothing could long withstand those murderous batteries , and the Americans , excited to madness by the galling , devouring fire , rushed with terrific shouts up to the very mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But met hy those resistless grenadiers , they were rolled sternly back to their position . Again they rallied and charged with such impetuottity , that everything went down in their passage : but that same steady valor reclaimed the victory , and hurled them back to their first position . On one gun they rushed five successive times , and captured it in each onset , and as often were forced to relin9uish their prize , until at length they carried it off in triumph . Major Ackland , who commanded the grenadiers , held them to the shock with a firmness that baffled every effort . Galloping fiercely amid the disordered ranks , he rallied them again and again by his voice and example , until at last he himself was struck to the ground by a ball , when they broke and fled . Morgan , in the mean time , with his deadly riflemen had poured down with resistless strength on the left wing , carrying everything before him . Rallying bravely behind a fence , the shattered troops attempted to stay his progress ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such headlong fury to the attack , they agaiti broke and fled . The whole English line now began to shake , and Burgoyne was just forming a second line with his right wing , when Arnold , maddened with excitement , and stung with rage , burst in a headlong gallop on the field , and plunged into the thickest of the fight . His practised eye soon saw that General Frazer was the chief stjpport of that tumultuous hattle , as on his splendid gray horse he moved amid the chaos , bringing order out of confusion , and courage out of despondency , wherever he passed . Dashing up to Morgan , he told him not to let him see that officer long in the saddle . The latter , selecting a few of his best marksmen , said , pointing to Frazer , " That gallant officer is Genera I Frazer : I admire htm , but it is necessary he should die . Do your duty . " The first shot cut the cropper of his horse , the second pierced the mane , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortally wounded . Arnold had no sooner given this order than he placed himself at the head of three regiments of Lamed 's brigade , and with a shout those who heard it never forgot to their latest day , led them fiercely on . The Hessian troops threw themselves in his path , and for a moment broke his charge . The next moment , with a mere handful of men , he hurst like a falling rock through their midst , and scattered them from his path . Nothing could exceed the terror and fury of his charges : before such onsets the firmest troops in the world must sink , lie *hook terribly the whole British line , and Burgoyne , now thoroughly alarmed , put forth a desperate effort to maintain his ground . But in vain did he expose himself to the hottest of the fire to animate his men - in vain did his bravest officers again and again lead his devoted troops to the attacknothing could stop that astonishing infantry . Their rapid tread shook the field-their dreadful volleys swept away the head of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they closed steadily on the shrinking line . No charge of bayonets could break their firm array , no blaze of the close and deadly batteries check their lofty enthusiasm , as moving amid the horrid carnage , *32 May , // they gathered with brows of wrath closer and closer on their foes . Those shattered veterans labored a moment as if about to hear up in the storm , then swung and rent asunder , and rolled heavily to their camp . Morgan and Dearborn and Ten Broek following up their advantage with the same impetuosity , the whole army took refuge behind the intrenchments . Nothing could now arrest the victorious Americans , as with shouts that were heard above the din of battle , they rushed forward and stormed the camp itself . But behind their intrenchments , and under cover of their heavy guns , which bristled in fearful rows along the ramparts , the British fought with the energy of desperation itself . On the uncovered ranks of the impetuous Americans they opened all their batteries , and hailed a leaden tempest from the small-arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and smoke , added tenfold horror to the fight . They were no longer struggling for victory but or life , and therefore summoned all their enertries to check the progress of the victors . Bht neither formidable intrenchments with the abatis in front , nor the hotly-worked batteries exploding in their faces , nor the close and destructive volleys of musketry , could stay the excited patriots . Through the tremendous fire , and over the ensanguined field , now covered with a sulphurous cloud , amid which incessant lightnings played , and one continuous thunder-peal rolled , they charged up to the very muzzles of the guns . The camp itself was shaken throughout its entire extent , and trembled like a reed in the blast ; while Arnold , enraged at the abatis , which baffled all his efforts in front , called around him a tew brave fellows , and taking a short circuit , made that desperate charge into the sallyport , where he fell . One hour more of daylight , and that camp would have been swept as with a hurricane ; nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steed , and that darkness would have been filled with the flying enemy*and a routed camp ended the day . " S S S S " The British army abandoned their camp during the night , and took post on the hills , and in the morning the American troops marched into it with colors flying and drums beating , and a long shout went up from the abandoned intrenchments . During the day a scattered fire of artillery was kept up , and ever and anon was borne back to the camp the rapid discharge of musketry , as small detachments from either army came in collision . Frazer , who had died early in the morning after the battle , had requested to be buried at sunset in the chief redoubt . The procession was formed , and at six o'clock was seen moving slowly up the hill to the place of interment . General Winslow observed it and not knowing its object or character , o'rdered it to be cannonaded ; and while they were laying the chieftain in his grave , a solitary cannon kept booming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore up the earth in their midst . Throughout the solemn burial-service , the voice of the chaplain was ever and anon interrupted by that solitary peal of thunder , and his priestly robes were covered with dust , which 533 the ball , as it smoked past , threw upon him . " The sun had now gone down , and twilight drew its mantle over the scene . The American officers discovering at length that it was a funeral procession , ceased playing upon it , and in sympathy with the brave who had fallen , fired minute guns till the solemn ceremony was over . It was a burial worthy of the chieftain who had thus fallen on his last battle-field . Amid the thunder of artillery , he was borne from the disastrous fight  --  the enemy 's guns pealed over his grave , and when the mute procession turned away in the gathering shades of evening , their cannon gave his last salute , and the sullen echo , as it rolled over the hills , was his only requiem . Burgoyne , now convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the only alternative left him , and began his retreat , hoping to retrace his steps to Lake George , and from thence to Canada . This he should have done sooner-now it was too late-for the American army , extending itself on every side , baffled all his efforts , and soon well-nigh completed a circle about him . In every direction the roar of cannon told that the avenues of safety were cut off . Even the last desperate effort to abandon all his artillery and baggage , and by a rapid night march reach Lake George , was seen to be useless . Still Ilurgoyne lingered-his proud heart refused to yield to the stern necessity which bound him . What ! that splendid army , on whose success he had staked his reputation , to be surrendered , and all his bright visions sink at once ! The thought was too bitter , and he still clung to hope , and dreamed of escaping by some accident from the perils that only thickened as he advanced . For six days he turned and turned , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devouring element rages nearer-his camp was uncovered , and cannon balls were continually falling into it , while from every height the artillery played upon him , and the sharp crack of the rifle was heard along his lines . He could not enter a house without its becoming in a moment a target for the batteries . Through the hall of council , and through the apartment in which they sat at their scanty dinner , the cannon balls would crash , and it was a constant and steadily increasing storm of iron around him . At length alUhope was abandoned , and a council of war was called to deliberate on the terms of capitulation . Their consultations were interrppmed by the whistling of bullets and roar of artillery , and the very tent in which they sat was pierced by the American marksmen . Pride and ambition at length yielded to inevitable fate , and that splendid army , the relics of ten thousand men , laid down its arms . Forty-two brass cannon , five thousand stand of arms , and all the camp equipage , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vanquished commander with courtesy , dressed in a plain blue frock , while the soldiers , on marching out to pile their arms , found not an Amencaii in the field . The brave fellows were spared the mortification of grounding their arms in the presence of their enemies. ** * Vide Burgoyne , Wa8kinglon and 1zz8 Generals . // Most assuredly the brilliant triumph at Saratoga could not he more vividly and clearly told . From the author 's notice of the scenes and characters which make up his second volume , we have no doubt that it will be even more interesting than the present . And we will add , that we hope the American public , who read Mr. Headley 's writings with so great avidity , will not fail to thank him for turning his fine powers to the scenes of his native land . Our liberty and national prosperity are a very great inheritance , which we ought not to delight ourselves with enjoying while we forget its cost . It should doubtless be gratifying to live in an excellent house . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as safe-to call upon our neighbors to do the same . But it should be with a solemn thankfulness , that we remember the wear of life with which its foundations were laid , the blood with which its stones were cemented , and the skill and toil and labor of scheming , with which its arches and pillars were raised , and the abiding roof stretched over the fair edifice . To him who best succeeds in making these labors appreciated , much is due . The instructed imagination is the great preserver of historic events ; and Mr. Headley , in appealing so powerfully and truthfully to this chief faculty of the mind , for the scenes of our Revolution , has rendered to American History a most important service.
