Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE PEASANT GIRL OF FRASCATI. from The peasant girl of Frascati 1848 Mute is the tambourine , Hushed is the lay ;  --  Hark  --  how the sweet echo Wanders away ! With the wild melody , Far , far it floats , To itself ,  --  softly Repeating the notes ; And her soul  --  after it  --  That too has flown , Off in a sunny dream , Joyous and lone . Lightly the frolic hand Rests from its play , Mute is the tambourine , Silent the lay ! Child of the glowing south , In thy dark eyes , All thine own Italy Eloquent lies ! In the soft changes , That glow o'er thy face , Passion and purity Blended , I trace ! Like the spray-sparkle , That wild waters show , Joyance like thine , only Deep natures know . Strike thou the tambourine ! Rewake the lay ! Weave the wild dance again , Gracefully gay ! Toss the bright ribands , That float o'er thy hair ! Dark as the Arno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm brow , Its raven braids gleam ;  --  Glad Contadina , Awake from thy dream ! Call back thy soul , From thy lover afar ;  --  Rightly he named thee , Frascati 's proud star ! Clash the light tambourine ! Wake the wild lay ! In thy hand 's tuneful touch , Let thy soul play ! Chant Roma 's glory , And Tusculum 's pride , How the star of her story , Her Cicero died ! Lo !  --  the campagna , Where haughty and bold , Crowned like a god , Came the hero of old ! Lo  --  the dim ruins Of statues and fanes , Where but the shadow Of genius remains . Nay  --  for thy tambourine , Love be the lay ,  --  Child of the sunshine , Joy to thy way !
