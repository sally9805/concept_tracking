Taylor , Bayard , 1825-1878 : TO YOUNG SPIRITS . from To young spirits ( 1847 ) Brethren in thought and years ! Ye on whose brows the morning splendors gleam  --  Who look on skies undimmed by cloudy fears , And changed by sunrise to a golden dream ; Or ye whose lips , in childhood 's tender day , The cup of suffering and of wo have known , Pause for a moment on your hurrying way ! List to a kindred tone ! Come ! ye are young and strong ; Give then your strength to Freedom and to Truth , Till the great throne of many-visaged Wrong Trembles beneath the ardent fire of Youth  --  Till his large empire , like a mountain old , Quakes with the heavings of the flame below , And , sundered , crashing from its long-kept hold , Falls with one mighty throe ! Oh ! ' t is a glorious strife ! Life-long and toilsome must the combat be , But for the fallen , there is nobler life , And for the victors , immortality ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the world might name renown Shall from the glory of his lofty place On kings and thrones look down ! There 's many a toil to bear  --  Scoffing and scorn from many a meaner soul , Heart-sickening struggles with the phantom Care , And oft despair to reach the far-off goal . Ye must in silence and in patience wait For the glad ripening of the tardy seed , While Avarice , ' midst his golden piles elate , Reviles the noble deed ! Yet bravely bear it all , So long as Vice , with bloody chariot-wheel , Drives o'er the groaning world she keeps in thrall , And man forgets that fellow-man can feel ! The wronged and suffering , from their darkened sphere , Will aid you with their eloquence of prayer , And hearts , whose wishes reach th ' Almighty 's ear , Will ask your blessing there ! Not with a warrior tread Be your proud marching , o'er the waking world  --  Not over plains of dying and of dead , Where the swift death on flaming bolts is hurled ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lights the dark bosom with a sudden glow ; Bid the crushed spirit from its bonds aspire  --  Teach it , itself to know ! Touch with a trusting hand The chords of feeling in the deadened heart , And by the lonely and the wretched stand , Drying their bitter tear-drops as they start . Oh ! by that God whose breath inspires the soul , That work of mercy will not be in vain , But every kindness to the suffering , roll In blessing , back again ! Brothers , let us arouse ! Shall we be bound in earth 's benumbing thrall ? Is there not freedom written on our brows ?  --  Then let us keep it , or in losing , fall ! Say , what is Freedom , but the power to be Unled by Error from the soul 's pure light , And but to God and Truth to bow the knee In Hope , forever bright ? Feel we not , deep within , A spirit mighty , deathless and sublime ; Whose high , pure nature , bids us scorn all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there not longings for a loftier crown Than e'er was wreathed from Fame 's unfading bough , Which , with its blaze of ever-fresh renown , Shall gild the faithful brow ? Come , then , ere morn be gone ! Ere the pure blossoms of the spirit fade  --  Ere in the wildering crowd , as life rolls on , The heart from all its better hopes hath strayed ! Shake from the soul each sin-alluring snare That turns to earthly flame its heaven-born fires , And men , the glorious path with you to share , Will leave their low desires !
