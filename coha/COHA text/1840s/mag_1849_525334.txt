txt WE flOW see what the government was at first , when the few and evil days of " the confederacy " were at length succeeded by a real union between the thirteen primary States . And first , it was a true government , as well in the general as the particular economies , and no longer a confederacy of States in the former , more than of counties in the latter . Ahove and below , at Washington and throughout the territorial departments , it made laws for the people as individuals , and gave effect to its laws , not by negotiation or entreaty , much less by military force , but by court process . Secondly , it was a pure agency government , a republic ; with a guaranty in the federal charter that it should continue such . A part of the sovereignty was delegated for purposes of direct administration , and the residue lodged with a very large , but not promiscuous body of the citizens , at once to maintain the personal organization of the system , and to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses made of its powers in the management of its affairs ; the two sovereignties , ( if I may call them so , ) being both alike functionary under the Constitution , though in provinces of duty quite distinct from each other , and separated by a wall of partition never to be passed , the one way or the other , for any purpose of reciprocal interference . In the third place , it was a government homogeneously framed in the relative constitutions of the head and the members ; its agents everywhere acting for and representing the people , and nowhere , corporations of the people . Nor was there any known disparity of endowment among the several agency groups of the system in the matter of power , save what arose necessarily , or at least naturally , out of its scheme of divided jurisdictions . The power of the State governments was ample for what concerned their local line of business . The common law stood sponsor for this . The government of the Union , designed as it was for a sphere of action limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inter-state relations ( so to call them ) of its interior subdivisions , had no authority but by special grants looking mainly to that sphere . Still , within the prescribed limits , federal functionaries had the same common law to adjust the measure of their powers , that State officers had in their departments for the like important service . Nor was there to be a particle of difference in the rule of construction applicable to the two cases . Finally , it was a government distributed , balanced , checked , guarded , and accominodated to the actual state of society , in a very remarkable manner . On the one hand , its founders were afraid of public power . They knew the views of that kind of power . They knew it had been the great oppressor of mankind in all ages , and they had nothing more at heart than to secure themselves and their posterity from its grasping , overreaching , perverting tendencies . On the other hand , they meant it to be decently accommodated to social facts . Exact equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callings , and conditions of men ; but an effort of approach towards it was both jQst and prudent ; it was practising , in the construction of the system , the very principle that was to form the characteristic merit of its subsequent operation . As to power , the first thing done was that of cutting it up into jurisdictional parts . The making , interpreting , and executive oversight of the law , were assigned to different agencies , with strong lines of demarcation between them . This was the functionary division . Sept. // A territorial division was added , by which the details of government business were scattered over the country among thousands of political corporations . The lowest grade of these , were townships and villages . Over the townships there were counties , for concerns of corresponding extent . Over the counties , there were States ; and over the States , a Union . The townships had some powers each that were ultimate , and consequently sovereign . So had the counties . But for the most part , appeals lay upward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powers of the States were nearly all sovereign . Like those of the smaller districts , however , they looked only to internal and domestic matters ; having no hearing that was properly national , nationality belonged to the Union alone . This scheme of jurisdictions adjusted , the policy of the lawgivers descended next to the minuter features of the system . And they began , here , with limiting rigidly the order or description of persons from among whom the more considerable agents of the gov*'nment were to be selected . The door of office might , they apprehended , be opened too wide for the general safety . It was necessary , therefore , to be cautious . Precise rules of elio'ibility must he fixed upon , to guard against mistakes . " Is he honest , is he capable , " was the great practical inquiry for the electors in all cases ; hut to bring them to just or prudent conclusions on the subject , marks of probable honesty , probable capability were wanted , that might afford invariably some reasonable chance of safe judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of residence , some property , and a religious profession , perhaps the most reliable circumstances that could be hit upon as practical indications in the matter , were made conditions of access to public life in its more eminent stations . Outward , sensible tokens were necessary , and these answered that description . Clear certainty was out of reach ; probability was all that could be hoped for ; and it was thought that if the people were required to choose for the public service persons of from twenty-one to thirty-five years of age , who should have lived from one to ten years under their eyes without reproach , should have acquired considerable estates , the usual fruit of industry , good habits , and good principles , and should have maintained , or have been ready to profess , the character of Christians , the choice would be as likely to result well , as in human circumspection it could be made to do . These , at any rate , were fair grounds of popular judgment , and they were made indispensable conditions in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were t4*e interests involved , that other precautions were resorted to . If all the people were to be constituted electors , nothing could well save the majority from mischances in the use of their power . It was therefore deemed expedient to put conditions on the right of suffrage itself , and so to restrain the possession of it to the stauncher portion of society ; making not only years of manhood , and a short local commorancy , but even a pittance of property ( in general a freehold ) necessary qualifications for the function of the polls . By which arrangement the number of allowed electors , compared with the entire popular mass of both sexes , must have been limited to a sixth or seventh , more probably a tenth , of the whole . A striking fact in several bearings . How it illustrates the doctrine of representation , as depending on dut'y , not constituency . Were the men of straw unrepresented in those days ? Are women and children unrepresented now ? How it exhibits the franchise of elections as a thing of trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims or pretensions of special interest in those honored with the use of it ! Away with the preposterous folly of scrambling or contending as individuals for a right which at the best is but fiduciary , and no object of selfish demand to any one ! How it shows off the slow and . though*ful and painstaking husbandry of the patriarchal statesmen , as contrasted with our modern steamploughing ! There are things which it is more important to do well than quickly . Thus then , to reach the great objects of a safe personal organization of the Government , the population of the country was to be doubly sifted : first , for a class of persons fit to stand before the people as candidates for election ; and next , for a community of voters , who might be expected to act independently , conscien // tiously , wisely , in putting forward the best of those candidates to serve the commonwealth . No doubt the fathers ( the greater part of them ) thought it desirable to keep their men somewhat longer in office than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might render this admissible . The fathers meant to have a decent tone of government  --  a decent consistency and vigor of administrative policy . In crder to which if public sentiment required that some officers ( the larger houses of legislation for example ) should die out annually , others ( such as chief magistrates and senators ) must have a longer lease of life  --  a lease that might bring them acquainted with two or three generations of their more transient brethren , so that some sort of connection might be kept up between the past and present , and the notable principle of rotation in office might not have a speed and sweep of action that should put everything in a whirl . Change , doubt it who will , is the besetting curse of free institutions . This desperate evil was to be put , if possible , under some restraint . The tossing floods were to have shores to beat upon . Accordingly , while members of assembly in the State legislatures were allowed to hold an incessant correspondence with the popular mind by annual elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had terms of from two to five or six years assigned them . Federal agents were similarly dealt with ; the President holding for four years , and the upper house of Congress for six , while members of the representative chamber were restricted to two . In which respect , as in most others , the whole system of the country was symmetrical , and the policy of its arrangements uniform . Can a question be raised as to the advantage of all this ? Who will confess a doubt , for instance , whether the executive administraf on of a State is likely to be better managed , or , at least , with more consistency and dignity , for a dozen years together , by three successive chief magistrates than by twelve , even admitting the men to be all of a stamp ? And then is this admission likely to be true in matters of fact ? Is it likely that an official term of one year will attract the same rate of talents and qualities into public life as a term of three or four ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtail the term unduly , and you belittle the office . Incumbents may be found undoubtedlythere are placemen of all calibres ; but to think of getting petty offices filled by men fit for the greatest is idle , unless indeed you are prepared to buy their condescension with enormous salaries . It is pleasant to trace the old harmonies of the republic as between the head and the members . There are breaks in some of those harmonies now , but the recollection of what they once were is music to a patriotic ear . Take , as a further specimen , the great principles of a completely independent judiciary , once common to the federal and State economies , and sustained alike in each by what is called the good-behavior tenure . It was a glorious sight to look at , when the dispensers of human justice went forth erect in their full stature , unswayed by government , unindebted to political parties , judging the cause of the fatherless and widow , as well as of principalities and powers , without respect of persons , and only liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their deeds . The Union and the States had also , in fair proportion with each other , the patronage of many appointments , and were aggrandized by it exceedingly in the public eye . Not only the States and the Union as bodies politic , but the people at large were the better for this . Appointments were better made for many purposes by government officers than it was possible they should be in the way of popular elections . Indeed the agreement between the larger and smaller economies was general . Both were concise in the written expressions of their plans and principles . Both , with a few local exceptions , rejected bills of righis as useless , perhaps hurtful substitutes , of form for spirituality Both preferred to rest upon the people 's common law  --  the unwritten code of usage and common sense-as the true basis of men's rights , the rock of their liberties . To both , religion was a first element of life . It was deemed a main support of all civil and political obligations ; a guar *o49 // speakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect , but religion in its general substance-the religion of the gospel . The fathers wished to tie the hearts of the people to their institutions , and they imbued these with the religion which the people then loved . Religious babels were not wanted . Religious feudal systems , with alien lords paramount , did not suit a polity which claimed the citizen 's whole allegiance for his own government . This government was not made strong enough to do without the people 's affections , much less to abide the distracting competition of foreign claims upon them . Foreign allegiance , therefore , of whatever type , was expected to be abjured , and the rules of our own national piety and patriotism undividedly embraced . In one respect undoubtedly the close and sympathetic relations of the Union government with that of the particular States brought the former into a kind of independence that might subject it to possible mischief , though a mischief in which the States must also participate . I allude to the provision of the federal Constitution , by which the State electorships for members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress . In which respect the character of one branch of the national legislature was left in some measure at the future mercy of the States ; so that a change made at Albany or Hiarrisburg in the vesting of the electoral franchise must affect the whole country . A matter of grave consequence certainly . 14 ; were well if our thirty faculties of constitutional dissectors would bethink themselves that the nerves they handle with such surgeonlike freedom extend to Washington . On the other hand , there are points in which it was left possible for a State to alter its economy , and take all the fruits to itself . By which means the equilibrium of the system might be sadly interfered with , and its working impaired . Suppose , for instance , that a State should so change its Constitution as to degrade one of the jurisdictional branches of its government , and sympathetically the others too , by depriving the judges of that jewel of modern policy , time independent tenure . The evil , if such it were , would fall directly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up its head in undiminished honor , character , and influence ; and the comparative result would be , a loss to one of the nwinbers of the political body , and a corresponding gain to the head . Or , suppose a State to put itself under a sort of process of depletion , by reducing its terms of office from three years to one in the case of its chief magistrate , and from four to two in that of its senators . Does any man question that the effect must be , upon the whole , to let down the tone of the particular government , and take somewhat from its relative weight of character ? Does any man fail to see , that this must needs redound to a proportional exaltation of the central government ? Or , finally , suppose a State government to have its mantle of patronage stripped off , and all appointments made over to the disposal of the popular electors . What follows ? Does not the shame of that government 's nakedness appear ? Tell me not that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people never varies . The people are out of sight and unthought of . The immediate organs of power fill the eye for the time : Degrade these , and you degrade the State in their persons , the people 's majesty notwithstanding . We must take things practically , by the world 's measure . Rank and influence result from actual circumstances , not from philosophical musings of what ought to be . A government without patronage may be a noble ship ; but it is a ship under bare poles , that makes not half the impression on us in that plight of destitution as when all her glorious canvass swells in the breeze . One thing , however , may be stated with confidence ; the fathers left the State in high relatice condition ; free , indeed , to fall by their own acts , but not exposed to any known power of injurious depression at the hands of the federal government . How could that government hurt them if it would ? and what temptation *rns it under , to desire to hurt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedency over them in national affairs . The general fear of considerate men was , that the States would prove too great for // entertained this fear , and so did Hamilton , and many others . Indeed , supposing the States true to themselves , I do not see how it was possible for the central government to work its way to a disproportionate and dangerous pre-eminence , save by one or both of two expedients ; that is to say , by the adoption of a war policy , or a policy of territorial acquisition ; neither of which , in my humble judgment , was compatible with the fundamental laws . Let us think of it a moment . As to war , the most aggrandizing and fearful of all the expedients of ambition when successful , and which , if it could be entered upon at pleasure by the federal government , might truly make that government everything , and the States nothing , the original policy of our institutions was clear and unequivocal against it . lATe were , for example , to have no considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axiom . We were to depend in ordinary , for our military operations , on the citizen militia ; another primitive axiom , or rather , another form of the same . And then the specified conditions on which alone , according to the federal charter itself , the militia might be called into service , shut out altogether the notion of an aggressive foreign war . Citizens can not be sent abroad against their will , though it were to fight the country 's battles . More than all , a war of aggression is one which , as a Christian people ( constitutionally such in profession ) we may not , can not urge . But how as to the national domain ? Was that to be enlarged indefinitely ? If it was , adieu to all safe proportion between the head and members of the Republic . I affirm , however , that by the unadulterated rule of the fathers the thing was impossible . They certainly would not have been apprehensive of the growing consequence of the State governments , as likely to disturb the general balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union capable of widening its foundations at pleasure , and thus availing itself of resources of wealth , influence and domination , to which no bounds could beset . Let us see . If foreign territories were to be acquired at all , it could only be by conquest , by legislation , or by treat y-pur chase . No other means could be conceived of as within the granted powers of the government . Could it be done by conquest ? Citizen soldiers would hardly have been preferred to enlisted troops with such views . Nor were such views consistent with the religion , the morals , the laws , of the country in its first and purest age . The notion of an habitually grasping policy was as foreign to our institutions then , as that of highway robbery was to the economy of private life under them . Indeed , the very savages of our forests were safe from the injustice of such a policy . Instead of invading the Indian settlements for purposes of prey , the fathers carried nothing but the arts of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking away the lands of the poor red man , the fathers protected his title to them , and did all they could to make his occupancy safe , useful , agreeable , permanent . The government had a right of eminent domain over many of the indian territories , but this right was held in scrupulous deference to the right of the actual possessors to enjoy them as long as they pleased , and who were never , on any account , to he disturbed or disquieted  --  a pleasing evidence of the unambitious , self-denying charactbr of our early policy , as to what so many modern politicians think it impossible to get enough of now . The days of aggression and of conquest had not yet dawned . As to legislation , it is a milder expedient , but inapplicable to the purpose . Legislation is the exercise of an essentially internal power , and of coui-se the fathers could not expect it to go abroad Most true , there was an acknowledged form of that power for admitting new Slates into the Union . This , h*vever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change of the axiom that legislation can not , in the nature of things , make its voice heard beyond the actual borders of the country . The jurisdiction of Congress was still rigidly confined to its domestic province . The common law , as well as common reason , settled this point ; so that the power of admitting new States extended not an inch beyond the national domain as it then was . Existing materials might be worked up ; new // States might be formed upon soil already ours ; and Congress might then receive them into the larger organization of the federal system . But here legislation must stop . There was no warrant , no competency for carrying its enterprises further . Foreign lands , that is , lands to which the jurisdiction of Congress did not as yet extend , could not possibly be reached by any action of that body . Fundamental principles forbade it . No human jurisdiction is unlimited ; no human jurisdiction can take effect by its own vigor where it is not . But lastly , the treaty-making powermight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon occasion of very strong ap-petite ? I apprehend this too is impossible upon legal principles . Such a power is indeed given , arid in broad terms ; nor will I pretend to say what might he done with it by a government differently constituted from ours , and with different views of necessary policy in the matter of colonial institutions ; but formed and principled as we are , there is an embarrassment upon our hands which must I think be fatal , so far as law and theory are concerned , to any rightful extension of the national domain by treaty purchase . For I assume that such extension , if it were possible , can only be to the dii-ect intent of a corresponding enlargement of the federal system , to take effect sooner or later , according to circumstances , by the introduction of new States into that system . We have no colonial dependencies , and no law or policy for any . Perhaps the argument would net be much less cogent if we had . But the fact that we have not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a territorial acquisition with such views , is necessarily to touch the Constitution of the country in the relation of the head and members of the system to each other  --  a very tender , nay , a vital point . Is the thing doubtful ? examine it . The relation of comparative extent itself , as between a State and the Union , is something . But other relations , more important far , grow out of that . Comparative resources , comparative jurisdiction , comparative dignity , influence , power . Great landholders are very different personages from little ones ; and a VOL . IV . NO . III . NEW SERIES . government with a long radius for its sceptre , differs in like manner from one of comparatively small jurisdictional limits . Besides , in proportion as you multiply particular States , you reduce the weight of each in the federal councils . Massachusetts , for instance , was formerly as one to thirteen in the Senate of the Union ; a proportion liable to be reduced by fair means ( that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio , we will suppose , of one to twenty-one or two . But imagine the government at Washington to throw its arms abroad and take in ten or twenty States from the outer world , beyond the original bearing of the national compact , a terra incognita to the constitutional fathers ; what would Massachusetts be then in the senatorial huddle of the republic ? The little State of Delaware was something once , with her single representative and two senators in Congress ; but what will Delaware be when all the territories acquired from France , Spain , Mexico , shall have been worked up into States ? Depend upon it , such changes touch the Constitution in a nerve which , quiet as it may be now , will vibrate by and by . It can not be otherwise . In mercantile affairs the introdu*tion of a new partner into a firm dissolves the firm that was , and creates another in law . That is often done by common consent-not otherwise . But here is a case where a thi*i-d party claims to bring in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be done ? I answer , no . And for this plain reason , that it requires , not simply a treaty-making , but a constitution-making power to effect it ; and to such a power the president and senate have no pretension . The truth is , the treaty-making power being vested in the Presid'ent and Senate by general words of delegation , takes its range and bearing from the common law . It can therefore do no more , assuredly , than nations have been accustomed to do with it , time immemorial . This is putting the case in the most liberal light that can be ; for the peculiarity of our forms and polity is now put out of view . What then does national usage and custom teach us that this power is equal to ? At the very utmost , to a purchase of colonial dependencies . Such dependencies have been 19 283 // often secured by treaty . But as to purchasing states , whether fully grown or in embryo , by way of organic enlargement of an empire , there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no solitary example for it since the world began . So that the common law can afford no countenance to such a practice . Since , therefore , the President and Senate are without any expressly granted authority for altering the constitutional relations of the State Governments with that of the Union , and since the want of such express authority is not and can not be made up to them by construction of law , it follows , that no right of acquiring foreign territories by treaty , in order to turning them at length into constituent portions of the federal system , exists under the compact by which that system was formed . It is a system depending , beyond all parallel , on nice adjustments , as well between the States and the Union as elsewhere ; and the fathers never thought of introducing into it a principle of sure progressive derangement , which , however its operation might be borne with for a time , must tend infallibly to confusion and ultimate ruin . Let it not be fancied , that because the President and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as assenting to all the treaties that are made . The people are represented no further tItan the power exercised is legitimate . They assent of course by implication to treaties lawfully made , that is within the just range of the treaty-making power . But my position is , that to purchase new States from abroad , such either in fact or contemplation , is beyoud the scope of the power , and so without legal authority . It is an act of constituent , not ad , ainislrative sovereignty ; of usurpation , consequently , on the rights of the people , and not of duty in their service . * * NOTE BY THE Enrroa. - As the series of articles , of which the above is a member , requires to be published without change , to stand or fall by its own merits ; and as the usual editorial policy of admitting nothing inconsistent with an adopted course , can not in this case be adhered to , we can here only enter a personal objection to the opinion of the learned and able writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , erected upon ceded or purchased territory . Florida , Oregon , Texas , Louisiana , California , New Mexico , are as much *a part of us , as if they had originally belonged Neither let it be imagined that I overrate the probable consequences of an indefinite extension of federal territory , as regards the equipoise of our system . The States to the thirteen States ; and the erection of new States upon them is a matter of necessity . Nor do we think it can be said , in strictness , that we have HO colonial system ; our territorial is , perhaps , the best colonial system ever erected . Nor does the comparison of a " firm " seem to hold good in regard to the admission of new States . The importance of individual States may be lessened , but is the importance of the Union lessened , or the system weakened as a whole ? It seems to us that it is not . The spirit of a system is not necessarily changed by the enlargement of the body which it governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not of other territory ? The common law takes its rise from the application of reason and necessity to the immediate circumstances ; it does not control or limit the growth of States , but only produces a just order in affairs as they proceed . The English constitution and the common law do not jar , yet the empire of England has been enlarged in every way . If the doctrine be admitted , that bad treaties are not binding on the people because they are bad , we should have no government left . The President and Senate are plenipotentiaries under the Constitution , and will sometimes make bad treaties ; but we , the people , can only make the best of it ; we have elected our officers , and must suffer by them . The treatymaking power is in fact in the Senate ; the Senate represents States , " the partners in the firm ; " if the partners chose to admit new members , f*rmed out of colonies of citiEens , we can not help it . A company is dissolved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that the law may maintain its ascendency , starting from the new record to control the new circumstances , and not because the principle of a partnership is changed by the addition of a new member . In the case of the admission of a State , the record is effectually made , and the laws go on as before . Such , we are obliged to say , are our objections to the learned author 's argument . We have always advtcated , and shall always advocate , the regular admission of new States , and have no fears for any deterioration of the general system , though it seems to us that our author has established the conclusion that the individual States are weakened by the enlargement of the body of the Union . Our Southern citiEens , who have been so eager for the admission of new States , will perhaps profit by the hint . The importance of South Carolina dwindles a little with every new addition to the confederacy , while the power of the entire system , and the sway of national majorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would have opposed the acquisition of territory . 284 Sept. // are a great feature of that system , a momentous feature . And their importance in it depends upon their relative magnitude and weight of influence as compared with the head government . It is this that makes them such a capital check upon that government , according to the recorded opinions of the early patriots . And would it be nothing to these vast subdivisions of the commonwealth to find themselves reduced suddenly , or by unmarked degrees , to the dimensions of mere counties in the general scale ? - lost sight of , one by one , like individuals in a mob ? True , indeed , the nation as a whole is our own , and we are apt to be fond partakers of its glory whencesoever derived ; applauding when its armies conquer , and making every expansion of its sway a matter of personal triumph . All which , however , is but a commentary on the views I have urged ; a living annotation upon the text of our danger . It shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile of political supremacy ; exalting the head , not only to the disparagement , but often , generally perhaps , with the blind concurrence of the members . Let us not deceive ourselves . The fathers had no part in this infatuation of the popular mind . They saw that it was necessary for the members to maintain their relative standing , and there is nothing truer or more vital in our case . Extension of territory is increase of power in the head government . How can it fail to be so ? Money is said to be power . Double the national domain , and , other things being equal , you double the pecuniary means of the federal administration . Business is power . By enlarging the jurisdiction of office , you multiply subjects and occasions of official action . Patronage is power ; and what a swarm of appointments must inevitably gather upon every new hive of the national apiary . Fame , worship , is power , and we are witnesses against ourselves , that men are prone to honor worldly greatness and prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice , points of prudence , points of law itself , connected with the ma0nificence of a nation 's exploits . Of the original adaptation of the government to the actual state of things in the country , much need not be said . Our elements were very simple . Peculiarities indeed there were , that claimed attention and accommodation , and received it . I will mention two or three . One of importance was , the diversity of condition among men in the matter of property ; as to which , there was a triple alternative at the option of the lawgivers . They could give official eligibility , and the right of choice among candidates for public stations , to the wealthy alone , a small part of the community ; to the whole popular mass , the majority of whom had nothing to bind them to the country , or to attest their personal fitness for meddling in its affairs ; or to a middle class or classes of society , greatly more numerous than the former , greatly less so than the latter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once for rich and poor , tempering matters impartially between them . The option was easily determined , and determined as it ought to be . A low property qualification was annexed to the right of suffrage , and a somewhat higher one to that of being admitted to the trusts at its disposal . The prevailing religion of the country may be given as another instance . There were various sects of Protestant Christians . Their differences were for the most part formal . It would not do to set up one above the rest , and yet as Christians they must not be overlooked , for their religious sentiments and interests were very dear to them . The patriarchs went therefore for the substance of things , and let forms alone . To atheism , too rare to have any claims , and too detestable for gratuitous favor , they gave no countenance whatever ; and they looked with stern dislike upon ecclesiastical cone ections , under whatever guise of Christian seeming , that drew off the allegiance and the love of the people from their own land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was deemed *ssential to high and pure citizenship ; and this became the religion of the government and of the laws . There was in the country a settled popular aversion to privileged orders . We had felt the weight of such burdens , and it was impossible we should submit our backs to them again . Instead of that , 285 // the universal demand was , absolute equality of legal rights . The principle had grown to a passion among us , and would not be put off with evasions ; it must be gratified with direct concessions ; it must be explicitly provided for . Seeing this , and feeling it too , the fathers readily conformed . And thus a third social element was taken into the account of the government . Shall I refer to African shivery , as yet a further fact in the existing state of things , that could not be overlooked , and could not be- prevented from blemishing the arrangements of the time with a provision concerning it . Here , however , that which was done was done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the concoction of the federal scheme . It is said in certain quarters , that the federal Constitution sanctions slavery and protects it . The language is too broad . The constitutions of the slave states themselves go not so far . Not one of them protects slavery by any positive means , not one of them sanctions it , further than by the odious prohibition of legislative emancipation that disgraces some of them . As to the federal charter , the only clause that gives color to the pretense in question , is the last paragraph of the second section , article fourth , which provides , " that no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof , and escaping into another , shall in co*nsequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up , on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " In fewer words , no person held to service by the law of one state , shall have his obligation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have rim away from his master . Of slaves , or slave law , as such , not a syllable is said . No protection certainly , and no sanction , in terms . Nor is there any by implication , unless the bar against officious meddling in cases of elopement can be tortured into such a meaning , which is quite beyond the power of fair criticism . The truth lies upon the surface . The existence of involuntary servitude in some of the states , was a social and civil fact in the condition of those states when the convention of 87 were at work upon their great task . The law or custom of that servitude was strictly local . There were other states near by , into which its victims might easily escape , where the pure common law made slavery impossible . Thus circumstanced , the people of the slave localities , in giving up to the new central government their right of control over their relations and intercourse with the neighboring- states , demanded a guaranty against the snapping interposition of the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves . And they were strenuous in this . There was indeed no getting on with the great project of the time , perhaps no guarding against frequent breaches of the peace , without some pacifying arrangement on the subject . The required guaranty was accordingly given . And it was a guaranty of a purely negative character ; not an act of favor or approval in any form , but of simple non-interfereni*e or standing aloof . If a state had a law to hang men , as they used to do in England , for horse-theft , would it be a sanction of the severity of that law should a sister state , for peace ' sake , and to avoid continual broils , deny herself the right of harboring fugitives from its penalty ? Slavery indeed is against the general law of the country . Out of the place of the local custom or statute , where its chains are , it can not exist ; there is no place for it , no air for it to breathe . Mr. Benton is right ; it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is not . A statute of Congress , that should purport to legalize it in a free territory , , would be void by natural law , by God 's law , and might be so declared judicially without dafiger of mistake . Even English authorities may be cited for the position that an act of highest legislation , if against natural right is null . Holt and Hobart , both of them great names ( the former , one of the very greatest ) in English judicature , held this opinion. * Think of this , in reference to a polity that makes the legislature omnipotent . It were strange indeed if American morals were less legal . * Wood . Lect. p. 62 . Hob . R. 8*1. 12 Mod. 6 , *8. 286 *e ; . // less fundamental , than English , on such a point . But after all , what had the paternal lawgivers to do with any point of that kind ? Could they not abstain from meddling with runaway slaves without becoming abettors of slavery ? Were they not free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear by itself if it would ? How could their forbearance draw upon them the reproach of puddling the waters of the land , especially when it was plainly impossible to obstruct those waters but at the hazard of a desolating overflow ? Such then was the government in its origin ; a government which few travellers have adequately understood , and which the most eminent foreign writers have spoken of with surprising inaccuracy . Little wonder , perhaps , when it is considered that blunders greater still have found perpetrators among ourselves . Yet the founders of the system knew thoroughly what they were about . And they left their work , as I conceive , in a very intelligible shape , with strong characteristic marks upon every part of it . Such too as they left it , they intended and expected it to continue . The general absence from it of all machinery of c/ian ge , shows this . In which respect , however , their views have been disappointed . Changes not a few , and not inconsiderable , have been made already in their system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change , a principle that allows it no rest ; I will add , no prospect of rest , till either a political heaven , or at worst , a grave is found . Of the thirteen primary States , New Hampshire has wholly remodelled her constitution twice since the first organizing act ; Connecticut and Rhode Island , once each ; New York , twice ; New Jersey , once ; Pennsylvania , twice ; Delaware , once ; Virginia , once ; South Carolina , once ; and Georgia , twice . Fourteen thorough renovations in ten States . Besides which there have been partial changes , called amendments , in Massachusetts , Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , at successive periods , and with very material effects . The federal compact itself has been repeatedly amended , ( always I think for the worse , ) though never put entirely into the furnace of a second national convention . Meanwhile seventeen new states have been ushered into the Union ; some from the original domain of the country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a full-grown foreign commonwealth , lugged in bodily , by legislative sleight of hand , a mysterious method of " annexation . " In numbers of these states of increase , ( Kentucky , Tennessee , Louisiana , Mississippi , and I know not how many more , ) the renewing process , in one or both of its forms , has been plied with due activity , and is going bravely on from year to year , a la mode . Not only so , but in several of the constitutions lately formed , provision is made for calling conventions , at stated intervals , ( if agreeable to the electors for the time being , ) to brood anew and periodically over the life elements of the republic . By the last constitution of New York , the people are to be invited to this pastime every twentieth year ; by that of Indiana , every twelfth year ; by that of New Hampshire , every seventh . In other states , things have not yet come to this pass , but in all there are methods duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in all there is an incessant hammering at the fundamental laws . So that besides an immensity. of work already doiie in this field of human adventure , preparations are matured for going vigorously forward with the business in time to come . Mutation has become indeed the order of the &amp;iy . It is our policy , our rule . Not content with going ahead personally , we have infused the go-ahead principle ( do not smile , it is a portentous trul9h , ) into the very foundations of the republic . But the changes actually made in our polity , what are they ? Let us ponder them a little , that we may the better judge of the direction or our course , and what we are coming to . Beginning with the State economies , I am afraid it will appear that nearly the whole line of conservative arrangements , so conspicuous in the first platform , has been erased . Take the important instance of the property qualification , once indispensable to candidates for the upper stations of public life , but which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out against as aristocratic and injurious . New 287 // Hampshire , Rhode Island , Connecticut , Delaware , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia-eight of the original thirteen States-maintain , it is true , a more or less relaxed adherence to the platform doctrine ; but in the other five of those thirteen , and in all the States since added to the Union , that doctrine is quite obsolete . Twenty-two out of thirty , near three to one , have opened the temple of government to all comers ; no one is excluded whom the people can be cajoled to let in . Religion too has been dropped from its connection with the subject , save in North Carolina and Mississippi . And the result is , that , excepting a reduced standard of age and residence , ( circumstances of mere time and place , ) every man , so far as constitutional law is concerned , is now fit for every office . Here then is a great change . A check upon the franchise of elections has been taken away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of objects . Were all voters virtuous , intelligent , discreet ; could they be all expected to use their power cautiously , and for the best , there might be little danger , and some positive advantage in this extended liberty of choice . But who will found an argument on such a postulate ? The two general indications of respectability that are entitled to perhaps most weight in forming a hasty opinion of a candidate are property and a fair profession of Christian belief . Such evidences ought not to be slighted . But they are out of date . Our confidence in the people now-a-days does not allow us to question their ability to decide on men 's characters by instinct . Religion and property are therefore of no account . And the most hopeful candidate for office , ( I need not stop to acknowledge the occasional exception of a great or good man , paradventure both , advanced to public life for his merit 's sake alone , ) is the one who has least to lose by electioneering baseness ; with nothing at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embarrass his proceedings . Men who want office to live upon become demagogues from a kind of necessity ; and when their acts succeed , they carry the profligacy of the hustings into office with them . It is now a habit . Having begun with poisoning the people , they poison the government in due course , and thus requite the favor unworthily gained from their constituents with substantial injury . As might be expected ( because in keeping with this utter abandonment of the original terms of official eligibility ) we have made a further sacrifice of principle to the democracy of members by a greatly widened distribItion of the right of suffrage . Nearly all the States are here of one mind . Connecticut , Rhode Island , Virginia , and the Carolinas-five of the first thirteen-make still a feeble effort to hold on upon the property qualification of the electorships ; and some few others talk fondly about taxpaying , as if working on the highways , which every renegade must do , could fit men , or denote their fitness , for a sacred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , the electoral character of the country goes now upon all fours ; and , beyond the five States just mentioned , every man is a voter-every biped who can call himself a son of Adam* and who , being one-and-twenty years old , has the merit ( to some a rare and strange one ) of having resided " one whole year " continuously under a particular State government , and from ten days to six months ( there is a tasteful variety here ) within the county where he claims his privilege , is a competent chooser of governors , senators , and members of assembly ; the legal presumption from these premises being , as it seems , not only that he is a person of integrity and patriotic sentiments , but a judge of what assemblymen and senators , and governors ought to be , as well in understanding as in politics and morals . In all which , say of it whatever eJse you will , we have departed utterly from the paternal paths - deserted utterly the paternal policy . Putting then together the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public officers are to be chosen , and the subject of the class or kind of persons to be entrusted with the selection of them , the change our polity has undergone in the conservative principles upon which its organization was formerly kept up , its working taken care of , its agencies visited , its powers watched , regulated , disarmed of mischievous tendencies , made 288 Sept. // effectual to the general welfare , amounts to revolution . Everything is alteredturned topsyturvy . And it is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that this alteration is , in spirit , from republicanism towards democracy ; that is to say , from the best of free governments towards the worst-cutting away the checks and braces of the system , and putting everything at the disposal of an unbridled popular will . Have we looked well to our social elements in deciding on this change ? Have we considered what was due to the great interests that pay our taxes , and sustain most others of our government burdens ? Have we made sure , or jeoparded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public peace ? If I mistake not , the immediate consequences are already manifest in a lessened aggregate of high character and talents among the agencies of public life . Men will form their own estimates . Invidious as the subject is , I have no difficulty in declaring mine . The same electors , it will he remembered , who choose the ordinary legislatures , choose also the yet higher functionaries by whom the active trade of constitution-making is carried on . Is it not curious to see how these two classes of agents push their different kinds of business at one and the same moment ?  --  the statute-men working , as I may say , within the edifice of the Constitution , while the architects of reform are pulling it down , or laying strong hand upon it , outside ? It reminds me of the screw method of removing buildings in New York ; where huge structures of brick and mortar are daily sent upon their travels by the magicians of improvement , while the inmates , as if nothing strange were happening , cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parlor . Such cool philosophy may have merit in it ; but I am afraid there is less fortitude of reason than callousness of familiarity in the exhibition ; and I would ask political observers , who have lived long enough to make the comparison the question imports , whether merit , of some other kinds , is not apt to be scarcer than it ever was in our State councils of whatever grade ? Our public men , generally , are they of the same stamp as of old ? I was lately present in a State convention , and heard some of the debates . I was stunned with the town-meeting rhetoric of little men , getting warm , getting furious indeed , upon matters which were to me as " the great globe* ' to a fly upon its surface . The great body of assessors were tradesmen , ploughmen , men of every calling but that which might have fitted them for the place they were in . I had not sat long before a person of very humble stature accosted me . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good getter-up of picture-frames , and who had spent his life in a garret , plying diligently the usual stucco and gold-leaf of that species of manufacture ; a man , indeed , whose very face was to my mind a picture-frame . " Ah ! my old friend , " said I , " what are you doing here ? " " I am a memlmr of the house , " said he ; and with that returned to his seat of grave deliberation , to serve the nonce as a framer of political commonwealths . A considerable change of artisanship it seemed to me ; and one that indicated very pointedly , as I thought , the chronology of what was going forward . These conclaves of reform are now , like everything else in the political world , got up ( the idiom is not the less pertinent for being vulgar ) by universal suffrage . And they are got up too often to be much considered of by the multitude . The game of the constitutional chess-board is become so common an affair that the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fitness of the agents employed . It seems as if everybody were held statesman enough for such a business . And if fundamental lawgiving has arrived at this pass , if th' great job-work of constitutional reform is deemed within the competency of men educated in the hands only , and not in the head , what is likely to be the popular standard of judgment as to the talents and qualities required for regulating ordinary matters ? We have no occasion to speculate about it ; we have all seen , and may see again next winter , if we live so long . Another source of bad influence from which some of the State economies are suffering , as I think , both absolutely and // relatively , is the too narrow policy they practise in regard to terms and tenures of office . I refer particularly to the cases of chief magistrates , senators and judges . Of the terms of governors and senators , I have spoken too broadly in a former number , as to the innovations that have been made . The evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . Particular States have committed a folly of that kind , and have ta*ed the fruits of it . Other States have never given longer than annual terms to either of their houses of legislation , or to their governors . It is a sort of original sin in their constitutions , and they have the effects of it upon them , without any consciousness perhaps of the cause . But there is an office , that of the judges , of which the annals of the country give us a tale of universal interest . Between a tenancy for a few short years , and a lifetenure defensible only by bad conduct , the difference is such as to strike every one . And there is no difficulty in concluding , that practical reswlts must be as wide apart as the causes that produce them . An independent permanent bench has a a chance of great attainments , great usefulness and honor . There is likely to be a tone of high-minded purity and firmness in its administrations , which the men of a petty term , who desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom exhibit . What were the English judges when the crown appointed and removed them at pleasure ? If it were allowable I might find illustrations nearer home . Mere time is something to the character of an office . Independence is more . And the charmed tenure by good behavior puts a finish to these advantages with an influence all its own . We have seen the fact exemplified from one end of the country to the other . Has there been an instance of any manner of evil growing out of this tenure ? Has not the benefit of it been acknowledged by the wise and good of every party ? What has faction itself to complain of in the matter ? True , Mr. Jefferson disliked the notion of judicial independence . And what then ? He disliked the judges themselves , particularly those of the Supreme Court at Washington . And why did he dislike them ? Just because they were firm enough to follow their own judgment , and not his , in the celebrated trial of his rival , Burr . Let facts be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson suffered his hatred of Burr to betray him into marvellous indecorums in relation to that trial . He wanted time at the judges ' hands to hunt up further proofs against the accused . He ! the President of the Union ! Was the prosecution his , or was it the people 's ? He sent Mr. Rodney " to inform the chief justice inofficially " of his desire ; a most glaring impropriety . And because the impartial duty of the court forbade their compliance , he took offense , as James the Second did when Coke 's uprightness baffled his villany . James , indeed , had power that could reach the recusant judge , but Mr. Jefferson had not ; Chief Justice Marshall held by good behavior . And thus the impotence of the President 's anger left him to the amazin* indiscretion of using hard words ; talking about " the tricks of the judges , " and their " favorite offenders , " to protect whom he represents them as willing " to pervert all the principles of law that bore upon them ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follies to a substantial winding up , he concludes with a sage prediction that the people will judge , not only*Burr , but the judges too , and that they will ultimately " see and amend the error in the Constitution , which makes any branch of the government indepe*ident of the nation ; " remarking , elsewhere , " I believe that the judicial term should be fixed at about six years . " * It gives me pain to make these observations . But when opinions are mischievously influential on the public mind , the public mind should know the evidence they are founded on . I ascribe to Mr. Jefferson the originatioQ of the heresy that has gone abroad respecting free tenure in the department of the courts . And I ascribe the rise of that heresy in his own breast to his unworthy quarrel with Chief Justice Marshall upon a point that illustrates well the beauty and grandeur of the very principle the President condemnedjudicial independency . Unfortunately , the serpent 's fang was venemous , and the whole country has sickened of the bite . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 , 362. 290 Sept. // No , not the whole . There are thirteen States that still hold fast to the old tenure . They are Maine , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Florida , Alabama , Kentucky , Illinois . May they long keep one another company in this evidence of wisdom ! But the majority of the States prefer dependent courts ; men of yesterday , and to whom to-morrow is uncertain ; men whose breath is in their nostrils ; the sport of an appointing power , which is necessarilv felt to have claims upon them , and of which they are not likely in all cases to repel the approaches , as Marshall did those of Mr. Jefferson . In one of the States ( Rhode Island ) the judges hold at the pleasure of the General Assembly ; but among the rest , the terms of office range from about three to fifteen years , giving an average of about six-Mr . Jefferson 's idea . Here , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first estate . I profess a conviction that it is a fact of stupendous consequence to our future prospects . Others will smile at this ; time must decide . In the next place , we are beginning a practice which is perhaps still more disparaging than that of judicial degradation to the relative dignity and power of the States that adopt it , by taking from the local governments their patronage of appointments , so called . In early times , the far greater number of executive and ministerial agents were selected and commissioned by other agents , whom the people put in principal charge of the public business . It was thought , and with good reason , that for many purposes of peculiar public service , appointments could be best made in that way ; while , on the other hand , the making of them placed the patron agents , and the whole organic economy they were parts of , in possession of very considerable influence and weight of character beyond their direct power over the general will ; a fact sufficiently clear by its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to deprive our State governments of this advantage , and to depress them proportionally in the feudal scale of things . The practice was timidly commenced long since , in reference to certain petty officers , such as sheriffs , coroners , justices of the peace , &amp;c. , whom it was thought best , in many parts of the country , to choose by popular elections . I may mention Alabama , Louisiana , Tennessee , Ohio , Illinois , Missouri , Michigan , as active in this policy . And so far as concerned the mere choice of those officers , who were to serve in small districts , and in functions of no technical nicety , the thing was well enough . Yet the withdrawing the privilege of appointing them from government , where the true personality of the States resided , was a sensible drain upon head-quarters , an effect that was increased in some of the States by putting the choice of officers of militia , to a great extent , upon the same footing as the civil service of the counties and townships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very old custom of organizing regiments , and , I believe , brigades , by the voices of the rank and file ; a bad custom , I should think , even in its military bearing . Good or bad , however , it is gaining ground . Several of the more recent constitutions have given way to it . Not content with that , the State of Mississippi , in 1832 , went much further , and transferred the appointment , not only of district and militia officers , but of secretaries , treasurers , and attorneys-general nay , of judges , chancellors , and " the High Court of Errors " itself-all the great officers of the commonwealth , however peculiar their duties , and how far soever from popular competency to decide upon their fitness for them-from government to the people , from the capital to the villages and hamlets of the country . What a swoop was there ! It reminds me of the exploit of a very near-sighted gentleman of my remembrance , who , being asked by the good wife of the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and upon a thievish cat beneath it while dinner was setting on , mistook a pudding for puss , and , in the eagerness of his zeal to redress what he supposed to be a crying evil , made a flourish with his stick that sent all the smoking contents of the platter upon the floor . It is good to be watchful against mischief ; but a defect of vision may bring the best intentions to an awkward development . 1849. 291 // Patronage , no doubt , is apt to be abused . What then ? " Why then , " say the wise counsellors of Mississippi , " let us have an end of it . " Is the conclusion a just one ? I will put a case . The business of constitution-making is apt to be abused-nothing more afflictingly common  --  and may we thence infer that we are to have an end of that too ? Sophisms do not work such benefits . The truth is , abuses are incidental to power of every kind ; and what we have to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , to strive against them ; but never to attempt a riddance by suicide , or even by expedients of near-sighted empiricism . I am ashamed to say , the example of Mississippi has been followed by the great and once lofty State of New York . The same style of reasoning , I suppose , that produced the model prompted the imitation . Even " the Empire State " has made its own judges elective ! In short , it has tried for itself the " fell swoop ; " the secretary of State , comptroller , treasurer , attorney general , state engineer , canal commissioners , inspectors of state prisons , being all put upon a footing , in this respect , with the unnumbered tribe of district officers , and with the judges Well , imagine a popular election in New York . A common citizen , any one of a thousand as the wheel of universal suffrage turns them up , goes to the place of voting and asks a friend for tickets . Twenty of these , less or more , are put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor . That will do ; he understands the thing perfect ly . Another : it is for senators and members of assembly . That too is intelligible . A third : it is for judges of the court of errors - I beg pardon- of " appeals . " What now ? The sun grows dim . A fourth ticket labors with candidates for the supreme court ; a fifth is full of canal commissioners ; a sixth , of state prison inspectors ; a seventh , sports a would-be attorney general , or a clerkly aspirant to the keepership of public accounts , or the yet more interesting task of " carrying the bag ; " and so on , in a series that ends with the last journeyman 's place in the political workshop . Is the voter 's mind cleared up when he has shuffled his cards ? Does he know what he is about ? Can he go forward to the poll-inspectors and say , " here are my men I have considered the exigencies of the civil list , and bring you votes such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parts call for ? " It were as plausible to ask , is he a rational agent in the use of his franchise ? Is it possible for him to use it intelligently , overburdened as it is with a variety and multiplicity of objects , not only beyond its fair scope in his hands , but above his competency to judge of , and every way too much for him ? But besides the evil of this wretched electoral mummery , ( made such by tasking the popular mind to do more than it knows how to do , ) consider , also , the effect which government itself is likely to experience from having all its patronage taken away . Do I deceive myself ? Must not an utter bereavement of the power of conferring appointments depress and humble that government in its relative political attitudes ? If reason could not answer the question , I would appeal to observation . Three years are not enough to develope fully the consequences of the late revolution in New York , but I mistake the matter greatly if even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her high places are not aspired to by the same kind of men as formerly . Persons of distinguished merit will consent at times to go into them , as present facts show ; but the staiidard of official character , taking all the departments through , is sensibly lowered . And though several causes may have contributed to this , the stripping process of 1840 is probably the chief of them . It must have been . There is a vast and necessary difference between a government with some thousands of benefices at its disposal , and the same government in a plight of forlorn destitution , with nothing to give , and none to ghther round it in token either either of expectancy or gratitude . The zenith sun , that sends forth all his radiance to the dazzled eye , is not more different from the sun of the lower heavens , seen " Through the horizontal misty air , Shorn of his beams . " Out of New York and Mississippi , this change of things from the old model as to government patronage , has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other States be more cautious of the judi 292 Sept. // cious selection of their public servants , and especially more regardful of their relative position in the country , than to follow examples so extremely questionable , nay , so certainly bad . I know that patronage has an odious sound . The notion of it is associated strongly with that of favoritism and corruption . Very justly so ; for the two things have gone much together . But what are you to do ? Is there a substitute that can be expected to do as well for the public service ? And now that the Union is stretching abroad over the earth , does it not become the particular governments to maintain as much prominence as they can , and not gratuitously hazard the chance of being by and by overlooked ? In the next place , I see a spot upon the religious aspect of our present State constitutions generally , " which was not so before . " Not only is it not required any longer , ( with two or three exceptions , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , but there seems to be a kind of studious liberality towards irreligion , a worldliness of impartiality as between those professing the faith of the country and those who know not or despise the country 's God , that is matter of wonder on several accounts . First , it is an unprovoked , and as far as I can see , an objectless departure from the pious politics of the fathers . Secondly , it is a regulator taken out of the constitutional time-piece , which is certainly the worse for wanting it . Need I argue the point ? Is it not apparent in reason , that of all the checks of a general nature , calculated to keep men back from malversation in office , and to make them safe trustees of the people 's interests , Christianity stands first in order , both for facility of application , and for practical force ? And there are names of authority , respected by the world itself , that may be cited to the like purpose . " Religion is the basis of society , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is , the Christian faith ) " give double assurance to their country . " * De Tocqueville regards our national religion as the foundation of our morals.t Another French writer of eminence tells us Christianity is " that re ligion , whose liberal spirit prepared , and can alone sustain , all the great institutions of modern times . " * And even Mr. Jefferson , who has done more by word and deed to unchristianize our politics than any other man , was not prevented by his infidelity from acknowledging the useful bearing of Christian sentiments in every form upon the health and good order of society. * Originally , as we have seen , this faith of the country was also an element of its constitutional forms . It is such no more . The municipal laws are not yet purged of it ; God grant they never may be ; but the strong attestations of the early charterrecords have been mostly blotted out . Is this for the better or the worse ? Whether terms of religious profession ought to be imposed on candidates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ought the religion of the land to disappear entirely from the constitutions by which it was once so conspicuously honored ? Should a stranger be unable to learn from those records , whether we are Turks or Christians ? Another topic , that calls for more notice than there is room for now , is the present common low aspect of our politics , as compared with the past . There are signs here of incipient discontent with the old order of things . I see them as I think in several of the States . In some , direct aggressions upon our common law jurisprudence by constitutional provisions that violate it ; such as the restriction in New York upon leases of agricultural land , and the admission both of interested persons and of atheists to testify in judicial proceedings ; such also as the canons in another State , ( Texas , ) overruling the common law of covertur.e as to property rights . It is needless to multiply instances . There is a form of evidence that might not strike the general eye as bearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I mean , the use of written bills of rights , which are now , with three or four exceptions , appended in all the States to their constitutional records , or inserted * Cousin , Republican Institutions , 289. * See his letters , late in life , to the elder Adams . 1849. 293 * 3 Works , 100 , *th edit. , 285. 1 Democracy in America , 31 , 2. // in them . These documents are but repetitions , in one form or another , of common law principles , and it argues a distrust of the security of those principles in their unwritten , that is , their natural state , to bolster them up in this manner . But the most startling fact that has occurred upon the subject , is the recent undertaking in New York to reduce the common law to a code ; an enterprise that one knows hardly whether to smile at or be sad about it . Yes , the common law is there to be codified ; in other words , drowned bodily in an ocean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ferrying the poor victims out to sea for the purpose  --  a jurisprudential noyade ! Indeed , a code of practice has already been achieved , at least in part . Do you ask what followed ? First , I am told about a year of professional blundering , and then - another code ! or virtually another ; which last is now on trial , and expected to serve till the legislature meet again next winter . Such are written laws , so versatile , so transient . By the time you understand them , ( often sooner , ) you look for them in vain ; they are no more . Frustra comprensa manus effugit imago . But the subject is too large for my present limits , and must be deferred . One topic more as to the State economies . The later constitutions embrace notoriously many things which have heretofore been looked upon as things of ordinary government . The first , seventh , and eighth articles of the latest New York constitution are full of instances ; interfering with portions of the law of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal administration ; directing what shall or shall not be done with the public canals and salt-works ; putting limits upon the use to be made of the State 's credit , and how its debtors are to be treated ; laying down plans and rules of legislation in regard to corporations , &amp;c . The Delaware constitution of 1831 has other instances of yet minuter detail ; going down even to the law of forensic procedure ; as when a defendant may bring money into court , and with what advantage ; whether a suit in chancery shall abate or not by the death of a party ; when an appeal is to work a stay of proceedings , and the like . Other items still may be found in several of the Southern constitutions , in regard to slavery , slave-merchandising , emancipation , free negroes , &amp;c . Now the members of a convention are no part of government proper ; they are agents of the people for a purpose quite distinct from all administrative functions . But suppose their jurisdiction once enlarged by usage to a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legislature in ordinary , where the people are served by a standing council , who adopt measures for them , and are acted on in turn by the electoral sovereignty as terms of office expire ; the other , a special and extraordinary legislature , fresh from the popular mass , and through which that mass may almost be said to carry on the government by a direct action upon measures rather than men . Literally direct this action of the people certainly is not . But is it therefore legitimate ? If literally direct , it would be rather democratic than republican , and would violate the theory of our system . Is it not such a violation , then , in spirit ? For in spirit , it exhibits the people acting irregularly , that is , upon public measures ; overreaching their administrative agents , and taking the government virtually into their own hands . Observe , too , the tenor of sundry provisions in different constitutions touching future amendments , and requiring that these , after being voted upon by the legislature , shall be submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last New Jersey constitution gives us an example . That of Louisiana , another . We have a third in Tennessee . Now supposing a constitution may embrace subjects of ordinary governments , an amendment may of course do the same ; and then , with these systematic provisions for amending by the popular voice , our re* public begins in earnest to look and operate like a democracy ; the state legislatures playing the insignificant part of preparing statutes for the people to enact . And what is remarkable , there is , in the constitution of Missouri , an act ual adoption of this relationship between the leqislature and the people as regards all future enactments involving the public credit for any sum beyond a gross debt of twenty-five thousand dollars . 294 Sept. // It is distressing to contemplate these facts , in connection with the whole series of changes that our constitutional polity has undergone in other respects already noticed . Those changes have been all in a progress towards a consummation which these facts , as far as they go , realize . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed . One word , in conclusion , as to the economy and history of the central government . Its economy , constitutionally speaking , is not much altered . A parcel of declarative articles have been appended , that are of little consequence for the most part . The amendment in regard to presidential elections is I think a step backwards . It is at all events a check thrown away , that might have saved us the folly and misfortune of putting at least one unfit person into the president 's chair through th' vice-presidency . But the history of the Union government-what has that been ? One of gradual and stupendous territorial growth ; with all the natural consequences of wealth , patronage , fame , power . To accomplish which , the Constitution has been overstepped in various ways , without awakening any general reprehension on the part of the particular states or the people . In a word , while the states have gone down materially in the tone and character of their institutions , the stature of the Union has become gigantic , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind yet unsatisfied with acquisition.
