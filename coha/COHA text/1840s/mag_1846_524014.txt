txt No peculiarity of our institutions appears to have so confounded the wise Mustapha of Salmagundi memory , as the existence and tolerance among us of a class of men , whom his highness denominates slang-whangers . Our friendship for Mustapha , and the observations of a few years past , half incline us to his opinion : we are quite disposed to believe that the country would not be much the loser should some miraculous intervention suddenly extinguish their intellectual and political phosphorescence . The genuine slang-whanger is a lean , tall man , with large , jaundiced eyes , and a head apparently constructed on acoustic principles , to serve as a sounding board to his tongue , and whose tout ensemble seems a mechanical arrangement for the rapid manufacture and diffusion of sound . Had the business of towncrier been hereditary in one family , since the first herald opened his mouth , the latest specimen would be , we think , the ideal of a slang-whanger . As for his mind , let that pass : as little might be said of his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contains it as a child 's rattle holds its contents . He has neither sensitiveness nor sense . To him the word sacred bears no meaning , and no seal of decency can teach him to respect the sanctities of public or private character . In fact , we do not love slangwhangers : and if we do not declare war with them , it is that we do not fancy tilting with crocodiles . Knowing that argument or expostulation , or even satire , may as well be addressed to a windmill as to these iron-throated gentlemen , we propose , simply , to take the abused public // by the arm , and once for all advise it against giving audience to these modern Eumenides . There are slang-whangers everywhere ; but perhaps a portion of our Democratic Congress , with certain stumporators-who are Congressmen in training-bear off the palm in this country , probably in the world . On many subjects these orators provided by law are restless , raving and ridiculous enough to excite about equal degrees of compassion and contempt ; but it is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurseries the U. S. Military Academy and Naval School , that they have " shown the quality of their souls . " If any one argues against all military organizations , as prolonging the spirit and dominion of war in the world , t is a very different thing . We can even go a part of the way with them , and are only brought up at the rock of necessity , or at least of national caution . But when persons , who nre forever noisy about fighting for national honor , feed daily on martial epithets and belligerent denunciations , wax sanguinary in the face against great nations desirous of being at peace with us , and have finally succeeded in plunging us into a war of sheer aggression , in which all the little military science we possess is in vital demand-when such persons froth at the mouth with abuse of the system and single institution , from which alone that necessary science is derived , it becomes a matter despicable beyond endurance . If they would but conduct their operations in the spirit , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means quarrel - with them . But they have , of their own accord , *tepped without the pale of commoa courtesy . For several years a mean arrd libelous system of attack- has been indulged in by Members of Congress , stump-orators and editors of the slang-whanger school , characterized by an entire want of can dor , and a total disregard of the public and private character of the class so foolishly assailed . Whatever objections any person may entertain against the Army and Military Academy , as in*titutions of the country , he has *o right publicly to deal in wholesale denunciations of officers and cadets ; as if , in giving their official services to the country , they had also thrown in their private characters for the public amusement . No one need be informed that such gen eralized anathemas offend alike against the laws of veracity and gentility . When Members of Congress deliberately characterize cadets as " wasp-waisted yampyres , " and officers of the army as " epauletted loafers , " it would appear hopeless to argue points of propriety in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate decorum ; and , in most cases , even those are evidently and confessedly offering sacrifice to the newly installed deity of Buncombe . The devotees of Juggernaut can plead superstition rn extenuation of their practices ; these worshipers of Buncombe add hypocrisy to their other pleasant qualities . We do not propose a formal vindication of the character of the Army and Academy : the . species of attack against which - we protest is too mean-spirited to deserve refutation . With those who know it , the private character of officers and cadets will sufficiently plead their own cause ; and their official character has been vindicated - by a voice from the fields of J*alo Alto and Resaca de la Palma , to which a nation has listened , and which we hope will long silence the clamor of detraction . Fair and able expositions- of the condition and importance of the Army and - Academy have so often come from official sources , as to require no reiteration from us . But it is a fair ground of com* plaint , that some of those to whom these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without either opportunity or desire for candid examination , entirely to close their eyes to official testimony , given with a full knowledge of facts . There are some Members of Congress who , with the most wretchedly crude notions of our military organization , indulge themselves inperiodical outpourings of bile on ou* establishment and all connected with- it , doling out stale denunciations and gross misstatements , already often refuted . When Members thus volunteer to inform the world , it surely is but fair to hold them responsible for the veracity of their facts , when these are open for investigation . Yet some have doggedly persevered , for years , in stating as such , what a glance at statistics have shown to be misconceptions . What does this mean ? This simply : - these patriots , amid their statistical oratory , are casting sweet sideglances at their dear constituency . They are laboring to demonstrate their pure democracy . There is another species of army attack // August , which , coming from a different and higher source , threatens consequences of a more formidable character both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iu the exercise of his appointing power , has choseis to do violence to the cherished feelings of all military men , and to crush the just hopes of those whose distinguished services should have recommended them to his favorable notice . Little as the officers in our service had to hope in the way of promotion , he has made that little less by showing them that no services , however brilliant , can secure to them this , the only real and appropriate reward in his gift . We have seen the country plunged into a war of Executive origin ; our little army we have seen brought into a situation which made even the most sanguine tremble for its safety ; by the most conspicuous gallantry and good conduct on the part of all concerned , we have seen it , not only saving itself , but signally overthrowing its enemies . Suppose the result what it surely must have been with officers unlike what ours showed themselves , brave and accomplished in their profession ; suppose that army sacrificed to the Mexican arms through Executive mismanagement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resounded , and what bitter reproacheswould have been coupled with the names of those who had brought this deep , abiding stain upon us ! If ever an administration was saved from irretrievable disgrace , it was that of James K. Polk by the battles of the 8th and 9th of May . From him , then , we might fairly suppose , a sense of gratitude would call forth every just acknowledgment of those services which saved him . What has he done ? Close upon the heels of the dispatches announcing the triumph of our arms , comes a law authorizing the formation of a new reigment , as if purposely to furnish him the means of rewarding the merit which had won a nation 's applause . With a total contempt of both justice ahd gratitude , he coolly passed by all the gallant spirits of Palo Alto and Resaca de Ia Palma , to appoint a crowd of hungry aspirants whose courage and ability has only been shown in political campaigning . He prefers those who made him to those who saved him . Amongst these beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once given a rank above that of their former classmates who have graduated and continued in service : a piece of indelicacy and injustice too gross to require comment . But are we told that the President intends to reward with brevet rank , the distinguished officers of the Rio Grande ? He might better reward them with a blue ribbon or a sugar plum , as the more valuable of the two . Brevet rank gives neither pay nor ( according to his own decision ) command , except in certain unusual circumstances . Besides , this is so cheap a present that it has long since lost the attraction of being a distinction . The President could not now , if he would , bestow a substantial reward . Or perhaps it will be said that he has rewarded them by speaking in the highest terms of their merits in his communications to Congress . The approbation of a Washington or a Jackson might be esteemed a reward worth seeking ; but what imbecility , what downright lunacy , what a specimen of reasoning from great to small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polk is a sufficient recompense , is glory enough ! There is another view of this affair . The President seems evidently to be shaping his measures to make the army a part of the great Executive machine for political corruption which so powerfully contributed to make him what he is . Let this be done , and wetoo will join in the belief that a standing army , however small , is dangerous to the political liberty of this country . We can not too soon disband our little army existing , when time-serving politicians shall discover that officers in it are to be won by stump rather than field services or military attainments . The Executive patronage is already so great as to be more dangerous to a free expression of popular opinion than any*other cause : what then might we expect should it be double ? This system of army attack , of which we have had so recent and ungracious a foreshadowing , is directed against its most vital point , its hope of distinction and love of honor . If continued , it will soon break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the service in disgust . Its present high character for military science and efficiency will not long survive the system which created it . Entering our most decided protest , in the names of gentility , gratitude , and justice , against the slang-whanger and stiletto systems of army attack , we proceed to the more welcome subject of na // 149 tional defence . We will first briefly give our creed on the subject of war , whence arises the necessity of national defence . We believe , as our pages have heretofore testified , that war in itself is an immense evil , and that we are morally bound to strive against its occurrence by all means in our power , consistent with the rights and character of a free and Christian nation . We have often felt , moreover , that no sight could be more sublime , than that of a great people , like ourselves , quietly disbanding all armaments and means of war , and calmly resting for security upon the broad level of human gentleness and forbearance . We do not , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating the principles of gospel kindness , that nations in their dealings with each other will be always controlled by a sense of justice , and never allow interest to lead to violations of right . Most of all , we are too sadly persuaded that we can not trust the action of our own Government could this be otherwise , we might come to a different conclusion . We think , therefore , that war or quiet submission to foreign dictation and injustice , may become our sole alternativ&amp; . When this case arises , we believe war to be not only justifiable but obligatory upon the nation , if there be a chance of success . As all past history and present indications show both the possibility and probability of future resorts to this last argument becoming necessary , we esteem it a first duty of Government to provide for its own security when such an emergency arises . We believe that a state of thorough preparation for such emergencies constitutes one of the strongest possible securities against their occurrence , and thus redoubles the obligation of Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not our present purpose to examine in detail the various systems which have been or may be proposed . We , as a nation , have already adopted our system , and it is this which we would now examine . The elements entering into its composition may be classed under four general heads , viz. : the navy , the militia , the army and fortifications . The militia is the grand park of material from which the mass of our armies must be drawn . The army is the school of practice in which the treasures of military science are kept . Its office is that of the Roman vestal , nourishing ever a sacred flame which was thence extended to every hearth at Rome . Fortifications exert a controlling influence over other arms , and are the grand auxiliary of the defensive . The navy represents our power to foreign nations , protects our commerce , acts against their navies , and c*ioperates in sea-coast defence . In the latter capacity , only , would we now consider it . The physical circumstances under which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier to hostile attempts . But this very weakness of our position affords , to a certain extent , its own cure ; since the intervention of the Atlantic creates an obstacle not easily overcome by a force of sufficient strength to effect , by landing on our shores , its proposed object . Here we must call distinctly before the mind the fundamental principle of war , which is , that-in every movement  --  the object should be to effect a concentration of superior forces on decisive points . Our main sea-port towns containing , as they do , the grand depots of materials useful in war-being almost the sole repositories of our naval stores and supplies , and concentrating in themselves vast amounts of wealth which might be exacted by laying them under contribution-are all , strategically speaking , decisive points , as their occupancy , even though temporary , would seriously affect the issue of a war . Thus the most important positions in our country are , naturally , entirely open to the attacks of our enemy . Now unless means be adopted effectually to prevent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprive us of our main resources , and draw from ourselves the means of protracting hostilities . The navy has , by some , been regarded as the most efficient means of preventing or re* sisting these attempts . Its entire inadequacy to effect this result becomes evident , if we reflect that it has not the power of omnipresence . Unless we suppose the chivalric courtesy of our enemy to extend so far as that he will favor us with a seat in his council of war , we can not know beforehand whether he contemplates a blow at any of our towns , or , if he does , whether he will select Boston , New York , or New Orleans for a first effort . But till this be known , what can our navy do to prevent his design ? Supposing it ( what we may safely take for granted it long will be , in reference to the chief maritime powers of Europe ) inferior in available force to // that of our enemy , it would be altogether absurd to expect it to secure our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage its antagonist . If it remains in port , it can only assist the defence of that harbor in which it may lie , while all the rest are entirely exposed . Next , suppose it of force equal to that of our enemy . Now , if it be kept together , it may try the result of an engagement , provided it can find an antagonist ; but the chance of meeting him , by cruising after him on the broad ocean , is but as our chance of meeting Daniel Webster by taking a turn around the Capitol . But while our fleet is engaged in searching for its enemy , lie may he successively laying our towns under contribution . Thus an equal fleet , united , would only succeed in defending our coast in the one fortunate case of its meeting and conquering its adversary . If , now , we suppose our equal fleet subdivided , no part would be able to cope with its enemy ; as , in naval warfare , the inferior can not maintain position before the superior . Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize increased by a fraction of our fleet . Thus our navy , considered as a means of seacoast defence , has but one chance , out of a great number , of effecting its object , so long as it is no more than equal to that of our antagonist . A navy alone can only secure our defence when we are able to statioh before every town worth an enemy 's attack , a fleet superior to his entire disposable navalforce . If , with this idea , we think of the great number of our important seacoast towns , and of the immense navies of the maritime powers of Europe , we can form some conception of what an enormous marine we must create in order thereby to be secured . The whole nation would hardly furnish it crews . We regard those , then , entirely at fault , who look upon the navy as the principal in our defence against invasion , since we can not , by it , secure an efficient and certain protection by any efforts within our power . But , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some important positions , naturally incapacitated for an unaided land defence , when ships of war or other floating batteries-acting under cover of fortifications-may seriously affect the the operations of an enemy , even though greatly inferior in force . Their province here is to act against the weak points of his line and his sources of supply , by improving favorable conjunc tures for slipping out from their secure coverts , and not to endeavor to bear the whole brunt of his force . Thus , as an auxiliary , its necessity arises not from its excellence , but from the fact that nothing better can be substituted . The true sphere for the action of the navy is on the ocean-its own grand element-against the commerce and wooden walls of our enemies . Here its utility all must feel and acknowledge , and here our brilliant experience has shown how much we might yet hope from it in the event of another war . It still seems to us quite too small to effect this great object , and fom* this reason , together with the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would advocate its increase . The great peculiarity which characterizes our organization for national defence , is that , with us , the great reliance is placed , not as with other nations , on a standing army , but on the citizens of the country , embodied as militia . Practically dissenting from the conclusion on which the nations of Europe have grounded , and still ground , their organizations , that reliance can only be placed on troops formed by long and , rigid discipline ; we must be presumed to regard our circumstances as justifying us in excepting ourselves from a principle which is verified by so vast a body of experience . When a rule of national conduct has been universally concurred in , to depart without its pale is a dangerous experiment , requiring cogent reasons for its justification . Such we believe to be the character of those arguments which caused our national secession from the creed of the civilized world on this point . With us there does not exist the necessity for maintaining a large standing army , in order that we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a small standing army sufficient to perpetuate the higher branches of military science among us , we can pass to a state of active hostilities with every requisite for success . The great body of troops required in war is composed of infantry , whose duties require but a slight degree of intelligence . These duties militia , under skilful direction , can efficiently perform , if they can be induced to use the abilities of which they are , in fact , possessed . The effect of discipline is not to make a man 's skin shot-proof ; its virtue lies in this , that it teaches all to act together as parts of a whole , to // trust to joint exertions for security , to associate a sense of danger and disgrace with flight , and by practice to familiarize the operations which may be necessary in the presence of an enemy . Can superior intelligence and a higher morale alone effect these ends of discipline ? Experience says that they may partially , but never fully . With these , a much smaller amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior intelligence is as advantageous to the common soldier as the common laborer , and the influence of enthusiasm is sometimes almost a substitute for discipline . Yet they are both uncertain dependencies when relied on alone . To avail ourselves of them and make them sure , they must be united with such a degree of military instruction as will bring them under control . Now we believe this may be effected with us , by means of a good militia system . Such , however , is tar from being the result of the present so-called organization . We have now , virtually , no militia system ; and , if we except the few volunteer companies who have a creditable esprit de corps , we have no militia worthy of the name . Not only is our nominal system heretical , but our practice is a doubly refined heresy . The whole affair has become the merest farce in the world . But is war so much a piece of stage foolery , so entirely harmless , as to justify this piece of national buffoonery ? Our revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are wholly untrue to ourselves . Our actual system is not only inefficient , but odious and irksome . A man of any spirit is justly ashamed to be seen engaged in any of our so-called " trainings , " so completely silly and ridiculous have they become . To allow this state of things to continue longer , will be indicative of a criminal apathy . Either let us have a system of which we need not be ashamed , or let us do without any . No longer let our military displays he ridiculous . There is no reason why , at least , a respectable fraction of our able-bodied men should not be so taught that even the professional soldier should see no cause for laughter on their gala day , but rather of real satisfaction . That such a result is attainable , the volunteer companies of two or three Atlantic cities fully attest-nor can we doubt but that an emergency would prove them an invaluable resource . Give us a system , and a state of public feeling that will render what we here see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immediate declaration of war : who would then expect the least benefit from our present system ? Napoleon declared , that " when a nation is without establishment and a military system , it is very difficult to organize an army . " This is exactly our condition , if we regard facts instead of statutes . We expound no system , but in common with all who regard the best interests of our country , we ardently desire that a spirit of reform may originate , ' soon and in the right quarter , such a system , skch a tone of public feeling and opinion , as will restore to efficiency this paralyzed right arm of our national defence . We fear not for the safety of our institutions , however efficient this , our Marcellus and Fabius united , may be rendered ; for what have w* to fear from our own best citizens ? It is an odious piece of demagoguism to raise the cry of danger to our institutions , whenevet any plan is proposed which wonld give a respectable degree of efficiency to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " a standing army , " " overthrow of our liberties , " and other  |p6|pular  bughears , when it is proposed to qualify a portion of our citizens to discharge the duty of defending our liberty , in common , with all else we hold dear from the fatal arm of foreign aggression ! It is the unmoored seoundrelly radicalism of this country , calling itself democracy , that is constantlyplunging us into war , yet all the while raising these outcries against the only system which . can give us adequate contingent defence , yet secure us from the dangers of military ambition . Othbr nations all concur in the necessity of large standing armies to their independent existence : we , trusting to our position and the patriotic , intelligent character of our citizens , have cast from us the acknowledged means of defence , and have substituted a mode admirably adapted to our situation , were it but made all that it is capable of becoming . A criminal neglect has suffered a wretched system of organization to bring into ridicule this mode of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body on which we still continue blindly to depend . We have cast from us-not without consideration-the old , tried armor of nations : shall we also suffer that sword , on which alone we now rely to be eaten up by rust , simply because we are told // that in burnishing it , it might cut our-selves ? What could our militia now do , if called into active service ? How could they be controlled and directed in their untutored condition ? How could they be brought to act in union when in large bodies ? How could men , habituated to think and act for themselves , be brought to do the will of another without stopping to call for information as to the reasons for their orders ? Military operations admit no democracy . Their first principle is , that all men are not equal . Without strict obedience there can be no united effort , and this is the very soul of military power . Thus our political creed is unfavorable to that spirit which alone can secure success in war . The corrective for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall teach all that discipline is no unmeaning word . We can hardly blame privates in the present militia fof insubordination , when we reflect on the general character of their officers . Often chosen through some capricious freak , generally without regard to fitness , obedience is regarded rather as a matter of accommodation than of duty . When we reflect on the utter incapacity of a majority of militia officers to discharge their duties , and think that on them war would actually throw the responsibility and direction of operations on which they have never bestowed a thought , for which they have no natural fitness ; we can not but fear that we may have to pay too dearly for the thoughtless playfulness which has decked them with epaulets . The defects of our present system are so great , and the condition of our militia , regarded as ameans of defence , so wretched , that with war , if not before , reform must come ; and can any one doubt the wisdom of anticipating that necessity ? If so , let him reflect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were in the presence of our foe . Let him remember that time is necessary to bring about a reform , and that while it is going on , we shall suffer all the evils , incident to a state of military disorganization . Our condition is evident not only to ourselves , but to foreign nations : let such measures then be taken as that we shall no longer seem to invite hostilities by voluntarily disabling ourselves to meet them with success . The objects proposed to be secured by maintaining our small standing army are , August , the preservation among its of military science by creating a prqfesszon whose special business shall be its cultivation , todisch arge the various military duties arising while we are in a state of general peace , to garrison our forts and to be a sure reliance , as a nucleus , in case of general hostilities . War has always been to a certain extent a science . Even among barbarians , superiority of weapons and skill in their use have ever constituted prime elements of success . Conflicts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not made itself felt : thus originating in the combatants ideas , crude it may be , yet important , on the principles of strategy . With the progress of civilization , the inventive powers of man have been constantly active in devising new implements of warfare , and the highest minds have found ample room for exercise in deducing from the victories and defeats which history has recorded , those general principles which conduct to the former , and those precautions whose neglect induces the latter . Thus what at first was of extreme simplicity , by degrees assumed the nature and form of a science , abstruse in its elements and of all perhaps most difficult in its application . War ceased to be a trial of personal strength , and it was felt that success was " not to the strong alone , " but to him whose strength was best directed . The introduction of gunpowder into military operations , may be regarded as having consummated the change from a game of strength to a game of skill . Mind controlling and directing means now performs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innovations , apparently trifling , have fixed the destiny of nations ; and success has again and again been seen to attend movements which to the unpracticed eye bore no apparent meaning . And , amid the general advance of civilization , we see defeat ever brooding over a nation which has been slow to adopt military improvements , and there is no more forcible illustration of the truth of Bacon 's aphorism , that " knowledge is power , " than that which is derived from the history of modern warfare . We may add , what all who have considered the subject know , that the greater destructiveness belonging to modern instruments of war , has really been a g rent aid in inducing habits of peace . or his effect , however , it is plainly of much consequence that nations should feel themselves equal to each // other in their means of aggression and defence . Now it is with military as with other professional sciences . Chance may direct the op5ations of a medical quack to a successful issue , in the same manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements ; yet who advocates the employment of a Sangrado ? Ought we to be more tolerant of quackery in the one case than the other ? Who talks of intuition alone as the true basis of legal skill , or who would trust the *management of his own eases to a lawyer whose only professional recommendation consisted in a happy faculty of guessing our laws ? There exists in fact the same necessity for a military profession as any other , a necessity arising from the fact , that without long and patient study , an officer can not , generally speaking , be adequate to the discharge of his appropriate duties . Its importance can best be estimated by supposing ourselves suddenly involved in war , without a body of accomplished officers to discharge the newly created responsibilities then thrown upon them . Our condition would be that of a man with a broken leg and no surgeon at hand . We do not suppose that the mere study of military science is alone sufficient to make a good officer , for nature must have done her part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity with opportunities for improvement alone can insure excellence . Thus far like the other established professions ; it differs from them in one essential particular , that the necessity for its practice is not of constant occurrence . The fixed depravity of man 's motives and acts , constantly stimulate the theologian to the application of his moral sanatives ; litigation is ever pursuing its chase after poverty and iniquity , and flesh is the constant heir to too many ills to leave the physician 's rest unbroken ; but it is the business of the officer to keep alive through long intervals of peace , that knowledge to which war alone can impart value . Without his agency the vast body of past experience would become almost lost to us until too late : and history records , our own painful struggles tell , how dearly original experience is b*ught . The purchase money sinks in an ocean of blood . What we have laid under this head may be thus summed up . War has become 153 a science of great extent ; a thorough understanding of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this understanding , it is and ought to be made the business of a profession , unless we are to take the position as a nation , that there is of course to be no more war . A second object proposed to be effected by our army is the discharge of those military duties incident to a state of general peace . We are separated , to a great extent , from the powerful nations of the earth by our position . Our relations to them are not those of contact . Hence we graduate our establishments , not by their scales but by reference to our own immediate situation . Jn other words we look around on our immediate neighbors and shape our permanent force by their strength . We find ourselves flanked by establishments too weak in themselves to admit of their disturbing the general pacific character of our condition . Our great wars must always be with powers not American . In our territory , and bordering on it , are numerous tribes of In* dians , whose character is essentially warlike . We can not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagined or real grievances are always rankling in their minds , prompting them to that revenge which their educationhas formed them to love . We are at least bound , for a long time , to provide against the probability of such hostilities . The portion of our country most exposed to their attacks , is also that least able to defend itself against them . Our government must keep in readiness means sufficient to avert , as far as may be , from our exposed pioneers , the dangers resulting from their position . It also has an office of prevention to perform . A proper show of force to our savage neighbors has the effect of enlisting their fears on the side of peace . Seeing the means of punishing their aggressions prepared and on hand , nothing but desperation or infatuation cam* drive them to hostility . But were they to see no traces of a power ready to crush their first efforts , the apparent facility of their execution would stimulate into fearful activity , all their animosities and longing for plunder . We have here an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet or prevent all threatened hostilities on this quarter . The accession which our territory has recently received , by increasing the number of Indians within and bordering on our domain , has brought // qwq corps , often the strongest spring to urge the mass to honorable achievement , the cool determination and fearlessness which pervades the forlorn hope or storming party , all are feelings rapidly transferred from breast to breast , and must all conspire to make the true , efficient soldier . But these are also feelings which neglect can kill , and which , once gone , years of careful culture alone can restore . Let them be cherished among us , not as provocatives of war , but as sure pledges that if it must come , our annals shall not thereby be rendered ignoble . The last element of our organization for national defence to which we alluded was our system of permanent fortications . In the further discussion of this subject , we propose to state the general nature and effect offortifications ; to define the military character of the frontier to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the attacks to which it is s ject ; and hence to deduce the character of the works whicfl oar sitaation requires ; and , fin*ally , to illustrate by their application to the defence of the city and harbor of New York . The term fortification comprises all dispositions made to cover a weaker force from the attempts of a stronger , and to enable it to withstand an attack . The art derived its origin from that cautious impulse which so universally drives men to seek immunity to themselves when doing violence to others . The Indian advances stealthily on his enemy , interposing trees , hillocks , or whatever cover he can find , to serve him as a fortification . In like manner may be traced the incipient art of fortification in the shields and other defensive armor of the ancients . The general , by a natural extension of the same impulse , seeks a like cover for his army against hostile attempts , and finds it in entrenched camps , thus giving rise to the art of field fortifications . Governments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may arrest and foil the hostilities of other nations , and these are found only in defensive frontiers , duly organized with permanent works . As the fundamental principle of offensive strategy bids us proceed by concentrating superior forces as decisive points , so may defensive strategy he said to rest on the equally general principle that all decisive points should be so preoccupied as to render ineffectual an enemy 's concentration upon them . This principle clearly points to the office which permanent works are to perform in the defence of States . The testimony of history is positive and decisive on the importance to a nation of precluding active hostilities from the central portions of its territory . if an enemy be allowed freely to overrun the country of its antagonist , he will thence derive his own support , at the same time that he destroys the resources of his opposers . Hence the vast importance of meeting invasion at the threshold , and of checking on the frontier that torrent which , unarrested , would bear destruction in its train . The great talents , untiring study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers whom Europe , and especially F*nce , has produced , have been mainly directed to the strong organization of those international frontiers which were marked by no insurmountable natural obstacles . The method which has been pursued has been to occupy , with works sufficiently strong to require a formal siege for their reduction , those stra- - tegic points , which , by their relations to the communications , would so act against the flanks , rear and line of operations of na invading enemy , as to compel it to besiege them before attempting an advance . Fortresses or enclosed towns have often been employed for the same purpose . Our own extensive frontier may be divided into four principal sections , defined by their military character , as well as geographically ; namely  --  the frontier of our Northern Lakes , our Western Frontier , the Gulf of Mexico , and the Eastern or Maritime Frontier . The northern frontier , marked by a grand water communication whose lower portion is in the possession of the first naval power on earth , presents peculiar facilities for invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather the organized elements of a force , which , if suddenly precipitated upon us , might do infinite harm to our flourishing Lake towns , and even to our more interior villages . If the naval ascendency on the Lakes he left in the hands of Great Britain , invasion maybe chosen as the means best adapted to avert our expected attacks on Canada , her most vulnerable point . As the invasion of Carthage forced the recall of Hannibal , so would an invasion of these States be presumed upon as the surest means to confine us within our own borders . When fortifications could be so placed as effecually to command any inlet for such an // attack , they would doubtless be appropriately and advantageously applied . We believe , however , that the minds of our people are so firmly impressed with the idea that Canada will ultimately become ours , that a proposition to prepare for any other issue , in case of hostilities , would meet with no favor ! The character of our western frontier is altogether peculiar . Civilized and savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible exactly to define its position . The presence of numerous tribes of Indians beyond it , renders a frequent show of force necessary , not so much to conduct , as to prevent hostilities . Its distribution into garrisons must be regulated by the rapidly shifting circumstances of the case . Our western works of defence , therefore , must all be of a temporary character . As they can never be subject to a formal siege with artillery , it would he a useless excess of precaution to give them a greater degree of strength than is possessed by the stockade forts and blockhouses now in use . The general character of our maritime and Gulf frontier is such as to direct to them our principal positive means of permanent defence . Its immense extent , the great importance to our nation of securing the wealthy and flourishing towns springing up at many points along it , the military and naval resources concentrated within them ; these are peculiar features , inviting peculiar consideration . These sections , too , constitute the frontier over which must cross any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf frontier , the towns are few , and , with one great exception , comparatively unimportant . Yet they stand in special need of defence , as the country from which they draw their support has not in itself the means of promptly sustaining them in their attempts to repel an attack , and especially as the hope , so confidently and cruelly entertained across the Atlantic , of deriving assistance from servile insurrections , would greatly tend to attract invasion towards this portion of our Union . But it is the commerce of the west , collected into the Mississippi , which gives peculiar importance to Gulf defence . The establishment of secure harbors of refuge , at Key West , Tortugas and Pensacola , will give to this commerce a degree of security which nothing else but a naval supremacy could afford . The eastern section is that which presents the strongest temptations to an ene my . Containing , especially on its northern portion , many excellent harbors , most of which are inlets to important towns , and within which is concentrated the main commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish to the immense navies of the old world every incentive to organize overwhelming attacks . Expeditions destined to act against our shores are quite within the range of probabilities . The overwhelming navy of Great Britain could dispatch , almost without perceptible reduction , a fleet superior in force to our entire navy . Were such a squadron allowed to enter our harbors without obstruction , it might successively visit our ports , capturing or destroying our mercantile marine , bombarding our cities or laying them under contribution , destroying our naval materials , shipyards and docks ; all this , too , without making a landing ' or exposing itself to the action of land troops . Historical proofs of the probability of such enterprises might be adduced in abundancce , but we shall contentoerselves with alluding to the action of the British government in fortifying the coast of England against such attempts . Hitherto its reliance for home defence has been placed mainly on a channel fleet , which it has been enabled to maintain without elsewhere losing the naval supremacy . It has thus always succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition which Napoleon had contemplated for invading England with 150,000 veterans , not having been executed , has generally been considered as a chimerical project , but whatever may have been its character then , the English government is now evidently convinced that steam has brought down the sea-girt isle from her position of fancied security . Their channel fleet can not by its flutterirrgs frighten away the " dogs of war , " which can almost blow their breath over so narrow a line of water , and are able to cross it in a single hour . If , then , England , so long the acknowledged mistress of the seas , with a limited , densely peopled shore , is obliged to confess by her present heavy expenditures that her wooden walls are no longer a sufficient security against invasion , how unlikely is she to doubt her own ability to invade our immense and sparsely-settled coast , if it be left undefended ? We have a positive expression of her opinion on this point in the establishment of an extensive coal depot // at the Bermudas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct an expedition of twenty or thirty thousand men against our coast to execute a coup-de-maim can only be doubted by blind or prejudiced students of past history ; and still less can such a sceptic comprehend the effect of steam navigation in annihilating distance . The question of the success of such enterprises , after reaching our shores , is quite another thing , and its answer will depend on the state of our preparations for their reception . This brings us to the question as to what preparation we must make to frustrate , as far as possible , such an attempt . First of all , we must , if it can he done , cut off all facilities for a hostile entrance into our harbors to attack our cities from on shipboard . A great point will be gained if we can force an enemy to land at a distance : for we are thus enabled to dispute his landing , which being necessarily made on an open beach , is , at best , a matter of great difficulty and hazard . Then his approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the city itself may be vigorously defend . ed , especially as he can hardly put on shore any artillery to accompany his advancing column . Meantime the alarm is spread ; volunteers come pouring in from the surrounding country ; a retreat becomes necessary , if the field is well contested , even before reaching the town ; the fleet , lying off an open coast , may have been driven by rising winds out to sea , or on shore , either of which disasters may render surrender or destruction the sole alternative of the invading army . Besides , we by this means deprive him of the power of using his immense naval batteries against our cities , and render bombardment , the means of attack most of all to be dreaded , quite impossible , except at infinite expense and hazard . By obliging him to put his mortars on shore , and to transport them some distance overland , we so delay his attack that our troops may be concentrated in great force to oppose his onset . Again , inasmuch as a landing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather , we may , by closing our harbors aginst him , constrain him to lie off at sea , exposed to storms and the danger of being driven on shore , waiting a favorable occasion for debarkation . His approach being thus made known some time before he can attempt a landing , we are enabled to organize a vigorous resistance to that difficult operation . From these considerations , it seems evident that if we can seal our harbors against invasion , we make the hazards of attempts on our towns so great as to throw them quite beyond the range of probabilities , and thus procure , as far as may he done , perfect security to our decisive points of defence . To effect this great object , is the proposed end of the system of permanent defences , which has , for the past thirty or forty years , been in slow process of execution . The problem of closing the harbors on our maritime frontier , has been addressed in all its generality ; and careful examinations of our whole extent of coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with special reference to the practical solution of this great question . The result of their deliberations and investigations has been the projection of a system of permanent works , which , when completed , will positively preclude an enemy from entrance to any of our good harbors . The erection of the Individual works composing this system , has been undertaken , as far as practicable , in the order of their importance . The constant study , in their construction , has been to effect the proposed object in the most economical manner consistent with a due regard for those military principles , which must regulate the relation of parts , in order to render the works secure from an assault , or coup-de-main . The necessity of a strict observance of flanking arrangements , which alone can secure a fort from escalade , requires the preservation of a considerable interior space , and positively forbids that reduction in their capacity which some of the uninitiated have thought practicable . We have but one fort which would be considered in Europe as more than of the third magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere , is true enough of the macruitude of our forts , though decidedly false in regard to their other good qualities . The system to which we have alluded will require a long time for its completiomi , yet this event is quite within the range of calculation . The small appropriations annually made for this purpose are gradually effecting it , and Congress may , at pleasure , accelerate within certam limits its rate of progress . When once completed in the manner contem // lated , the entire system may be kept in repair , by a very small annual expenditure . Its total cost can not be determined at present with any great accuracy , as many of the works are not yet planned . But the conjectural estimates of the Engineer Department , made with all the care which circumstances would permit , give the aggregate cost of the whole proposed system , exclusive of those parts constructed up to 1836 , about thirty-one and a half millions of dollars . This expenditure dwindles into nothingness , when compared with the additional loss which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . But its duration will be measured in centuries , if proper attention be paid to its repair , instead of the twelve years cycle , deduced from French naval statistics , as the lifetime of a man-of-war . Hence it is a fair inference that a true economy would dictate the gradual completion of this system , as fast as the means of the general government will permit . It can hardly be doubted , that when this great national work shall be finished , it will constitute a pacific argument fully competent to refute the " ultinsa ratio regum , " thereby powerfully tending to subvert the present bloody system of internation*tl dialectics . The unity of opinion among those who have made a special study of the subject , should silence the doubts of those who question the ability of forts , to close the entrances of our harbors . Obstructions placed in the channels will detain , under their fire , any vessel attempting to pass , sufficiently long to secure her inevitable destruction , whether propelled by wind or steam . Our sea-coast batteries being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost certainty , if properly served , set fire to any wooden ship venturing within their range . If floating defences , specially adapted to harbor operations , be employed as auxiliaries , nothing but our neglect or treachery ca&amp;enable a fleet to run this gauntlet with safety . Such is the decided opinion of those whom careful examination of this subject has best qualified to decide , and as this is mainly a question of facts , all vague , careless scepticism should yield to their matured judgments. * We have thought that the important functions of fortifications and their relations to sea-coast protection , could not better be illustrated than by a brief exposition of their application in the defence of the city and harbor of New York . The importance of placing beyond question the security of this great commercial emporium , would appear to he self-evident ; nor can we suppose that any person would seriously regard this object as too unimportant to justify a great expenditure . Yet , conscious as we are that the city is actually open to the approach of an invading force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brooklyn without disturbance from forts or storms , we confess a degree of surprise at the general apathy on this subject which has prevailed among those most concerned , during the recent agitating state of our foreign relations . it hardly seems to have been thought possible that , in the event of hostilities with England , New York should be in danger of insult . Now , we would not be alarmists , nor are we ambitious to create a sensation , but as we have bestowed a careful examination and some reflection on the facts of the case , we feel justified in stating our deliberate conviction that , in case of war with any great maritime power , New York is in greater danger of being laid under contribution and otherwise insulted , than any other city on our coast , unless its fort *fications are considerably extended . This opinion is based on the fact that an enemy 's inducements for such nit operation against this city is so much greater than it would be for a similar enterprise elsewhere . Could he destroy the Navy-yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stocks , ship materials and dry-docks , this alone would be equivalent to several victories at sea , in its effects on the progress of the war . If he were to add our mercantile marine , collected at the docks , the docks themselves , exactions of heavy contributions , or pillage of private property , he would have done us a greater injury than he could possibly have effected in any other way . The capacity of forts to withstand the battering of fleets , and the inability of fleets to withstand a well-served and sustained fire from forts , have been ably discussed , and fully demonstrated , both by rational considerations and historical facts , in several American papers . See the various official Reports from Col. Totten , our present talented Chief Engineer ; also , a Re ort by Lieutenant Halleck of the Engineers. - Sen . Doc 85 , 28th Congress , 2d . Sess. ; af*o , an article in the Democratic Review , Vol. xiii . No. 66. // This would be Vandalism doubtless , but did the fear of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , great as his inducement for such a course would unquestionably be , its practicability will doubtless he denied . Prudence forbids a detailed statement of the facts which have confirmed us in the opinion that 40,000 or 50,000 men may suddenly be precipitated on the rear of Brooklyn , almost bearing the tidings of their own approach . To check such an enterprise before the apprehended mischief should be completed , would require the full force of our city troops , who could , it is to be feared , only be brought into the field in time to annoy the enemy 's retreat . Certainly , full success could not be promised to such an attempt , but the injury which even its partial success might inflict on us , would be of such magnitude that all chance of such a stroke should absolutely be prevented , by availing ourselves of the facilities which , in the present case , nature has so lavishly besto wed . There are two great water approaches to New York harbor , which must be closed against the entrance of a hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as possible from the city , as by this means we force an army attempting a bold stroke to make a longer land march , thus giving time to oppose his advance and to concentrate in force on his rear . The first position on the East River , in approaching from the Sound , capable of being occupied for this purpose , is Throg 's Point , on which Fort Schoyler is now being erected . This is admirably situated on a sandy spur of the mainland , and when completed , ( which will probably be in about two years , ) will be almost impregnable . This , in connection with a work on Wilkin 's Point , situated just opposite , would render any attempt to force this pass foolhardy in the extreme . The entrance through the Narrows is , in every sense , the most important passage on our coast . It consists of an inner and an outer harbor , connected by the Narrows , a channel of about a mile wide . The inner harbor contains Governor 's , Bedlow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now constructed . But the strong point is at the Narrows , which is capable of being made absolutely impassable by an enemy . On the Long Island shore the present defences are in good condition and possess no inconsiderable strength . On the Sta ten Island shore , though considerable has already been done , much more remains to be accomplished . As this is the key to the defence of New York , delay in completing its efficient occupation with permanent works , is attended with no small danger to our metropolis . The outer harbor is separated from the ocean by Sandy Hook , which is a spur of sand shooting out about five miles from the Jersey shore , across its entrance , and by a bar , with an interior line of shoals and channels , stretching thence to the Long Island shore . It contains a spacious anchorage , by the occupancy of which all ingress or egress of vessels might be prevented and a strict blockade enforced . But by occuping the point of Sandy Hook with a respectable fort , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate shoals , this harbor may also be closed against an enemy , thus rendering the enforcement of a strict blockade impossible ; as a hostile squadron could only maintain a blockading position when favored with calms or western or northern winds . Supposing the water approaches closed as has been indicated , a land descent can only be made by a disembarkation on the Jersey shore , on Long Island or on the northern shore of the Sound . The intersected and marshy nature of the country on the Jersey shore makes an approach to the city from that quarter quite impracticable . To effect a landing on the southern shore of Long Island would , for a similar reason , be impracticable , or at least extremely hazardous , at any point nearerthan twenty miles from the city . Disembarkation on the northern shore would also be removed to about the same distance by the action of Fort Schuyler . But the western section of the island is diversified with hills and villages , which might be most efficiently employed to check the advance of an army ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossing at Throg 's Point , might concentrate on its rear in such strength as to cut off its retreat , unless it be commenced before reaching Brooklyn . A disembarkation on the northern shore of the Sound might be made at about the same distance from the city , and would present even greater difficulties . Westchester Creek , the Bronx , Harlnem river and Harlaem heights would constitute a series of obstacles quite too great to be overcome without enormous force . From this examination it would appear to be within the power of fortifi // cations to place New York beyond all danger from and of attack . The entire expense of such a system as that supposed in this discussion , would doubtless ( judging from the best data to be obtained ) not differ greatly from six millions of dollars ; a sum not more than sufficient for building six ships of the line , and which , when compared with the amount of property to be protected , seems but an insignificant mite . From the general examination of the subject of national defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive organization is not characterized by that efficiency which alone can render it valuable , and that it is the duty of all who wish the great blessings of peace and who would preserve the escutcheon of our country*s fame untarnished , to bestow their earnest , honest and persevering endeavors towards effecting that timely preparation for hostilities which will render us respected in peace , secure and victorious in war.
