txt TRUL religion consists in the love and service of the true God . By the angels who have not sinned , the true God may be approached direetly , without the intervention of a Mediator . But it is not so with men . Our entire race have revolted from God , and become the objects of his just displeasure ; and we can have audience and acceptance with him , and come into a situation to receive his blessing , only on the ground of the Gospel . To us , therefore , the true religion is the religion of the Gospel . And as this is the only religion for man , so it is the only source of virtue and happiness . Without the religion of the Gospel , founded in the blood of Christ and applied by the influence of the Holy Spirit , man , in no situation , under no circumstances , neither in this world nor in any other , can rise to his proper dignity and glory , and be truly and permanently happy . As much as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we should have reason to believe him , even if we had no other evidence . For does not God know ? And would he knowingly deceive us , in a con VOL . VI . 65 cernof so much importance ? In this instance , however , God has not shut up his people to his simple word ; but in the entire history of the world , for almost six thousand years , has been illustrating before their eyes the sole sufticiency of Christ and his Gospel , as a ground of happiness for man . All history , indeed , whether ecclesiastical or civil , sacred or profane , is but a continued practical illustration of this great truth . To make the illustration the more perfect , so as to cut men off from every other dependence , and lead them to trust in Christ alone , God , has been pleased to try  --  or rather to permit  --  a great variety of experiments ,  --  and such experiments as , to sinful men , might seem the most hopeful ,  --  just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that , if they would be happy , they must come to Christ and receive the Gospel . One of the first of these experiments was that of a long probation . It might have been said , if the experiment had not been tried and failed , that nothing more was ne* // cessary , in order to the improvement and happiness of men , than that they should live a long time in the world . Only give them a suflicient probation , a long space for repentance , time enough in which to grow wise and good , and the great object of life will certainly be secured . They must , at length , be weary of sin , and weaned from it , and become universally holy and happy . But this pretence , however plausible it may have appeared once , can not be offered now . rphe experiment has been tried , and has signally failed . In the first ages of the world , God favored mankind with a long probaiion . He protracted their lives to the period of almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all reason , in which to become happy here , and prepare for happiness hereafter . And what was the consequence of this long probation ? Did men become universally wise and good ? Was the earth filled with holiness and happiness ? Or has not the pen of inspiration , which has recorded little else respecting those early times , faithfully recorded this ; that " the wickedness of man was then great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil , and that continually ? " " The earth , " we are told , " was corrupt before God ; " it " was filled with violence ; " and nothing remained bat that , in awful judgment , it must be destroyed . The floods of the Almighty must be rolled over it , to purge it of its heaven-daring impiety , and wash out the traces of its pollution . Another experiment of those early times was that of separating men one from another , and scattering them abroad on the face of the earth . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah , ( as it has been by some of his later descendants , ) that there was no inherent corruption in men ; that their wickedness was the result of bad influences and example ; and that if they were only separated , the virtuous from the vicious , the precious from the vile , a portion of them , at least , would escape contamination , and be able to preserve themselves pure . And so God was pleased to put this opinion to the test . He did early separate his wayward and rebellious creatures . He confounded their language , and scattered them abroad on the face of the earthSome settled in India , some in Egypt , some in Canaan , some in the wild regions of the north , and some in the Grecian isles ; and from these primeval nurseries of men , the race rapidly diffused itself , till it is found in every corner of the earth . There is not a sea or ocean , which restless man has not traversed . There is not a continent or island , mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where his habitations are not seen . Surely , if scatteriig mankind was likely to reform them , they ought long ago to have been thoroughly reformed . They ought ere this to have become universally wise and good . What then have they become ? What has been the result of this general diffusion ? Where is the colony or tribe that has so elevated itself , as to disprove its descent from a fallen father ,  --  or as to contradict the asseveration of heaven , that we are all " by nature children of wrath ? " The experiment has been a long one , and the issue of it is plain and unanswerable . Wherever on the face of the earth man is found , he is found corrupt . Wherever he exists , he is naturally the same sordid , selfish being . To whatever quarter of the earth the eye of the Omniscient may be directed , he must say of men now , as he did in ancient times , " They are all gone aside ; they are together become filthy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They all alike need the Gospel ; need it now as much as ever ; and must be elevated , sanctified , and saved by it , or not at all . // A third experiment which God has permitted to be tried , is that of other and idolatrous religions . But for this experiment , it might have been said , that to shut men up to a single religion ,  --  a single method of worshiping God and securing his favor , would he exclusive and illiberal. rrhe religious principle in man must be allowed to develope itself more freely . The invisible God is too spiritual , too intangible , to he made the object of universal worship . The creatures of sense , we need something palpable to the senses . The great lights of heaven ,  --  the sun , the moon , and stars ,  - -  images of curious workmanship , the symbols , the representatives of an indwelling divinity-let these be the objects of worship , at least to uncultivated minds , and they will undoubtedly be more devout , more religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates of idol worship ; and thus might we have reasoned , had not the experiment been fairly tried . But it has been tried . It has been tried on a large scale , and for a long time . Men have worshiped the sun , moon , and stars . They have worshiped idols which their own hands have made . They have worshiped birds , beasts , and creeping things . But instead of becoming more religious and happy , they have been uniformly and dreadfully degraded by such worship . They have been depraved and corrupted under its influence . They have sunk down from one degree of debasement to another , till they have lost , in great measure , the attributes of humanity , and become almost like the brutes themselves . We may not pretend to fathom all the designs of heaven , in permitting the long and terrible reign of idolatry in the earth . But this , undoubtedly , was among these designs ; to convince men , by actual experiment , as to the nature and tendency of all such impious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ground of peace . Still another experiment which has been tried , in the fruitless search after happiness , is that of learning , philosophy , and the arts . It might have been said , but for this experiment , that it is only necessary to our highest welfare to improve the understanding and the taste . Let the mind be cultivated and enlightened . Let its thoughts be elevated and enlarged . Let it be enriched with oriental wisdom , and liberalized and refined by literary pursuits . Let the secrets of nature be investigated , and the arts be carried to the highest perfection . By such means , surely , the heart will be softened , the character improved , and a foundation of virtue and happiness will be laid . Thus reasoned the votaries of mere learning thousands of years ago ; and thus they reason now . And far be it from us to say that there is nothing plausible in such reasonings . To inform and improve the understanding , to refine and cultivate the taste , to advance in all useful knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it , of itself , and of necessity , improve the character ? Does it raise the thoughts and the heart to God ? Does it subdue the power and secure the pardon of sin , and thus open a fountain of holy , spiritual , and enduring enjoyment ? The experiment has been often tried ,  - -  tried in different ages , and under various circumstances ; and we hesitate not to say that it has always failed . Some of the most learned men in the ancient world were some of the basest men . And the times when the lamp of learning shone brightest in Greece and Rome , were times of the greatest corruption and wickedness . In the days of iEschines and Demosthenes , the Grecian states had become so corrupt , that they were no longer // capable of governing themselves . And long before learning was advanced to its highest perfection at Rome , the stern virtues of the earlier Roman character , and with them the republic itself , had disappeared . The most elegant literature , and the most atrocious wicked ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ancient world ; and that of the modern European world has been the same . Else , why has France been proverbially denominated , " the land of science and of sin ? " And why has plodding , delving , literary Germany produced such hordes of infidels ? The truth is , mere intellectual culture , however important on other accounts , has no necessary tendency to improve the heart . So far from this , it rather enables its possessor to sin with a more ruinous influence , and a bolder hand . And all this has been illustrated by a thousand experiments , under different forms , and at different periods of the world . A fifth experiment which God has permitted to be tried , in the search after happiness , is that of civil government ,  --  di/ferent forms of government ,  --  governments great , and rich , and powerful . Civil government is an institution of God , intended for our well being in the present life . it was never designed to be an ultimate source of happiness , either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly , have been led thus to regard it . And so God has permitted them to try the experiment . it has been tried under a variety of forms ; under every form , indeed , which human ingenu ity can invent . There has been the patriarchal form of government , and the monarchical . There have been aristocracies and democracies , oligarchies and republics . There have been governments absolute and limited , pure and mixed . Nations great and powerful h ' * ye risen up , one af . Zer another , and pread themselves over the face of the earth ,  --  the Babylonian , the Persian , the Grecian , the Roman ; they have been splendid in affluence , and terrible in power , devouring , breaking in pieces , and stamping the residue with their feet . But have they promoted general happiness , or have they obstructed it ? Have they given it , or taken it away ? The experiment has been often tried ; and the pen of history has recorded the result . in a great majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arbitrary , tyrannical , oppressive ; plundering what they ought to have protected , and rendering life itself more a burden than a blessing . They have involved their subjects in cruel and almost perpetual wars , bathing the earth with blood , and filling it with the slain . It is mournful to look back on the experiment we are now considering , and see how an institution of God , which was intended for a blessing , has been perverted into a curse . Nor has the perversion been confined to any particular forms of government . Free governments and despotic have been alike ambitious , grasping , and oppressive ; thus prov. ing , conclusively , that it is vain to look to governments alone to make man happy . Another experiment which God has permitted to be tried , is that of leaving men , without learning or arts , without any settled forms of religion and government , to live as it is called in the state of nature . Infidels and enthusiasts have long been crying down what they term the artificial modes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only let civil government be abolished , and the right of property be taken away ; let learning and the arts be forgotten , and man be permitted to roam the common earth in his native liberty , subsisting by the chase , and on the spontaneous productions of the fields and woods ; and then he will // be happy . Men in our own time , who reason in this way , do not consider how long , and how often , this same experiment has been tried . It was this state of nature , probably , which filled the antediluvian world with violence , and provoked the Almighty to come out in wrath against it , and destroy it . It was the attempt to live after the same manner , which led to the earliest op. pressions after the deluge . Nimrod was " a mighty hunter , " subsisting by the chase , and living after the course of nature ; and he seems to have been , for the time , the great oppressor and corrupter of the world . And from that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the state of nature , we invariably find him a cruel , ignorant savage . XVe find him but little bet . ter than a brute . Murderous wars , unbridled licentiousness , the i m molation of human victims , slavery , cannibalism , exposures of all kinds , and in frequent instances death by starvation or suicide ,  --  these are some of the continual , woful attend . ants of what is cried up to us as the state of nature . Let our modern advocates for such a state go and spend a few years with the savages in the interior of Africa , or in the fastnesses of New Zealand or New Holland , or in the deep recesses of our western woods , and the experinient , should they survive it , may perhaps cure them of their mania , and convince them that it is vain to look to the state of nature as a source of happiness . Still another experiment which God was pleased to try in ancient times , and which seemed to promise most of all , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and organizing them as a community by themselves . Possibly this experiment began to be tried before the flood ; for we read , in that age , of " the sons of God , " as distinct from " the daughters of men . " After the deluge , the ex periment was entered upon more effectually . When idolatry had begun to prevail extensively , and the knowledge of the true religion was likely to be lost , God called Abraham out of the land of his fathers , and brought him into Canaan , and instituted a church in his family , of which he was to be the visible head . He took this church into solemn covenant with himself ; gave it new revelations , rites , and ordinances ; and separated its members from the world around , that they might be a holy people unto the Lord . These transactions on the part of God were of solemn interest , and of the utmost importance to the world . Considered as a means of revealing the Savior to come , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of drawing and binding sinful men to him , the only foundation of the sinner 's hope , too much importance can not be attached to the church in the family of Abraham . But the members of this church came ere long to regard it , not as a means , but an end ; not as a help to bring them upon the right foundation , and keep them there , but as itself the foundation . They came to trust to it , and to the privileges connected with it , as a ground of hope . " The temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , are these . " And now it became necessary for God to show them , by actual experiment , that they were trusting to a broken reed . Their church gradually became corrupt . It became so corrupt , that after repeated and long continued reproofs and corrections , after reforms and relapses , revivings and backslidings ; the patience of God was exhausted with it , and the great body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were cut off and cast off for their unbelief ; their holy city and temple were demolished ; and all those things in which they vainly trusted and gloried were taken forever away . // All other experiments having been tried , and failed , the way was prepared , in the providence of God , for the grand source of light and hope to the world to be more fully exhibited . The true and only foundation , which had so long been typified and promised , was now to be laid . The great Son of God made his appearance in our flesh ; he dwelt here on the earth a course of years ; and having done and suffered all that had been written of him , he laid down his life a ransom for sinners . By his sufferings and blood he made a full and sufficient atonement for men ; he laid a firm foundation of hope ; and now all are invited to come and build upon it , and partake the provisions of his grace . " I-Jo , every one that thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The spirit and the bride say , come ; and let him that heareth say , come ; and let him that is athirst , come ; and whosoever will , let him take the water of life freely . " When the invitations were first sounded forth , and set borne by the power of the Holy Spirit , great multitudes at once embraced them . They came and builded on the sure foundation , and found life and peace . The word of the Lord had free course and was glorified . The church of Christ was rapidly increased , and the gospel of salvation was soon published throughout the greater part of the then civilized world . When the corner stone of Zion bad thus been laid , and men in such numbers had builded upon it , and found peace to their souls , it might have seemed that it could never be forsaken . The experience of past ages had shown the vanity of every other foundation ; present experience was teaching the blessedness of this ; and why should men any more stray away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves cisterns that could hold no water ? Why should not all come together to the feet of Christ , and learn experimentally the blessedness of those whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are cov-ered ? Such may have been the reasonings of the recent converts , in that primitive , prosperous age of the church . Such may have been the expectations at that period indulged . It might have seemed as though the wanderings of restless man were over , and as though ,  --  the great source of light and hope being found ,  --  it would be forsaken no more forever . But man 's inveterate opposition to Christ and his gospel had not yet been fully exhibited . He had not yet ceased to pursue happiness where it never could be found , and in the search for it , to try experiments , and seek out inventions . The vain experiments which have been permitted and tried since the coming of Christ , and ( what is stranger than all ) within the pale of his own church , remain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rites and forms . The Christian rites , as instituted by our Savior and practiced by his apostles , are few , simple , and highly appropriate . They significantly set forth some of the more important truths or facts of the gospel , and seal and bind upon those who receive them , the obligations of the covenant of grace . But the apostles had not been long dead , when a disposition began to show itself to increase the ritual of our religion , and render it more acceptable to Jews and Pagans , by the addition of new ceremonies . And this course of things went steadily on , until both the nature and form of Christianity were entirely changed . Baptism soon came to be regarded as regeneration . It was that which cleansed the soul from sin . A rite of such momentous import must , of course , be preceded by a long process of preparatory observances . It must be administered // only on the great festival occasions , and under circumstances of profound secrecy and mystery . It must be followed , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign of the cross ; the anointing with holy oil ; the white robe , as a symbol of imparted purity ; the crown of garlands , in token of victory ; and the administration of milk and honey , to show that the subject of it had become spiritually a babe . At the same time , or a little later , the Lord 's Supper began to lose its commemorative character , and to be represented as a literal sacrifice of Christ . The elements , after consecration , were believed to be changed into his body and blood ; of course , the administration of this ordinance became a scene of awful interest . The transmuted elements were reverently worshiped ; they were trusted tu as Christ ; and the deluded votary , when he had received them , verily believed that he had received the Lord Jesus . And not only were the primitive sacraments of the New Testament obscured and perverted by superstitious rites , but new sacraments were invented , and new rites added , borrowed mostly from the Jewish and heathen temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form of Christianity were changed , and the whole converted into another kind of religion , and another foundation of hope . The experiment of rites and forms was now complete , and the results of it were soon visible . It was found that the spirituality , the vitality of what was called the Christian religion was gone . It was no longer a pure fountain of living waters ; an unfailing source of happiness to man . Its professors could no longer say with Paul : " Being justified by faith , we have peace with God , through our Lord Jesus Christ . " The influence of the perverted system was rather to corrupt , than to purify ; rather to perplex and distress the anxious soul , than to fill it with light , and love , and joy . The next experiment of the church , in its departure from Christ , was that of strengthening its form of government . The original form of church government was confessedly of a free , republican character . In the language of Waddington , an Episcopalian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was essentially independent of every other . The churches , thus constituted , formed a sort of federative body of independent religious communities , dispersed through the greater part of the lioman empire , in continual communication and in constant harmony with each other . " Such was the form of church government , which the apostles , under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , bequeathed to the churehes . And this form of government was continued to them , during the period of their earliest and greatest prosperity . But as the life of religion began to decline , and a spirit of ambition and worldliness came to be exhibited , more especially in the higher ranks of the clergy , a desire was felt that the government of the church should be modified and strengthene d , soas to place more power in the hands of its officers . And now there began to be a marked distinction between the bishop and the presbyter . And above the bishops , there soon came to be archbishops , metropolitans , exarchs , and patriarchs . And above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great variety of inferior officers were also created , of which we hear nothing in the Scriptures , and for which there was no necessity , except in the pride of their superiors . Meanwhile , the individual churches were merged in great confederated communities , and their rights , liberties , and independence were swallowed up . This course of things went on , till more than half the churches in Christendom were united in one stupendous // hierarchy , over which presided , or rather reigned , the proud Bishop of Rome . And what was the result of this grand experiment ? Were the clergy more learned , holy , spiritual , faithful , as they rose in power ? And were the churches better instructed , and better governed ? XVere they quickened and edified , and " walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the I-Ioly Ghost , " were their numbers multiplied ? No , but the very opposite of all this was the result . Phe clergy became worldly , aspiring , domineering , contentious . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent in wisdom , in grace , and in spiritual gifts , but who should be the greatest . Phe people were instructed , not in the holy truths and precepts of the gospel , but in the rites and forms ,  --  the added ceremonies and superstitions of the church . Knowledge , of course , decayed ; piety languished ; while ignorance , error , and every form of corruption and wickedness prevailed . Such was the recorded result of the experiment now under consideration , showing that inventions and additions in the government of the church are no substitute for the light and influence of the gospel . A third experiment tried in the church , in search of some other foundation of virtue and happiness aside from the gospel , was that of rnonachism . A considerable portion of the church , as early as the third and fourth centuries , worn out with persecutions , and tired of the corruptions prevailing in th eworld , determined to abandon it forever . They heard a voice crying to them : " Come out from the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the literal sense . They retired , therefore , into deserts and solitary places , subsisting upon the barest necessaries of life , and gave themselves up to indolence , seclusion , and contemplation . These hordes of monastics were , after a time , formed into communities , and rules were given for their observance ; rules which , it was believed , would prevent all disorders , and render the subjects of them holy and happy . This experiment was tried under different forms , and by vast multitudes of human beings , for a long course of years . Indeed , in some of its forms , it has continued to the present time . And what ha* been the almost invariable result of it ? Has monkery secured to those who have practiced virtue and happiness ? Has it been to them a source of peace ? So far from this , in almost every case , it has proved a source of intolerable corruption . We would not say that there have been no pious monks . We would not say that the seclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the promotion of piety . But this the voice of history constrains us to say , that the monastic establishments generally , have been the very hot-beds of vice , where corruption and wickedness , in their basest forms , have luxuriated . In some periods of the church , the monks have been among the vilest and most troublesome of men , the abhorrence of both kings and priests , and nuisances to the common people . Averse to the method of salvation by Christ , men have tried the experiment , at different times , of adulteration and perversion ; of adding something to the pure gospel , or of taking something away . Some new principle must be introduced , the better to solve a mystery , or explain a fact . Or some new observance or penance must he added , to render the foundation of hope the more secure . Or the morality of the gospel has been thought too severe , or too lax , and the standard must be made higher or lower , must be raised or depressed , to suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , has often thrust herself // in , with her little rush light , to illumine the darkness of the sun , and make clear and palpable what the Bible had left obscure . It would be endless to refer to all the experiments of this kind which , during the last eighteen hundred years , have been successively tried in the church . But the issue , in all cases , has been much the same . The gospel has been perverted and corrupted , and the power of it has been turned away . The great source of light and hope has been removed , and a shadow has been substituted in its place . And it has mattered little as to the result , whether the adulteration took the form of an addition , or a subtraction . Those who have thought the standard of the gospel too low , and have wished to raise it , and those who have thought it too high , and have labored to depress it , have usually come together , in a little time . The extremes have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delusion , corruption , and wickedness . To make the experiment of departing from Christ appear the more hopeful , it has sometimes been introduced under the name and form of a reformation . A real reformation , if put in the place of Christ , and trusted to as a foundation of hope , will soon prove itself to be but a broken reed . This was painfully illustrated in the case of the Reformation of the sixteenth century . Many of the reformed churches , when once they had escaped from the iron grasp of Popery , and found themselves out of the reach of their enemies , began to feel as though they had passed all dangers . Backsliding , degeneracy , errors in doctrine , and corruptions in practice , were scarcely feared ; because they were regarded as scarcely possible . Christians trusted to the Reformation , and to its attendant blessingstheir settled peace and their legal establishment  --  to secure them from all future ills , and make them happy . And what was the consequence ? A sad degeneracy ere long took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in less than two centuries , they needed another reformation to place them back upon the ground of the early reformers . But most of the alleged reformations in the church of Christ have not been real . They have been the work of furious and half-crazed fanatics , or of dreamy mystics , who , in the effort to improve upon the work of the Savior , have perverted and polluted all that their hands have touched . Such was the pretended reformation under Montanus , in the second century ; and that under Manes , in the third ; both of whom professed to be the promised Comforter from heaven , and to have a commission to reform the religion of Christ . Such , too , was the reformation attempted by the fanatics in the sixteenth century , who denounced Luther as not worthy the name of a reformer , and undertook to carry forward his half-way measures to perfection . And such , it may be feared , are not a few of the misnamed reformations of the present day . No movement of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually sets aside the gospel ,  --  which professes to improve upon it , to go beyond it , or to proceed without it , can long prosper . It is sure to terminate in corruption and defeat , and to involve its abettors , sooner or later , in shame and ruin . Were we to speak of other experiments which have been tried in the church of Christ , we should notice those growing out of a carnal , worldly policy . There have been those in past ages-there are some such now-who , not content with promoting a holy , spiritual cause , by holy and spiritual means , have been inclined to resort to other measures . Some have used flattery , and some force . Motives of self-interest or // ambition have been employed , and a worldly expediency has been substituted in place of duty . With a view to the more rapid increase of numbers , some have been willing to conceal or soften the more offensive points of the gospel ; to lower its high and uncompromising claims ; or to throw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savior supposed would be consistent with its safety . But facts have long ago demonstrated that all such expedients are a great deal worse than fruitless . They are positively sinful , corrupting and dangerous . They draw away the church from Christ , and place it on another foundation and the first storm that blows is sufficient to show that this new foundation is all sand . The foregoing discussion is intended to teach us , and to impress upon us , several lessons . And , first , the connexion of God 's great work of providence , as recorded , in part , on the page of history , with his greater work of redemption , as unfolded in the gospel . To the casual observer of providence  --  to the ordinary reader of this world 's history , the whole appears like a chaos of incidents , no thread , no system , no line ofconnexion running through it . One course of events is seen here , and another there . Some nations become civilized and refined , while others are left to their native barbarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and become great and powerful , and then pass away and are forgotten . And the history of the church seems scarcely less a chaos , than that of the world . Changes are continually going on within it , and around it , and these , apparently , without much order . New doctrines or measures are introduced , and then laid aside . Heresies make their appearance , and have their advocates , and after a while are refuted , and die away . Now the church is protected , and now persecuted . There are reviv ings and backslidings ; seasons of light and hope , and then of darkness . Such , we say , is the appearance to the casual observer of providence , and to the ordinary , though it may be extensive , reader of history . But the intelligent Christian , with his Bible open before him , and his heart warmed with the great subject of redemption , studies the book of providence , and reads history , with other eyes . He learns from his Bible , that as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for him ; that " he is head over all things to the church ; " and that he overrules all things in providence , with a view to the great purposes of redemption . In the Bible , redemption is presented as the great work of God ; that which was performed at the greatest expense to himself ; that which is best calculated to show forth his glory . The creation of this world was but a scaffolding , on which the greater work of redemption was to be performed ; and the entire work of providence in respect to this world  --  the changes and revolutions which take place among me rise and fall of states and empires ,  - -  these all are in some way connected with , and subsidiary to , the great purposes of redeeming mercy . Having gained these important intimations from the Bible , the Christian student now looks out upon the world , and back upon the wide field of its history ; and what before seemed so chaotic and disordered , puts on the appearance of system and form . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unity of object is discovered ; and redemption is seen to be the central point , towards which every thing tends , and for which all exist . In the death of his beloved Son , God has opened a way of life and salvation for ruined man . He has laid a foundation of hope for the world . It is a sure foundation ; it is the only foundation . And this point God is continually and variously illustrating // in his providence . The foregoing remarks teach us how he illustrates it . It is by an endless succession of experiments . God is showing his creatures , not only in his word , but by the events of his providence , - by actual and oft repeated experiments , taking place before their eyes , that the gospel is the only source of real blessing to them , and that if they would be happy , they must put their trust in Christ alone . Some of these experiments we have already considered ; and the making of them , and of others like them , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of the church and world . The entire history of the past is little more than a history of these various experiments , all standing connected with the great subject of redemption , and all calculated And intended-if men could but see it  --  to call them back from the vain search after happiness , and bring them to trust in Christ alone . President Edwards commenced an extended history of the church , and entitled it " A History of Redemption . " In a more enlarged sense , the same title might be given to a full history of the world . It is all a history of redemption . Not that every thing which has taken place on earth has been of a directly religious character ; far from it . But every thing has stood connected , in some way , with redemption . Every thing has had a bearing on this mighty subject . Even in those parts of the earth where Christ is not named , and his religion is not knowt* , the providence of God has been silently , secretly at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An experiment has been going on there , which is already of great value to the church and world , showing the hopeless misery of departing from God , and losing the knowledge of his salvation . It is in its connexion with redemption , that we must come to look at the history of the world , if we would regard it as God does , or if we would be greatly interested and instructed by it . The second lesson which the subject is fitted to impress upon us , is the importance of that first principle of Protestantism ,  --  the Bible the only rule of faith and practice . This implies , that when the canon of Scripture is once settled , and the meaning of it ascertained , there be no more questions asked respecting it . We are to rest in the decisions of God 's holy word ,  --  desiring neither to rise above it , nor to fall below it ; neither to add to it , nor take from it . The great Protestant principle as to the sufficiency of Scripture has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of persons . It has been violated by Tractarians , Romanists , and all those other sects , who would connect with the Bible , and receive as a part of their rule of faith , the traditions of the elders , and canons of the church . It has been violated by fanatics , mystics , and impostors , who have made pretences to inspiration , and have substituted their own dreams and fancies in place of the revelations of God . It has been violated by liberalists of various names , who , dissatisfied with much that the Bible contains , have undertaken , by dint of criticism and false interpretation , to cut it down , or explain it away , till nothing is left which offends the proud and selfish heart . But in whatever direction , or by whatever means , the great principle before us has been invaded , the fiood.gates of corruption have been invariably opened , through which streams of error and wickedness have poured , to desolate the vineyard of the Lord . Nearly all those vain and wicked experiments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and in the making of which the church has been corrupted and wasted , have come in upon it in this way . They could // have come in no other . If the Bible had been uniformly and consistently adhered to , as the only rule of faith and practice , those long ages of delusion and darkness , so painful to the eye and the heart of benevolence , had never been . The church had been comparatively pure , and the world had been blessed . But the great lesson which this subject is fitted to teach and impress , is that with which the discussion commenced . The Gospel the grand remedy for human woes , and the only source of real blessing to the world . " Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ . " Of all lessons , divine or human , this is infinitely the most important to be learned . It is the lesson which , of all others , God has been at the most pains to teach us . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most averse . We turn every way , before we come to Christ . We try every other foundation , before we consent to build upon Christ alone . The world 's history is filled up with vain and fruitless experiments , in the search after happiness ; nor is the heart of restless man weaned from them even now . He is as much inclined as ever to forsake the fountain of living waters , and hew out for himself cisterns which can hold no water . How long is this miserable course of things to continue ? When shall it have an end ? Is it not time , even now , that we commence learning the lessons of heavenly wisdom Is it not time that we listen to the voice of our Heavenly Father , crying to us , not only from the pages of his word , but from every leaf and line of the great hook of his providence , and saying : l'iTon* hut Christ . Nothing but Christ . Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
