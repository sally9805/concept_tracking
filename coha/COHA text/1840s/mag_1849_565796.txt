txt No small portion of the field of Home Missionary labor is in New England , and in others of those older states which are best supplied with religious institutions . Many an old parish is weakened rather than strengthened by the growing up of a manufacturing village at the distance of some three or four miles from the old place of worship . The new village must be provided with a church and with a pastor , or it will become a center of pernicious influences . Thus , for a few years at least , a decaying agricultural parish on the one hand , and , on the other , a young church and society , in the midst of an unsettled and changeable population , and struggling against the tendencies to sectarianism and to infidelity , which are at work all around it ,  --  are both dependent in some degree on the aid of the Home Missionary Society . After a while , the ideas and habits of the people , the modes of agriculture , and all the investments of capital , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old meeting-house has been repaired and beautified , or perhaps some more commodious and attractive edifice has taken its place ; and though the spot has lost something of its importance as a center , the congregation finds itself well able-perhaps better able than before  --  to support the expenses of public worship and religious instruction without any burdensome sacrifice . The new village is ho longer made up of transient operatives , living at board , and with no interest in its character and welfare ; it has its permanent and prosperous households , whose dearest interests , both secular and spiritual , are dependent on the moral influences that give character to the place . But while these changes are in progress-while the old order of things is passing away , and the new order of things is getting itself established-there is a season of hazard and danger ; and the far-sighted patriotic Christian zeal which is gathering churches and establishing pastoral ministrations beyond the Mississippi and on the shore of the Pacific , is compelled to exert itself lest the powers of darkness obtain dominion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two centuries ago , and which has been hallowed by their graves . To one who , with a thoughtful mind , observes how constantly new villages are created in these eastern states , by the application of associated capital to all sorts of manufacturing industry , it can not but occur that the men who own and control the capital by // which these villages are called into existence , are the depositaries of a power which affects , widely and permanently , the welfare of their fellow men . The proprietors of that capital , and especially the directors and agents by whom it is controlled , are obviously acting under a responsibility to God of which they are not always aware . Too often it is taken for granted that the whole duty of capitalists , and especially of corporations , to the population of the villages which rise into existence at their call and in conformity with their arrangements , begins and ends with the fair payment of fair wages . Here then , if we mistake not , is a large chapter of Moral Philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject in this connexion as a subject in which all our readers have an interest . It will hardly be expected of us that we shall do full justice to such a subject within the limits of a few pages . It will be enough for us , at present , if we can bring the subject distinctly to the attention of thoughtful minds . Let the moral sense of the people take cognizance of such a subject as this , and in due time , it will pronounce a just decision and one that must be respected . What have manufacturing corporations to do with the character and the social and moral well-being of the manufacturing villages which they create ? Here on the one hand are the proprietors of capital , and generally of capital associated in large masses under a legislative incorporation . Here on the other hand a village is coming into existence in consequence of the employment of this capital  --  a compact settlement of workshops and dwellings* in which successive generations of human beings , connected by all domestic ties , and by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor-will enjoy and suffer-will act upon each other , and be acted upon , by all the influences that constitute or control the common life of the community-will die and pass to their account . What responsibilities are involved in the relation between the one and the other ? Let it be considered under what circumstances the inhabitants of a new manufacturing village are brought together . They are almost always persons who have no accumulated capital , and whose earnings are barely sufficient to provide them from one year 's end to another with the means of living . If indeed , by economical management , some of them may lay up a little for a day of need , and if all of them may be extremely comfortable , real poverty being unknown except in protracted sickness , still they are not by any means able , of themselves , to make that provision for the wants of their intellectual and religious natures , which ought to exist in the institutions and local influences of every community . They can not build churches and schools , nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // 242 Manufacturing Corporations supply themselves with comfortable houses , or even to lay out their village in a tasteful or ornamental manner . All these things , necessary to their intellectual and moral welfare , and necessary to all the welfare of the community which is there beginning to exist , must be provided for them from without , or not provided at all . Past generations have bequeathed to the present a rich legacy of invested capital , in all the places settled by the natural gatherings of population . Churches and schools and dwellings are built , roads are opened , public grounds are provided ;  --  the present is started upon the career of advancement , with the accumulations which it has inherited from the past . But in the process by which New England is so rapidly becoming more and more a manufacturing country , the proprietors of capital are bringing together masses of people in places entirely barren of all these advantages . In the most desolate and rocky situation , avoided by all human beings since the settling of the Pilgrims as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blasted trees , there is a water-fall . Taking its stand here , the genius of our age calls into almost instantaneous life a bustling village . Here factories are erected in this barren waste , and suddenly a large population is gathered . For this population every thing necessary to the social state is to be created . The past contributes nothing . Now , where lies the responsibility of providing for the community thus beginning to be formed , the essentials to human welfare ? Who is bound to do it ? The individuals of such a populationthe operatives , not yet domiciliated on the spot , nor knit to each other and to the locality by the ties which constitute society-are not able to do it for themselves . Does it not then follow that the associated proprietors of the capital which has called these persons together , should aid in providing the institutions and influences essential to their well being , and in starting them upon the career of m*ntal and moral improvement ? Does no obligation to this effect devolve upon a man or body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises which involve the creation of a village , assume the responsibility of calling together a mass of people , away from all the privileges which established society affords ? Will not God hold to an account those who thus cause a human community , with all of destiny which is involved ? in its existence , to spring up for their profit and advantage ? It should be distinctly remembered that in these manufacturing villages , the corporations for a long term of years have the only permanent interest . The operatives and overseers are only sojourners . They go and come at the bidding of the companies . If a man has ever so much public spirit , he is not at home there ; he is liable to lose his situation in a month , and to be turned adrift to find employment elsewhere . Not a man employed in the factories expects to live and die in the village . Not a man regards it as his // permanent residence . This must always be the case for a term of years , if the village is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few farmers in the neighborhood , who naturally belong to the new community , this gives an element of stability ; but it would be very unjust to throw upon them the responsibility of providing for the new population , which comes not at their bidding . For the new value given to their farms , and the greater nearness of their markets , they should be willing to pay their increased taxes , and they are bound to assist according to their ability ; but their peculiar responsibility evidently ceases here . Among those who are employed by the corporations , it will take years to develop any permanent interest in the place . When they shall have been in their situations long en ougli to consider themselves fastened there , they will begin to have a home feeling , but not before . Wherever , then , the incorporated proprietors by the very tenor of their engagements with those whom they employ , exclude this permanent interest from the employed , how undeniable is it that the necessities of 9the social state should be in a great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . The village is theirs , and as it is theirs , they are bound under God to make it all that a village should be . They are as much botind to take care of its moral , intellectual and religious welfare , as the citizens of any of our towns are bound to care for the well being of the community in which they are proprietors and lords . If the village which is under their control , and in which they only have any permanent interest , grows up with a malaria of degrading and demoralizing influences hanging over its population , God will hold them resl ) onsible . We are aware with what facility the sense of this responsibility may be evaded by the proprietors . Those employed , it may be said , come for definite wages , and can easily understand the situation of the place ; and therefore when they come , they come on their own responsibility . But this argument will not answer . The individual doubtless is responsible for going to such a place , but this does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . An argument like this would vindicate the keeper of the dram shop or gambling house . Those who resort to such places know what they are doing . But the questioh is deeper : ought you to make such a place for them to resort to ? A man i*might almost as well send his children to dram shops and gambling houses as into some neglected manufacturing villages . The relation , then , of such corporations to their villages , is essentially parental . It is as much so as the relation of master and apprentice . God has placed in the parent 's care children who are unable to take care of themselves . And because God has thus placed them , parents are bound to take care of them , and to educate them in all good morals and sound principles . // He holds them to the obligations of this relation ; nor can they escape if they would . So with the relation of master and apprentice . A youth is placed under an experienced business man , to be educated in his trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in his . character . The master is obviously bound by imperative duty to guard the morals of the apprentice . He is invested , for a time , with parental responsibilities . Should he neglect to provide for that boy 's intellectual and moral wants , he fails essentially in the discharge of his obligations . So with the relation now in question . The manufacturing corporation draws together , in unfavorable circumstances , those who in their new position are unable to provide for the wants of an unformed community , and who , being without the means of improvement and religious culture , can not be expected to make the arrangements necessary for the supply of such a deficiency . The capitalists are the parents of the village ; they have called it into being , and they are responsible for its character , as truly as the parent for the character of his children . A ma*iufacturing village needs for the formation of its character , all the means of improvement , moral and religious , which are needed by other villages . The transient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the village , nor can they supply it with these means of improvement ; the proprietors , therefore  --  the parents of the village-ought to do so . In other places , the population being permanent , and the property being theirs , the responsibility is divided among them ; but in these villages , the property and the permanent interest being in the hands of the corporations , the burthen of all this duty lies upon them . We may put this matter perhaps in a clearer light by a few plain questions . Can a village be suffered to grow up in vice and immorality , deprived of the many checks to evil and incitements to good which are essential to the character of a civilized and Christian community , while there is no responsibility in the matter ? Where then shall this responsibility rest , except upon those who create the village , and who have ample power to aid it into the possession of all that is desirable and necessary ? Where , when they who have created the village have the , only permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their contract with those whom they employ , they deny to the villagers the idea of a home ? Is a parent responsible for his children 's training ,  - -  and are not corporations responsible for their villages , which are their children ? Can the members of a corporation , caring for nothing but their dividends , create a Sodom in the midst of New England , and not find themselves arraigned at last for such a deed at God 's tribunal ? Are there no moral obligations connected with the control of accumulated capital ? And can any man , or company of men , exercise that control to build up a // village characterized by intellectual and moral degradation , and not violate the great moral laws of God ? Perhaps it may be suggested from some quarter that corporation charters give no power to the body corporate to perform these high moral duties ; that by the terms of the charter the corporation is confined to a specific business , and that it has no power to do any thing else . Thus the attempt may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have known this argument to be used for such a purpose . But we doubt very much , whether the highest courts of law would decide , that a charter which defines only the business duties of a corporation , takes away from it the power of performing its moral duties . The high principles of the common law , would come in here , and decide that , as in the case of a man , so also in that of a body of men united in a corporation , there is always the right of fulfilling all moral obligations ; and that nothing can take it away , since it exists by necessity of nature . It can not then be true that corporations are relieved from their moral obligations by their charters ; and if it were so , then surely it would be high time that legislatures should invest them in full with their moral rights , and with the power of fulfilling these moral duties . We ask now-since it is evident that corporations are morally bound , to exercise a beneficent parental care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they create and controlwhat are their specific obligations and in what modes are they bound to render assistance ? And here we are not insensible of the difficulties which embarrass the question . The positions and circumstances of manufacturing villages are so very various , that no invariable rule can be laid down . Every company must judge for itself in its circumstances , under a sense of responsibility to God , what is incumbent upon it to do . The size of the village , its newness , the country around it , the character of the people who are attracted to it to obtain employment , and other things of this nature , are all to be considered . For a village not large enough to need a place of worship , the corporation should see that the villagers have the means of going to the nearest church , and should assist them . For a village of several hundreds , it should aid in providing a house of worship . Thus there are a thousand diversities which determine the particulars of duty . All that we can attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always important that the villagers be encouraged to help themselves to the extent of their ability . In order to value their blessings they must pay something for them . Blessings which cost us nothing are apt to be undervalued . There was good policy in the course of that pastor , who sent his deacon round among those who never went to church , to get them to subscribe something to his support ; for when they had // subscribed , they attended on his ministry to get their money 's worth . *In every manufacturing village , therefore , the villagers should be stimulated to help themselves . This is necessary in order to the highest success of whatever is done in their behalf . And in order to their taking hold in earnest to help themselves , they should be encouraged . If they are expected to do every thing , they will probably attempt nothing . But the patronage of the corporations should be so employed as to stimulate and encourage them to the highest pitch of endeavor . And not only should they thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground of the greater benefit derivable to them , but also , on the ground of their own obligations . They share the responsibility for the character of the village place which they inhabit even temporarily . They are bound to do what in them lies , for the advancement of all good institutions , and for the building up of a healthy social state . Here then is the starting point from which to calculate , under the diverse circumstances of different places , the amount and manner of assistance to be rendered to the inhabitants , in the molding of society . It will riot be difficult , in view of the specific facts , to decide specifically what shall he done . In relation to the necessities of a manufacturing village , there can be little difference of opinion . And first of all in the starting of a village that is to give employment to somi*ie hundreds of operatives , the corporation or corporations should provide a suitable church or chapel for the due performance of religious worship . The persons who first come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of God at a distance . And indeed it is almost impossible to exert any salutary moral influence on such a population without the preaching of the gospel in the midst of them . In the beginning of the enterprise , unless there are able men in the vicinity who naturally belong to the new community and become its leaders , the burden of providing a place of worship must necessarily devolve upon the corporation or corporations . It is for them , therefore , to build a house for God in their village , as soon as they build their boarding houses . And as the village increases and its wants demand a larger house of worship , they should judiciously stimulate and encourage the people to build . As other churches are needed , they should still be ever ready to give their aid . The comparative amount , however , which they give to each church may reasonably diminish as the ability of the place increases . We have known a village where , though the power of the people was stret*hed to its utmost limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of worship was a miserable apartment which was too small for those who wished to attend ; and from which all children were therefore excluded . The lordly // 247 manufacturers were making extravagant dividends , but were permitting the children in their village to grow up without access to the house of God . As to schools , not a loom should begin to move , before these have been provided for . A manufacturing place , of all others , needs the very best of schools . The population is young and excitable . There is a movement and a stir in the current of society , which needs to be guided , and often to be kept in check . While there are peculiar advantages in such a place , there are also peculiar dangers arising from the activity of life , which seems to catch its motions from the flight of the spindles . No state fund will provide schools of a sufficiently high order . The corporation should unite with the inhabitants to set up and perfect the very best system of schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the intellectual improvement of mature minds , such as libraries , lectures , associations and other things of this nature . These will naturally come in their season , if the character of the place is molded by the influence of schools and churches . When their time comes , they should be attended to , promptly and liberally . Such things are sometimes done by large-minded proprietors of manufacturing capital , in a way that ought to be more generally imitated . Much attention should be paid to the general beauty and tastefiil arrangement of a place . These things have more power in the social and moral education of a people , than some men can imagine . In a beautiful village , laid out with true regard to regularity and neatness , and embosomed in trees , there is an assimilating power upon the minds of the people . Of course , all this devolves upon the corporations . They have the whole arrangement of the place . We regard it as a very great wrong , for any body of men having control over the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may , and do nothing for its external appearance . Where a few pounds of powder will blast away a rock and give a regular street , they have no right to save the powder and perch their houses wherever they can find the cheapest place for them . The manufactory should be kept neat , every thing about , it should present an inviting appearance to the eye . Dirty people dwell in dirty villages . Neat people dwell in neat villages . And there is always some immorality in dirt , and some morality in neatness . In the boarding houses , as we generally find them in even the best manufacturing villages , we think there is a call for very great improvement . The crowding of from four to eight lodgers into a little room , hardly sufficien t for them to turn around in , is obviously contrary to the laws of health . And then the absolute impossibility of retirement and solitary thought is greatly injuri // ous to character . To persons thus situated , however devoutly disposed some of them may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . " Their communion with their God is interrupted and broken at the best , so that they can reap but little of its benefits . There is an evil here which ought to be remedied . Larger accommodations should be provided , and if necessary , a higher price should be charged for board . The laborers ought not to be excluded from all the inestimable benefits of retirement , nor compelled to sleep in unventilated , pent up rooms , where the air , breathed over and over again by so many lungs , is necessarily impure ahd poisonous . One more thing must have a place in this outline of the n*oral duties of a corporation , and that is the duty of a good example ; - every corporation in a manufacturing village should keep with the utmost strictness the holy Sabbath of God . We regret to say that to a very great extent this duty is neglected . The repairing of the machinery , upon the holy day , in order to save something for the increase of dividends , can find no excuse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is most deeply injurious to the moral character of the place . The extensive violation of the Sabbath in such a village , is no wonder , when we know that the corporation itself is not particular to observe the Sabbath . It is said indeed , that if the mill is not put in order on the Sabbath , the laborers will be out of employment and much time lost ; and thus a sort of necessity is pleaded in abatement of the sin . If the loss occasioned would , by the rules of employment , fall upon the operatives , then a plea of " mercy " is added to the plea of " necessity . " But however the matter may be presented , it is difficult to see how a corporation can be justified in working on the Sabbath , except upon a principle which would destroy the Sabbath altogether . For the merchant may plead that he must work to support his family , and may prepare his goods for the week-days ' business . And the mechanic , by the same excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . And so we should soon have rio Sabbath . The case is very plain ; a corporation is no more relieved frofri responsibility to the law of God than a single individual . Though it has no " soul " in its corporate capacity , God will find souls in it , which he will hold to account . In the case in which the loss falls upon the company , it is one of the hazards of business , and should no more be complained of , and made an excuse for violating the Lord 's day , than any other loss . And in the case where , by the terms of employment , the loss falls upon the operatives , it is a risk which they take , and to it they should cheerfully submit . There is no necessity in either case , except the necessity of making money , and that is not such a necessity as justifies labor on the Lord 's day . If we admit that excuse , we // at once give up the Sabbath with all the blessings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operatives , to have a day of recreation occasionally during the repairing of the machinery , even though it should diminish their wages . They might then have time for amusements and excursions without desecrating the holy day . But if , by the terms of employment , the company assumes the loss , then how nobly does their self-sacrificing regard for the Sabbath , shine forth in the community ! What a moral power do they thus bring to bear upon the operatives ! But let the corporation work , to make money , on the Lord 's day ; and why may not the operatives violate the Sabbath for the sake of pleasure ? Regarded from either point of view , repairing of machinery is not such a work of necessity or mercy as was excepted by the Savjor from the law of the Sabbath : the only necessity or mercy in the case is the necessity of making larger dividends , or the mercy of pcrmitting the operatives to earn more wages . We must say one word as to the number of hours in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the employed , they can find " a more excellent way " than by repairing their machinery in violation of the Sabbath . We know it is difficult to regulate such a matter . One corporation can not do it alone . Nothing can be done effectually , till a healthy public sentiment is formed . In the views , therefore , which we suggest on this point , we design only to call the attention of intelligent Christian manufacturers to a consideration of the question . It is certainly an evil , which we trust is not remediless , to confine human beings txvelve hours out of twenty-four , to their daily tasks . There is left little or no time for intellectual improvement , social enjoyment , or religious culture . At half past seven , the weary laborer returns to his or her evening meal , worn out and fit for nothing but sleep . In a manufacturing village it is almost impossible to have a religious meeting , or a meeting for intellectual improvement , except between the close of one week 's labor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals of a place . But we forbear to enlarge on this point . Turning now to some of the economical relations of the s'iibject , we think it can be shown , that as a matter of business merely , it is for the advantage of corporations to exercise over their villages the paternal care which we have described . In this view we are sustained by the opinion of several persons whom we have consulted , and who are fully competent to form a correct judgment , inasmuch as they have conducted manufacturing enterprises for many years . But instead of relying on authorities in such a matter , we refer to reasons . // It is evident without much argument , that intellectual and moral qualities tn the laborer are necessary to the most productive labor . This is as essential in manufacturing establishments as in every other . If a clerk or apprentice who has a good character is the more valuable on that account , so it is with the girl who tends a loom , or the overseer who directs the labor . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dissipated and unprincipled operatives are , in their estimation , as profitable as those who are high-minded , sober and careful . At any rate , they act as if it were of no matter of consequence what kind of laborers they employ . But this is a very great mistake . The best qualities of mind and heart are necessary to the highest productiveness in any department of labor . And from the nature of the case it must be so . In order to the most effective industry , the laborer must be educated to self-respect , and a lively sense of character . The slave is every where , in comparison with the free laborer , a most miserable producer , and that because he has not the highest and noblest feelings of a man . Next to him is the debauched , dissipated and reckless free laborer . And next in order follow , one after another , the long list of individuals who are in various degrees removed from a high standard of character . It is the testimony of one whom we have consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the constant habit of attending public worship upon the Sabbath , and who are connected with Sabbath schools and Bible classes , are far more profitable to their employers than those who entirely neglect these privileges . " And this testimony is only the confirmation which experience gives to the view which arises from the very nature of things . Corporations , therefore , should endeavor , for their own interests , to provide for a high standard of character in their villages . What they expend for this purpose will more than return to them , not perhaps in tangible results at once , but in the stability and gradually increasing value of their entire investment . The influence of a high tone of intelligence and morals in the community that grows up around their establishment , will be like the dew , gentle and unnoticed in its action , yet , with wonderful power , ministering life and growth to all the sources of profit . To tend a loom , or oversee a number of operatives , ma*r seem to some a work of the simplest kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such work testify that there is a very great difference of skill in even the simplest departments of labor , Some girls can earn eight dollars a week , while others can earn only two or three . But the most skillful laborer , notwithstanding his high wages , is by far the most profitable to the employer . Of course it follows that the money expended in a manufacturing village for the purpose of sharpening the faculties , and educating the intellect of the population , is not lost , but will return , " after many days , " to increase the wealth of the company . // There is another point of no little consequence in this connection : the greater security and value of prop erty in a well trained community . Among a thriftless , idle , vagabond population , which a manufacturing village is likely to attract if left to grow up uncared for , great losses are constantly occurring from fires and theft , and general waste , which are greatly diminished in a village nurtured into a high moral character by the judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cmated it . No prudent business man would invest his capital in a disgracefully immoral place ; how then can he build up such a place around capital which he has already invested . In a place where moral influences are deficient or pernicious , manufacturing proprietors lose much by the frequent changes in the working population . Good workmen may come to such a place , but they will not stay long , for in such a place they can not feel themselves at home ; and poor workmen are always noted for their unsettled , uneasy dispositions . Hence there must be a constant changing of operatives . But this is always attended with loss . It takes much time to learn how to labor to the best advantage in any mill ; and while learning , the labor can not be so valuable . Thus , where the operatives are constantly going and coming , the profits of the concern must be materially diminished . The damage which a corporation may suffer simply by the loss of time consequent on the employment of idle , dissolute operatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stopping of a single loom on account of " a spree , " may be a serious affair to the company . In a great inanufactory , all the fragments of time are valuable , and it is important that every loom should be constantly in motion . To one of the companies in Lowell , the loss of a single hour makes a difference of between three and four thousand yards of cloth in the product of their mills . We have known villages where looms have stood idle for several days on account of the drunken frolic of him who had the charge of them . This item of loss was never reported to the corporation . It was a leakage , that made so little show as to seem unimportant . Arid yet the aggregate loss from such things to that corporation 1*ust have been very great . The slighting of the work is another source of loss ; operatives of inferior moral character produce inferior fabrics . There is often as great a loss in the quality of the article , as in the amount produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives have , many of them , little sense of character , working simply for the pay , with no feeling of obligation , the service rendered to the proprietors will be mere " eye service , " and the product will be of corresponding value . // Another important item of loss arises from petty peculations . Where hundreds or thousands of hands are employed , small " stealings " amount in the aggregate to large amounts . In a small factory , which employs a hundred persons , if each should take a yard of goods manufactured per day , the company has a hundred yards to subtract from the day 's profits ; and if the goods be valued at twelve cents , they experience a loss of twelve dollars , which in a year amounts to thirty-six hundred dollars . Now , when it is remembered that these peculations are very diljicult of detection , the value of operatives who can be depended on will be seen at a glance . And then , too , will be seen whether it is good economy in a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which groxvs up around its factory . But it is not in items that the extent of the losses which corporations suffer on account of immoral influences around them , can be estimated . There is a general wastefulness and want of care , which cuts in upon the profits of the concern yet deeper than can be explained by these items . In truth , the losses thus arising are , many of them , hidden from view , and can not be represented in any definite statement . We may get the best idea of this whole subject by comparing any two villages conducted respectively upon the opposite principles of duty and selfishness . There are many visible contrasts of this kind which are of the nature of demonstration . Such an one rises to our thoughts at this moment . In a certain part of New England , upon the same bending stream , not many miles distant from each other , there are two manufacturing villages . One of them is neat , tasteful , beautiful , and inviting as a place of residence . The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory ,  --  a church , whose very appearance is an auxiliary to good order and virtue . All good objects received the fostering care of the company . The villagers were thus stimulated to exertion , and inspired with a sense of character and true dignity . By the judicious aid of the company , an academy was founded , and good schools were established . Roads were leveled , grounds well laid out , a beautiful green thrown open to the public ; and every thing was done to provide for the taste and morals of the population . rphe consequence has been that the village is a model . Vice hides itself from view ; losses from drunkenness and idleness are rare ; and the general character of the people there bears a stamp of dignity and genial manliness . The other place was founded upon different principles . Nothing was laid out except by absolute necessity . The people who desired to worship , were obliged for years to meet in a room only large enough to hold the adults . No children attended the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the advantages of the sanctuary . The schools were miserable . Houses // were built almost any where . The village was dirty and uninviting . The factories instead of looking out upon you with a sunshiny look , scowled grimly through their dinginess , as if they were the castles of Giant Despair . Not a tree had been set out in the place It was the image of what a village ought not to be . The morals of the place were such as one might expect from such influences . Drunkenness was common . The looms frequently stood idle for weeks , because of the " sprees " of the workmen . Profaneness was fearfully prevalent . As for the children , such a generation has been seldom seen . It will be easy for the reader to fill up the picture ; the contrast is too painful for us to follow further . It brings up before us scenes which caused us great sorrow years ago , when we witnessed them , and upon which we do not care to dwell . We have before our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat , inviting , moral , orderly , prosperous ; the other , filthy , repulsive , immoral , disorderly , bankrupt . The secret of the difference betweeti the two , is that the first is conducted on high and generous principles ; the other , upon those of the most narrowsighted selfishness . Another contrast occurs to us in one village under two successive administrations . The first was close-fisted , leaving the people to themselves , taking the holy day to repair machinery , making no outlays for the religious and moral welfare of the place ; the consequence was , that the whole business ran out , thc owners became bankrupt , and the property passed into other hands . The new administration went to work on the opposite plan ; built a church , settled a minister , gave an impulse to schools adorned the place with tasteful care , and now it is one of the most flourishing villages of the kind in Nexv England . And thus we might continue to cite examples almost indefinitely . But we need not . One more thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Manufacturers will find it to their interest to pursue a liberal policy in their villages , in order to check the spread of that opposition to corporations which is now of no inconsiderable disadvantage to them , and which , if manufacturing villages be*come the abodes of a low and degraded population , will sweep every thing before it , in the indignation of the people . Then charters will not be renewed ,  --  companies will not he allowed to increase their capital , new burdens will be laid upon them , and in a thousand ways they will find themselves hampered and troubled . The only way to avoid this result is for companies to pursue a high and liberal policy , making their villages the open proofs and testimonies to the value of such **26;197;TOOLONG " THE Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress to their Constituents , " does not appear to have made much impression any where upon the community , if we except the single state of South Carolina . Indeed , it has hardly received as much attention as it deserves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading statesmen of the country . It diseusses subjects of the gravest character . It brings against a portion of the states of the Union , the weightiest charge which can be brought against any people , the charge of a national " breach of faith . " But , apart from this , the address undertakes to make a statement as to the nature and import of the slave coml ) romises of the constitution , which is of peenliar interest to the student of our constitutional history . It is this point we propose mainly to examine ; for we apprehend there are many erroneous opinions on the subject in the community , and we are sure the statement in the *ddress , made though it is by men learned in these matters , is destitute of historical foundation . We quote the statement entire . " Not to go farther back , the difference of opinion and feeling in reference to the relation between the two races , disclosed itself in the convention that framed the constitution , and constituted one of the greatest difficulties in forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise , which provided , in the first place , that representation and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers ; and that in ascertaining the // number of each , five slaves shall be estimated as three . In the next , that slaves escaping into states where slavery does not exist , shall not be discharged from servitude , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom their labor or service is due . In the third place , that Congress shall not prohibit the importation of slaves before the year 1808 ; but a tax not exceeding ten dollars may be imposed on each imported . And , finally , that no capitation or direct tax shall be laid but in proportion to federal numbers ; and that no amendment of the constitution prior to 1808 , shall affect this provision nor that relating to the importation of slaves . " There are several things on the very surface of this statement , which strike us with astonishment . it represents the several articles of the constitution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise , in which the various interests were vieved together and decided together as forming one subject , thus giving to each the peculiar sanctity , if there be any , which is due to a single great measure , obstructing the progress of the convention and only carried by a compromise of many interests ; whereas , the plain historical fact is , that there was no such compromise . the different articles were discussed at different times , put upon grounds entirely independent of each other , and supported by different parties in the convention . But , what is still more astonishing , the statement represents the question of the restoration of fugitive slaves as among the first to be drawn into discussion and linked in with the other matters compromised ; whereas , it was not in the resolutions introduced by Mr. Randolph ; it was not in the resolutions reported by the committee of the whole house ; it was not in the resolutions reported by the committee of detail , though they introduced the clause relating to fugitives from justice ; it was not proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not referred to any committee of compromise nor to any other committee ; there were no matters compromised ; in a word , it was no compromise at all . But there are other assertions in this statement which are equally erroneous , as we believe , though they are more in accordance with prevailing opinions . We refer to the assertion that slavery constituted " one of the greatest difficulties in fbrming the constitution , " and that this difficulty arose from " a difference of opinion and feeling , " on the subject of slavery , for that is what we suppose to be meant by the relation between the two races. ** On the contrary , we say that the slave questions did not constitute any peculiar difficulty . There were several subjects , which excited far more feeling , and divided the convention far more nearly into equally balanced parties . The resolution allowing an enumeration of three fifths of the slaves in apportioning representatives , was passed in committee of the whole by the vote of // nine states against two , New Jersey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty years , by the vote of seven states against four ; and that relating to fugitive slaves , unan iniousi y . And what difficulty there was , did not originate from any " difference of opinion and feeling " as to slavery . There was in fact very little feeling about it in the convention , far less than we could wish . Slavery never came up as a great moral question , deeply agitating the souls of men . The remonstrance against It as a violation of natural right even , was feeble compared with what it has since become . Doubtless there was a difference of opinion and feeling , but it was not such as to separate the members into two parties according to their geographical position , nor to array them according to their sentiments against each other , the one portion seeking to overthrow the system , and the other , to uphold it . Slaves were regarded merely as an element of national prosperity , and the difficulty in regard to representation arose in determining the comparative importance of this element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruples of conscience in the mind of any one . The protection of the slave trade for twenty years , was , indeed , opposed on moral grounds by some of the ablest men in the convention , but they were overborne by a very strong majority . We do not say there were no proper feelings on the subject ; the determination that there should not be in the constitution any recognition of property in man , shows the contrary . Bnt even that point was not carried by the free states against the slave-holding states ; it was the general sentiment . Mr. Madison declared in the most express terms , " that he thought it xvrong to admit into the constitution the idea that there could be property in man . " In the expression " legally held to service " in the clause relating to fngitive slaves , the word " legally " was struck out at the last moment as " favoring the idea that slavery was legal in a moral view . " There was a general understanding that there should not be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this anti-slavery feeling must not be overrated . It went no farther , and did not give rise to any of the difficulties in the way of forming the constitution . There was no such feeling against sla%ry as has since grown tip and as now exists . Nor is this strange . Even the slave-trade had not as yet been repudiated by any Christian people . There had been no formal abolition of slavery any where . Nor was there any thing in the American revolution to convert the people at once into abolitionists . Principles , indeed , had been laid down in the Declaration of Independence , which in their legitimate effect would destroy slavery , but so far from being new , in this country , they were the old and recognized principles of freedom . Republican governments do indeed contam // doctrines , which are hostile to the existence of slavery , but the revolution did not make the people repoblicans ; they had always been republicans . And as a matter of fact , slavery existed in almost all the states , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one can read the Madison Papers , without being impressed with the fact that the opposition to slavery in the convention , on the ground of moral principle , was comparatively nothing . The present anti-slavery feeling has been the development of subsequent times . To pass from the discussion of a slave-question in Congress now to the discussion of similar subjects in the convention that framed the constitution , is to pass beyond the commencement of one of the most remarkable developments of the moral sentiments of mankind , which the history of divine providence affords . If these things are plain matters of fact  --  and that they are such we can produce the most undoubted evidence-then , the articles of the constitution relating to slavery , ought not to be represented as possessing any peculiar sacredness from the great difficulties under which they were agreed upon ; and the address , in making such an impression , is unsupported by the facts of history . And this is the sole bearing of our remarks . For , we would not be understood as desiring to impair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we merely deny to them any extraordinary sanctity above other portions . But we proceed to the next paragraph of the address , which sets forth the import of this compromise , as it is pleased to call it . We here quote the entire statement . " So satisfactory were these provisions , that the second , relative to the delivering up of fugitive slaves , was adopted unanimously , and all the rest except the third , relative to the importation of slaves till 1808 , with almost equal unanimity . They recognize the existence of slavery and make a specific provision for its protection , where it is supposed to be most exposed . They go farther and incorporate it , as an important element , in determining the relative weight of the several states in the government of the Union and the respective burdens they should bear in laying capitation and direct taxes . It was well understood at the time , that without them the constitution xvonld not have been adopted by the Southern states , and of course that they constituted elements so essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Northern states knowing all this , ratified the constitution , thereby pledging their faith in the most solemn manner , sacredly to observe them . " A single glance is enongh to discover somewhat that is very extraordinary in this paragrapli as well as in the last . " They "  --  the provisions of the slavery-compromise- " recognize the existence of slavery " - so the constitution recognizes the existence of the slave-trade , of piracies and felonies on the high seas , of foreign // nations and Indian tribes , of every thing else which it mentions or alludes to . But what then ? The expression is either an idle truism , or else it insinuates more than it dare assert . " They make a specific provision for its protection where it is most exposed . " But why was there " a specific provision ? " Was it because this property was a peculiar favorite of the convention ? a property so important as to deserve ettraordinary protection ? or because it was property held against natural right aud therefore when passing from the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They incorporate it , as an important element in determining the relative weight of the several states of the Union . " But how is it that SLAVERY IS incorporated ? Is it the slaves as slaves , that determine the relative weight ? or laborers who are slaves , that do it ? And how an important element ? Because of the value attached to such labors by the constitution ? or because of the value attached to it by those who possess the political power which it gives ? " They constituted elements so essential to the system , that it never would have existed without them . " Again we ask , why were they so essential ? Because without them the system would have been so inherently bad it would never have been fit to be established ? or are they essential merely in the sense that the supposed interests of the slave-holding states made them necessary conditions to the adoption of the system . We would not cavil at mere forms of expression , but we have a right to complain , that the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being merely tolerated by the constitution , and presents it as a cherished institution instead of being marked as disfavored by the very manner in which it is treated . We can not but think the language of this paragraph as well as of the last , distorts the historical facts in the case . We propose , therefore , to give somewhat at length the history of the formation of those articles of the constitution , which involve slave-questions . We regard the constitution of the United States as the greatest product of human wisdom . No body of men can be pointed out in history , which can be compared with the convention that formed it . rfl*eir comprehensive views , the steadiness of aim with which they pressed forward to their ultimate object , their perfect understanding of the existing condition of the country , and prophetic foresight of its future necessities , their political knowledge , in which the conclusions of theory were corrected by experience , their singleness of purpose , by which they rose superior to preconceived opinions and personal rivalries , and which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every part of their proceedings , in one word , THEIR WIsDoM  --  and we believe there is no other word in the Ianguage which fully expresses the character of the conventionplaces // these great statesmen on an eminence which must ever attract the respect and the admiration of men . To trace out the various shapes which any particular article took before it received its finat form , as the process is developed in the Madison Papers , furnishes a lesson of political wisdom of a kind such as can not be elsewhere obtained . We hope , therefore , our readers will bear with us , and perhaps follow us with interest , as we proceed now to follow out the history of the formation of those articles of the constitution , which the address groups together as constituting the subject matter of a single compromise . We commence with the compromise as to the enumeration of three-fifths of the blacks in determining the number of representatives . But in order to obtain a correct historical view of this subject , it will be necessary to revert to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the confederation . No sooner had the Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies , than it undertook the far more difficult task of forming a confederated union of these now independent states . A committee was appointed to draft articles of confederation . In their report , which was made on the 12th of July , 1776 , it was resolved , among other things , " that all charges of war , and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare , shall be defrayed out of a common treasury , which shall be supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age , sex , and quality , except Indians not paying taxes , in each colony . " The report was discussed in committee of the whole house . The debates upon the article nuder consideration were partially preserved by Mr. Jefferson , and are published in the first volume of the Madison Papers . It was moved by Mr. Chase of Maryland , as an amendment to the resolution of the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of inhabitants of every condition , but by that of the white inhabitants . ' " Mr. Chase remarked , that " he considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerable good criterion of property , and thought it the best mode of apportioning taxes , with one exception only . He observed that negroes are property , and as such can not be distinguished froiP the lands or personalities held in those where there are few slaves . there is no more reason , " he said , " for taxing the southern states on the farmer 's head and on his slave 's head , than the northern ones on their farmer 's heads and the heads of their cattle . " Mr. John Adams , in reply , observed , " that the number of people were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the state , and not as subjects of taxation . That as to this matter , it was of no consequence by what name you called your people , whether by that of freemen or of slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no greater surplus for the payment of taxes , than five hundred slaves . Therefore that the state in which are the laborers called freemen , should be taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves . * * * That a slave may , indeed , from the custom of speech , be more properly called the wealth of his master , than the free laborer might be called the wealth of his employer ; but as to the state , both were equally its weairh , and should therefore equally add to the quota of its tax . " Mr. Harrison , of Virginia , proposed as a compromise , that two slaves should be counted as one freeman , as they did no more than the work of one . The amendment of Mr. Chase was rejected . rphi5 was the first occasion , we believe , in which any question as to slaves was discussed in the councils of the nation . It was a question as to the productiveness of different classes of laborers . It being admitted that the taxable property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the amount produced is in proportion to the number of laborers* and that the number of laborers is in proportion to the whole number of people , it would seem to be fair that the quota of taxes to be paid by each state should be according to its whole population . But if the laborers in a slaveholding state be not as productive as the laborers in a free state , then the number of the whole population of the former would not indicate as much taxable property as the same number of people in the latter ; the quota of taxes to be paid , therefore , should not be as great , or in other words should not be in proportion to the number of the whole population . Upon this hypothesis , it was quite natural to think of determining the proportion between the productive value of labor in the slave and free states , and then counting the number of laborers in the former as equivalent to such a number in the latter as should result from the proportion . Admitting the correctness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that such an arrangement would be unjust . But it is quite obvious that it would be no recognition of slavery as a legal or moral institution . It contemplates the laborers as producers merely , without reference to their political condition in the state-so much so , that from this alone it xvould be impossible to determine whether they x*re free or enslaved . It could only be said that one class were not as good workers as the other . After the rejection of the amendment of Mr. Chase , the original article was itself rejected ; and it was finally agreed that the quota to be paid by each state should be in l ) rOPortion to the value of the houses and lands . But it is well known that there never was any such valuation , and that the sums apportioned among the states during the war were regulated by the snpposed number of inhabitants . At length , however , in 1783 , the subject came up again in the effort which the Continental Congress // made at that time to revive the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a protracted discussion , it was agreed almost unanimously that the valuation of land and houses was impracticable , and it was proposed in the report made by the committee on revenue , that the quota to be paid by the several states " should be in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age , sex and condition , provided that in such enumeration no persons shall be included who are bound to servitude for life , according to the laws of the state to which they belong , other than such as may be between the ages of - years . " In the discussion it was pretty generally agreed that the apportioninent of the quota of taxes according to the whole population , deducting somewhat for the inefficiency of Southern laborers , was the best practical measure . But it was thought instead of fixing the proportion by ages , it would be best to fix the proportion in absolute numbers . The clause was recommitted for this purpose , and on the next day , March 28th , the committee report that two blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report is quite curious . Mr. Wolcott was for rating them as four to three ; Mr. Carroll as four to one . Mr. Williamson of North Carolina , said that he was principled against slavery ; and that he thought slaves an incurnbrance to society instead of increasing its ability to pay taxes . Mr. Higginson as four to three . Mr. Rutledge said for the sake of the object , he would agree to rate slaves as two to one , but he sincerely thought three to one would be a juster proportion . Finally Mr. Madison said , in order to give a proof of the sincerity of his professions of liberality , he would propose that slaves should be rated as five to three . This was carried , and on the main question the whole clause passed by the vote of six states against five : New Hampshire , New York , New Jersey ) Maryland , Virginia and North Carolina being in the affirmative , and Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , Delaware and South Carolina in the negative . of We have here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the enumeration of three-fifths of the slaves in apportioning the number of representatives in the lower house . We pause only to say , that it was a compromise of opinions as to the comparative value of different kinds of labor u1 adding to the wealth of the state , and had no relation to the political condition of the laborer . But this system of revenue , which was to be adopted by the states unanimously in order to be binding , never went into complete operation . It became apparent at last that the confederation of the States was inadequate to the purposes of government , and that some other form of union must be devised . The convention to form the Federal Constitution was organized on the 25th of May , 1787 , and , on the next day , Mr. Edinund // Randolph introduced the business of the convention by the proposal of fifteen resolutions , containing the elements of a national government . These were discussed in committee of the whole house . But at the very outset , the convention was met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government  --  the question whether each state should have an equal vote in the national legislature . Mr. Randolph 's third resolution was , " that the right of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be proportioned to the quotas of contribution or to the number of free inhabitants , as the one or the other may be best in different cases . " Several amendments were proposed , till finally a substitute was offered by Mr. Madison , " that the equality of suffrage established by the articles of confederation ought not to prevail in the national legislature , and that an equitable ratio ought to be adopted . " rj his resolution was then on motion postponed . On the next day it was resolved that the national legislature ought to consist of two branches , and that the first ought to be elected by the people of the several states ; but the resolution as to electing the members of the second branch by the first out of nominations made by the state legislature was tmnanimously rejected . The whole subject was then postponed till the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 7th of June the convention returned to it . It was proposed by Mr. Dickinson , that the second branch should be elected by the state legislatures , which was unanimously carried . It having been decided that the national legislature should consist of two branches , of which one should be elected by the people arid one by the legislatures of the states , it only remained to determine how the states should be represented . And this was the great difficulty of the convention . It resolved itself into two questions the first was , whether the states should have each an equal vote in both branches , or an unequal one in both , or an equal vote in the one and an unequal one in the other . The second arose from the supposition of an unequal vote , and was , what rule of apportionment should be adopted in order to determine the number of votes each state should have ? The subject of the inequality of the votes of the several states , and the rule of apportioning the votes to each state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final settlement of this question in committee of the whole , the substitute offered by Mr. Madison to the third resolution of Mr. Randolph , was revived by Mr. Wilson and Mr. King , and it was resolved , " that the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national legislature ought not to be according to the rule established in the articles of confederation , " - that is , that the states ought not to have an equal vote ,  --  " but according to some equitable ratio of representation . " This last clause con *OL . VII . 43 // tains really two propositions ; the first , that the states ought to have unequal votes in the first branch , which is the affirmative implied in the preceding negative ; the second , that the number of members assigned to each state should be according to some fair rule . This resolution was carried by the votes of seven states against three , New York , Nexv Jersey and Delaware , and Maryland divided . The definite proposition in this vote was , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature . The delegates from Delaware were restrained by the terms of their appointment from voting in its favor , and Mr. Lansing and Mr. Yates , who constituted the majority from the state of New York , interpreted the terms of their commission in the same way . rJlhe delegates from New Jersey , and Mr. Martin from Maryland , were opposed to a national government and in favor of a confederation . It having been resolved that the states should be represented unequally according to some fair rule of apportionment , the next step was to determine this rule . Accordingly it was moved by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Pinckney , that the number of representatives from each state should be in proportion " to the whole number of white and other free citizens and inhabitants of ' every age , sex and condition , including those bound to servitude for a term of years , and three-fiftbs of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description , " and carried by the vote of nine states against two , New Jersey and Delaware . It seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an ennineration of three-fifths of the slaves , as distinct from the inequality of the votes of the state , which made the apportionment necessary , was adopted almost unanimously . It excited no deep feeling , and was attended with no particular difficulty . It was manifestly taken from the articles of confederation relating to the apportionment of taxes , which had already been ratified by eleven states . It was the adoption of a compromise already made rather than the making of a new one . It stood as here adopted throughout all tite discussions of the convention , by itself and on its own merits . It was not made the condition of any other article , nor the part of any compromise . How then can it be represented as one of the great difficulties of the converition , and only settled " after many efforts , " by becoming the part of a general compromise . The first branch being thus constituted , it was moved by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hamilton , " that the right of suffrage in the second branch ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch , " and carried by the vote of Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia , against Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Delaware and Maryland . The convention then proceed in committee of the whole to dis // cuss the remaining topics of Mr. Randolph 's resolutions , unti ! they are completed . On the 13th of June , the committee of the whole report to the house the resolutions of Mr. Randolph as amended . The house at once take up the report and proceed to discuss it , in which they go over the same ground as in committee . It was not till the 27th of June that the question of the representation of the states was reached , when a very able and exciting debate commenced on the first clause of the seventh article of the report , " that the rule of suffrage in the first branch ought not to be according to that established by the articles of the confederation . " On motion to agree to this clause , it was carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Connecticut , which voted in the negative . This change of vote was owing doubtless to the vote in committee making a proportional representation in the second branch . After the acceptance of this part of the report , Mr. Ellsworth moved as an amendment to the eighth article , " that the rule of suffrage in the second branch be the same as that established by the articles of confederation . " this amendment was lost by the votes of Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Delaware and Maryland , against Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Virginia , North Carolina and South Carolina , and Georgia divided . The only difference from the vote in committee is , that Georgia is now divided . After the loss of this amendment , the house was at a stand . The small states insisted upon an equality of votes in the second branch . In this emergency the whole matter was referred to a special committee of eleven , composed of one member from each stare . The matter stands thus . It is quite generally agreed that the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rule of apportionment is settled with almost entire unanimity . But the states are equally divided with respect to the second branch . The committee of compromise report on the 5th of July . The report in regard to the first branch , adopts the articles already agreed on in committee of the whole , and adds to them , among several things of less importance , the following clause , " that all money bills should originate in the first branch . " With respect to the second branch , it reverses the resolution of the committee of the whole , and allows an equal vote to each state . This report was discussed at great length . The only addition made to it , which it is necessary for us to notice , is , the resolution that representation ought to be proportional to direct taxation . this was carried unanimously , and seems to have been overlooked rather than rejected by the committee of the whole . On the question being taken on the proposition of the special committee " proportioning representation to direct taxation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , and re // quiririg a census within six years and within every ten years afterwards , " it was carried by the votes of Connecticut , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia , against New Jersey and Delaware , Massachusetts and South Carolina divided . New York was absent , and South Carolina was influenced by other reasons than opposition to an enumeration of threefifths of the blacks . New Jersey and Delaware were the only states opposed to it . The vote , therefore , was the same as in committee of the whole . Upon the question for agreeing to the whole report as amended , including the equality of votes in the second branch , it passed in the affirmative , by the vote of Connecticut , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , North Carolina , against Pennsylvania , Virginia , South Carolina and Georgia ; and Massachusetts divided . This was the test vote as to the second branch . It is obvious from these votes , that the enumeration of threefifths of the blacks was not a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of that compromise . The inequality of the votes of the states in the first branch , and not the rule of apportionment , was the true ground for acquiescing in the equality of votes in the second branch . The enumeration of three-fifths of the blacks was brought in merely as belonging to the same subject-matter , but it was a part of the general subject , about which there was almost entire agreement . In concluding this account of the formation of the article of the constitution under consideration , we add that the house having finished their discussion of the report of the committee of the whole , on the 23d of July referred their proceedings to a committee of detail to report a constitution according to them . This committee made their report on the 6th of August . The convention then took up and discussed this report , in doing which they passed over the same ground which had been already twice traversed . During this discussion , two votes were taken upon the enumeration of three-fifths of the blacks in the former of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the negative , and in the last , only Delaware . ( Madison Papers , vol. 3 , 1261 and 1379 . ) The convention continue the discussion of the report of the committee of detail , till the 8th of September , , when a committee was appointed " to revise the style of , and arrange the articles which had been agreed to in the house . " rp1115 committee on style report on the 12th of September , and their report was discussed until the 15th , when the constitution as amended was agreed to by all the states , and ordered to be engrossed . Upon the review of this historical deduction , we remark , in the first place , that this article did NOT " constitute one of the greatest difficulties in forming the constitution . " In no stage of the discussion were there more than two states against it , and one // of these was not opposed to it , it would seem , from any hostility to an enumeration of the blacks ; for Delaware voted in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enumerated . The question of a proportional vote of the states in the first branch has been confounded with the rule fixing the proportion . We remark in the second place , that the difficulty , if there were any , did not arise from a " difference of opinion arid feeling " on the subject of slavery . It was not a question about an institution , but a mere problem in political philosophy , by what means the wealth added to the country by a certain class of laborers could be ascertained so as to be fairly represented . rrhe slave and the fred states were not in the convention facing each other , as they now are in Congress , on a great question of moral and natural right . The subject was looked at from a much lower point of view . Now , it would be a question of life or death to the system , and the discussion would sound the depths of moral and political science ; then , it was a mere question of money . We need hardly remark , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a general compromise , uniting all the slave questions , and accomplished after " many efforts . " We remark , finally , that this article does not " incorporate slavery as an element , " - for any purpose whatever . We believe it has been felt by many that this article gives some countenance to slavery . On the contrary we contend , that in no respect whatever does it show it any favor or give it even any advantage . To prove this , we must look to the ground upon which it was urged by the slaveholding states , and acquiesced in by the other states . However political writers may have found difficulty in explaining it , as a question in political philosophy , the historical grounds are clearly stated in the Madison Papers . There were two distinct questions ; first , Shall the rule of apportionrnent in any respect take into consideration the wealth of the states ? And , secondly , How shall the wealth of the states be determined ? In regard to the first , it must be remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a right to vote and be represented as a man , irrespective of his wealth , hardly obtained a foothold in the convention . Our ancestors entered into the revolution on the principle that representation and taxation went together , and they held that taxation should be in proportion to the wealth of the states , from which it seemed to follow that representation also should be in proportion to the wealffi of the states . At any rate , the southern states claimed to have the most wealth , and that their superior wealth ought to be represented in the first branch by an increased number of members . Mr. Butler of South Carolina " contended strenuously that property was the only just measure of representation . This was // the great object of government ; the great cause of war ; the great cause of carrying it on . " Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Pinckney said the same . This was agreed to by members of other states . Governeur Morris " thought that property ought to be taken into the estimate as well as numbers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be iii the combined ratio of number of inhabitants and wealth . " Mr. King of Massachusetts , said , " he had always expected , as the southcrn states are the richest , they would not league themselves with the northern , unless some respect was paid to their superior wealth . " In regard to the second question , How shall this wealth be determined ? it had already been agreed after much deliberation , that population was in general the best test , but that in the slave states , the whole number of the free and three-fifths of the slaves , was a fairer test . The enumeration of three-fifths of the slaves , therefore , was regarded by the convention as an index of the wealth of the states which was to be represented in the house of representatives . It follows from this that slaves are not represented at all , either as men or as property . They are not represented as men , for in that case all should be represented ; nor as property , for here too there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of such property . It is merely an enumeration of so many laborers as an index of the wealth added by them to the state , which is a very different thing from estimating the laborers themselves as so much property . In proof of this , we alledge the language used in the debate* on the subject . Gen. Pinckney said , " South Carolina has in one year exported to the amount of ? 600,000 , all which was the fruit of the labor of the blacks . Will she be represented in proportion to this amount ? " that is , not to the value of the slaves , but the value of xvhat they produce . In discussing this proportion , it was put upon the same ground . In the estimate of the productive power of laborers in the condition of slaves , by the continental congress , with reference to taxation , the southern delegates represented the slaves as very unproductive laborers , while in the ratification of the articles of confederation by the Massachusetts legislature , it was very difficult , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave was not equal to a free laborer. lint in the convention , the southern delegates thought the slaves fully equal to freemen , while the northern , thought them far inferior . Mr. Butler insisted " that the labor of a slave in South Carolina was as productive and as valuable as that of a freeman in Massachusetts ; that as wealth was the great means of defense and utility to the nation , they were equally valuable to it as freemen ; and that consequently an equal representation ought to be allowed for them " . - not of them- " in a government which was instituted principally for the protection of property . " It was a question of // determining the value of a peculiar species of labor in producing wealth . Mr. Governeur Morris " objected that the number of inhabitants was not a proper standard of wealth . " Mr. Pinckney said , " the blacks are the laborers of the southern states . They are as productive of pecuniary resources as those of the northern states . Jt will also be politic with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with representation . " We are not defendin* this article on the ground of abstract right ; we merely state the gronud on which it was placed in the convention . We are aware it was opposed at the time as involving an inconsistency . " Are they admitted as citizens " - said Mr. Wilson , " then why are they not admitted on an equality with white citizens ? Are they admitted as property-then why is not other property admitted into the computation ? " Mr. Sherman , however , in a later stage of the discussion , made a distinction which seems to do away with this difficulty . He said , " it was the freemen of the southern states who were to be represented according to the taxes paid by them , and the negroes are only included in the estimate of the taxes . " It may be said too , that on this ground , the people are not at all represented , but only their property . We are not responsible for this inference . It was , however , contended that the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of apportionment was consistent with either view . But it must be admitted the opinions of the convention were somewhat fluctuating , and perhaps a consistent theory of representation has not been found out even to this day . But whether the clause is defensible as an abstract political question or not , in determining whether it has any relation to the system of slavery , we must look at the actual grounds on which it was adopted . And looking at these as we have given them from the original documents , we ask , Has it any relation to the system of slavery at all ? Does it recognize its existence or even imply it ? We say it does not . For it does not contemplate the relation of the blacks to the laws which make them slaves , but their relation as laborers to the wealth of the states . This article might have been expressed in the same words , if the blacks had really b*eri what Mr. Piuckney called them , " a peasantry , " and a free peasantry . We ntterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the system of slavery- " as an important element in determining the relative weight of the several states in the government of the Union . " It does , indeed , deduct two-fifths of the blacks in the ennrneration of the whole population , but not because they are enslaved laborers , but because they are inferior laborers . The blacks belong to the class of laborers , and to the class of slaves ; this article contemplates them in the former relation and not in the latter . And if any should say it is slavery that // makes them inferior laborers , we reply , this special legislation was not on account of their condition , but on account of the effects of that condition upon them as laborers . We say , therefore , that this article had not for its object , to recognize the system of slavery , nor to provide for its perpetuity , nor even to guarantee . its influence in national legislation , but to give to the southern states the weight which they claimed to be due to their superior wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining compromise . In the discussion of the report of the committee of tietail , a new point of difficulty arose . It was the general sentiment of the convention that the slave trade ought to be abolished . Virginia and North Carolina had already abolished it . But Georgia and South Carolina were determined to maintain it , as being a source of wealth to them . At the same time , the interests of the staple states of the extreme South , as they were called , came in conflict vith the navigating interests of the Eastern states . The former demanded that no navigation bills should be passed , except by a two-thirds vote , which was of course resisted by the latter . These subjects , though having no necessary connection with each other , were forced into opposition and referred to a select committe for compromise . It was agreed and carried by a vote of seven states against four , that the slave trade should not be prohibited anterior to 1808 , and that there should be no exception to the usual practice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this compromise was in no way connected with the compromise of slave representation . It was not even a contest between the free and slave states , for Virginia and Delaware were against it , and no where was it more strenuously opposed than in several of the slave states . It was an open , naked barter of the principles of humanity for the gains of traffic  --  a mere matter of trade in which human beings were sacrificed to propitiate the interests of the Eastern and the extreme Southern states . And as to its being one of the difficulties of the convention , in which freedom and slavery were arrayed against each other , it was settled only too easily . Indeed , it was precisely such a scene as has since been so often reenacted , in which humanity has been forgotten amidst the arrangements of p*ol itical or commercial interests . Mr. Luther Martin , who was one of the committee of compromise , says , " I found the Eastern states , notwithstanding their aversion to slavery , were very willing to indulge the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave trade , provided the Southern states would in their turn gratify them , by laying no restriction on navigation acts , " and he adds that the committee agreed on the compromise by a very great majority . There was indeed strenuous opposition by Governeur Morris , Luther Martin and Mr. Madison , and many // leaders of the convention to the protection which was thus offered to the slave trade , but such was the general feeling , that it was in vain . We come next to consider the provision for the restoration of fugitive slaves . The committee of detail had incorporated into their draft of a constiti*tioi* , the provision respecting fugitives from justice , taken from the articles of confederation . The house reached this clause on the 28th of August . " Mr. Pinckney was not satisfied with it " - we here quote from the Madison Papers " he seemed to wish some provision should be included in favor of property in slaves . " " He and Mr. Butler moved to require fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive of the state to do it at the public expense . " " Mr. Sherman saw no more propriety in the public seizing and surrendering a slave than a horse . " These were all the remarks , and Mr. Butler withdrew his proposition , in order that some particular provision might be made apart from this article . On the next day , Mr. Butler jIltroduced the article respecting fugitive slaves as it now stands in the constitution . It passed unanimously and without debate . It seems unnecessary to say that this provision is no compromise . There were no opposing interests set off against it , which were given up . There was not even a reference to a committee . Nor has it any necessary dependence on the other artices relating to slavery . It would have been just as much required , if the whole number of slaves had been enumerated or none at all , or if the slave trade had been at once abolished or made perpetual . Nor was there any difficulty in making the arrangement . It was unanimously adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a fair and proper measure . We have thus finished our historical survey . In view of it , we ask what becomes of the bold assertion that " difference of opinion and feeling " in relation to slavery , " constituted one of the greatest difficulties in forming the constitution ? " What becomes of the still bolder assertion that these difficulties were , after " many efforts , " all removed by a general compromise , involving all the questions ? And what shall we say of that most extra. *rdinary assertion of all , to come from such men , that the article relating to fugitive slaves , formed a part of this compromise ? Our readers may think we have dwelt too long upon this point , because , after all , we do not deny the binding force of these articles . But the southern statesmen seem to feel that these articles have son-ie peculiar sanctity , and are to be treated with especial reverence , arising from the circumstances under which they were adopted by the convention . But we see this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , neither more nor less . Indeed there is nothing in either of them to prevent Congress from abol // ishing slavery itself . Not that we hold that Congress has any such power , but the southern states have no other guarantee against such interference , than the other states have against the interference of Congress in what does not belong to it . But besides this feeling in the southern states , there is a general impression upon this subject which we think to be erroneous . Thus , in the famous case of Prigg against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , Mr. Meredith says , " that this provision " - relating to fugitive slaves-* ' was the result of mutual concession in reference to the whole subject of slavery . " " On the one hand the south agreed to confer upon Congress the power to prohibit the importation of slaves after the year 1808. " - ls this the true historical statement , when it is known that the states of Virginia and Delaware were opposed to the protection of the slave trade for any length of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize and protect the existing institutions of the south . And for this purpose . the clause in question was engrafted upon the constitution . " There is not the slightest evidence that this clause was the consideration for the power conferred on Congress to abolish the slave trade after twenty years . Mr. Justice Wayne , in giving his opinion in that case , says ; " It , Ethe article respecting fugitive slaves with an allowance of a certain portion of slaves with the whites for representative population in Congress , and the importation of slaves from abroad , for a number of years , were the great obstacles in forming a constitution . " Yet the first was passed unanimously , the second with only two states against it , and the third with only four . " Each of them was equally insisted upon by the representatives frm the slaveholding states . " And yet Virginia and Delaware were two of the four states which opposed the compromise for the continuation of the slave trade . " When the three points relating to slaves had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution was removed . " This happcns to be true in one sense : for the articles relating to the slave trade and fugitive slaves , were not agreed upon till the 29th of August , in the last important revision of the constitution upon the report of the committee of detail , when the impediments were really removed , but it was because long before the grayd difficulty , the equal vote of the states in the senate , had been settled . But the language means that " the three points " were the only impediments , and it is to us unaccountable that a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States could by any inadvertency , make such a declaration . " The constitution , " he proceeds to say , " was presented to the states for adoption , with the understanding that the provisions in it relating to slaves were a compromise and a guarantee ; and with such an understanding in every state , it was adopted by all of them . " A similar assertion is made in the address . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several state conventions which adopted the Pederal Constitution . We say , however , as the result of our investigation , that there is not the slightest reason to believe there was any understanding with respect to the provisions about slaveholding being * a compromise and a guarantee . " No doubt it was well understood that the whole constitution was a matter of compromise , but we deny that any special importance was given to the slave compromises , and titterly reject the assumption of " a guarantee , " as wit hout any historical foundation . The several conventions did , indeed , discuss the proposed constitutions with great solemnity , and tinder the feeling of a great responsibility ; what we object to , is that the slave questions should be represented as the absorbing object of attention . We should suppose from the language used , that the free states made the articles in question the subject of most thoron g h and careful examination , that they regarded them as the critical points on which the adoption of the constitution turned , and treated them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sacred than to the other parts of the constitution . Now , no such thing took place . The very provision for the restitution of fugitives from service does not appear to have even been debated in any convention of the free states . The article relating to the slave trade was as much opposed in the conventions of Virginia and North Carolina , as in those of New York and Massachusetts . The rule of apportioning the members of the house of representatives among the several states , was somewhat discussed . In Massachusetts there was considerable opposition , but it was principally on the ground that all the slaves were not enumerated in determining the amount of taxes . These articles were nowhere the prominent subjects of debate ; they were no'vhere brought forward as test-questions . No one can tuin from the representations of southern writers to the debates in the several con vent ions on this subject , without feeling that their importance has been very nrnch overrated . We of course do not deny that the states adopted the constitution under a solemn sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that they regarded the articles involving slave questions as having any peculiar sanctity . We have not space to follow the address step by step any farther . We can not conclude our remarks , however , without alluding to the charge which the writers bring against the free states " of breach of faith . " They charge that the provision relating to fugitive slaves has been " praciically expunged from the constitution . " They say , " the citizens of the south in their attempts to recover their slaves , now meet , instead of aid and codperation , resistance in every form ; resistance from hostile acts of legislalion , intended to barne and defeat their claim by all souts of de // vices , and by interposing every description of impediment ; resistance from judges and magistrates ; and , finally , when all these fail , from mobs composed of blacks and whites , which by threats or force , rescue the fugitive slave from the possession of his rightful owner . " They conclude the whole by saying , " we doubt whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record . " Such is the charge . Nothing would be easier than to show its utter falsity . We had intended to give the history of legislation on this article . But we have already prolonged this discussion , if not beyond the importance of the subject , we fear beyond the patience of our readers . We must content ourselves with stating the substance . The first case respecting fugitives occurred in 1791 , when the governor of Pennsylvania made a demand on the governor of Virginia for the surrender of three persons charged with kidnapping a free negro . With this demand the governor of Virginia refused to comply . President Washington brought the matter before Congress , which resulted iu the law of 1793 , pointing out the mode of proceeding with respect both to fugitives from justice and fugitives from labor . This is the only law of Congress on the subject . The several states also passed laws . We will specify , however , only those of Pennsylvania . This state in 1780 and again in 1788 , had passed laws for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was careful to except fugitive slaves from their operation . There was no other legislation till 1826 , when at the request of the state of Maryland , a special act was passed , entitled an act " to give effect to the provisions of the constitution of the United States , relative to fugitives from labor , for the protection of free people of color , and to prevent kidnapping . " This act was entirely satisfactory to Maryland . On the one hand , it prohibited the seizure of a fn*itive slave without legal process , and on the other , pointed out what that process should be . In 1837 , one Edward Prigg seized and carried away a fugitive in violation of this act , and for this was indicted . By an understanding between the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania , the case was brought before the Supreme Court of the United States , where it was argued and decided in 1842 . This decision covers the whole ground . It was agreed it should settle all the questions which had arisen on the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaveholding states as a decision in their favor . It is the supreme law of the land and has been uniformly acquiesced in by the free states , though they have not been entirely satisfied with it . This decision vests all the power of legislating on the subject in the national government , and prohibits the states from any legislation in the premises . The national government is to execute by its own agents , this article of the constitution . Ioxv then can the // free states be guilty of " a breach of faith " in a matter where they are not permitted to act ? rI*he address says this article is binding " on all the federal and state governments , the states and the individuals composing them . " We acknowledge it is binding on the federal government , but how can the states be bound to execute it , when they are prohibited from acting in the only way in which states can act-by law  --  and that too by virtue of a decision gained by a slaveholding state against a free state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judges are from slaveholding states ? The states are bound not to interfere by law-When have they interfered against this decision ? And how is it binding on individuals ? Are they bound to volunteer as slave-catchers , to stand on guard to arrest the fugitives ? No . They are simply bound not to interfere . But suppose they do interfere , can the states punish them ? No. they are prohibited from acting . How , then , can they be guilty here of a " breach of faith ? " If individuals interfere , they violate the law of Congress , and may be punished by the national tribunals , as has often been done . rphe states have nothing to do but look on in silence . But while we repel the charge of " breach of faith , " we do not deny that the difficulties of recovering fugitive slaves have very much increased . The people of the northern states will no longer coöperate with the slave-owner or his agents ; they stand aloof , and will not go beyond their legal duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution . We acknowledge that there are difficulties in the way even of the general government , which did not once exist . But from what does this difficulty arise ? From hostility to the southern states ? From local interests ? From political factions ? From a spirit of disobedience to the constitution or from ill will to the Union ? From none of these things . It arises from that which constitutions can not destroy , which laws can not overcome , which government can not control-from the conscience and the heart of man . The civilized world has undergone a moral revolution . It is not the free states resisting the constitution , but the providence of God stirring up the divinity in the mind of man , and asserting thereby the wickedness of slavery . We have already seen that at the time the constitution was formed , the subject of slavery was scarcely agitated in the convention on moral grounds . We have seen that there was not anti-slavery feeling enough there to make any opposition to the restoration of fugitive slaves . Would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in judging of the conduct of the free states on this point , to take into consideration the great moral revolution the world has undergone in regard to slavery ? The position of inaction which we have taken , is not to be attributed to hostility to the southern states , or a desire to injure them , but to deep-seated moral feelings . // But it will be said that this is very different from what we expected . Undoubtedly a state of things has arisen which the slave states did not anticipate . But who is to blame for this ? Not the free states-not the southern states ; if there be blame , it must rest on the providence of God . But is this different state of things peculiar to this article of the constitution ? Have not many articles , in the lapse of years , operated differently from what was anticipated ? Virginia , South Carolina and Georgia were opposed to an equal representation of the states in the senate , and yet has not this very arrangement given a power to tho slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can control the government ? While at the same time , the very ground on which the slaveholding states obtained a greater than their proportion of the members of the house of i.e presentati yes-their superior wealth and resources-is found now to have no existence not to say that with respect to the principle of apportioning representation to wealth , there has been a change as great as on the subject of slavery itself . We of course do not deny the binding force of the article of the constitution under consideration ; we are merely explaining why it is , that that active codperation which might in ordinary cases seem to be due as a matter of courtesy , is withheld . We must here bring our examination of this address to a close , though we are obliged to pass by many topics which are deserving of consideration.
