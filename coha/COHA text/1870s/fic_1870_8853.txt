H. Buf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way , sister : of course , any argument 1 suggest must be wrong ; however , I flatter myself that I have had some experience . Egad ! when I think how I toiled to get my first start in the world , and succeeded in making a fortune , I deserve some credit . Miss Buf . Miss Arabella Buffer L. of Table . Brother , brother ! hold your silly tongue ; have I not made a fortune as well as yourself ! Buf . Mr. Buffer True ; but in a very different way . I had to struggle with the fieree competition of trade ; labored day and night with my young wife , who loved me in adversity , that I married at the first dawn of prosperity . Every dollar I possess was gained by my own perseverance and industry . You went as housekeeper to Mr. Brown : he died , and left you all his property . Miss Buf . Miss Arabella Buffer A proof of his esteem for my conduct and services . He knew how to appreciate a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in the house or out of it . Mr Brown was a gentleman , brother ! Buf . Mr. Buffer I am aware of that , sister . Mr. Brown ought to be done brown , for you mention his name at least five thousand times a-day . Miss Buf . Miss Arabella Buffer That 's my gratitude , brother , an article you do n't possess . But I was a great simpleton for condescending to come and live with you  --  taking charge of your household affairs , managing everything with discretion , and bringing up your daughter ; how ever , I have the comfort of knowing the dear child values her protectress . Susan . Susan C. behind table . My dear aunt , you are indeed my best friend . Buf . Mr. Buffer Woman like ; what one says the other will swear to  --  so  --  Miss Minks , your aunt is a better friend than your father ! Susan . Susan Law ! Pa , how you do go on . I quite wonder at my aunt having so much patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , child ; but it is nature to be full of cross purposes . The spirit of opposition was born with him . Ladies rise from table . Come , dear ; we wont trouble him with our presence any longer . I have something to tell you in my room . Exit L. H. , Miss Buffer and Nancy . Buf . Mr. Buffer Curse me if there 's anything worse than being pestered with an old maid . Susan 's a good girl , spoilt with her stupid old notions about decorum . Upon my soul it 's too bad . I am not master of my own establishment . Discharged the gardener yesterday without saying a word to me . The servant girls are all under her thumb , and , at her request , watch all my movements . If I kick up a rumpus , and she leaves the house , the whole of her money goes out of the family . That wont do : I guess that I must put up with her temper for the sake of number one . Egad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a confidential man-servant could be obtained  --  one that might be depended upon ; but there 's no one will put up with my sister 's annoyance . Pat sings off . Somebody singing in the garden . Who can it be ? Pat appears at window , L. C. Pat . Pat Musha ! good luck to your honor . Can you give a poor Irishman a job of work ? Buf . Mr. Buffer Bless me , you have appeared as sudden as a flash of lightning . How did you get into the garden . Pat . Pat Jumped over the wall , your honor . Buf . Mr. Buffer You are fortunate that the dogs have not laid hold of you . Pat . Pat Faith it would not have been good for their health if they had : here 's a small twig that would knock a frog into a canary bird . Shakes stick . Buf . Mr. Buffer You are a strange character ; come in , I must have some talk with you . Pat comes through window . Dear me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pat . Pat It 's all the same to me , sir , if it makes no difference to you . Buf . Mr. Buffer Well , for the matter of that , it 's more proper to come in at the door . What part of Ireland did you come from , and what 's your name ! Pat . Pat I come from Dunleary  --  my name 's Pat . Buf . Mr. Buffer Pat ! You must have some other name besides Pat . Pat . Pat Faith I have not , sir . In me you see one of the most unfortunate devils in the wide world . Sure I never was born , sir , or had either father or mother . Buf . Mr. Buffer Impossible . Pat . Pat It 's true enough for all that . I was found in a basket , like a lump of butter , all of a heap , on a St. Patrick 's day , by the roadside , and was christened Pat : and the devil another name I ever had . Buf . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . Pat . Pat I do n't know about being left ; but it 's quite certain I was found and grew up as you see , among the pigs and paraties . Buf . Mr. Buffer Laughing . Ha ! ha ! ha ! your history is quite amusing . What profession have you followed for a livelihood ! Pat . Pat Anything and everything , sir  --  nothing comes amiss to me . I was cow-boy , horse-jockey , footman , fisherman , gardener , postman , car driver , pig killer , and half a hundred other trades . Buf . Mr. Buffer Mercy on me , I never heard of one man following such a list of callings . Well , to judge from your appearance , you were not very successful in either . Pat . Pat You may say that , sir ; I was the most unlucky fellow under the sun ; the cows that were entrusted to my care , bad luck to them , ran away so far that nobody could find them ; as horse-jockey , I rode a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fell down stairs and nearly killed my mistress ; as fisherman , I capsized the boat and drowned all my companions ; when gardener , all the paraties had the rot ; as postman , I did not understand reading , so took all the letters to the wrong places ; when cab-driver , by mistake I pitched the chief magistrate into the river , and as for pig killing , the devils would not die anyway , I cut off their heads , legs and tails , but in spite of me they did n't kick the bucket . Buf . Mr. Buffer Laughing . I declare you are one of the world 's seven wonders . Pat . Pat I know it , sir , but I have one greater misfortune than all the others . Buf . Mr. Buffer Really you give the most singular account of yourself I ever heard ; pray what is the other terrible misfortune ! Pat . Pat Confused and shy . Sure I am the devil after the girls . Buf . Mr. Buffer Laughing . Ha ! ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should not think the fair sex returned the compliment by running after you . Pat . Pat There you 're out intirely , for the girls kicked up the devil 's own row about me . Buf . Mr. Buffer Aside , comes forward , R. Egad , I 'll hire this fellow , he 's quite a curiosity , and see if he will make love to my old maiden sister . His beauty will never captivate my daughter . Young man , if I take you into my service do you think there 's a possibility of avoiding those dreadful mishaps you have related to me . Pat . Pat I 'll try , sir , you know it 's a long lane that has no turning . Buf . Mr. Buffer Well , you can come on trial for a month , and I will reward you according to your merits . I 'll look you up some clothes that will make you appear decent . Go in the garden and wait a few minutes . Pat .

Faith , I must look out for my grumblers ; there 's plenty of grub on the table comes through the window , seats himself at table and eats  --  a darling little rooster , by all that 's beautiful . By the powers I 'll say grace to it . Re-enter Miss Buffer and Susan , L. H. Miss Buff . Miss Arabella Buffer Gracious ! who have we here ! Susan . Susan What a fright !

Miss Arabella Buffer My dear child , my patience is completely exhausted Brother Buffer will drive me out of my senses .
