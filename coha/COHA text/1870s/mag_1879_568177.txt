REMINISCENCES OF BAYARD TAYLOR . I MET Bayard Taylor first in 1848 . We were both young men , for we were born in tbe same year , 1826 , he in January and I in July , and we both had one thing in common , - a love of poetry and a belief that we were poets . We may have doubted some things , but that supreme thing we did not and would not doubt . It was a consolation to me , and a glory to him . I was familiar with his writings before he could have been with mine , and , knowing something of his history from the newspapers , I was prepared to like him , if we should ever meet , lie had been to Europe , and had published his Views Afoot , which had made his name widely known , while I had merely printed a few verses in the magazines . The Union Magazine , which had been started in New York a year before , was the immediate cause of our acquaintance . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a charming writer , who had read a little manuscript volume of verse which I had inflicted upon her good nnture , who had kindly loaned me books from her library , and who had accepted some of my verses for her periodical . She was the most judicious friend whom I had yet made , and she was also a friend of Enyard Taylor , who was one of her most valued contributors . She talked with me about him , and just before she went to Europe , leaving him to fill her editorial chair , she advised me to call upon him during her absence . I have tasked my memory to recover the reason of my first calling upon Bayar ( l Taylor , and I believe I may say that it was to learn the fate of a manuscript which he had received either from Mrs. Kirkland or from myself . I found him in the editorial room of the Tribune , which , I think , was on the same floor as the composing-room . It was certainly on an upper floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compositors were at work close by the desk at which he was seated , which was lumbered with books and newspapers , not forgetting the necessary editorial shears . It was one of two desks which were placed back to back , for the accommodation of himself and a fellow-editor , who was charged with the shipping news of the paper . " Is Mr. Bayard Taylor here ? " I asked , in a general way , of the two persons who were occupying these desks . The one who was nearest me looked up from his work , and replied , " I am he . " " My name is Stoddard , " I said , " and I have come to see whether you can use -. * Here I named an early production of mine , which , I believe , was addressed to Oblivion ( if so , it has reached its destination ) , and he assured me that he not only could use it , but that it would appear in a certain number of the Union Magazine , which he specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote one . He must have risen during his conversation , for I saw that he was taller than myself . I have before me now a vision of him in his young manhood ; - tall , erect , activelooking , and manly , with an aquiline nose , brig1*t , loving eyes , and the dark , ringleted hair with which we endow , in ideal , the heads of poets . There was a kindness and a courtesy in his greeting which went straight to my heart , and assured me that I had found a friend . What conversation other than that I have indicated passed between us I have forgotten , though I know that be must have asked me to come and see him , both in the editorial room and at his own room , for I visited him at both places soon afterward . Bayard Taylor and I met at night generally , for neither could call the day his own ; he had his work to do on the Tribune , and I had mine to do in a foundry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , but not the least laborious , I am sure . He wrote fifteen hours a day , he told me , scribbling book notices , 242 February , // leaders , foreign news , reports , - turning his hand and pen to everything that went to the making of a newspaper thirty years ago . There was but one night in the week when he could do what he pleased , and that was Saturday night , which we always spent together when he was in town . I looked forward to it as a school-boy looks forward to a holiday , and was happy when it came . I have forgotten where his rooms were , but as near as I can recollect they were in a boarding-house on Murray Street , not far from Broadway . They were sky parlors , as the sayin is , for he liked a good outlook ; and besides , they suited his purse , which was not plethoric with shekels . In the first of these rooms , which was set apart for his books , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , resting his soul with poetry after time prosaic labors of the day . It was poetry which had made us friends , and we never spent a night together without talking about it , and without reading the poems we had written since our last meeting . If the Muses had favored me , I brought their favors with me , arid mouthed them out in innocent audacity . I thought well of my attempts , no doubt , but never in my wildest moments did I dream of comparing myself with him . He had an imagination which surpassed mine , a command of the fervors an ( l splendors of language , and an intuitive knowledge of rhetoric and of sonorous harmonies of rhythm . I have been looking over his poetical works , and I find that there are but few of his early poems which I did not read , or which lie did not read to me , in manuscript . His mind was so fertile and his execution so rapid that he generally had one or more new poems to show me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hear him read the Metempsychosis of the Pine , Hylas , Kubleb , and Arid in the Cloven Pine . The last impressed me so deeply that I wrote a companion piece , in which I tried to embody the personality of Caliban . The conversation and the poetic practice of Bayard Taylor were the only intellectual stimulant I had , and if I wrote 243 better than I had done previous to making his acquaintance I felt that it was largely due to him . There was an enthusiasm about him which was contagio us . We were a help to each other , and we were a hindrance , also , I can see now , for we admired too indiscriminatively , and criticised too tenderly . My favorite poet was Keats , and his was Shelley , and we pretended to believe that the souls of these poets had returned to earth in our bodies . My worship of my master was restricted to a silent imitation of his diction ; my comrade 's worship of his master took the form of an Ode to Shelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest poem that his immortal genius has inspired . It is followed in the volume before me ( Poems of Home and Travel , 1855 ) by an airy lyric on Sicilian Wine , which was written out of his head , as the children say , for he had no Sicilian wine , nor , indeed , wine of any other vintage . He had cigars , however , and he tempted me into the use of the Indian weed . He tempted me , also , into the eating of oysters before we parted for the night , and it was our custom to repair to a restaurant near by , and to supply ourselves with that succulent brain food . These Saturday nights of ours were more to me , I think , than they could possibly have been to Bayard Taylor ; for if his days were passed in mental drudgery , they were passed in the society of gentlemen , while mine were passeti in hard , physical labor amonost comriion workmen and apprentices . I had no friend except himself , and no companionship but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not enjoyed myself at those seasons , I must have been more or less than human . As Cowley said of Hervey : - " To him my Muse made haste with ev'ry Strain , Whiist it was New , and Warm yet from the Brain . lie loved my worthless Rhymes , and like a Friend Would find out something to Camenend. hence now , my Muse , than caust nor me delight ; Be this my latest Verse With which I now Adorn his Herse , And this my Grief without thy Help shall write . ' If Bayard Taylor had been in easy Reminiscences of Bayard Taylor . // 244 circumstances in 1849 , I hardly think he would have gone to California as the correspondent of the Tribune . But his circumstances were not easy , so he went manfully , and wrote a capital book about his experiences in the new Eldorado , and , better still , a number of California ballads , of which any poet might have been proud . They were so popular , I remember , that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Phcebe Cary , which delighted the parodied poet , who was good-natured enough to take as well as to give . The American Parnassus was a Bedlam in the autumn of 1850 , and Bayard Taylor was the innocent cause of its madness . The Prince of Showmen had imported Jenny Lind to sin0 before his admiring countrymen , and , to flatter their national vanity , he offered a prize of two hundred dollars for an original song for her . All the versifiers in the land set at once to work to immortalize themselves and to better their fortunes , and as many as six hundred confidently expected to do so . Bayard Taylor came one afternoon early in September , and confided to me the fact that he was to be declared the winner of this perilous honor , and that he foresaw a row . " They will say it was given to me because Putnam , who is my publisher , is one of the committee , and because Ripley , who is my associate on the Tribune , is another . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name , and put my name in place of it . You shall have the money , and I will hear the abuse . " He laughed , and left me , as I thought , to do what I had suggested ; but he concluded to acknowledge the authorship himself , and stand the consequences . The decision of the committee was published next day , and the indignation of the disappointed competitors was unbounded . They rushed to all the editors whom they knew , or could reach , and these sharp-witted gentlemen , having an eye for mischief as well as fun , published their prose and their verse , which ranged from an epigram up to an epic . The choice of the committee had fallen upon only two out of the whole number of manuscripts which had been sent to them , and being in some doubt as to which of the two was the most suitable for the occasion , they showed both to Jenny Lind , who chose the shortest one , as containing the feeling she wished to express in her 0reeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayard Taylor had written , and it was accOr ( lingly set to music by Jules Benedict , and sung by her at her first concert in Castle Garden . I havc recovered this unfortunate lyric , but I shall not quote it here , for Bayard Taylor desired to have it for0otten . " Did you see the Brooklyn announcement of my lecture ? " he wrote to me in Novemher . " ( Bayard Taylor , the successful competitor of the Jenny Lind prize* . ' ) Is that song to be the only thing which will save my name from oblivion ? " I have been reading over the letters that Bayard Taylor wrote me at this time , and have been pained almost as deeply as when I first read them . They are darkened by the sickness and death of the woman he loved . Her health began to decline after his return from California . She was so ill in June that her physician had no hope , but in August she was able to make a summer trip with her parents . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote from New York , " and has herself strong hopes of her recovery . I ( lare not see anything but darkness yet , - I will not hope against hope and be deceived at last . We went to West Point , which was distractingly nQisy and unpleasant ; but , by a special godsend , Willis touched there accidentally the same day , and took us to a farm - house back of the Hi0hlands , where his family was staying , - a beautiful , quiet spot . I stayed two days , and then came here . I was up again yesterday , and will go again on Tuesday , when they think of leaving . Mary has agreed witlm me that it is best for us to be married at once , so that she can be with me here . The winter will not be so hard in the city as in the country , and then if she is to be taken from me we will at least have a few days together . It will be a sad bridal , I fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to their marriage , and added , " But were we to die for it we could not do otherwise . " He wrote me again in October from Kennett Square . There was no hope ; the worst was certain . She might linger , but death was the end . What agony we have endured in talking all this over I can never tell , but we now look to the end with calmness , if not with resignation . " He visited her again in November . She was very weak when he reached home , and had been growing weaker ever since . " I found it a hard trial to see her going from me with so slow and certain a decay . My own health is already shattered , and if this were to last much longer it would kill me outright . " As the end drew near , he strove to console himself by looking forward to what we might accomplish in the future . " We must both cling the closer to that worship which is the consecration of our lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty which men call Poetry . Without that , I should be nothing in my present desolation . Let us work our way , whatever the toil and sorrow , from vestibule to chancel , from chancel to shrine , from the lowest footstool of the temple to the high priest 's place beside the altar . The same incense that reachcs us will sanctify and embalm our griefs : they will share in our canonization . " Twelve days later ( December 27 , 1850 ) she passed through the valley of the shadow of death . " It is over . Perhaps you may already know it , but I wish to tell you so before we meet . She died on Saturday last , and was buried in the midst of that cruel storm on Monday . She is now a saint in heaven . She had no foes to pardon , and no sins to be for-Oven ) ' Such was the close of this brief episode in the early love-life of Bayard Taylor . How deeply he was moved by it the readers of his poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would force itself into his remembrance . It found a voice in that saddest of all dirges , the unnamed lyric , beginning , " Moan , ye wild winds , around the pane , " in his Autumnal Vespers ; and in The Phantom , where he describes himself sitting in the old homestead , where shadow and sunshine are chasing each other over the carpet at his feet . The arms of the sweet-brier have wrestled upward in the summers that have gone , and the willow trails its branches lower than when he saw them last . They strive to shut the sunshine out of the haunted room , and to fill the house with gloom and silence . Remembered faces come within the door-way , and lie hears voices that remind him of a voice that is dumb . " They sing , in songs as glad as ever , The songs she loved to hear They braid the rose in sommer garlands , Whose flowers to her were dear . And still , her footsteps in the passage , Her blushes at the door , Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more . " And , all forgetful of my sorrow , Unmindful of my pain , I think she has but newly left me , And soon will come again . " She stays without , perchance , a moment To dress her dark-brown hair : I hear the rustle of her garments , - 11cr light step on the stair 0 fluttering heart ! control thy tumult Lest eyes profane should see My cheeks betray the rush of rapture 11cr coming brings to me : She tarries long ; but lo ! a whisper Beyond the open door , And , gliding through the quiet sunshine A shadow on the floor ! Ab ! t is the whispering pine that calls me The vine , whose shadow strays ; And my patient heart must still await her , Nor chide her long delays . " But my heart grows sick with weary waiting As many a time before Her foot is ever at the threshold , Yet never passes oer . " Bayard Taylor sailed for Europe in the sur*smer of 1851 , and we corresponded until his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Constantinople on July 21 , 1852 , and wished that I might enjoy with him the superb view of two continents and their proudest city , which he saw whenever he lifted his head , and that he might relieve his heart by letting loose a fountain of talk 1879.3 245 // which had been sealed up for months . He had met with no one to whom he could speak of poetry and be understood , and was like a lover who had no confidant . " God be with us all , and speed the time when I may see you , and we may gossip away the midnights in my lofty attic . Fields promises to have copies of both our books waiting for me in London , so that I shall see something of you before I reach home . " I must have been the most negligent of letter-writers , for 1 see that Bayard Taylor wrote me nearly a year later , from China ( August 13 , 1853 ) , and declared that he almost vowed never to write me again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sat till the small hours in my attic ! Was it in this life , or a former one , that I knew you ? I shall be ready to greet you as a ghost , when I get home again , for you oblige me to think of you as I knew you in the past . " He was curious ( though he need not have been ) to see what I had written during his absence , and whether I had not taken a different direction from what he had anticipated . As for himself , he feared he should return to me the same mere lyrist as of old , with a few orientalisms in his imagery , an additional glow and color , perhaps , in his cup of wine , but nothing else . " I have relapsed into a traveler and adventurer ; seeking the heroic in actual life , yet without attaining it ; satisfied with the sensation of animal existence ; and more admiring and more thinking of the lusty joys of living and breathing among my fellow-men than of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has repaid me , however , by inspiring me with a warm sympathy with all kinds and classes of men , an ( l I shall have , for some years to come , friends in the deserts of Nubia , the mountfiins of Spain , and among the hardy seamen of our navy , who , I am sure , will remember me with kindly feeling . The experience of the last two years has been most valuable to me , in every respect . It has vastly increased my sum of mere knowledge , and most of all my knowledge of human nature . I have a rich store of material to work up in after-life , if I live , and my art does not forsake me . " During his absence abroad I gave a hostage to fortune in the person of a wife , and on his return to America he found two friends where ho had left but one . We no longer met at night in his lofty attic in Murray Street ( if it was Murray Street ) , but in my cosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted them , besides whatever beverage was in the house . He came to us one night in high glee , with a flask of wine which he had obtained on board of a Greek vessel . He said that Homer had drank of it , and when it was opened , and we had tasted it , I wondered at the taste , not to say the courage , of 1-Joiner , for " the Homeric beverage , " as he named it , was execrable . He stood up for it as long as he could , and tried to persuade himself that he liked it , but we laughed him out of his supposed liking , and made him confess that it was horrid stuff . He had his little enthusiasms , which he insisted on my sharing with him , though I fought against them strenuously . I tried once to smoke a nargileb in his room , but I could not do it ; neither could he , when he set about it seriously , so I had the laugh against him . He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was delighted at their excellence . If I had not been aware of the ease with which he wrote , I should have been surprised at the rapidity with which these poems succeeded each other . He had copied them out , in the order in which they were composed , in a blank book , which he presented to me after they were fairly written out . for the press , - " to keep when he was dead . " ( " Ab , woful when ! " ) They are before me now , in his perfect manuscript , and as I turn the leaves slowly , the winter nights in which I first read them return , and the quarter of a century which has intervene ( l rolls lightly away . The first of these Poems of the Orient , the sonnet entitled Smyrna , is dated October , 1851 ; the last , Jerusalem , December , 1853 . The Nilotie Drinking-Song // was written on the Nile , Ethiopia , and Kilimandjaro on the White Nile , Central Africa , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , Nubia , The Birth of the Horse , and Charmian were written in September ; and the Ode to Indolence , A Lament , The Angel of Patience , Desert Hymn to the Sun , Hymn to Air , Gulistan , Saturday Night at Sea , Yoyage of a Dream , The Sheik , The Mid-Watch , and the glorious Bedouin Song , in October , 1853 . I doubt whether the genius of Byron ever produced more and better poetry than that of Bayard Taylor within the space of a single month . The manuscript readings of these poems , and others which I might name , differ but little from the printed versions of to-day . A few lines have been omitted here anti there , and one stanza ( the third , as it was originally written ) has been dropped from the Ode to Indolence . Where thou dost sit the shadow of Despair Fell never ; Hate and Envy thence depart . Turn from thy gate the baffled hounds of care , And the great strength of slumber fills the heart . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright paths of rapture which he trod , Folds up his wing ; in Indian Song , the god Was born beneath the sleepy lotus-flower . The only fugitive escaped the riot , His presence glorifies thy deep Elysian quiet . " I have found a Persian Serenade , which is not included in the poems of Bayard Taylor ( 1865 ) , and which I copy from his manuscript . Whether . it has been printed before , I have forgotten . It was written at Granada , Spain , in November , 1852 . PERSIAN SERENADE HAaK , as the twilight pale Tenderly glows , - Hark , how the nightingale Wakes from repose ! Only when , sparkling high , Stars fill the darkling sky , Unto the nightingale Listens the rose . Here , where the fountain-tide Murm'ringly flows , Airs from the mountain-side Fan thy repose ; Eyes of thine , glistening , Look on me , listening : I am thy nightingale , Thou art my rose . Sweeter the strain he weaves , Fainter it flows Now , as her balmy leaves Blushingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Silence thy nightingale - Kiss me , my ros&amp; ! I thought , and I think so still , when I read these spirited and picturesque poems that Bayard Taylor had captured the poetic secret of the East as no English-writing poet but Byron had ; and I rejoiced heartily that they would add fresh laurels to his wreath . He knew the East as no one can possibly know it from books , or Moore would have reflected it with greatcr fidelity in Lalla Rookh . " I am quite Turkified in my habits , " Bayard Taylor wrote me from Constantinople ( July 21 , 1852 ) , " sitting cross-legged , smoking pipes , swearing by Allah , and wearing a big white turban . In Asia Minor I frequently went into mosques , and was looked upon as a good Mohammedan . " That he was not so Turkified as he would have had me suppose was evident to me while I read the Winter Solstice , the Requiem in the South , and The Mystery , three touching and beautiful poems , which no Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Western poet , unless his soul had been touched to fine tones by a great loss and a mournful remembrance . I recall many nights which Bayard Taylor passed in our rooms , and especially one when he made me proud and happy by reading me a poem about our poetic friendship , written in Greece , and inspired , I assured him , by a warmer and richer tlraught than the Homeric beverage ! Great was our merriment ; for if we did not always sink the shop , we kept it for our own amusement sole ly . Fitz James O'Brien was a frequent guest , and an eager partaker of our merriment , which somehow resolved itself into the writing of burlesque poems . We sat around a table , and whenever the whim seized us , which was often enough , we each wrote down themes on little pieces of paper , and putting them into a hat or a box we drew out one at 1879. 247 // 248 random , and then scribbled away for dear life . We put no restriction upon ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiotic even ; but we must be rapid , for half the fun was in noting who first sang out , " Finished " It was a neckand-neck race between Bayard Taylor and Fitz James O'Brien , who divided the honors pretty equally , and whose verses , I am compelled to admit , were generally better than my own . Bayard Taylor was very dexterous in seizing the salient points of the poets we girded at , and was as happy as a child when his burlesques were successful . He reminded me , I told him once , of Hatterfelts , " with his hair on end At his own wonders . " He blushed , laughed , and admitted that his cleverness pleased him , and he was glad that it pleased us , also . " It is good sport , " he remarked ; " but poetry , - that is a very different and very serious matter . " I mention these trifling intellectual duels , because they were afterwards a continual source of amusement among our common friends , and because the practice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was preparing The Echo Club , which grew out of these early wit combats of ours . When Bayard Taylor returned from abroad he found a great many invitations to lecture awaiting his arrival , and he concluded to gratify those who wished to hear and see him , for seeing had much to do with lecturing twenty-four years ago . Bating the inconvenience and occasional hardship of winter travel , it was an easy way of earning money , but it was not a way that he liked : he was naturally averse to crowds and strange faces , and eager for leisure in which to write poetry , which literally haunted him like a passion . We tracked him through his letters , which were very amusing . He was at Buffalo on the 5th of March , 1854 . " I have lectured nine times since I saw yiu , " he wrote , " and have had great success everywhere : crammed houses ; women carried out fainting ; young ladies stretching their necks on all sides , and crying , in breathless whispers , There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe me , Stoddard , it is a miserable business , this lecturing . There is some satisfaction in finding so many persons that have known you , and read what you have written , and feel a sincere interest in you , and are kind and hospitable towards you ; hut oh , the vanity and vexation of hearing the same remarks twenty times a day , and being obliged to answer questions that have become hideous by endless repetition ! I wonder how I retain my patience under it all . Sometunes I snap them rather short off , but they think it is my way of talking , and are not offended . I find that this business of traveling has entirely swamped and overwhelmed my poetical reputation , except with a few sensible people here and there . People ca n't see that if I had not beca a poet , I should never have had such success as a traveler ; Then to hear remarks made about me and my lectures , in the cars and hotels , by people who do n't know me personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not flattered by the value they put upon me . There is not the least fragment of discrimination in it . Most of them admire me hugely for having gotten over so much ground , and some are inclined to envy because the others admire . Altogether the experience is interesting and useful , but I foresee that 1 shall soon get enough of it . " He sent me a song which he had written that morning ,  --  an attempt at expressing a very vague and unsubstantial melody which had been dodging about his brain for some days . It will be found in the collected edition of hIs Poetical Works ( " Now the days are brief and dre5 " ) , but shortened by the followin , , stanza , which was inserted between the first and second stanzas as in the printed copy : - " Balm and hrightness , hloom and glee , Filled the land from sea to sea ; But the heavens grew dim with rains , Sunshine left the autumn plains , And the night sank down with snow , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second time in the summer of 1856 , accompanied by his sisters , to whom he // played the cicerone . " I never saw England so beautiful , " he wrote to us from Paris . " The weather was clear and warm , and the country greener ( if possible ) than the fields of Kennett . I saw the loveliest ivy-grown cottages ( Anne Hathaway 's among the rest ) , the fairest meadows , the most dazzling poppyfields , the picturesquest elms and oaks , but no trees , I swear ( not even the venerable oaks of Carlicote , where Shakespeare poached ) , equal to my own . Kennett went with us through Warwickshire , a journey of four days ; it was eavenly . " He had made the acquaintance of Thackeray during the previous year , while he was delivering those famous lectures which we all remember so well , and had given him a breakfast at Delmonico ' s , where 1 had my first and last sight of that great writer . They became friends and bosom cronies , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls had tongues ; it was natural , therefore , that they should soon meet again . " Thackeray was in London , " he went on to say , in the letter from which I am quoting , " and I found him as jovial and tender-hearted as ever . His daughters came to see the girls , took them out driving a whole afternoon , and we all dined together in the evening . The T. s are good girls , charmingly honest , naive , and original . The dinner came off on the 1st according to promise : present , Thackcray , Mark Lemon , Tom Taylor , Shirley Brooks , Horace Mayhew , Leach , Bradbury and Evans , Hurlbert , Story , Olmstead , and myself . " I breakfasted with Barry Cornwall and Browning . Dear old Barry ! I loved him from the first minute . He is reputed silent , but he opened his heart to me , like an uncle . He showed me all his manuscripts , - lots of unpublished poems , etc. , - and talked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial . " Bayard Taylor spent the winter of 1856-57 in Norway , Sweden , and Lapland , from which countries I presume he wrote me , though I do not find his letters . In the autumn of the latter year , we learned ( not directly , I think ) that 249 Benedict was about to become a married man , and the date of his marria*e having been made known to his friends , we celebrated it , and drank his health over three thousand miles of sea . He was married at Gotha , Germa*ny , in October , 1857 , to Marie Hansen , daughter of Geheim-Regierungsrath P. A. Hansen , . the distinguished astronomer . The Taylors proceeded to Athens , where they remained until May , 1858 . Bayard Taylor returned to America in the autumn of 1858 , and after a short visit to his beloved Kennett concluded to reside in the same house with me and mine in Brooklyn , and we spent our first Christmas under the same roof . Twenty years have passed since then , and we have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , either at his house or mine , - never till the Christmas which has just gone , the last sad Christmas since his taking off . If he had been a delightful companion as a bachelor , he was no less so as a married man : his love of poetry was as ardent as ever , his heart as warm and ten ( ler , and he was as ready to sit up and talk and smoke into the small hours of the morning . He brought from the 01 ( 1 World the receipt of a wonderful punch , which was concocted of champagne and claret , pounded ice and oranges or pineapples , and which was christened cardinal punch . The bowl of it which graced our table that first Christmas Eve quickened the memory of the happy poet , who referred to a lyric of Kenyon 's on Champagne Rose , which he admired greatly , and could repeat by heart . " Lily on legend roses floating , " he began , and went through the poem without missing a word of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we disclaimed the iniputation in the first two lines : - " And true it is they croes in pain Who sober cross the Stygian fersy ; But only make our Styx champagne , And we shall cross right merry , Ploating away on wine ! " I told him I thought I could beat that , and I read him a song in praise of claret , written over two hundred years before , by Alexander Bromne , the lawyer Reminiscences of Bayard Taylor . // poet . The closing lines , I remarked , were prophetic of what was before us : - " Since we re to pass through this lied Sea . Our noses shall our pilots he , And every soul a swimmer . " " Crown the bowl with flowers of soul , " quoted the merry bard , as he handed me a goblet of punch . We saw less of Bayard Taylor than we had hoped during tile winter , for he was away from home most of the time lecturing . When spring came he determined to remove to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was more prosperous than I he would pay the rent of the house . It would be so jolly to have a library in which we could write . And how we would write ! They would soon cease to call us " younger poets , " and we should take our proper places among the Old Masters . Young , quotha ? Why , we were thirty - four ! It was impossible to resist his enthusiasm , or to refuse his generosity . I could do neither , so we set up our two households in one house in Thirteenth Street . It was a risky tIling to do , perhaps , for the best of friends can see too much of each other ; but we managed to do it , nevertiseless , and without adding a fresh chapter to the Quarrels of Authors . We were scarcely settled in our new quarters before the Taylors were in Kennctt again , directing the building of a country-seat . Bayard Taylor was his own architect , and apparently his OWII superintendent , overlooking brick-makers , stone-cutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Napoleonic business for a poet . " To-day we placed the great corner-stone of the tower , with all due ceremony , " he wrote on June 7th . " Under it is a box of zinc , containing a copy of Views Afoot ; an original poem by me , to be read five hundred years hence by somebody who never heard of me ; some coins ; a poem by R. H. S. in his own MS. ; and various small things . All of us - even Lily - contributed a trowelful of mortar . I broke the neck of a bottle on the stone , and poured oblation to all good Lares and Penates , an ( l then gave the workmen cakes and ale . " February , If we had not lived so happily together , in town and country , during the next two years , I should doubtless remember the little events of our common life more clearly than I do . We were all young enough to be merry , and we passed our leisure as Cowper and Thurlow passed theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ma ( le the most of what we possessed , and were never so happy as when we had our friends about us . Our home was frequented by artists , by men of letters , and by poets . We were a nest of singing birds , as Dr. Johnson told Mistress Hannah More , when he showed her his old rooms in Pembroke College . We made much of Christmas , which we kept as the poet 's wife had been accnstomed to see it kept in her German fatherland . We had a Christmas tree , which was installed in state in the back parlor the day before Christmas , and was decorated with little glass globes , tiny candles , flags , ribbons , and what not , as full as it could hold . The ladies of the household were the only ones who had access to it , and they arranged our Christmas presents on its branches , and on tables and stands around it . The folding doors were closed , and we were not permitted to enter the room until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were as eager as children in the interim , laughing in our sleeves at the gifts we were to make , and puzzling our heads over the gifts we were to receive . We rode each other 's hobbies , exhausting our ingenuity in selecting oddities to provoke laughter and promote good fellowsllip . We invited a young poet to spend a Christmas Eve with us , and showered upon him all sorts of musical instruments : drums , trumpets , fiddles , fifes , penny whistles , jew's-harps , - everything , in short. , that would indicate his devotion to the Muse . We made more of our Christmas Eves than of all other nights in the year . And we shall never spend them togetiler again , - never ! " No motion has he now , no force ; He neither hears nor sees ; Rolled round in earth 's diurnal course with rocks , and stones , and trees . " Reminiscences of Bayard Taylor . // Bayard Taylor finished his country house , " Cedarcroft , " in the summer of 1860 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never before known in Pennsylvania . Our families were together , as in New York , and we , their lords and masters , resolved to surprise them , and ourselves , by writing a play . We went into a quiet room , and sketched out a trifle with which we hoped to amuse the expected visitors . There was but one room in which it could be acted , and as scenery was not practicable we managed to have the action take place in the parlor of a hotel which we named the " Effervescing House , " and located at Saratoga . We studied our company , nn ( l settled upon the number we thought we could depend upon , and upon the parts which would be likely to suffer least at their hands ; then we set to work , and wrote as rapidly as our pens would travel over the paper , and when our company was letter perfect in the text , and in their stage directions , we went to an old disused printing-office in Kennett , and set up the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEATRE ! GREAT ATTRACTION ! Saturday , August 18 , iSGO , Will be presented for the first time a NEW COMEDY In one act , entitled , LOVE AT A HOTEL ! By the world-renowned dramatic authors , Mr. B. T. Cedarcroft and Mr. R. It . S. Cu tomhouse . This was followed by the dramatis personce : Mr. Charles kugustus Moutmorency , a fast young gentleman , without any visible means of support ; Captain Morton Price , U. S. A. ; Mr. A. Binks , proprietor of the " Effervescing House ; " Barney O'Brien , porter ; Miss Araminta Delaporte , a sentimental old maid of French descent , with a nervous dread of boys , mice , etc. ; Miss Julia Grindle , her niece ; and Mehitable Jones , of Squam Neck , chambermaid . The " cometly " was a great success , and deserved to be ( before a country audience ) , for there was not an original scene , situation , thought , or word in it . it had been played so many times before , in one form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; and it did not fail . We amused our audience in the acting , as we had amused ourselves in the writing , and we parted , on tue best of terms . If I were called upon to single out of my thirty years ' reminiscences of Bayard Taylor the one above all others by which I should prefer to remember him , it would be the night on which we celehinted his fortieth birthday ( January 11 , 1865 ) . His friends prepared for it beforehand , each thinking what would be most absurdly appropriate ( or inappropriate ) to present him , and all keeping their own counsel , ransacking invention for preposterous Inementoes . It fell to my lot to act as the scribe , and as The Century had lately printed a voluminous account of its celebration of the seventieth birthday of Mr. Bryant , I resolved to burlesque that account . I imaginetl the decoration of Bayard Taylor 's chainhers , the gathering of his friends , an ( 1 wrote letters of regret from those who could not be present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their letters . The reading of these missives and sundry copies of verse , and the bestowal of our mementoes , provoked more fun than had ever before , or has ever since , distinguished our Taylor nights . It was not so much that they were comical in themselves ( though they were ) as that we were willing to fool and be fooled to the top of our bent . The table was on a roar till long after midnight . We had a meeting in Bryant 's commemoration at the Century in November of the past year , a few nights after what would have been - if he had lived - his eighty-fourth birthday . Mr. John Binelow , who had known him long , delivered an address , and three Century poets were present , one only in the spirit . Bayard Taylor was represented by an Epicedium , ' which was read for him , and Mr. Stedman read a noble poem , which the readers of The Atlantic will remember . Before two months were passed Bayard Taylor had joined the dead master ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never see his face nor take his hand 1879. 25t // again , I am feelingly reminded of what we are . " There 's nothing serious in mortality . " As I have mentioned Bayard Taylor 's friend Thackeray , let me close my imperfect tribute to his memory by reading a little sermon by that great lay preacher , which was a favorite with us , and which has now a melancholy interest for me . " I mind me , " he says , in the person of his alter ego , Mr. Brown , " I mind me of many a good fellow who has laughed and talked here , and whose pipe is put out forever . Men I remember as dashing youngsters the other day have passed into the stage of old fogies ; they have sons , sir , of almost our age , since first we joined the Polyanthus . ' Grass grows over others in all parts of the world . Where is poor Ned ? where is poor Fred ? Dead rhymes with Ned and Fred too . Their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the en ( l of the Club list under the dismal category of Members Deceased , ' in which you and I shall rank one day . Do you keep that subject steadily in your nmind ? I do not see why we should not meditate upon Death in Pall Mall as well as in a howling wilderness . There is enough to remind one of it at every corner . There is a strange face looking out of Jack 's old lodgings in Jermyn Street ; somebody else has got the Club chair which Tom used to occupy . He has been sent for , and has not come back again . One day Fate will send for us , and we shall not return ; then people will come to the Club as usual , saying , Well , and so poor old Brown is gone. * R. H. Stoddard.
