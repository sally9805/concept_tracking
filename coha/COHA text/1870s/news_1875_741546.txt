txt Supreme Court , the legal contest for the Governorship of that State is closed . That is to say , it is closed so far as BROOKS and BAXTER are concerned . There is a small remainder in the shape of an unsettled dispute between VOLNEY V. SMITH and . the present Governor . SMITH pretends that BAXTER 'S term of office has not expired ; that he , SMITH , as Lieutenant Governor , is entitled to act as Governor for the rest of BAXTER 'S term , and that BaxrEn , by surrendering his office to a newly-elected successor , has " abdicated " the Gubernatorial office . It is useless to pursue this branch of Arkansas politics . The whole disheartening complication , let us hope , is disposed of forever . The report of the evidence taken in Judge POLAND 'S committee shows that there was as much confusion in the domestic affairs of the State as there was in its politics . The same interminable complications that existed in political matters seem to have extended into every department of activity . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is in it an element of the tragic which the squabbles of the several contending Governors lack . One hardly knows how to regard the story of the Jefferson County coffins , and what the witnesses called " the cremation exercises . " When KING WHITE 'S Militia were arresting the Brooks men through the country , one Deputy Sheriff was brought in under guard and treated to the sight of four black coffins set up in the court-house . These were labelled " Powell Clayton , " " J. W. Dorsey , " " Poker Jack , " and " Judge Whytock " respectively , and each bore the additional legend of " D. D. D. , " which mysterious letters signified that the expected . tenants of these shells were already dead , condemned , and delivered . It turned out , later , that the coffins were prepared for a mock cremation exercise , in which certain obnoxious persons were to be burned in effigy , and the expenses of which were paid by " a party of Young Bourbon Democracy . " But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weak nerves who had a wholesome terror of death . More serious than this were the frequent murders and assassinations , of which we get some glimpses in the committee 's report . Intimidation seems to . have been very generally resorted . to wherever votes could be made . In this game , the negroes usually suffered most .. One witness , one of the numerous deputy sheriffs of that period , testified to the killing of ARRAMS , a negro whom he was taking peaceably to jail , followed  --  by a volunteer posse of white men . These volunteer defenders of the law killed the unarmed and manacled negro while the Deputy Sheriff was conveniently sauntering in the rear . There was no pretense that the prisoner could or would escape . He was thus disposed of to save trouble . The negroes , hunted and pursued , would turn on their tormentors occasionally , and when they dtd they usually managed to have an arsenal of weapons near at hand . One of these men , who testified that he belonged to " the state-house gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party of armed men approaching his house ; that he got behind a plank fence with a double-barrel gun and ' a pistol ; then he got another gun and two more pistols . and , being reinforced by a neighbor with more firearms . he staid m the neighborhood all night ; and , when daylight came , he " took precautions and knocked about all lay . " This poor fellow , armed as he was , seems to have spent all his time in " knocking about . " No sooner did he begin to relate to the committee his story of adventure than he slid off into an indistinct gurgle of " knocking about the rest of the time . " But he knew enough to " get the drop , " as he called it , ou his persecutors , and his battery was kept with " a bead " drawn on them . Another much-beset colored man testified that , after a white man had stormed about his house all night , he got up and found the white man easy to conquer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking as he did so , " Hold up your hands or blow your brains out . I 've been fooled all night and you 'll not fool with me any more . " The victorious negro then relates how he " went through " the white man 's pockets and found only twenty-five cents and a lot of cartridges . The cowed white mau was disarmed and had his money restored to himby his conqueror , who informed him at parting that if he did not leave those parts within an hour he would kill him . Such scenes as these give an outsider some idea of the condition of things in Arkansas during the late struggle . We wish we could be sure that they would never be repeated . But , whether they are or not , it is necessary that people in more peaceful States should . understand how these long contests for political supremacy demoralize the people and desolate the laud . It is not alone that human life is wasted and bloody crimes are committed . Industry is unsettled ; life-long enmities are engendered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the troubled districts to any form of respect for law , life , and property . All parties to these quarrels readily resort to violence , and the blessings and arts of peace return slowly to a country so torn by domestic warfare .
