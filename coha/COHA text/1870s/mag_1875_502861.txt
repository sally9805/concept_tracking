FflIIE military history of the American Revolution has never yet been fairly written . While the wars of Europe have been critically investigated by Napier , Jomini , Von Kausler , and Bulow , the struggles for liberty on the American continent have passed almost unnoticed for purposes of military criticism . The same may be said of the great civil war of 1861- ' 65 , which remains to this day unanalyzed and almost unappreciated in Europe , full of value as are its lessons . Two causes have contributed to this : an undue exaltation of the accounts on one side and an undue contempt of those on the other . The American civil historians of the Revolution have failed to appreciate the really important military facts developed by the war , and have too frequently indulged in indiscriminate laudation of the Americans and indiscriminate depreciation of British efforts . English historians , on the other hand , have been prone to undervalue American successes in that war , the more because it is the only contest in which English vanity has lately suffered a severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maid of Orleans , nearly forgotten in the lapse of three centuries , the American Revolution is the only instance in history in which the English race , once having obtained possession of a country , has been driven from it by a series of reverses . The only really fair histories of the American war written by Englishmen are those contributed by military actors in that war , after their final defeat . The frame of mind of a defeated man who is compelled to own himself defeated is more apt to be candid than that of a victor , who is easily tempted to magaify his own successes . The English civil historians , writing for a public accustomed to be fed on accounts of victories , conceal and distort many of those facts which the more candid soldier freely admits . In searching for tile authenticated facts on the battle of Bunker Hill we are forced to go as much to English as to American sources for information , and it is due to the English to admit that their accounts are in the main free from partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general there are none so impartial as Irving 's " Life of Washington ; " but in the direction in which we are now investigating there is one book worth all the rest-we refer to Frothingham 's " Siege of Boston . " It is seldom that a modern historical work will stand the test of verifying evidence so well as this work . Experto crede . It is so common , in investigating special events , to find the evidence appealed to by the author in foot-notes to be manifestly garbled or of the hearsay kind , that many people have contracted an undue contempt for modern histories , especially the famous ones . When two historians , each celebrated , give diametrically opposite accounts of the same battle , differing as to numbers , time , and place , it is hard to believe in famous histories . Frothingham is one of the very few whose account bears verification by the evidence of eye-witnesses , and who does not rely on the reports of the generals of one side only . For this is to be remarked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to numbers , except in the reports of killed and wounded . A. general will catalogue the names of his units of force with correctness , so-and-so 's brigade , such and such regiments , but we hardly know of an instance on record in which a general , in his official dispatch either of victory or defeat , gave a correct estimate of numbers . The force is nearly always computed at // " about so many thousand , " when the morning report will show a considerable excess . With the morning reports of both sides to check the accounts of both generals , and accurate maps to mark the positions , the story of a battle can generally be made out clearly , and the truth of general statements determined with accuracy from conflicting particular accounts . With the single aim of finding the truth about the battle of Bunker Hill , let us in this its centennial year enter on the task of finding why it was fought , what it was , and what it led to . Why was it fought ? We must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since the passage of the Stamp act and the various repressive laws of the English Parliament , the most intense bitterness of feeling had been spreading in the English colonies . We in these days have little idea of the extent of that feeling . It appears very clearly in Moore 's " Diary of the Revolution , " i ' a book made up of extracts from the contemporary n*vspapers of all shades of opinion . From these papers , then as now the index of public opinion , we find the gradual spread of hostility to Great Britain , and the commence - ment of the opprobrium attached to the word " British . " It is remarkable that all through the Revolutionary war , and before and after , we seldom meet the word " English " or England . There was some reason in the distinction , for it does seem as if the old liberty-loving spirit of England , which gradually shaped its unwritten constitution , was of a very different complexion from that stern , repressive government introduced by the house of Hanover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England first acquired her huge colonial empire , and by the conquests of Canada and India , raised herself to the first rank among European powers . It was in those reigns that she commenced her career of blood and plunder in the east , and * Ilew York , Charles Scribner. 1860. all her grand conquests date from the final union which made Great Britain . Be that as it may , it appears that a sentiment of intense dislike to Great Britain and things " British " had begun in the minds of Americans in those days , and that this feeling did not extend *o the component parts of the kingdom to the same extent . It survives to this day in the opprobrious use *f the word " Britisher " by Americans , just as its complement explains the sentiment of veneration and affection manifested by American travellers toward the commonest sites of English historical ground , a feeling often remarked on with surprise by Englishmen . The sentiment , like all good honest hatreds , was born of provincialism . No hater like your good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or American . Had intercourse between America and England been as constant as it is now , there is little doubt that there would have been no Revolution . Both parties would have known each other better , and realized that the devil is not so black as he is painted by the hand of ignorance . But in. those days our forefathers on both sides of the water saw but little of each other . When roads were few and poor , and settlements were restricted to a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast and the banks of navigable rivers , few people found time or inclination to cross the ocean . The average colonist , beginning with a superstitious veneration for the old country and British troops , had had his illusions cruelly disturbed by the Braddock defeat and the many disasters of the French Indian war . The middle of the eighteenth century was in fact prolific of disasters for Great Britain , including Fontenoy , and only redeemed by the close of a long and troublesome war . That war had cost a great deal of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford to say that there was much reason in the British demand that the colonies should be taxed to pay the expense of the French-Indian war waged for their // protection . It was only the mo*le of taxation that was rightfu*lly complained of as unjust . Had a request been proffered instead of a demand madewhy , perhaps we should not be celebrating the centennial of Bunker Hill to-day . As it was , the matter-of-course demand was ill taken . The old English spirit rebelled against the new British arrogance . After all , it was the old blood speaking out . Massachusetts and all her sisters east of the Hudson were English to the backbone . It was New England that lighted the fires of rebellion against oppression , at Concord , just as old England lighted them at Edge Hill a century and a quarter before . The weight of the fighting done in the Revolution was done by men of English race , whether in New England or Virginia , and the only place where the hold of Great Britain remained strong till the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam . Even the descendants of the cavaliers in Virginia and the Carolinas were carried away by the ties of blood , to join their brethren in the north , just as , nearly a century later , they were carried away by the same sentiments of loyalty and kindred , to espouse the cause of their other brethren of the South . Their conduct was in both cases very similar . Without rancor or bitterness , the Virginians yet threw themselves into the strife when the necessity arrived , though they were slow to enter the quarrel . In 1775 their fate was happier than in 1865 , but in both wars they held the same part of brave and loyal gentlemen , fighting only for what they deemed a duty , when , left alone , they would have preferred peace . Toward peace their traditions and those of their fathers inclined them . They were generally descendants of the cadets of good families , accustomed to reverence authority and stick to the Church of England . They were courtly and hospitable , fond of field sports , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were more disposed than might othc*rwise have been by the presence of the Huguenot colonies planted by William III . on the banks of the James . Some of the noblest figures of the Revolution , grouping round Washington , Henry , Lee , Jefferson , and Madison , are those of Virginians , and they first sounded the note of warning against the pernicious principle of taxation without representation . The Virginians , however , to a man , were not given to fighting without clearly understanding the reason ; for once in , they realized that the battle must be fought out to the bitter end . The rancor of feeling of the New Englanders finds no parallel in Virginian manifestoes . The language is more stately and polite , and the hope of an accommodation more prominent . There is more reason and temperance in their arguments , and their representatives as a rule are men of higher culture . The New Englanders and Virginians , we must remember , were recruited mainly from the two opposing stocks of which the English race is to-day compounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Saxon names and lineages , possessed much of the old Saxon character ; while the Virginians , sprung from cadets of Norman houses , partook of the Norman character in a degree . Neither was unmixed , but there was a leading trait in each , one Saxon , the other Norman . What those leading traits were is very beautifully elaborated by Henri Taine. * In the Saxon it was dogged courage and perseverance , the relic of the old Berserkir ferocity , combined with a spirit of rugged independence that submits to no chief save him elected by its own vote . Add to this a gloomy imagination , abounding in picturesque imagery , full of vigor beyond that of any southern race , a spirit of intense love , delighting in self-sacrifice , strong family affection , and equally strong hatred , and we have the old German in his native wilds , the only real republican the world ever saw . * " Engliah Literature , " Vol . I. , Cap . I. // While Greece and Rome were narrow oligarchies , always tending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be republican to the backbone , electing its chiefs , holding parliaments , trying its criminals by juries of their fellows , tenacious of the doctrine that every man 's house is his castle . In the Norman , with his gay and romantic mind , his love of pomp and state , his music and polished poetry , his dashing courage in the field , his religion , his respect for his knightly oath , we have the type of the race that gave the world CHIVALRY . That race , by superior finesse , conquered the English at Senlac , and held them in bondage for three centuries , to be vanquished by the superior " staying qualities " of the Saxon at the last . The decay of chivalry in the fifteenth century has been ascribed to many causes : the decay of the race which produced it has been too often left out of sight . The dogged Saxon conquered the Norman and drove out his language , and the decay of chivalry dates from the foundation of the English tongue . Here were these Virginians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much of their ancestral characteristics left in them , modified by mixture of Saxon and other bloods , for the Normans were always a mixed race . Here were these New Englanders , English to the backbone , with all the English gloom , will , poetry , turbulence , ferocity ( sleeping , but ready to waken ) . Both races were threatened with oppression by the British giant , whose grasp was then on three continents . Which race would strike the first blow ? It was not hard to say , and the result only justified the doctrine of chances . The Saxon New Englanders struck the first blow , and opened the contest that was to revolutionize a continent : occasion , the injudicious march of a detachment to seize some military stores not worth seizing ; result , the Concord fight and the siege of Boston . That Concord fight , though a small one , was a terrible one . It never could have taken place with any other race than the English . When the truth is told about that fight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of . It was a fight of bulldog against bulldog , with no let-up to either side . The little column of English troops that did their duty and obeyed their orders so doggedly that day , might have marched through any other country in the world almost unopposed . Better troops never trod a battle field , and the guerrilla peasantry of any other race would have recoiled in awe from their imposing front . The Concord minute-men who bore up under the tremendous moral weight of those veteran troops had their hardest victory to gain before a shot was fired . Their comrades at Lexington in the early dawn had been swept away like chaff , and almost annihilated by the head of the English column. * In its ranks were veterans of Minden and Dettingen , and the prestige of victory after victory was with them . In the face of all this , the spirit of the minute-men , from the accounts of eye-witnesses , seems to have been only that of a burning desire to fight at any hazard . Their officers ' only effortst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing began , the spell of invincibility was broken , and without leaders , every man for himself , the new English flew at the old English . How the odds gathered against these latter may be inferred from the fact that no less than thirty towns sent their quotas to fight this little column of eight hundred men . They poured in from all quarters , and in numbers increasing every moment . At the least computation there must have been three to one against Colonel Smith 's expedition , for it is hard to imagine an average of less than eighty men for a town and its environs , when every man * " American Archives , " Fourth Series , Vol . II. , page 490 , Ut supra . Depositions. t Captain Parker 's deposition and others , above quoted . // came that could come . The English column had accomplished its mission , and had a far more difficult task to perform . It had to return to Boston , through a country swarming with foes . These foes were only guerrillas , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen before or since in warfare . They were descendants of the old Berserkirs , cool and desperate in courage , reckless of danger , and pitiless in their revenge . It was useless to charge them . Drive them off in one direction , and they pressed on you from the other . They formed a thin circle of flame that was invulnerable . They were not an army ; they had no trains to attack , no city to threaten ; there was nothing to take hold of . At every turn of the road death lurked behind tree , wall , and rock , while every bush hid a rifleman . Had it been possible , Colonel Smith would have held Concord against attack , and despatched a courier to Gage for help . Had he known what a march was before him , he would doubtless have done so , for at least six thousand men were necessary to get him out of his scrape . But could such a courier have reached Boston in safety after the first fire from the minute-men at the have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Concord toward Lexington , and from that moment his fate was sealed . He was surrounded , and by foes as relentless as the Saxon race has always been in battle . There was no let-up to the persecution . It was a grim slaughter , to which the English could interpose no adequate resistance* Fettered by old tradition , they marched in column of platoons of three ranks , in the road , and fired in volleys at unseen foes . Under such a persecution , kept up with increasing vigor all the way from Concord to Lexington , on fasting stomachs , after a night march from Boston of fifteen miles , men and officers dropping every minute , and every fresh turn of the road revealing new foes , it is to this day a standing marvel that the English troops retained a semblance of order . We say it boldly : any other troops in the world would have dissolved into a mob of fugitives long before they got to Lexington . An equal number of Napoleon 's Old Guard or of any troops in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered in mass . The little English column , surrounded by foes , moved on , and reached Lexington in fair order , having repulsed every assault . There they met friends , and our sympathies are turned from them once more to those minute-men , with all the old Berserkir 's pitiless hatred , and all the old Berserkir*s dogged courage . These men were rude farmers , and the odds were made more even against them . Instead of 800 men , a mass of 1,800 , with two field guns , faced them now . Fierce and hungry for revenge as ever , no sooner did the foe stir from his resting-place on the return than the grim hunt recommenced , and continued to the very gates of Boston . The odds were turned and the slaughter more even , but the minute-men recked not of that ; and it is with justice that they pride themselves on the day of Concord . It roused the country effectually , and before Gage had gathered resolution for a second attempt , it was impossible ; for Boston was invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching behind their earthworks , from Cambridge to Dorchester . In order to comprehend the immediate reason for the assault on Bunker Hill , it is necessary for the reader to understand the topography of Boston . The city itself is built on a low promontory , the handiwork of the ocean , and resembling its greater neighbor , Cape Cod , on a small scale . But all of Boston is comparatively low , Beacon Hill being of small elevation . Opposite to it , on the north and south , are some hills , which quite command it . On the south are Dorchester Heights * Frothiagham 's " Siege of Boston , " p. 74 , and notes . // by Dorchester Neck , the isthmus that connects Boston with the mainland . On the north are Bunker and Breed 's Hills , just above Charlestown , a cape that juts out half way to meet Boston . Of late years we have been informed by antiquaries that Bunker Hill is behind Breed 's Hill , and that on the latter the battle was fought . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , but there was none at the time itself . In the newspaper accounts of the battle , English and American , and on the English map of the ground made by Lieutenant Page , of Sir William Howe 's staff , the front hill is called Bunker Hill , the back one Breed 's Hill . There is no dispute as to the locality of the battle , only as to whether the names have been interchanged or not . In the present account we propose to stick to the old fashion* and call the front hill Bunker 's , the back one Breed 's . Any reader given to antiquarianism , and belonging to the Breed 's party , can interchange the names all through this article , if so disposed , the locality being undisputed . For some weeks the American militia were content to blockade the British in Boston , they themselves gathering strength behind their fortifications till they numbered about 13,000 men . In the mean time Gage was receiving forces also , and seven weeks after the day of Concord he possessed nearly ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Minden . As we have said , the colonists at first manifested no intention to do more than blockade Boston . This was easily done , for the neck was narrow , and no one could leave Boston by land while that was guarded . On the other side was Charlestown ; but Charlestown , with its backing of hills , was a peninsula as easily guarded as Boston , being connected with the mainland by an equally narrow neck . Very wisely the colonists drew their forces into a great semicircle reaching from neck to neck , watching the shallow bay and cutting off all communication with Boston save by water . Their line was long and ill guarded , but strengthened by intrenchments , especially at Cambridge , back of Charlestown Neck . About the middle of June Gage seems to have first waked up to the fact that Dorchester Heights and Bunker Hill , if the enemy chose to occupy them , might be made the site of batteries that would render Boston untenable in a single day . With him was now Sir John Burgoyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gage had determined to seize Dorchester Heights on June 18 , Charlestown Heights ( Bunker and Breed 's Hills ) being reserved for a few days after . These hills seized and fortified , Boston was safe from bombardment . Alas for the fallacy of human expectations ! June 18 was to prove a day too late . On the night of the 10th the Yankees began to work , and the morning of the 17th found them fully established and partially intrenched in a redoubt on Bunker Hill . We can fancy the way those militiamen worked over night . It was pleasant summer weather . The spring had been unusually early in that year , just a century ago . The moon was five days past the full , and rose about midnight ; and it was about midnight the work commenced . There were no lanterns about . Quietly and earnestly the task was pushed on in the uncertain light of the moon , and for four hours it progressed rapidly . These militiamen , farmers all , were used to handling the spade , and worked better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent bay and harbor , with the sleeping city , twinkling with lights , at less than half a mile 's distance . Silently they labored . Those men were intelligent soldiers , like the volunteers of 1861 . They were really thinking bayonets . They knew that they were provoking a fight with the strongest power in the civilized world . As at Concord bridge , the hardest victory those men *Am . Arch. , Fourth Series , Vol.11. , 1094-5. // had to gain was before the fight began . They had to face the moral force of a great empire , then unconquered by any one . Cooped up on the little peninsula of Charlestown , they would have no chance for the elastic skirmishing tactics of Concord and Lexington . They must fight regulars like regulars if it came to a fight . With all these thoughts running in their heads , they worked grimly on , the gibbous moon climbing higher and higher . Below them , in the mysterious gloom of the harbor , lay a man-ofwar , neat and trim , her tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving only topsail and lower yards crossed , man-of-war fashion . She lay about half way between Charlestown and Boston , her crew below , nothing but the drowsy watch on deck . It was the little frigate Lively , of twenty guns . Near the Lively lay another vessel , somewhat larger , but not so trim and seamanlike . There was a certain slouchy air about her rigging that told the initiated that this was no man-of-war . She had her topgallant and royal yards crossed , and there was an absence of precision in her trim that contrasted with the dainty order of the Lively . This was the Symmetry transport , armed with twenty nine-pounders . The guns of the Lively , like those of most small frigates in those days , were long twelves . The Americans were the first to bring out twenty-four-pounder frigates , and that not till long after . Besides the Lively and Symmetry , there were three larger frigates in the harbor , the Somerset , 68 , the Cerbeins , 30 , and the Glasgow , 24 . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the depth of Water not being sufficient . The Falcon , a smaller gunboat , was within range , but her force is left unknown from accessible authorities , and was probably not considerable . At last the gray , uncertain light of early dawn began to creep over the scene . It was within five days of midsummer , and the sun rose at twenty minutes past four . At four o'clock it was light enough to see plainly , and even before that the lookout of the Lively had reported the Yankees at work on Bunker Hill . This early notice shows that the British must have realized their ticklish position in Boston , and kept a sharp watch on the surrounding hills . The captain of the Lively was a thorough sailor , trained in the school of Rodney and Howe . He did not hesitate long what to do . He went to quarters silently , got springs on his cable , and all of Boston sprang from its sleep at four o'clock , startled by the sound of a brisk cannonade from the Lively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees had stolen a march , and it was too late . Already the work was six feet above the ground , the gun platforms were in it , and two guns had been brought up . Behind the low embankment were three regiments , those of Prescott , Frye , and Bridge ; while two hundred of the Connecticut men had been detailed as a working party to help their comrades of Massachusetts . Besides these , there was Captain Gridley 's company of artillery , with their two guns , numbering fortynine men . When the Lively opened on the Bunker Hill redoubt there were present about thirteen hundred men in and about that work. * Of course a sudden cannonade , opened at dawn from the harbor of a large city , could not remain long unnoticed . Before many minutes the Symmetry was at it , the little Falcon had swept up close to Charlestown and opened her fire , while even the large frigates joined in at long range , all firing at the impudent Yankees , who kept on , digging away , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent one . It is not often that peaceable citizens get a chance to see a battle at their own doors . Usually the defences of a city are far out of gunshot , and an enemy is met a long way off . * Prescott 's , Frye 's , and Bridge 's regiments , a fatigue party of 200 Connecticut troops , and Gridley 's artillery company , being 1,312 men all told . // Real war is hard work , made up of hunger , fatigue , dirt , and a very smitil spice of romance . This Revolution began exceptionally . Bunker Hill was an exceptional battle . It was like an old tournament fought before the ladies for a point of honor . It never could have happened had Washington been in command from the first . Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights would have been seized long before Gage was ready to take them back . On the other hand , had Gage been anything but a figurehead , both points would have been fortified long before : As it was , Gage was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , and Bunker Hill . was seized just in time to provoke a bloody fight . All the morning the cannonade roared . There was a tremendous noise . Copp 's Hill in Boston itself was just within long range of Bunker Hill , and an English battery was firing away from thence . The ships of war battered away with their twelve-pounders , and the Somerset tried her long eighteens . As far as noise , and fire , and smoke went , the majesty of war was up in arms . But after all , there was very little harm done . From the edge of Boston to Bunker Hill was thirteen hundred yards , * and the best range of a twelve-pounder is about nine hundred . The guns carry to two thousand yards , it is true , but we must remember that rifled guns were unknown then , and the accuracy of fire of a smooth-bore at long range is a fallacy . The balls went overhead , struck the hill , threw up the dirt , knocked off branches of trees , sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killedt one man . So utterly futile was this cannonade , in common with similar exhibitions in all ages . Seldom or never do results follow commensurate with an expenditure of this sort . Even the moral effect of the imposing thunder of guns and crashing of round shot quickly wore off , while those obstinate Yan * Page 's Map , reprinted in Frothingliam. t Asa Pollard . See Frothingliam , 126 and note . kees continued to strengthen their redoubt . The morning went on , and Boston began to buzz like a hive of bees . Orderlies were galloping to and fro , boats clustered at the Charlestown ferry dock , and the troops of King George began to turn out . The cannonade had proved ineffectual , and Gage saw that the Yankees must be dislodged at any hazard . He resolved to storm the uncompleted redoubt . From the lines at Cambridge and at Bunker Hill itself , the farmer-soldiers , watching the city , traced the turmoil and movement , and knew what was coming . The attack was anticipated long before it was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British mustered their storming column . By noon the latter had all been ferried across , and commenced their attack . The battle of Bunker Hill was opened . It is now time to examine the forces of the contending parties at the moment of attack . Gage in his published despatch admits sending on the first expedition the fifth , thirty-eighth , forty-third , and fifty-second regiments , with ten companies of light infantry , ten of grenadiers , and two full batteries of the Royal Artillery , making a strength , as he puts it , of " about 2,000 men. * ' He admits sending as reinforcements the Forty-seventh battalion and the first battalion of marines , with " some companies of grenadiers and light infantry . " In the list of killed and wounded from the same set of despatches are names from sixteen regiments and the Royal Artillery . One of these regiments , the twentysecond , was , however , clearly not in , their loss being confined to LieutenantColonel Abercrombie , who was on the staff of Sir William Howe , commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments then had ten companies , only eight of which constituted the battalion proper . The other two were the so-called flank companies , one of grenadiers , the tallest men of the regiment , the other light infantry , the smallest . Thus Howe 's // first column had four full regiments of ten companies , and the flank companies of six more ; while his reinforcement was of two full regiments , and the flank companies of two more . The second marines made a last reinforcement . Unfortunately we have no morning report of the number of the English regiments , and can only approximate it . The average strength of a company in the English service is about forty men , and allowing this for the average at Bunker Hill , we find in the first attack fifty-two companies , or about 2,080 men ; in the second , fourteen companies , or 560 men ; in the Last , the second marines , 320 men , or a total of 2,960 . Including the artillerymen , the whole force was thus over 3,000 men with twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Americans ? They had no one chief to give a connected report till more than a week later . When Washington came he sent to Congress a report of the killed and wounded . From the various independent accounts we find what regiments were present at different times of the day . We have seen that they commenced at four A. M. , with .1,300 men . All the British witnesses watching from Boston testify to seeing* columns of troops pouring in during the whole of the fight . The regiments which lost men in different proportions during the fight were those of Frye , Little , Brewer , Stark , Woodbridge , Scammon , Bridge , Whitcomb , Ward , Gerrish , Reed , Prescott , Doolittle , Gardner , Patterson , and Nixon , besides the Connecticut troops , who are reported in a lump , and of which the number present is uncertain . Their commander was Putnam . The numbers of these regiments are given in Washington 's report , July 9 , 1775 , as follows : Frye , 313 ; Little , 405 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 413 ; Bridge , 318 ; Whitcomb , 446 ; Ward , 376 ; Gerrish , 181 ; Reed , 384 ; Prescott , 332 ; iDoolittle , 250 ; Gardner , 380 ; . Pat * Am . Arch. , Fourth Series , Vol . II. , 1091-6 . Letters . te*son , 311 ; Nixon , 337 . Stark 's regiment is not recorded . He is lumped in with the New Hampshire troops , the same as the Connecticut , without distinction of regiments . Connecticut is rated at 2,105 men , New Hampshire at 1,201 . From a contemporary report , however , we find Stark 's regiment to have been rated at about 460 men . Counting in the 200 men of Connecticut who were ordered in as a working party at night , there were thus 5,764 men in the fight on the American side , besides what of the Connecticut troops were hurried forward by Putnam to help their brethren in the works . The contemporary newspaper accounts of course diminish this , and vaguely compute the force at " about fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that the body at first on Bunker Hill was within that number ; and if so , they overestimated it , about the way that newspapers generally do . The English force after landing formed in three lines to the right of Charlestown , and began to advance . Above them was a gentle slope , all cut up with stone walls , strong rail fences , and plantations . They could no longer see the redoubt . The grass was waist high , growing rankly in the summer sun , and the day was intensely hot . The men were in heavy marching order , full uniform , buttoned and stocked , strapped and belted , with three days ' rations in their knapsacks . The three lines began to move up the hill , leaving the little village of Charlestown on their left flank , when shots began to drop in from that place , and a few men fell . Howe sent back a boat to Boston with the news , and the battery* on Copp 's Hill turned its fire on the rash village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments , a work soon completed by a flanking party . Then up the slope among the entangling fences , through the deep , rank grass , the British moved slowly on . They had not far to go . From the * Am . Arch. , 1094 . Burgoyne 'S letter . // Lively to the Bunker Hill redoubt was only 900 yards in a straight line , and from where the troops formed it was scarce 500 . Before they were half way up the slope they began to catch renewed sight of the fresh-turned earth of the redoubt and a long gray pile of rails stretching from its right shoulder away to the Mystic or Mcdford river . Then the Englishmen began file firing at the redoubt , which frowned-quiet but ominous-above them . It took them a long time to get up that slope , compelled as they were to pull down fences to make way for the artillery . Meanwhile on the farmer 's side , what were they doing ? There was Prescott in the redoubt , and Stark and Putnam behind the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep still . As at Concord , the only trouble of the officers was to restrain the men from rashness . Every moment reinforcements were coming by regiments , by companies , by single men . Every moment made their position stronger . Bulldog-like , with the old preference of the English race for a straight , brutal rush , the English were coming . Bulldog-like , the new English were waiting for them silently . Bulldogs do not bark much , but they hold on till the piece comes out . Straight above Charlestown was the redoubt , and from its flank an old rail fence went zigzagging back to the river on the right . The artillery face of the redoubt was toward Boston on the left front . By assaulting as his right Howe eliminated the American artillery from the problem . He had only musketry to fear . He did not know what was behind the fence . It was already swarming with troops , and more were coming in . That rail fence was to prove worse than the redoubt . As the English slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally moved to the assault in a long , steady line of regiments . The file firing increased as they advanced , for they had already discovered that the fence was full of foes . A few greenhorns in the redoubt and a few more along the fence , regardless of orders , and unable to repress their hungry longing to " shoot a Britisher , " opened fire over the tall grass as the red breasts and black bearskins came in sight . The fire did little harm , but it revealed the locality of the enemy-just what Howe wanted . His artillery , which had been playing at intervals to cover his advance , was now masked by his own troops , and the long line , slowly advancing , had reached within a hundred feet of the redoubt and fence . The American line had a bend inward in the middle , and the English assault had a corresponding bend outward . All this while the English were firing irregularly , their bullets cracking on the fence rails and knocking up the dust on the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idle fire , and the Americans , lying down , suffered little if at all . Suddenly the word came . The farmers could see the faces of the English , even the whites of their eyes . In a moment more redoubt and rail fence became a wall of fire . The long-restrained farmer-soldiers had sprung up , and were firing coolly and pitilessly into the English ranks . On the centre they had a cross fire , and the storm of bullets was fearful , for the English were totally uncovered , and within a hundred feet of the defences , dropping by dozens and scores . The long line staggered , wavered , and halted ; the men fell back confusedly a few paces , and began to fire in volleys . For some minutes there were two thick curtains of blue-white smoke pierced with savage red flashes . The bullets came in showers like hail , but the English fired into rails and banks , or overhead . The Americans were covered all but the head , and the English were completely exposed . No human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and flashes the farmer-soldiers saw the red line melt and break away . First one , then another ran back out of the horrible tempest , cowering with bowed head ; // then whole companies and regiments fled bodily , officers cursing and shouting in vain for the men to stand ; and then there was a lessening of the musketry in front , a yell of triumphant fury from the militia men , and they realized that the assault was repulsed ; that the British regulars , with all their pride , had fled from the face of the Yankee militia , whom they had taunted for weeks as bushwhacking cowards . It was a proud moment for those greenhorns . They had seen their first fight and driven back the best troops in the world ; while more of their own friends were coming every moment . Slight as were their defences , a low redoubt without flanks , a rail fence strengthened with brush and extra rails , they had proved sufficient in the hands of brave men to check the veterans of Minden . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and formed again with their reinforcements . The ships opened a furious cannonade once more . The Lively and Falcon lay behind burning Charlestown , and the Symmetry opened fire on Charlestown Neck to stop the hurrying columns that were coming up every moment to help at redoubt and fence . Putnam and Prescott knew that the fight was not over yet . They had both served with Wolfe , and knew what English troops were . At three o'clock the English advanced again in the same manner . This time the men were not so hearty , and the officers were compelled to drive them on , pricking them with their swords . The second assault was an exact repetition of the first . There was the same file firing , covering a resolute advance in line , made at a slow pace , keeping up the same rigid alignment , the same toilsome strain under heavy burdens , through tall grass and bushes , the same ominous silence from redoubt and rail fence , the same sudden leaping up when the scarlet line had reached the fatal barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the same murderous fire was opened , and the devoted troops halted and faced it grimly , firing back their despairing defiance . The struggle was longer , the slaughter fiercer , the American ranks were pierced , and men began to drop all along the rail fence . But the end was the same . The grim struggle at that short range could not last long . It had but one termination possible . The moment the English halted and fired , the contest became unequal . Where one English bullet found a mark in a human body five American bullets struck and killed or wounded . After a grim , desperate struggle to conquer impossibility , the English broke once more , and fled back through the smoke , leaving the field to the Yankee militia they had despised . We can fancy the despair , the burning rage of those haughty royal officers , who had boasted a few weeks before that five British regiments were sufficient to march through the colonies from end to end , and overwhelm the cowardly Yankees . The very name they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greenhorns were calling fiercely from behind their defences , " Are the Yankees cowards now ? ** The very tune their own fifes played in contempt of those same Yankees was soon to become the pride of the land , and the saucy , taunting notes of " Yankee Doodle , " high and shrill , piercing the rattle of musketry , were to rouse Americans to frenzy on many a field . But now , at last , Sir William Howe was to show what manner of man he was . He had undervalued his enemy* and suffered for it with nearly onethird of his force killed and wounded . Now he knew that he must fight as he had never fought before in his life , or go home disgraced : beaten by a parcel of Yankee bumpkins , who had turned out to be fiercer and more stubborn troops than all the flower of France that fought at Fontenoy . This time his plan was able and consistent . No longer attempting a vain attack in line against a reëntering line intrenched , exposing himself needlessly // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he determined to do what he should have done at first-assault the redoubt in column with the bayonet and take the rail fence in flank . Thus he gave himself the chances which he had heretofore madly thrown away . He received only the fire of one face of the redoubt direct or of two faces obliquely ; he gave opportunity to his artillery to cover his advance , and he prevented his men from acquiring the fatal habit of halting in the open to return the fire of a covered adversary , or one chance against five . The only way to evade such a fire is to dash through it at speed , and once in the ditch of the redoubt , the English would be sheltered from assault . He tried the plan , and it succeeded perfectly . His guns were run forward as far as they could be safely taken , and opened fire down the line of the rail fence , while the assaulting column , wave after wave , rushed at the redoubt without firing a shot . The assault succeeded , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They complained of lack of ammunition as the cause , but the complaint is hardly well founded . Had they never so much ammunition , it would not have availed them then , for Howe 's movement had turned the chances against them . Before , they had a cross fire on the weight of the English assault , where every bullet told , and they themselves were sheltered from artillery fire . The redoubt of Bunker Hill was really the least dangerous part of the line . It was the rail fence that made the slaughter . Now , with grape and canister raking the fence , and no fire to return but that of the redoubt , the English forced by their officers to run forward instead of halting to fire , the redoubt became untenable . Slowly and sullenly the Americans fell back from the redoubt as the English entered . The battle of Bunker Hill was over . The redoubt taken , the rail fence was useless . Had the troops occupied it for an hour longer , they must have been taken prisoners or slaughtered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slow and sullen , their smoky rear sparkling with fire all the way , and the terribly punished British , hardly able to realize that they had indeed won * victory , followed , but slowly and cautiously , forbearing to press these new English , who had that day proved themselves worthy to meet the old English in the death hug . The Americans retired across the neck almost unmolested , and the English settled around Bunker Hill to think over what they had lost and won . Result : Loss , a butcher 's bill of 226 killed , 808 wounded ; total loss , 1,034 out of 3,000 ; of this loss , 89 officers . Gain , a place for an outwork to hold Boston a few weeks longer . Dorchester Heights still unoccupied , Washington coming , a probable evacuation before them . Balance in British favor , prestige retained-after a fashion . The Americans sulkily retired to Cambridge . They felt savage and ashamed of their final defeat . They little knew what they had done . They had impressed on Sir William Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never recovered . Long years were to go by before the true value of this battle to America was to be discovered ; but to-4a* the world knows that of all the battl*s in which Americans have fought , no victory ever gave such results to them as the nominal defeat of Bunker Hill .
