txt The readers of THE TIMES will remember that about a fortnight ago W6 called attention to a case , seeming to be extraordinary , iu which , a Roman Catholic gentleman , being a British subject , had married a lady at Rio de Janeiro , the ceremony having been performed at the British Embassy by a clergyman of the Church of England , and had lived with her twenty-five years , and who yet , after that cohabitation , and she being yet alive , openly- married another woman in the Roman Catholic church at Manchester . The seeming extraordinary part of the case was that he was sustained in so doing by the highest authority pf the Roman Catholic Church , and that on his wife 's ? his real wife 's ? bringing suit in Edinburgh for the restoration of her rights , he openly pleaded the authority of his Church in support of his declaration that the woman whom he had so solemnly married , and who had lived with him twentyfive years , was not his wife . The case is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as it has been thus far reported , which is quite inexplicable . That such a plea should be put in by any respectable lawyer within the British dominions would be incredible , were it not so reported in quarters which make the fact certain . There may possibly be some complication of the question iu the unfortunately incongruous condition of Scotch law on marriage , which no one seems exactly to understand ; but that such a plea could be listened to for five minutes in an English court of justice is not to be believed . And yet , on the other hand , the difficulty with the Scotch law of marriage is that it binds men and women together for life too easily , so that a man has to be very cautious as to his behavior to a wotuan and as to the manner in which be speaks of her , if he would not find himself her " gude mod " willy-nilly . This would seem to favor the wife in the remarkable case we have referred to ; which is sorely in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very important in its bearings on tho marriage relation , it is not so extraordinary , in all respects , as we supposed . it to be . The very question which it raises is brought directly home to us , here , in the United States , and , of all places in the United Slates , in Boston . A suit for slander has recently been begun there , in which the plaintiff , one ROBERT C. FANNING , who it seems is a Leman Catholic , sues a priest , one Father JAMES MCGLY NN , for slander of him in his marital relations , laying his damages at $ ' 2,000 . FANNING alleges that ho married his wife some time in 1873 , the ceremony having been performed by a duly authorized magistrate , and , that ho and . his wife have ' lived faithfully and uprightly together since that time . This priest , however , Father , as he alleges , has denounced him and his wife publicly before the congregation of the church to which they belong as living together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to do so until they come before the altar and make public satisfaction ; and . he added , in regard to FANNING and his wife , that " by and by they will be coming to me with their bastards for me to christen . " This , be it remembered , openly before the whole congregation . Iu the course of his complaint the plaiutiff mentions the case of another couple who got married . out of the Church , " as to whom the same priest declared as publicly that they were . " not lawfully married . " The defendant 's plea is simply that he was justified in what he said by his priestly office . It is well that this question should be settled at once , and . therefore well that these two cases have come up , one under British and the other under American law . They ought not to be treated lightly , and should be decided , if possible , with regard to the fundamental principle involved , and not with reference to the mere relief sought by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in law . The question is not a religious one at all ; and the most noteworthy point in regard to it is that the Roman Catholic hierarchy professes to assume its position in this matter , not upon religious grounds , but upon grounds of public expediency . It professes to acknowledge the administration , or the performance , of its so-called " sacrament " of marriage , even by the parties to the marriage themselves ; but it denounces as clandestine , and therefore void , all marriages not performed by a Romish priest . This is getting around the stump in a very manifest and somewhat astonisting manner . But if Roman Catholics choose to submit to such decision theoretically , there can , of course , be no objection to their doing so ; nor can any Roman Catholic be found fault with if ho guides his action in regard to himself and his family by this rule , or by any other . The point is , whether those who , Roman Catholics or not , do not choose to conform to the dictates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City of Rome , iu Italy , shall have their rights iu any way affected by such nonconformity . Shall any man and woman , Roman Catholic or not , who have been united . in matrimony according to the law of the land in which they live , or to which they are subject , be liable to have the rights which they have thus acquired as to each other disregarded , as in the Edinburgh case , or openly and injuriously flouted and derided , as in the case in Boston 7 Is a woman who is married according to the law , whatever that may be , subject , without redress , to be treated or even to be spoken of as if she were " living in sin , " and to hear her children openly branded as bastards Iand this because of the dictates of a foreign ecclesiastical body . It really does seem to us as if our Roman Catholic friends would do well to stop this matter now , where it is . Let them teach what it seems good to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly with the law of marriage , they run the risk of arousing that spirit which caused our forefathers to drive the Roman Catholic Church out of England , less because of their dislike of its religions doctrine than because they would not endure that a foreign potentate , let . him call himself Pope or what not . should exercise any recognized ; authority over them . That spirit produced two revolutions and the Bill of Rights .
