txt We hope the Tribune , which is one of . the official papers of the Tammany Ring , and as such may be presumed to know all its secrets , will yet endeavor to explain , the curious inconsistencies between DICK CONNOLLY 'S published statement of accounts and Mr. DEXTER RAWreport on the condition of the City finances . It was all very well to mutilate Mr. HAWKINS ' report , but that is not quite the same thing as answering it . The Corporation pat . which was given to the Tribune in order that it might support the Tammany leaders , can never recompense that journal for the loss of confidence it will sustain by a persistence in its unfair policy with reference to Mr. HAWKINs ' report . The grasping and unreasonable exactions of the present cable companies are beginning to attract attention abroad , and opposition has asserted itself in the Press and in mercantile circles . A German cable is meanwhile in contemPlation.i.As the managers of the present cable system seem wholly independent of criticism , and indifferent to the just claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing them to their senses . Nowhere could competition originate with better prospects of success than in Germany . Our very excellent Minister at the Court of Austria seems to have indulged in some of the floridness that marked his quondam speeches at the Union League Club , at his grand Fourth of July banquet to the diplomatic world of Vienna . He Is reported , by cable , to have " expressed the opinion that the AngloAmerican Treaty would prevent wars hereafter , by the establishment of an international court of arbitration . " Presuming that the report is accurate , this is unquestionably too confiding . That the tendency of the treaty is to prevent war , we have frequently urged , and its value , great as it is to the two countries concerned , is vastly enhanced by this fact . But it will hardly turn bayonets permanently into pruning-hooks , or conquer completely what Count BEAST calls the " natural quarrelsomeness of mankind . " The Board of Commissioners for Docks and Piers yesterday toot the first practical stop toward the realization of Gen. MoCr.s.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharfage about the City of New-York . They ordered the building of a now pier , 500 feet long and Go feet wide , at the foot of Fifty-seventh-street , North River . The pier is to be approached by a bridge about 150 feet in length , which is required by the general plan contemplating the laying out of a 200-foot street on that side of the City . The Citizen is anxious to know " who is to be the next Register , with its nice little income of sixty thousand dollars with little to do I " Though unable to inform our neighbor , we can tell him where he can get the information . It is one of the beauties of our present Municipal Government that the people are not required to bother their heads about selecting candidates for office . The few officials who arenot appointed by the Mayor are nominated according to the " rule of Four . " If the people see fit to elect the nominees , well and good ; if not , they are " counted m " by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , therefore , ? who  --  is to be next Register , with its nice little income - of sixty thousand a year , lot it apply to TWEED , SWEENY , - CONNOLLY and HALL . By the way , what a Democratic howl there - would . be throughout the land , if the President of . the ' United States , or any other Republican official . were in the receipt of " sixty thousand dollars a year with little to ? do . " Yet there-are a dozen Democratic office-holders in this City whose receipts reach that figure , and the kind - of men who fill them may be inferred from the names put forward by'the Citizen as the most available candidates for Register . " Boss " TWEED , having heard that a famous poet , named WirmAx SHAKERPEA.RE. once said that " the man who bath no music in his soul is flt for treasons. - stratagems and spoils , " has set about organizing a band , to prove that he has a tuneful ear . The Tweed Band , we are assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen or heard in this country . It is to Consist of fifty first-class musicians , all splendidly equipped , and furnished with new instruments of the most costly description . It has knot yet transpired what use it is to be put to ; but it is supposed to be designed for-the entertainment of the " Boss " and his friends while- partaking of the Sunday punch in-those famous stables . It may also be called into service as a pacifier , to soothe and harmonize the bickerings of the " Ring " that are reported to break out occasionally over the division of the spoils . The passion for cruel sports seems to be on the increase . notwithstanding the exertions of " humane societies . " In England , the Prince of WALES and the sprigs-'of nobility appear to think no day complete in whigha couple of hundred pigeons have not been blown to pieces . Pigeon-shooting , the least sportsmanlike of all sports , is growing into favor here  --  also . In NewJersey , the prevailing rage-is for dog-fighting and cock-fighting . Although thefPohce interfere whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quietospots , and in the rural districts the owner of a game-cock may-easily find a match for him - at any price he likes to name . Prize-fighting does not make much progress , but the use of the pistol and the knife has not declined , and those weapons are often found to be quite as dangerous as the human fist . Pugilism has its good points , as Judge DOWLLNG seems to have discovered in his wonderful bout with four burglars , whom he smote hip and thigh by dint of superior " science . " Surely it was a little ungrateful in the Judge to commit a pugilist to prison for a twelvemonth just before his departure . The telegrapher from Watseka , Iroquois County , Ill. , whose melancholy duty it seems to have been to make the most of a very extreme case of lynching in that remote locality , speaks of a " daring " crowd of one thousand persons who took part in it . The precise fraction of pluck which results from dividing among a thousand the courage necessary to hang an un-armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the justice or decency of this way of violating law and order are about equal .
