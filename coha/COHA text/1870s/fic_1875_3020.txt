ACROSS THE SEA And Other Poems . By Thomas S. Chard . Now just as the gates were opened to let in the men , I looked in after them , and behold the City shone like the sun ; the streets also were paved with gold , and in them walked many men , with crowns on their heads , palms in their hands , and golden harps to sing praises withal . * * * And after that they shut up the gates ; which , when I had seen , I wished myself among them .  - -  Pilgrim 's Progress .

Across the Sea , The Seven Sleepers , A Legend of St. John , The Blessed Vale . ACROSS THE SEA . Inscribed to David Swing . ACROSS THE SEA . I. -- CHILDHOOD . Ah ! who can speak that country whence I fled ? None but a lover may its beauty know , None but a poet can its rapture sing ; And e'en his muse , upborne on Fancy 's wing , Will grieve o'er beauties still unnoticed , O'er raptures language is too poor to show . Fore'er remains the land where children dwell , Earth 's fairest mem'ry and its Palestine ; Tho ' years have passed since on my forehead there Were graven lines of weariness and care , Still on the silver string of memory oft I tell The golden beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Childhood ! God doth know That I have longed to dwell in thee again , As when by care unvexed , by doubt undriven , With eyes as blue , and heart as pure , as Heaven . Sweet are the days of childhood , glad the flow Of unhurt joyous life in every vein . It may not be , those sunny hours are flown , And loud " The Fortune " knocks at every gate ; Still move we on the path where none returns , Where wait afar , or near , our funeral urns , That mystic path , whose ways are all unknown , For only life 's surprises make us great . Yet still I dream , as o'er the swelling deep , I gaze upon the far enchanted shore , Through whose retreats the memory-brooding sea Rolls in deep monotone continually . Waves of soft melody , which fall asleep In rosy glens that I may see no more . O holy music of the flowing sea , Heard never but at eve , when shifts and gleams On waves afar the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice o'erpowers My soul with pensiveness , sweet reverie And memory of half-forgotten dreams . T was early , Sea of Life , I loved thee well , And mused betimes upon thy strand , till rolled Ashore from Daylight 's wreck her gilded spars , And Night , in thee , a chandelier of stars Had hung , to light the grots where mermen dwell , The deep-sea grots of amethyst and gold . Beyond thee , when thou wert of gentle mood , And held with all the weary winds a truce , Upon the other shore I could descry Where , faintly outlined in the western sky , A mystic rainbow-girdled Headland stood , Whose silver sandals thou dost rise to loose . Far on the verge , where sky and waters meet , The Headland 's hazy outline I could trace ; High in the blue of Heaven its summit lay ; There sleeps the twilight , till the crystal Day , Waked by the song of birds from slumber sweet , Beams on the Headland fair with lovelit face . For I have ne'er believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dearer to me the quiet hour of eve , And when at last this passion world I leave , May I , sometimes , behold the stars , as now ,  --  In the sweet gloaming -- tho ' " no night is there . " One early morn , ere earth had waked from sleep , From the calm shadow of my tent I stole ; I could not rest , and as I sought the shore , To tell my longings to the ocean o'er , A warning Voice , uprising from the deep , Murmured in plaintive rhythm to my soul . THE VOICE . Why wouldst thou go ? the way is long and drear ; Thou mayst be happy where thou art , but stern The fortune is that rules the watery waste . He who doth wisdom love will not make haste To change a peaceful way for one of fear , And he who leaves this shore can ne'er return . The warrior waves that lie in peace asleep Upon the stilly bosom of the main , Will don their plumes of snow when night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy sky ; Where wilt thou hide thee from the angry deep , Till it has sunk to silvery dreams again ? THE ANSWER . I may escape , for others have before , Why should I fear to view the storm-cloud 's form ? I answered to the Voice . In One I trust , Upon whose blazing path the clouds are dust , Why should I cower ' neath the whirlwind 's roar ? God 's chariot is the whirlwind and the storm . The thunder of the deep will be my psalm , And e'en the crested wave , that totters o'er My way , will seem an emerald arbor fair , With portals of bluebells and lilies rare ; For Fancy knoweth not of storm or calm , It dreameth but of beauty evermore . THE VOICE . Yet ' t is a weary way , the Voice replied , A trackless way of danger and of care ; And from thy cheek , ere tho the Headland find , The rose will yield its petals to the wind ; And from thy heart an adverse cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider too , O youth , Earth is a sphere , And he who journeys to the verge of age , But comes at eve to where he left at morn , But views at last the hearth where he was born , But learns , the bright horizon ne'er draws near The circle climbers of life 's pilgrimage . Think well , again , thou mayst forever part From pleasure , seeking pleasure o'er the main . The good of life -- such is the human lot --  Seems only good to those who have it not . Joy , smiling , opes the portals of the heart . But when he enters , Lo ! his name is Pain . Nothing but rest can satisfy thy thirst For happiness . Hast thou on land or sea Found what was not a weariness at last , And shall to-morrow cheat thee as the past ? The glowing bubbles of the future burst , Touched by the finger-tip of Memory . Thou art a poet , yet perchance may find The birds will carol more delicious lays ; Thy waves of song may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Thou canst not rhyme so sweetly as the wind , And nature is too subtile for thy phrase . But leaning on the muffled harp of thought , Here sweet for thee will sigh the summer wind , And dreamful will the rhythm of the deep Upon the shore of silver fall asleep . Nor wilt thou miss what thou has never sought , Nor seek what men at last have failed to find . Yet if thou wilt not heed our counsel sage , If still thou dost our warning cry despise , Yon barge will bear thee from these happy shores . Behold its silken sail , its crew , the oars , And thou its prow , thro ' calm and tempest rage , Mayst guide in peace at last -- if thou art wise . Thus speaks the Voice to every child , but yet Youth evermore to Hope will loyal be . Impatiently I listened to the strain , Then turned me to the Headland once again , Which in the early morning light was set An emerald in a golden ring of sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean marge , To steal the silver sparkle of the sand ; Then lapsing from the shore , I scarce could feel Its soft pulsations underneath the keel , As I sat patiently within the barge , Until the breeze should bear me from the land . And as I waited , lo ! the morning sun Rose golden on the misty eastern sky , And through the rosy dells the sunbeams bright Stole from the flowers the jewels of the night ; But yet no seaward zephyr had begun To fill the canvas drooping listlessly . I saw an aged man upon the shore , There was a kindly smile upon his face As thus he spake to me --  " Here have I dwelt For centuries , yet I have never felt The winds of heaven upon my forehead , nor Will they e'er visit this spell-haunted place . Your gaily-painted barge will wait in vain For favoring winds to fill its silken sail . If you would ever leave these drowsy shores Your crew must sweep the waters from their oars . To win the Blessed Headland o'er the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gazed adown the barge ; the silent men Toyed with their oars , awaiting my command ; The first was " Courage " quick to see and dare , And next came " Patience , " he as ready e'er To calm an angry brow to peace , and then Came " Justice "  --  " Knowledge " sat at his right hand . I held the rudder . No hand but mine own Could guide the mystic barge across the sea . But in the bow stood " Faith , " whose vision keen Discerns what mortal eye hath never seen , And when a mist across the deep is blown , Sendeth sweet messages of hope to me . Why tarry ye , O men ? the way is long To yonder hazy Headland 's wave-worn base . We wait in vain for favoring winds to blow , ' T is yours to pull the oars . Row , bravely , row , Keep even stroke , ye merry hearts , with song , And lead the swift sea-birds a winning race . The willing oarsmen heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " Knowledge " had not heard , And still he dreamed upon his trailing oar , Until the barge had rounded to the shore We scarce had left . In vain the labor spent . The old man smiled again . The swift sea-bird Such rivalry would never fear , said he , " Knowledge " must pull with " Courage " ; " Justice , " too , Must draw his stroke with " Patience , " else your barge , Despite your strength , will never leave the marge , But still in weary revolutions be A vanity of vanities to you . These words to you in parting . O beware In seeking heaven , lest you despise the earth ; Heaven is both what we are and where we go , And we are heaven-builders here below ; Alike we take it and we find it there , And heaven is worth to us what we are worth . God hath the earth to heaven in marriage given , See how the ocean yieldeth tenderly The penciled shadow of the morning bars Whereon , like notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the azure dome of heaven Is echoing now the music of the sea . Love wisely then the earth , and you shall love The Holy City where the angels dwell . The gentle light of love will never bring The circling moth upon his dusty wing . No thief will steal , no rust corrode above , Nor in your heart -- if love be there . Farewell . III.  - -  MANHOOD . So to their oars my boatmen , cheerily , Bent once again , and then , with steady stroke , They drew upon the waters till the shore Grew lower in the distance , and no more Thro ' the gray mist the mentor I could see , But oft I thought upon the words he spoke . And oft , O wise Experience , have I found The lesson true you taught to me that day . No progress but by toil , and there must be In heart and mind a vital unity . Our days are else in vain , and ne'er will bound The " Barge of Time " upon the heavenly way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whose darkling bitter waters seemed to stay The prow ,  - -  twined like a sea-weed growth the oars ; A tide that hies forever from the shores I sought , and with its soft caresses , wide And far , bears hapless wanderers away . Yet gallant are the boats that drift along ; Proud are the hearts that float where flows the tide . The youth whose heated fancy sees afar The promise of ambition 's streaming star , And he who follows with a careless song Some godless passion he has deified . The man of curling lip and brow of scorn , The worshiper of reason and of self , The atheist , wanton , and the giddy maid , The faith-betrayer and the love-betrayed ; Self-righteous pharisees , who would adorn Or hide with pious garb their love of pelf . The poet with a poem on his lip , The writer with an essay in his heart , The statesman with a law within his brain , The merchant princes busy with their gain ; Dreamers who reck not that their barges slip Upon a tide from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurries to the Land of Fear , The arms are feeble , and perplexed the will , And the hearts childish that must stem thy flow , And it is sweet to rest , and hard to row . I , too , have drifted on thy waters drear , And but for grace divine were drifting still . * * * * * * Life 's sea , at best , is but a lonely sea , Yet thrice from angry winds and waters rude The mem'ry of their bitter feud has flown On the soft pinions of a gentle tone . Thrice heavenly messengers have come to me To break the bondage of my solitude . And first , my mother 's love , warm , tender , true , To guide me o'er the billowy deep , was given ; E'en now I view her barge 's silvery trail , And faint , in distance , mark her snowy sail Bloom like a lily on the water blue . ' T is but a mirage , she is long in heaven . O how my heart has hungered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weight of cares , Yet I have thought , wherever I have been , Some gentle power was leading me from sin To virtue 's sweeter , nobler way the while . It was the power , dear mother , of thy prayers . One morning when , like Cana 's Lord , the sun Had changed the waiting water into wine , Sped o'er the rosy tide a seraph bright , Within a craft of pearl and crystal light , And still she sped until our ways were one , And I was hers , for aye , and she was mine . Once , when my tears were falling on the wake Which far and near my wayward path betrayed , Shone there upon me in that fateful hour , A Holy Being , clothed in light and power . And with Him came th ' eternal morning 's break . How sweet His words , ' T is I , be not afraid . Thus to the soul of man there come alone Three sacred ones upon the Sea of Life ; All others are as distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever by : And he is blest whose faithful heart hath known And loved the name of Savior , Mother , Wife . Thus o'er the Sea of Life my way I take , Not waveless have its waters been to me , For I have known , in many a fearful hour , The weight and fury of the tempest 's power ; But mercy e'er the sable clouds doth break And set the prisoned light of heaven free . And oft , O sea , thy troubled waters cease , Save when they smile to hear the breeze at prayer ; Thy calm so deep that he who glideth by May wonder which is sea and which is sky ; So full thou art of stars , so sweet thy peace , We seem in heaven while on thy bosom fair . IV.  - -  AGE . My boat is old , for I have journeyed far , But still the Headland seems a weary way ; My boatmen , too , are old , and oft an oar Slips from a feeble hand , but yet the shore Upon whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer every day . What matters that my boatmen now are old , Why should I grieve that with a feeble hand I hold the swaying helm ? The waves no more Rise o'er the prow to keep me from the shore , The silken sail at last the breezes hold , The tide of Love sets toward the Heavenly Land . O flowing tide that in our autumn time Ebbs from the world , and bears us on thy breast , I would to every human soul ' t were given To drift upon thy silver sheen to heaven ; To fall asleep , and dream , and wake -- SUBLIME , Within the crystal harbor of The Blest . Dear are thy urging waters , starry tide , Forever gently flowing heavenward ; Thine every dimple is a token sweet That rested there some beauteous angel 's feet , Thy sheen , a radiant carpet for the Bride , Laid to the wedding Temple of her Lord . Soon o'er the wave my boat no more will ride , The music of the dipping oar will cease , And through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's height , a loving call , Come hither , child , forevermore abide Within thy Father 's House -- at Home -- in Peace . L'ENVOY . Hark ! there is music on the lovelit sea . Music , sweet music falls upon mine ear , Soft as the sigh of June , when die the hours Crimsoned with sunset and the blush of flowers . Dost thou not hear it ? O it seems to me No mother 's cradle-song was e'er so dear . The music ceases . From the eastern sky , Lo ! the umbrageous clouds , whose gloomy frown Shadowed my youth , drift westward , dark no more , They float illumined o'er the heavenly shore . Behold , they part ! and thro ' their portals high The gleams of endless glory shimmer down . Farewell , O Deep , nor be thy solemn bell Jarred as I go by grief 's tumultuous blast . Farewell , ye winds , for me ye ne'er again Will fret the bosom of the restless main . To thee , O Barge of Time , a long farewell , Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give ear , O Earth , the honeyed air again Swells with the rapture of the heavenly shore ; And I am singing as I upward pass Upon the " sea of mingled fire and glass , " To Him who Loved and gave Himself for Men , Be Glory , Honor , Power , Forevermore . THE SEVEN SLEEPERS . Inscribed to Robert Collyer . THE SEVEN SLEEPERS . We seem within a pleasant vale to dwell , Whose boundary knows the early summer 's spell , And where , in leafy tabernacle , June Hears not the mandate of the waning moon . The river bank and hill-side of the vale , And orchard fruitage streaked with morning pale , Grow rosy with the rosy summer hours . Green is the dewy turf and gay with flowers . The morning sky is azure ; we behold The white clouds sleeping on the eastern hill , At eve -- a fleecy flock -- they follow still The shepherd sun upon his path of gold . Sweet is the air , and peace is everywhere : Save that in distant skies beyond our time We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twanging bow of thunder where The sky is bright with pale auroral light , Framed in by darkness ; there we view The stern death-struggling of armed hosts --  The smoke of burning cities -- martyr fires --  Towers toppling to ruin , palaces , Vast columned temples , and triumphal arch , Fair hanging gardens , walls magnificent , Resolved to dust by time -- as summer 's sun Resolves again a fleecy cloud to mist . Yet sometimes even here the spectral light Broadens and brightens into sunny day , And the soft winds ( the sweeter for the war Of elements , ) blow thence to us Legends ,  --  Traditions fair of noble hearts as true , Of honor pure , of love as sacred -- deep --  Of valor great -- of homes as fair and dear , As fresher , better modern days have known . I love the Legend of the Sleepers Seven , Which comes from days so near the Manger -- Cross , It seems to me a tale of Holy Writ . When Decius sate upon the Roman Throne , And made his empire red with Christian blood , Seven noble youths who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace ) Refused to heed the Imperial will and bow Themselves in worship to the pagan gods , Preferring the reproach of Christ , to all The wealth and honor of the Court of Rome ; And thus before the Royal Tyrant ( who It chanced was then at Ephesus ) the youths Bore witness to the faith more dear than life . " The living God who made the earth and sky , And dwells in Temples never made by hands , Hath set within the Heaven of Heavens His Throne ; He holdeth in His hands a thousand spheres , And hath created all that is create ; Jehovah infinite , eternal , good , And wise , we humbly worship , serve , adore , We can not bow , O monarch , to thy gods . " Behind a smile the Emperor hid his rage , And bade the youths consider well , and count The gain or loss which might to them befall . The Emperor 's favor was a life of gain , His anger roused was like a scorching fire . And thus he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , till he again , And soon , should come in power to Ephesus . So passed they from his presence , but the world Loves not the men who are unloved of kings . The silversmiths that made the idol shrines , Raised , as of old , a tumult , and the youths Fled secretly , and sought a refuge safe Among the mountain heights near Ephesus ; And there within a hidden cave they dwelt , While Malchus ( one of them , but lately come To Ephesus ) brought food to them by night . Ye deem their lives were sad ? Oh they were blest , On wings of prayer the hours went lightly by ; And oft , when day was spent , toward eventide Came one into their midst , who brake to them Celestial bread for their deep hungering . Till , lo ! again with martial pomp and pride , The haughty Decius came to Ephesus , And by the whisper of a faithless spy , He learnt the guarded secret of the cave , ' Gainst which a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tomb . " They are not dead but sleeping , " for the Lord Hath sent His angel who hath touched their eyes , And sweetly as a child at evening , dreams Upon his mother 's bosom , lulled to rest By the soft pulsings of her gentle heart , So rested well the brave Ephesian youths ,  --  Guarded by angels , while celestial light Filled the lone cave and made its rocky bounds Invisible ; and thus they might have seen , ( But that their eyes were closed in heavenly sleep ) The bright stars drifting on the ethereal tide ,  --  The moon at quarter , like a golden boat Rock onward to its changing destiny --  The great sun , rising from the under-world , Blanch all the planets with his fiery rays . Beneath them were the blue Aegean sea , Miletus , and the proud Ephesus , where Rose the world 's miracle of marble white , The Temple of the goddess worshiped there . Day follows night and night the busy day ; The generations come and go apace , The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years is now a grandsire by the hearth , And now hath passed away and is forgot . Two hundred years are fled , when , lo ! one day A mason finds the moss-grown wall of stone Built by the cruel Decius , strong and high , And knowing not it is a sepulchre , He quarries it to build a palace wall . And so the light of day beams in again Upon the youths , who wake to grateful prayer That blessed day has come so soon again , ( For all their sleep seemed but an hour 's delight ) And Malchus , cautiously descends the mount , To buy their bread in pagan Ephesus . Yet much he fears the tyrant Decius And the rough buffets of the Roman Guard . When , lo ! descending to the city 's gate , He sees a golden cross thereon upreared ; And passing through the portals in a daze , He wanders on in wonder through the ways . Where are the images of all the gods --  The silver semblance of Diana fair ? He sees them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Savior 's death , And hears the name of Christ on every tongue . At last he enters in where bread is sold , And gives in payment there a silver coin . " It is an ancient coin , " the baker said , " And bears the image of old Decius . " " Nay you but jest , " said Malchus , " where is he ? " " Dead these two hundred years , " the man replied , And , deeming that the youth had lost his mind , He sent him to the Bishop of the town . The Bishop heard the marvelous story through , And being deeply learned in history , Recalled the memory of the noble seven And their sad fate in days of Decius . Then coming to the rocky mountain cave , ( Led up by Malchus all the winding way , ) He witnessed all the truth of what was told . Nor lacked he faith in God , for he believed All wondrous things with Him were possible . But ere by letter he could tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed dreams again , and waked Within a crystal city where was peace . * * * * * * I think we all are dreamers like the seven ; The morning rises from her silver throne And smiles upon the hours we call our own . The minutes brim like drops of golden wine O'er Life 's o'erflowing cup ; we see the shine Of perfect day on every path we scan ; And Fame 's fair vaulted Temple on the span Of rainbow arches is upheld -- and gleams In every future of our boyhood dreams . But while we follow every promise sweet , With buoyant hearts and lightly springing feet , To where some joy untasted yet awaits ,  --  We hear the solemn sound of closing gates ; And driven by Care , we leave the City bright , To mount with aching feet some rocky height Where Time dispels the hopes that Fancy gave , And all life 's prospect narrows to a cave . Less sweet we sleep than did the sleepers seven , Our dreams are shadows -- theirs were bright with Heaven . Haply to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall with power , Or Love hath breathed a whisper soft and low , And wrought the miracle of Jericho . And thus we come again or soon or late , To pass once more the mystic City 's gate . Our hearts grow tender as we view again The dear remembered vistas of the plain , And as we draw the sun-lit portals near , The air is sweet to us with vesper prayer ; While o'er the gate our lifted eyes behold The sacred sign -- a cross of shining gold . A LEGEND OF ST . JOHN . Inscribed to C. C. Bonney . A LEGEND OF ST . JOHN . Then Jesus answered unto Peter , " If I will That he shall tarry till I come again , What is it unto thee ? " He spake of John . In Russia there still lives a legend sweet , Repeated by the grandsire to the child ,  --  A dear old legend , which has lived so long , And held an honored place so many years By ancient firesides long since turned to dust --  A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthened shadows , wonder-opened eyes , And groups which listened ere they went their way , We well might wish the story may be true ,  --  Of him who once had lain on Jesus ' breast . This is the tale , as I remember it . When John to Patmos ' isle was banished , He saw and heard unutterable things . The " Revelation " is a shadow poor , Of his most marvelous experience . But human language never can convey , And human intellect can never span , Things not of earth . When from his beauteous dream Unwillingly the loved disciple woke , His heart was burning with new zeal for God And therefore with more tender love for man . Down the steep mountain side , with ready feet , To preach the gospel to the Greeks , he ran , To tell of that fair city with its gates Of gleaming pearl , and streets of shining gold , Built for the people of the gracious Lord . But to the Greeks his words were foolishness . The Stoics cried , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unknown gods ! " And thus they closed their ears against his words Of beauty , and went on their careless way . ' T were long to tell how patiently he toiled ; How some believed , and some refused to hear ; Of all the cities that he visited ; And how his words were always , " God is love ; " How he was saved by miracle from death , When cast into a pot of boiling oil ; How in a weary dungeon he was thrown , Yet counted it but gain , for in the dark The angels dwelt with him and made it light . At last he was released . Perhaps his face --  So full of holy love , so angel-sweet , He seemed Christ 's brother -- moved his cruel foes To pity ; and they bade him go in peace . So from the rusty iron gates he passed , With a bowed form , and hair as white as snow . John traversed Europe for the Lord . At last His pilgrim feet pressed Russia . Through its coast He preached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lord to erring men . But everywhere with cold indifference , Or anger , or contempt , his words were met : Until , at last , with bleeding feet , he came To bleak Siberia . A churlish crowd Received his message with a stupid stare ; Which , as he gently told them of their need Of Him who came to save them from their sins , Changed to a glare of rage . So curst were they , They would have slain him ; but on his calm face There fell a light supernal , and he passed In safety through their midst , and came at last To where the Arctic laves with icy wave The chill Siberian coast , and there a boat Filled with strong men received him , and they plied Their oars , and like a swift-winged bird , sped north . Within the iceberg barricade which girds Impregnably the Northern Pole , ' t is said There is a Beulah Land surpassing fair , With beaming sky and soft delicious air , Rich with the perfume sweet of blossoms rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girdling waves , warm as the summer , fringe Its golden sands with lace of foam , and die In soft accord with bird-song melody . No cruel heats nor chilling blasts invade , But the sweet quietude of twilight shade Brings ever to the mind a holy calm . And there , ' t is said , the Great Apostle waits Until the end of all things shall draw near , When he will come again , and preach to men With the old words of love , and move their hearts To penitence , and they will captive yield To the sweet words of truth , and give their lives With heartiness to deeds of charity . Come , blest Apostle ! from the icy North Haste thy departure , for the world is faint And weary for the music of thy feet . The earth is growing old . Two thousand years Have fled since thou and Jesus walked with men . Two thousand years of bitterness of creeds ; Two thousand years of selfishness and crime . Come thou ! our clouded hearts to gently win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to evening comes the silver moon ; As comes the south-wind on the wings of June : From the far south the waves of summer roll , Come from the North , thou summer of the soul ! O , how our eyes are lifted to behold The rising of the star whose beams of gold Will usher in , with Bethlehem songs above , The day of Love -- sweet universal Love . Thou art its priest , O son of Zebedee , And we are waiting -- waiting still for thee . Why tarry yet thy footsteps from afar Thou gentler John the Baptist ? May thy star The herald of The Christ uprising shine , The harbinger of love -- of Love Divine . THE BLESSED VALE . Inscribed to H. N. Powers . THE BLESSED VALE . PRELUDE . Why should we journey to a distant star ? For lo ! we dwell within the Land of Dream ; The walls of jasper round about us gleam , Beneath our feet the golden pavements are . It is not far , O brothers , to the light ; Unheard by us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves of healing grow ; We dream of pinions when we need but SIGHT . * * * * * * There is a Blessed Vale of beauty rare , Alas ! I can not find it when I would ; Yet sometimes , in a meditative mood , My feet have wandered , how I know not , there . On devious paths unseen by mortal eyes , O'er pleasant fields or shadowy by-ways drear , I draw in joy , perchance in sadness , near To where in peace the Blessed Valley lies . Sometimes when thro ' the sapphire arch of morn The tides of light and bird-song mingled roll , A softer radiance falls upon my soul , A sweeter music to mine ear is borne . When day 's last color like a star-tipt sail Has vanished o'er the western sea of night , The air grows mellow with a rosy light ,  --  And lo ! I stand within the mystic vale . And sometimes on the city 's crowded street , Where avarice meets in never-ending fray , The roar of trafficking dies far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bright dreams of Heaven ! alas , how soon ye fail , And leave me to the empty ways of earth , Whose treasures seem to me of little worth , Since I have stood within the Blessed Vale .
