txt A good cup of coffee is a good thing , especially on a cold morning ; but it is a thing which few people get in either cold or warm weather . Not many of the articles that contribute to the comfort of human life are so uniformly poorjy made as that which constitutes the beverage of most breakfast-tables . Why this should be so we can not tell ; but it is a fact which no person of observation in regard to the manners and customs of society will dispute , and one to which any individual who has ever traveled much , or had occasion to order the article in question very frequently at restaurants , will , in respect at least to hotels and eating-houses , give a most emphatic and hearty assent . The worst specimens of this beverage accessible to the public are to be found at some of those railroad stations where passengers , after enjoying all night the refreshing atmosphere and delightful music of a sleeping-car , sit down to an equally refreshing and delightful breakfast . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such places is , we are aware , in some way or other which , in our ignorance , we do not exactly understand , indispensably connect ' ed with the workings of our vast and beneficent system of railway transit . There are , it is true , some exceptions to this rule , but although they do not appear to occasion any great catastrophe or loss of life in running the trains , yet doubtless the Companies have cause to apprehend some serious evil from so great an innovation on established usage , for few of them appear in any way to encourage it . Bid , while there may be some valid reason , connected with the safety of the trains , against haying good coffee at railroad stopping-plaees , there certainly can be no danger to life or limb in providing it at ordinary hotels and restaurants . At a few of thelatter , indeed , it can be bad , and occasionally , though very rarely , at the former . It would naturally be thought that the charges of our first-class hotels would j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests with a tolerably fair article of the kind . We are very sure that there are many travelers who would gladly see some of the items with French names left oft the bill of fare at dinner , if thereby the proprietors could save enough to enable them to provide a palatable cup of coffee at breakfast . But hotels , restaurants , and railroad eating-horses are not the only places where poor coffee is seen . There are many private houses where it is as bad as it could possibly be made at establishments where hundreds of persons are seated at table . And here , if we may be permitted to do so , we would venture a hint to young ladies contemplating the speedy approach of matrimony . There is no more efficient way of tranquilizing a ferocious disposition in one of the rougher sex than by giving him a good . cup of coffee at his breakfast . In fact , the preparation of this beverage is , in its relation to domestic in i harmony , a matter scarcely inferior n mportance to the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any cook in whom is a spark of professional dignity , would be aroused and incensed at any attempt on the part of her employer , particularly if that employer were a newly-married lady , to interfere with the making of the coffee . What can the bride do in such a conflict  --  between her desire to conciliate the authority she has just promised to obey , and the necessity of appeasing that which she knows she must obey I Here is a fearful dilemma ; here are the rock and the whirlpool at the very outset of the voyage . But we will not dwell on this painful theme . The obstacles to matrimony in modern society are already too great , and we would not willingly say anything to add to them . We should be heartily glad if we could suggest any practicable remedy for the very general difficulty in obtaining good coffee , and especially should we be rejoiced if any words of ours could . touch the obdurate feelings of hotel and restaurant keepers in relation to the matter . But we have little hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably expect is that which too often is the only reward received by those who , in reference to many other objects . exert themselves in a similar manner for the benefit of society  --  the simple consciousness of having done our duty in making the appeal .
