THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN EUROPE . By EMILIO CASTELAR . IlL-THE GERMANIC PEOPLES . THE German race fills the most special ministry in modern society , as a race which has carried in its own spirit and bronght into daily life the sentiment of individuality , effaced in the ancient states . Many writers think and say that this division into races is fundamentally false , and injurious in its consequences to the idea of human unity . Nevertheless , a conscientious study of history proves that either by conquest or by political influences , or other relations between peoples and the regions they occupy-relations as intimate as those between the body and the soul of every man - tribes and nations draw near each other , mingle , and form one race , just as families approach and mingle to form a people , to compose a trae nationality . And thus , as it is no contradiction to the unity of nature that there should be planets and satellites , worlds and suns , it is no contradiction to the unity of the human race that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The natural medium in which they move affects the color of their skin , the size of their eyes , the degree of their facial angle ; and the society in which they grow up affects their conscience , their intellect , and moral life . There is nothing so closely conn*cted with the spirit as speech . Many philosophers have confounded the idea with the expression of it , and have proclaimed the impossibility of the most secret and intimate thoughts without the aid of language . Christian theology has called the Second Person of its Trinity the God - Man , the Word ; and the revelation of ideas , which is for our souls what heat is for our life , has been the eternal revelation of Speech . Human speech is , therefore , the most intellectual and the most spiritual of all our natural functions , and speech is diversified not according to nationalities , but according to race . What strict kinship there is between the Portuguese , the Italian , the Spanish , and the French ! It might be said that all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little reading , a little practice , we attain to their complete possession . And why ? Because the four dialects are immediately derived from that mothertongue which has given its name to our race  --  the Latin language . In the most remote antiquity are unerring proofs of this . While the speech of the pagan peoples-the progressive , artistic Judo-European peoples - has rounded periods , complicated syntax , a verb rich in tenses and moods , which enable it to subordinate secondary thoughts to the capital thought , subsidiary phrases to the predominant and the sovereign phrase , the religious Semitic peoples , born to diffuse monotheism , reared in the solitude of the desert , the authors of that music which appears like the sob of the soul , and of an architecture which reserves all its marvels for the interior  --  the speech of these peoples is triliteral in its roots , simple in its syntax , suiting the sense to the sound in its words , cut up into versicles united by the primitive medium of the conjunction-all differences of the highest importance from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed to contain and to express the variety of human thought . The Judo-European languages have these characteristics because they are the languages of those peoples who have passed through all political ideas and social forms ; who have produced gods in their image ; who have placed the direction of their states in the hands of legislators , tribunes , heroes ; who have written the analysis of Aristotle , the synthesis of Plato ; who have consumed innumerable philosophical ideas in the perpetual movement , the periodical renovation of their spirit-while the Semitic tongues are the languages of religious peoples , who have founded the idea of the unity of God in Jerusalem and in Mecca ; who have resolved almost all their forms of government into a pure theocracy ; who have been directed by the voice of prophets ; who have written the Koran and the Bible ; who opposed to the Greek chorns the melancholy hymn ; to the drama , subjective and lyric poetry ; to free thought , the perpetual commentary of their revelations ; to the gods of mythology and the God-Man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret tabernacle in the immensity of the heavens . If two fundamental races have filled ancient history and the ancient world , two fundamental races fill the modern worid and modern history-that is to say , the Latin and the German races . The latter has always borne with it the idea of individuality , and has opposed this undying individuality , caught from the very bosom of nature , to the absorbing forces , to the institutions-means of civilization in certain historical periods , but always repressive-of the Helleno-Latin race , more artistic , more humane , if you please , than the German races , but less apt to preserve its entire liberty , and to hear in daily life the call of its own conscience . It is an irrevocable law of history that the German races should destroy the great uni* // ties reared by the Helleno-Latin races-those great unities beneath whose weight human personality disappears , and with it the law of liberty in life . The famous writers of antiquity announced , with the prophetic power of their genius , the destiny confided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . When Lucian described in imperishable verse the ruin of liberty at Pharsalia , he did not see that it became extinguished . He saw it pass the Rhine , take refuge with the primitive and ancient tribes known as Germans . Tacitus , the conscience , the remorse of the ancient society-Tacitus , who heated his steel red-hot in the fire of the love of liberty , to plunge it like a dagger into the heart of tyrants-opposes to the work of Cassarism the work of nature ; to the despotic empire the federation of tribes ; to the magistracy imposed by Pretorian slaves the magistracy elected by freemen ; to the corrupted court of the emperors the loving family , the respect for women , the purity of morals , acquired in the inspirations of conscience and the exercise of liberty . Cassar , on whose brow appeared to have been condensed all the genius of Rome , trembled before this immense mystery which was called the German world , and wished to *nclose it in his empire . And in these distant forests and plains , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nature , the Germans felt their wrath against the Eternal City rise like a hot wind . " I do not go of my own will to * exclaimed Alaric in his raids ; " I feel that something superior to me pnshes me on , drags me 1*rward , without giving me rest , and forces me imperiously to sack Rome . " Genseric unfurled the sails of his ship to the wind , not knowing where he was going . The pilot asked him , " Lord , where are we going ? " " To seek those peoples against whom the wrath of God is aroused ; " and they went to Rome . What was it which these barbarians hated most in Rome ? It was the principle hostile to their principle , the ideal contrary to theirs . They hated the omnipotent power , the absorbing authority , the Cassarism , which denied the very root of life , our personality . And from that time , whenever the Latin world has arrived , by the impulse of its character , by the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states which reproduce the Roman empire , the Germanic race has always come to re-establish the principle of individuality . Thus , as the hordes of Alaric and Genseric , born in the forest , educated in the shock of battle , without any home but their war-car , without any patrimony but their arms , rnshed to devastate Rome because it was the centre of imperial and Cassarist unity , the descendants of these hordes fulfill in the Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , and in modern times the same ministry they accomplished at the end of ancient history . If the French people , apostatizing from Germanic principles , re-establish the empire under Charlemagne , other tribes , other European families of the same origin , scourged by the sword of the Normans , found modern individualism in the feudal chaos . When the popes seized the control of consciences , and organized by their theocracy a strong government and universal authority proceeding from Rome , the German empire and its most illustrious representative , the house of Suabia , contested this religious unity with political and civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oriental tyranny of Byzantium , founded by a coalition of the patriarch and the emperor . In the sixteenth century the Emperor Charles V. , on one side , with his immense domains , and the artistic popes on the other , with their immense prestige , saved the Church from schism , dissolved the councils which threatened the power of the Church , reduced Ghent to submission , decapitated municipal freedom in Villalar and the brotherhoods in Valentia , who threatened the power of the empire . When two powers of such force on earth as the power of Charles V. , who found a new world in the seas , and the power of Leo X. , who found an ancient worid among the ruins , threatened to restore Cassarism , there arose to hinder it , to deprive the pontificate of its prestige and the empire of its peace , the obscure monk Luther , who , collecting all the anger of his race , from the blasphemies of the drunken peasant to the prayer of angels in ecstasy , sacked the Rome of religion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thousand years before , the Rome of the Cassars . The power of Philip II . suffocated Protestantism ; but a German by race , a Hollander by birth , named Orange , threw down the colossus which covered Europe with its shadow . If the policy of Louis XIV. , in the following century , engendered another gigantic Catholic reaction , as well in conscience as in courts , another Orange , also a German by race and a Hollander by birth , raised the Protestant individualized religion to the throne in England . If the kings in the middle of the eighteenth century established their absolute authority , despoiling even the Church of its attributes , the Germanic races , or their Saxon family , shook these absolute powers with the proclamation of therepnblic , and the advent of democracy in America . If , in the triumph of revolutionary principles in 1793 , and their new triumph in 1848 , the Cassarist reaction , initiated first by the Cassar of our time , and by his descendant the new Augustus , founded on imperial authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moltke and Bismarck at Sedan , destroyed these empires , and elevated anew the idea of human individuality , which is // like the bone and the marrow of all our liberties . We must not demand of the German races that in the European republican movements they should adopt in advance of the Latin races the organization of the republic . This organism will always be the work of the artistic and inspired race  --  the race which , the moment it has conceived the idea , has always put it into practice , anxious to create and to produce a complete realization of its ideas . But the German race has kept this individualist idea , this intimate sentiment of personal independence , which really constitutes the dignity without which republics are impossible . These ideas , these sentiments , are , as it were , the matter of which tho republic is the form . In the immense nebula composed by this diffusion of the human spirit democracy is formed , as Laplace says the sun and the planets are formed in the infinite nebula of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of modern revolution , has consisted in procuring us a rational knowledge of that idea of right which we had felt , and had aimost implanted in reality , before they gave us that clear and distinct knowledge of it . For another most intimate characteristic-I will not say of the race , but of the German nation-is the predominance in it of the scientific sentiment , of self-acting free thought over the practical sense , over the thought of policy . The Germans have accomplished their revolutions more in conscience than in space . Their most formidable insurrections have been those of the spirit . Certainly they have not , like us , reared the guillotine for their kings ; nor have they , like us , laid the demolishing axe at the base of their temples ; nor have they , in the present century , hanged their feudal lords to the lamp-posts , as the French hanged their nobles and the Spaniards their friars . We are still awaiting the formidable revolution announced by Heine , by the side of which the French revolution is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of revolutionists . But in the intellectual sphere , in the heaven of ideas , in philosophy and the arts , what profound revolutions , what audacious detbronements , have they accomplished ! The gods and the kings , the sacerdotal and aristocratic castes , the fundamental dogmas of the religions of the Middle Ages and of the monarchical traditions , all have been *composed and consumed in the burning crucible of their criticism . To investigate , therefore , the part which the Germans have taken in this modern political revolution , at the termination of which we are to meet the republic organized in the united states of Europe , we shall find that it is necessary to study science more than history , the course of ideas more than the course of events . Far away in the infinite and tranquil heaven of modern thought , where our low tempests never arrive , the bolt was forged which was destined to strike down the religious , philosophical , and political standard which was the true origin of hereditary and permanent powers . This revolution is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is more efficacious , more fruitful in results , even than violent revolutions whose shock appalls us ; for this invisible , impalpable electricity of ideas excites the material revolution , and raises that storm of conscience which gives life and vitality to events . Is it true that peoples can not possess universality of aptitudes ? Can it be true that those most expert in the abstractions of science fail when they descend to the reality of politics ? We are tempted to believe this , studying the scientific and political movements in Germany . Their audacity is without limit when it is necessary to affect moral powers and abstract ideas ; their philosophers approach the starry throne of the God of history and tradition with the froth of demagogic rage on their lips and the axe of the regicide headsman in their hands . At the blows of their implacable logic superstition falls with a noise more tur*iultuous than that of revolutions . Hernan Cort6z , with all his adventurous genius and all his epic valor and Spanish faith , never attacked the idols of conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked with scientific formulas the God of his fellow-citizens . All our outbreaks in the public streets , our insurrections , all our revolutionary which gave out such thunder of electricity , never contained the essence nor the quantities of revolution contained in those apparently obscure and idealistic discourses , foreign to reality , pronounced by the German doctor , seated behind his lofty desk as on a vague and remote cloud . To them , to those German masters of philosophy , we owe that theory of right before which the ideas of Rousseau appear conservative and reactionary ; to them we owe that theory of progress by whose impulse all institutions , even those most trusted for their celestial origin , and those most destined to eternity by the public powers , have fallen in the idealistic movement of human ideas , and have submitted to the law of universal transformation which condemns all resistance to liberty to sure defeat , and reaction to inevitable death . The universe and God , the soul and the body , nature and the spirit , have been called to the tribunal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priests and warriors , to the tribunal of their history . No tribune ever directed such imprecations against the pride of tyrants as they against the authority of the monarchy ani the church . No revolution ever freed society of monsters with the // power which tliey have employed to free the conscience from sophisms . But these demi-gods of the earth , the sovereigns of thought , the judges of institutions , when they descend to common life have seen their most sacred rights at the mercy of the first groom of one of these kings or kinglets , the relics of the Middle Ages , the ignes fatui in the grave-yard of history , who lately reigned , and who in some little states still reign , over the feudal soil of old Germany . The Germans have been compared to the ancient Indian , absorbed in contemplations of the world and of himself , and giving to other peoples his ideas and his gods . They have been compared also with the Greeks of the time after Alexander , not that they possessed the written and oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as if the Hellenic spirit could never be touched by decadence ; not that they possessed that relief of form and . of expression which gives life and blood and flesh to the most abstruse thoughts ; but they resembled the Greeks in their dotage , because , like these , they think , write , speak , teach , and transform the conscience , give themselves up to ideas , and do not perceive that by their side , over their shoulders , is rising a military and autocratic empire which , from one encroachment of tyranny to another , may end in bringing about the physical and moral degeneracy of ancient Byzantium . The Latin peoples , who are always so swift in the realization of their ideas , have scarcely ever enjoyed liberty of thought . The Germanic peoples , who have possessed liberty of thought , have scarcely experienced the living desire of realizing their thought . And the idea which never touches reality , which does not convert itself into a heart and soul distributed among the people , which breaks no chains , which destroys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is like a god without providence , shut up in the solitude of his inaccessible essence , without communication either with the spirit or with nature . No one admires Germany as I do . Its metaphysics are the touch-stone of our thought ; its poetry responds better than any other to the vague idealism of our spirits ; the art of Germany may be called the philosophy of the heart ; its music , impenetrable at the first hearing , appears when you have learned it the voice of nature , the harmony of uncreated ideas , the anticipation of the spiritualism of heaven . I pardon the German writers their confusion of style and the philosophical obscurity of their thoughts , because I understand that only in this way can the individualism characteristic of their nature be preserved . I admire their patient investigations , their religious worship of science , all the enlight-. eument which Germans Jiiave given to the modern spirit ; but we who love progress have a right to make some complaint , some bitter reproaches , to the German people . If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all their aptitudes for liberty ; despising gold , because they were ignorant of the necessities which gold satisfies ; united in assemblies where the leading men treated of details , and the whole people of general results ; governed more by example than authority , more by persuasion than by force ; enjoying the privilege of electing their chiefs , and disposed to follow them every where through a sense of duty ; chaste worshipers of woman , on whose brow they discerned the signals of prophecy , and in whose beauty they saw the divine ministry of the priesthood ; secluded in their homes with their families and their children , who were nourished at no other breast than the maternal ; devoted to their personal independence to the point of enthusiasm , and savagely hostile to tyranny-if that people through so many ages have preserved any thing of the primitive virtues , as they have preceded all modern peoples in proclaiming free conscience , they ought also to precede them in establishing the federation and the republic . But let us not be materialists . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstruse , nourishes the conscience , and so is filtered into reality . When we lose ourselves in scientific abstractions , we do not remember that those abstractions , like the Divine Word , must become incarnate in substance , and in the form of the human race . The traveler lost on the Alps , among the eternal snows , where he can scarcely breathe , where he perceives no atom of life on the desert of ice , does not easily remember that there below , in the deepest valley , all that cold and immobility and desolation becomes the Rhine and the Ticino and the Rhone , spreading the life and joy of fertility among the fields of Italy and of France and of Germany . The idea is the soul ; the idea is the life : events do no more than copy ideas , and that imperfectly and rude ly . The whole course of social events is filled with ideas , which are like hydrogen in water and oxygen in the air . Fifteen slow centuries were required to form a society animated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time is a relative idea . The delay will be long if it is compared with our short lives ; brief , if compared with the life of humanity . No one can calculate the millions of ages which have been necessary to form and compose the planet on which we are embarked . Who can divine the time that it will require for an idea to fall from the mind of a thinker upon his school , to pass from the investigation of the school to the militant forces of the apostolate , thence to the crucible of martyrdom , from there to the conscience of // a party , and from the conscience of a party to the laws , and thence to the customs ? But we have no right to doubt of the virtue and the efficacy of ideas , after having seen them issue from the lips , more subtile than the air on which they were carried , melting at one flash the bayonets of armies and the crowns of kings . Let us study this movement of ideas in Germany , sure of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be made in events . The true representative of the philosophical rcvolution in Germany is , by common consent , Kant , founder of the school of criticism . The eighteenth century would have been false to its progressive spirit and to its destiny if : , while it destroyed historical institutions in society , it had not destroyed also traditional ideas in the conscience . Every society which renews itself must renew its spirit , and with its spirit the ideas on which the soul of a generation finds its nourishment , and the organization of powers is formed . The eighteenth century could not promulgate natural rights without understanding human nature , without investigating the human problem par excellence , the problem of knowledge . To solve this problem nothing was more necessary than to trace the limits of our intelligence , to say how far it could arrive by the power of reason ; and in solving this problem the knot of the difficulty is found in the relations between the objective and the subjective . " Let us not attempt to know things in themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knowledge between that which is furnished by experience and that which proceeds from our own being . " No external phenomenon happens for us without happening in time , which may be extended to eternity , or diminished to an inappreciable and imperceptible instant . Time has not entered into our mind , nor has space , by the senses . Time and space are laws of sensibility . Knowledge would be most imperfect if we acquired solely sensations , if we possessed merely the faculty of feeling . It is the most primitive , and , in the hierarchy of our faculties , the most rudimentary ; that which assimilates us to the lowest animals in the zoological scale . If we had no sensations of life and of the universe , we would take our appetites as a rule of conduct , and the fleeting impressions of things as the laws of the universe . Our morality would reduce itself to the laws of pleasure . Our science would resolve itself at last into an immense heap of facts-of objects completely distorted . Phenomena , and not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sensation is purified and transfigured in intelligence , which is the faculty of notions , the active faculty of knowledge , by virtue of which we determine and define the objects presented by pure sensibility . Sensations or intuitions remain without light and without life , dead bodies in the mind , if they are not elevated to the rank of notions ; and notions would be shadowy and lifeless if they were not connected with objects . Thus , as the science which treats of sensibility is called *Esthetics , the science which treats of understanding is called Logic . Intuition is sensibility in exercise-the object impressed upon the subject . The notion is the conception of the subject in regard to the object . As sensibility can not be separated from time and from space , understanding can not go outside of those **28;202;TOOLONG , quality , and relation or manner . These elements of judgment are forms of intelligence . But notions are not enough for knowledge . To perfect it , reason is necessary , which gives universality to judgments , which places them outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , to universal principles in the purest region of the infinite . But , precisely because reason exercises this sublime ministry in life , it is necessary to guard against transcendental illusions . By transcendental illusions Kant means useless efforts to pass the limits of our intelligence . By such efforts we waste our reason in senseless ambitions , and we people our own souls with shadows . The labor we should employ in learning the possible we waste in traversing the impossible . We should renounce as illusory the thought of understanding in its essence the immaterial nature of our souls . And as with the idea of the soul , so with the idea of God , which it is in a still higher degree impossible for human reason to demonstrate . Apart from certain arbitrary forms of nomenclature , arranged solely to sustain the rhythm of ideas and the architecture of the system , the Critique of Pure Reason is the most lucid and most minute analysis of the limits of the forces of our reason which has been attempted since the time of Aristotle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid useless investigations , and to confine itself within the sphere of the possible . With it and through it remains concluded and finished that theological period which had brought the human race from the sophisms of the monastic schools to the violences of religious warsto figt and to die for vain abstractions . Man not only thinks , he lives ; henotonly has intelligence , but wilL Principles , to which pure reason can not attain by mere logic , appear when we require to found and establish moral laws . At this point arises the necessity of liberty to create human life , and the necessity of the immortality of the soul for the complete realization of justice . In the light of these principles is developed the purest moral law  --  the law of complete disinterestedness , the law of the love of good // and the hatred of evil for their own sake , without which neither the fear of punishment will save us from vice , nor the satisfaction of conscience or the hope of reward lead us to virtue , but only the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorical command of our own conscience . In virtue of this moral law man should proceed on principles which shall raise each of his isolated individual actions into universal rules of life and of conduct . Although the principles overthrown by pure reason and restored in practical reason may appear contradictory , they are not so , if we take notice that the thesis of the philosopher reduces itself to setting natural limits to certain investigation , demonstrating that the existence of God , the liberty , spirituality , and immortality of the soul , are affirmed with greater force than is possible to pure metaphysics , when it is shown that without these principles morality could not be established in life nor right be founded on the face of the earths But the philosopher who thus scrutinizes the limits of intelligence , the laws of morality , ought to enter into the sphere of politics . Intrenched within his own thought and his own spirit ; analyzing his own conscience and . reason more than exterior objects ; without passion , but also without discouragements ; knowing nothing of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in the delights of the family ; face to face with the human soul and conscience , like God in face of the universal creation-it is useless to seek from him observations upon facts or conceptions of reality . Seek , and this you will receive-ideas holding relations with philosophy and the moral sense , pure ideas of right . The origin of right was always the most important of questions . He who causes , engenders , originates law , is the true sovereign . For this reason the thesis of the theological schools claims that law , being the emanation of God , should be defined and applied by a true theocracy . Among the ancient peoples , the Greeks and Romans , law was the emanation of the state ; under Ca*sarism it was the will of the prince ; in feudal times it came from the possession or conquest of territory ; in modern times it came from traditions of God , whose image on earth was represented by the kings ; for Rousseau , the revolutionary prophet , it came from the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , which is its immutable foundation . The definition of the philosopher may be criticised . It may be said that the enumeration of conditions indispensable to assure personal liberty and harmonize it with the liberty of others has a certain vagueness , and is liable to the reproach of formalism and superficiality . But in that critical hour of history it was necessary to vindicate two principles - human nature as the origin of law , human liberty as the soul of law . Both principles were vindicated by the sublime thought of the philosopher , both principles which were to produce a moral revolution in the conscience and prepare another political revolution in human society . The capital object of his doctrine was to direct the world by ideas , and found a science of politics through the sovereignty of reason . To direct the world by ideas , he did not , like Plato , ask power for philosophers , but he asked for liberty and freedom of thought . To arrive at the reign of reason , after combating regicide and the right of insurrections as Machiavelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinated policy with morals , the principles of positive justice with the eternal principles of justice . Thus , in a world still drowsy with the unquiet sleep of the Middle Ages ; beneath the weight of absolutism ; to the sound of the rack , which still disjointed the bones of prisoners ; amidst the rumor of armies which still oppressed men , and wars which still devastated the earth ; in the midst of German feudalism , alive in spite of the revolution which lightened and did not shineKant writes , with a heart devoted to love of humanity , and a thought devoted to the mysteries of the future , a profound treatise , which prepares the advent of liberty , and which substitutes for conquest and force the pacific relations of right . To attain these great ends , Kant proposes that treaties of peace shall be adjusted with the intention and purpose to avoid new wars ; that no independent people should be subjected by violence and conquest ; that permanent armies should disappear ; that states should respectively abstain from interference with the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political right should recognize another superior right which touches humanity at large , and which can and should call itself the essentially cosmopolitan right . The savage state , which is praised by the Utopians as the natural state , is in reality a state of war . The Indian carries through the forests in his nomadic life the envenomed arrow , not only against beings of other species , which he may kill for his profit or defense , but also against other tribes which dispute with him the air , the soil , or the chase . Political states are founded to assure peace , and to attain in the sanctity of law a firmer security against violence than force can afford . To return to war after having entered into civil life is to stumble anew into the savage state . But the great philosopher recognized that the relations of people among themselves are not enough to avoid war and establish peace ; that an interior organization com // pletely pacific is necessary . And this entire* organization can be no other than one capable of assuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various faculties of the public powers . The civil and political constitution of every state should be a republican constitution . Writing under an absolute monarchy , Kant timidly defines republican government as that where the executive and the legislative powers are found divided ; and as this may happen , and does happen , even in a monarchy , some attribute to Kant , corn paring these texts of his with others of his Public Law , the intention of referring to constitutloifal monarchy . Such a belief is confirmed by his confounding in ancther place pure democracy with pure absolutism . But clear , concrete explanations leave no occasion for doubt . Kant desires a republic , because with the republic all the citizens have the right of peace and war , and it is most improbable , when this right resides in the entire body of the people , that it should throw itself into the abyss of war . Suicide , like madness , is an exception , not a general law , in human society . Next , if individual rights are derived from nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the government which can be founded on a pact is no other than republicanism , and must be formed not of vassals and subjects , whose lives can be disposed of without their consent , but of true free citizens . They call such a government as that a government of angels , supposing that human weakness is not able to comprehend it in its purity , nor practice it in its full extent. * But this alone is true human government , because it recognizes the principle of liberty , which is the need of every man , and because it establishes a common legislation in harmony with that idea of natural equality so profoundly engraven on our conscience . It is thus that the immortal philosopher not only sustains republican government for the purpose of human culture and per*. petual peace , but he sustains also the federation of republics , the federation which is the great mechanism of free societies , which distributes power among high political personalities , and then concentrates it in a supreme unity . Thus autonomous states , by means of changeable pacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority is contained in law and restrained by law , as liberty is contained in right and measured by right . The privileges of men and the interests which originate in these privileges may oppose themselves with sometimes irresistible force to the relations of this idea , but the nature of the earth and the character of the communications between peoples , the nature of man and the necessity which all men have to join in bonds of common laws , give assurance that the internal indication of individuals and the superior human education , the work of scientific and social progress , must found each state on a republic internally , and all states for the purposes of external relations in federations , which shall constitute , as it were , a new humanity on the earth . The liberal revolution was arriving in this supreme moment to the fullness of life through the knowledge of itself . The solitary celibate philosopher , with no other divinity than his idea , which completely possessed him , was impelling the world with forces slower but surer than the material ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of right defined and made concrete in its most necessary phases , the republican regime proclaimed as the most fitting for cultivated peoples , universal federation recognized as the organization of justice and of right , perpetual peace promised as a result and consequence of all these ideas , were giving to the modern revolution an ideal which in part has been already realized , and which will soon be realized in its fullness . And these formulas were not those of an ambitious politician , of an ardent tribune , of an impatient conventional , who hurled them into the midst of war or revolution to rouse his party or his people . No ; they were conceived in retirement and in silence , thought out in complete independence of any personal interests , and diffused only in the worship of the truth , to hasten the reign of justice , without any other motive than the purest , almost mystical , love of the human race , and no other reward than the satisfaction of conscience . The republican ideal was thus formulated in the heart of thinking Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century-Kant and Rousseautwo men of incalculable moral power . Kant was the philosopher , and Rousseau the artist . Kant agitated the conscience of man , and Rousseau his sensibility . Kant engendered those progressive ideas which transform the spirit , and Rousseau those exalted passions which transform events . The life of the one was tranquil and orderly as his mathematical formulas ; the life of the other tempestuous as the revolution . The soul of the philosopher exerted itself to strike , like the rising sun , the heights of science ; the soul of the artist , like the tempestuous cloud , to reach the social depths , the heart of the masses . Kant defines the natural right which produces the free man , and Ronsseau the political pact which produces the republican state . One is the true author of individual sovereignty , the other the true author of popular sovereignty . Both represent , in these two systems , the thought and action , the principle and the life , the spirit and the organism , the soul and the body , of these modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphysics , and diffused by the divine word of art , have at last to produce the United States of Europe , raised from the blood-stained abysses of the monarchy and of war to the pure life of the federation and the republic . The critical philosophy necessarily had its natural consequences . The idea of human personality recognized in all its extent , exalted with all its attributes , intoxicated with its own substance , in the restlessness of its young life , in the ambition of its passions , came to deny every existence and every reality which was not its own . The heavens appeared to its eyes as a figment of the soul , like the web which the spider weaves , or the pod spun by the silk-worm . The material universe disappeared in the intoxication ofthehumanpersonality . Light was the reflex of our own ethical spirit ; the *tars condensations of our innumerable ideas ; created beings were all organisms formed of the logical series of emancipated reason . In the immense cloud of dust raised by so many falling ruins , nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience on its brow as the sun of suns . And nothing else was to have been expected . Every new idea tends to absolutism , to the annihilation of limits , to the suppression of opposition , to the belief that it is enough to fill the universe and to resolve all problems . After criticism has pushed aside all that there is of internal and all that there is of external in knowledge , the dialectic necessity demanded that the spirit should come to believe the universal life its proper substance , the light its own reflection , and the universe its work . It is , therefore , necessary to gauge philosophical systems-first in themselves , in their fundamental principles , independent of every historic moment ; but afterward in their strict relation to the time in which they arise , and with the totality of philosophy which they develop under one of its phases . The slave , the serf the vassal , was becoming a man in the revolution which equally touched society and the conscience . To arrive at these results it was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place his right above all right . Kings had made themselves divine . In opposition to kings , the free man must make himself divine , anoint himself with the oil of his absolute personal autonomy* This was a necessary moment in the succession of time , and a logical principle in the series of ideas . The metaphysics of liberty went to extremes , erroneous , perhaps , in themselves , but necessary for the emancipation of the human spirit at large . To deny whatever was opposed to individuality was audacious , but without this audacity victory never comes to an idea . Progress proceeds through radical and absolute opposition . Religion denies all rational philosoVoa . XLVII. - No. 218. - 19 phy , and philosophy all reveah*d religion . The physiologist elipilnates the spirit and the mystic matter . In the pantheism of the preceding century there was nothing but one being with two forms-extension and thought . Human individuality disappeared in this ocean of the universal substance . Liberty was reduced to the mechanical force of the universe . To break this great tyranny of pantheism Fichte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , and declared him the only real being , gave him the earth for a footstool , the universe for a temple , where nil things were successive modifications of our own substance . Fichte personifies this moment of time , this phase of the spirit . For him there is a science which is , in respect to metaphysics , the same as metaphysics in respect to common-sense , the science of sciences . This science requires a first principle , inaccessible to negation , indubitable , self-evident . This first principle could be no other than the principle " I am . " Here is the sovereign affirmation , the basis of all judgment , the incontestable foundation of all science , the first principle of every system , the thesis where doubt with its vapors can never arrive- " I am . " From this sovereign affirmation , then , through thetic , antithetic , and synthetic processes , Fichte deduced the existence of something opposed to the " I ; " of something which had reality solely from being distinct from " I ; " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific spheres , as the enumerator of all real things , as the measure of all possible ideas . A philosophy so audacious raised general contradiction in the common-sense which considered itself insulted . It is said that at the conclusion of a conference Fichte used this singular formula : " To-day we have created the world ; to-morrow , gentlemen , we will create God . " It is said that at a certain dinner an impudent servant of the house took away the plates from before him , saying , " Let the philosopher feed on his own substance . " The ladies of Germany related that as Fichte did not believe in the existence of any personality that was not his own , he consequently could not believe in the existence of his wife , and wondered how Madame Fichte liked that . The governments were alarmed , and persecuted him in the universities . The great pagan , Goethe , censured him for the frankness with which he announced his ideas . Yet , nevertheless , Fichte was a great character as well as a great philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon misery , driven by the spur of necessity from free Zurich to oppressed Warsaw , without stumbling or falling by the difficulties of the way , without yielding his ideas under the lash of oppression , preferring to all ap // plause and every advantage the religion of philosophy , loving all humanity and its progress with a love almost mystic , he lived eonsecrated to the work of rousing the conscience of his country , in the midst of the terrors of revolution and the disasters of war , and died , amidst the horrors of pestilence , in the service of misery and pain , a master of morals , a hero of duty , a martyr of science . In spite of these exaggerations which have been published , of the individualism of Fichte , the immortal philosopher really held that the idea of the individual was derived from the relations of man with his kind ; that , living in these relations , law was necessary as a condition indispensable to individuality . The rational being could not comprehend himself nor give himself his proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many rational beings as existed in relation with him . Scientific , intelligent , and active , nature and society , the external world in its various manifestations , invite him to action , to operating upon them as a cause . Obedience to this invitation is the end of manthe fulfillment of his destiny . The means which are necessary to fulfill this destiny are his rights . But man needs to recognize not only his existence as a person , and his personal right , but his coexistence with other persons and his rightful relations with them . This reciprocity is fundamental in right , because without it society would disappear . Right is divided into primitive , coercive , and political . The first , primitive , is that by virtue of which man asserts the control of his own life . No foreign force should control a man in the fulfillment of his destiny , While he does not ignore or injure the rights of others . Individual activity should be directed and regulated by intelligence . Coercive right is that which has for its purpose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pact among citizens , and , as the consequence of this pact , the necessity of the state . Political right regulates in turn the common will and sovereignty . This common will gives laws . The executive power charges itself with their execution . The power of vigilance which Fichte proposes as a tribunate , as an ephorate joined to the executive power , charges itself to see to the execution of the laws . When those charged to execute the laws fail in their duty , those whose duty it is to watch the execution of the laws should suspend them and appeal to the people . The respect of law determines the form of government . Where the people have no idea or sentiment of legality , the form of government will necessarily be the monocracy ; but where the people respect the laws , the form of government should be the republican , the only rational and just one . All these political consequences are derived imme diately from the philosophy consecrated to the exaltation of the inner man , of the conscience . We hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty ; and nothing is needed but the exertion of our own will for the fulfillment of this code , and with its fulfillment our happiness is realized on earth . By perfecting the individual we perfect humanity , the superior individual , for whom ages are as years , slow but sure in his progressive growth . Make the subjective laws of reason objective in every direction and through all spheres : this is the supreme destiny of humanity in history . The series of events which have happened in a certain period of time have , like a mathematical progression , a common reason in the idea which animates them . Thus in every epoch one general thought has predominated , a consequence of the preceding epoch , and a premise of the succeeding . Our time , in the midst of the eclipses of reason , in the midst of the failures of the will , has solely one purpose  --  to realize the notion of right . But humanity counts many ages in the continual succession of time , and it will take more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the incarnation , the objective manifestation , of the pure law of reason in society and in the world . The capital ages of man are five . First , man , shut up in nature , like a seed in the earth , like the embryo in the womb , has nothing of life but instinct ; none of the faculties in exercise but sensibility , and the universe appears to him as a living poem , phenomena and facts as miracles , law a revelation , government a divine patriarchate-the so-called age of innocence . Second , powerful external authority , engendered among the horrors of war , raises itself to a despotism , and exacts of the conscience absolute faith in its principles , in the will blind obedience to its mandates-an age properly called that of the advent of evil upon the earth , and the fall of man into sin . Third , authoiity is wounded by reason , which begins to possess itself and to declare itself first cause in life ; the ancient principles fail ; the historical gods die ; altars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles reigns  --  the age of transition . Fourth , reason arrives at maturity , right at a concrete idea ; science gives laws ; justice becomes sovereign  --  the age of the beginning of perfection . Fifth , the ideal of reason becomes completely defined ; right is realized in its fullness ; morality is law ; art is the divine word of all philosophical principles ; evil is a fleeing shadow ; liberty the only means of fulfilling life ; good the universal end of all beings and things ; the angel of God descends invisibly from the skies , uncreated light in his eyes , a sword of fire in his hands , with divine love in his breast , to drive sin from the earth , and to restore it // completely to the pristine immaculate purity of Eden . Ficlite 's Philosophy of History gives as the purpose of life the fulfillment of the precepts of reason , and his Moral Philosophy the accomplishment of good through disinterested and pure motives of conscience ; his Political Philosophy the confirmation of right in our personality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy the divine ministry of art , which is to overthrow evil with its magic wand , and to open the heaven of reason . His entire system breaks all the fetters of the soul , and promises to our hopes , thirsting for the infinite , a pure , intelligible world , over which , like a thick veil , is spread that boundless celestial space , with all its luminous dew of suns and worlds . But the highest of Fichte 's qualities is revealed in the powerful reaction which his mind exerted against the impurity of events , against the miseries of reality . The French revolution burst out , and with it a new spirit spread through the conscience of humanity , new blood through its veins . Men of narrow discernment saw of this most important event only its disasters  --  the headsman forever in action , the guillotine in exercise ; war in the provinces and on the frontiers ; revolutionists mingled with aristocrats in the cart and under the knife ; dictatorial power in the hands of that sombre , irresponsible assembly called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes of the masses . But Fichte saw rising above events the vapor of ideas . Fichte saw in the boiling lava of the eruption of to-day the fertilizer of to-morrow . Fichte saw below the inundation of blood the harvest of new and salutary principles ; for he was inspired by something immutable and almost divine , the voice of reason and of conscience . Raised above the rock of his own desk , beneath the burning lightning , amidst the howl of the hurricane , the roar of the angry waves , and the drowning cry of the shipwrecked , he meets all with the persuasion fixed in his mind that the world was not lost or destroyed , but was filled with newness of life . His serene judgment is that of history . His tranquil idea mounts to the skies , and bathes itself iu the dawn of the future , while the mass of men are groveling in the shadows . He had profoundly investigated the human spirit , and had seen how it arrives , by virtue of new ideas , to the full knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of events was running with turbulent current through space , the course of ideas , moving serenely through his soul , was full of tranquillity and light , superior to the weaknesses and errors of the time , as if-its marriage with the body being broken - it dwelt already in the limpid regions of eternity . While allGermany was exclaiming against the revolution , Fichte studied and judged it . To appreciate it , he presented two problems , which refer , first , to the legitimacy of the revolution ; second , to its prudence . The means employed by the revolution were more or less just , more or less conducive to the vindication of right . But no one could place its legitimacy in question , because no one could with justice deny to peoples their right to change their political constitution . If this change brings evils , to whom could they be imputed ? It is difficult , almost impossible , to prevent people habituated to the darkness of the dungeon from dividing themselves into irreconcilable parties , and , being so divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , in continual combat , the broken fragments of the ancient fetters . Under these considerations , Fichte turned with anger upon those who wished the worid to be directed solely by the force of tradition , and human knowledge by the criterion of experience , as if there did not exist in reason pure laws anterior to all times , and principles beneath whose influence all arbitrary or unjust authority vanishes . If man had no other book than that of history , if because he yesterday fell into slavery he must continue the slavery to-morrow , and if time has a power to justify that which conscience eternally declares unjust , let us renounce our nature ; let us demand some moral suicide which can annihilate the soul ; let us leave off all work and effort for good ; let us declare ourselves eternal children , always learning and never creating , deprived of all original faculty and power , and destined to repeat past ages perpetually , and continually imitate past generations . The historic school says , to justify our oppression , that only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The accidental of human life , the state , the beliefs of a day or of an age , the fleeting institution , are learned in history . But the essential , the eternal , human nature in its fundamental laws , the typical man who does not change , who is not modified , can only be known in the science of pure reason , in philosophy , which gives us also the law of our right , and the fundamental principles of all justice . But rational principles are impracticable , according to the empirics . Impracticable ! And the history which they invoke in a matter where history has no jurisdictioneternal right , eternal justice-they forget and neglect in a matter in which history is competent , to prove how the most abstract ideas descend from the conscience to events , and how events adjust themselves to ideas , as the coin to the die . The truth is that the immutability of social constitutions which is desired by the historical school denies and contradicts the destiny of humanity , // which is gradual and progressive perfection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibility than conscience , has been able to give greater credit to faith than to reason , and greater value to tradition than to right . Its tutors , understanding this , and making use of the backwardness to which they have contributed , ask that the tutelage be continued for the purpose of educating the race and of giving it a more convenient culture . But no education has virtue enough to elevate man  --  to give him personal dignity , authority over himselfexcept that which is inspired by its origin or its nature in free reason , and which is directed for its end and object to the security of right ; which concludes by saying to the tutors of the human race what the philosopher said to the Greek conqueror when he stood in his sunshine , " Lord , move aside , for you are depriving me of the light of liberty . " In spite of all justifications , the tendency of monarchies is inevitably within the state to grasp for unlimited power , and out of the state , for an empire without frontiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man may be the property of another manof the monarch . But man is his own property . As if a king had given him his rights , he has the audacity sometimes to deny them , at other times to restrain them . But it is not a king who has given his rights to man ; it is nature . Neither the king nor the state itself : , even the most democratic , even that which is rnled by all the citizens , can give or take away the right innate to our personality . Man is primarily a spirit , and as a spirit he has but one sovereign-reason ; but one judge-conscience ; but one codethe moral . But man does not live isolated in his personality ; he lives also socially . Positive law is in this relation his rule of conduct . But positive law should give consecration to natural right ; other men should be his judges , but in the most perfect equality . By a series of political contracts the citizen should harmonize his individual sovereignty with the sovereignty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the expression of the general will . But in these contracts men can not alienate inalienable rights ; for it is a contradiction to say that the intelligence shall not think , and that the will shall not desire . Man possesses a right to be in society the same as in nature , to be before the law the same as before the universe , a person , free and responsible . When philosophy arrived at this point , it was its right and duty to rest , as the God of the Genesis after the creation of man . In the breast of the ancient pariah ; under the skin of the slave scarred by the lash ; in the ignominy of the vassals who bore the mark of their kings , the crest of their lords ; in the profound humiliation of the oppressed ; under all the chains and the wounds , as long as the conscience pulsated with life , there pulsated with it the free personality born of the divine forces of nature , though suppressed , effaced , by the errors of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rack , it reclaimed a law as real and harmonious as that which sustains the world with its attraction . It reclaimed as reasonable , as free , as responsible , the law of its right . It is just to say that Fiebte did not always preserve this serene conception of his own ideal , and this unshaken fidelity to his own principles . In other works , written later than the Considerations upon the French Bevolution , he fell from extreme individualism into extreme socialism , and gave to society powers which the state could not hold without injury to liberty . This inconsistency , common to thinkers who have lived before the public in incessant relations with it , ought to cause no suiprise to those who know how the vapors of events cloud the serenity of the conscience . But the life of man should not be judged by a momentary weakness , nor the work of a philosopher by an exceptional aberration . One result always remains from the whole , which is like a chemical substratum , the essential , thing in the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearness- and exactitude , the most rigorous vindication of liberty and the fundamental rights of man . If any doubt could remain , it would be cleared away by his campaign against the historic school . In the bosom of Germany the revolutionary battles which we Latins deliver by force of arms are fought with the weapons of ideas . The material agitation does not respond to the agitation of the conscience . Their scientific schools have the same position as militant parties with us . The notion of right is the motto which each combatant carries on his banner . The origin of right is a subject of enthusiasm and passion among these eternal students , as the passion of power among the eternally revolutionary Latins . The two hostile schools are the philosophical and the historical schools . For the philosophical school , right is a pure conception of reason , based on nature , in dependent of time and of place  --  the consecration of our **28;232;TOOLONG , which should subordinate political laws to the laws of its own essence . This idea naturally alarmed those who placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all human faculties the course of time , history above all science , custom above progress , the instinct of peoples above all reason . The historical school principally accused the philosophical school of forgetting the nature // of the state in favor of the nature of man , and the living country in favor of abstract humanity . The historians of right accused the philosophers of right of want of patriotism . An absurd accusation ! None of these readers of parchments ever raised patriotism to the height where Fichte carried it , the philosopher accused as a false priest of vain metaphysical conceptions . It was due to his idea-that the country should be the origin of humanity  --  to his pure sentiment of moral duty , to his worship of justice , to his care for the education of the soul , to his high feeling of human dignity , anointed for all liberties , to his illuminating and vivifying spirit , in fine , that in the supreme crisis when conquest was devouring all Germany , when the conqueror was hewing in pieces the ancient holy empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of the drums and the cannons of Jena drowned every voice , there arose from the heights of a pulpit raised to the moral pinnacle of the modern world a voice of irresistible eloquence , condensing behind the clouds of blood and tears exhaled from battle-fields the immortal , stoical , vigorous conscience of the German people , sustained by a vivid faith in their right to an unconquerable hope of recovering their independence . The ancient world presents examples of harangues more artistic , but not of greater moral power , than those pronounced in Berlin by Fichte under the sabre of Napoleon . What invocations of moral valor , what exalted vehemence of pure patriotism ! How deeply he felt the fault of our time , which has divided men into men of action and men of ideas ; when the word rings and cuts like a sword ; when thought and art also have their heroism , as was shown by iEschylus fighting in Marathon against the Persians , and Cervantes reddening with his blood the waters of Lepanto ! From these discourses , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the idea of humanity ; from these conceptions of right and of duty , which framed a new moral conscience in the human consciousness ; from these ideas , which thundered and blasted like powder burned in battles , and which produced a new spirit capable of the greatest heroism-rose tjhe national epopee of 1813 , in which Germany showed to the world once more how every conquest breaks to pieces against the indomitable will of the people resolved upon combat to death . The accusation of the historic school toward the philosophic school was unjust . On the other hand , bas not the bistorical school consecrated and defended all secular iniquities merely because they had in their favor the privilege of time ? No notion could be falser than that right is found only in its development , in its movement , in its history . For is there not one fundamental idea of right superior to all modifications ? Is it conceivable that right should reduce itself to history if there was not at least a sentiment , a conception of right , even if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people addicted to routine , given to admiring an expression of ideas like a pleasant spectacle , but without any tendencies to reduce them to reality  --  to such a people the historical school presented as an ideal its usages , customs ; its ancient legislation , stained with feudalism , fit only for the Middle Ages , of which the only result was to petrify it under the sceptre of its kings and the lash of its aristocracy . To the idea that the state is the only and complete social organism ; to the other idea , not less false , that the public instinct is above reason ; to that theory which , after having exalted the national conscience so far as to make it sacred and inviolable , delegates the preservation of right to semisacerdotal , privileged castes of lawyers ; to that favorite predominance of historical experience over pure science ; to that continual exaltation of custom , of usages , of traditional law-is due , in great part , the fact that althongh Germany is one of the most cultivated peoples in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those little states , the lost stones of the ancient castles of nobility-stones which the strong roots ctf the salutary vegetation of our progressive ideas have not been able to penetrate . No : the organization of human society should not be perpetuated when it contradicts the idea , the spirit of the time , of the century , because it may be merely the product of a historic fatality . Instinct , which confounds us with the brutes , can not prevail over reason , which is the divine faculty , the faculty of the infinite . By this road we would soon come to place the animal life over the life of the spirit ; the stomach over the reason ; custom over justice ; history over the ideal ; secular tyranny , the pontificate , which has endured fifteen centuries , and monarchical power , which has endured twenty , over our natural right , which has virtually existed in us for a whole eternity . And not only our *ight*i* thus destroyed , and with it our liberty , but at the same time every principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If duly the existing law is justice , you must admit that there is justice in the sacrifice of deformed children , the abandonment of useless old people . And not only the moral sense is destroyed , but science with it , because science can not consist in a perpetual comme*tary upon legislation already written in different codes sanctioned by custom-legislation which changes according to the changes of time , climate , historical education , institutions , habits , and usages of various peoples , more diverse in their political and religious prej // udices than in their degrees of latitude . Science must elevate itself to a universal law , which changes by no accident , which fails by no exception . And if the only thing worthy of being known is that which happens in the world , and not that which exists in the soul , there is no science of right possible . And if that be so , there is no hope of reform , because every amelioration l ) roceeds from the contrast offered between the reason , which rises to pure justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts between pure reason and tradition we have passed from the age of man in which instinct dominates , to that in which intelligence rules . In these contests between pure reason and reality all the reMANY years ago it was whispered about in a prominent New England city that strange things were going on at the house of a distinguished divine of the straitest pattern , that the unseemly tones of a violin had been heard to come from his study windows , and that a head and a pair of legs , which had been identified by peeping neighbors as belonging to the reverend doctor himself ; were seen alternately to appear and disappear above the gerden fence in such swift succession as to show that his body was in rapid revolution about a gymnastic pole . His friends of the stricter sort were greatly grieved , fearing that such worldly sports in a man of God would hurt the cause of vital religion , and they tried to Qtop the scandal . But the good man went on fiddling and whirling to rest and refresh himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching grew rather better than worse , they decided to make the best of it , while the more enlightened class of parishioners and the free-and-easy community at large thought a great deal better of him , and were glad to see such signs of humanity in a profession that had been so much in danger of drying up and mistaking ghostliness for spirituality . We are not so strait-laced now in our way of thinking , and we are quite ready to speak well of mingling a fair allowance of play with our work . Yet we find it easier to talk play than to do it , and we are so serious in our business and our care that we are as much in danger of losing our joy in the established worship of the almighty dollar as the stern Puritans were in danger of being robbed of their smiles under the threats of their terrific theology . In fact , some keen observers and profound thinkers soberly maintain that as a race we have fost our youth and our joy ; that with the gods of Greece the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are *ii superannuated generationan old set of fogies who may as well make up our minds to put our houses in order , arrange for our funerals , and die . What utter nonsense such speculation is , a little glance at nature at Contributed by Dr. SAMUEL Oseo*n. actions and all their advocates cling to the historical school as to their safety-raft . The king , who is born with the privilege of commanding slavish hordes ; the executioner , who inflicts irreparable punishments upon men ; the priest , who aspires in the name of God to subject the free conscience to the yoke of dogma imposed by coercion and force ; the military aristocracies , which live by war , as the hyena by slaughter and death ; the feudal aristocracies , who watch as if it were a thunder-cloud the idea of right passing over the brow of their serfsall oppressors , in fact , invoke the historical school and its sophisms to rivet anew the chains of the people and gild the diadems of despots. @         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
