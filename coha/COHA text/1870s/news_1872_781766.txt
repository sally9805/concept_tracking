txt The Republican victory appeared almost incredible yesterday morning . This morning it is known to be much greater than we then ventured to hope . The thirty States which we announced yesterday as having given their electoral votes to Gen. GRANT are now still more certain to have done so , while the majorities are greatly increased . The one hundred thousand in Pennsylvania is now known to be nearer 125,000 , a majority more overwhelming than any Presidential candidate ever before received in any State . GRANT 'S total popular majority on present returns is not less than 700,000 , and still increasing . Our own gallant State  --  the birth-place of the coalition  --  rolls more than fifty thousand majority on its grave . Of the States that went into the rebellion . which Mr. GREELEY expected to carry , and declared yesterday that he had carried  --  excepting only the Carolinas  --  only one , Georgia . declares for him . Of the other former slave States , he can count certainly only on three , Kentucky , Maryland . and Tennessee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Texas votes for two days more . Four States , then , with forty-three votes , with a possibility of two more with twenty-three votes , are all that this vaunted coalition can show for its long labors and great boasting . In Congress we have very nearly , if not quite a two-thirds majority . To this NewYork contributes twenty-five Republicans to eight Democrats  --  our present delegation being fifteen Republicans to sixteen Democrats . New-Jersey gives twelve thousand majority for GRANT , rivaling many of her larger sisters . New-York elects Dix by a majority fully up to Gen. GRANT 'S , if not beyond . it  --  certainly exceeding it in these two cities , which fail to respond . to KERNAN 'S nomination , though it was made with the avowed purpose of suiting their lowest classes . Our Assembly is also strongly Republican . The latest returns give al% composition of the House as follows : Republicans , 88 ; Democrats , 38 ; Independent , 1 ; Husted , 1 .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
