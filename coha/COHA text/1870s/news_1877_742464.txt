Eleven Senators are to be elected , and the candidates of both parties have been nominated. , being in most instances the present incumbents or their opponents of last year . Of the Senators that bold over , Si ! are Republicans and four Democrats . On this basis the Republicans , in order to retain control of the Senate , must elect five of the new members , which would not be a difficult task had the usual campaign work been done . As it is , no public meetings have been held , and a dead calm has settled down all over the State . Just how far this will affect the Son atorial elections it is , of course , impossible to s iy , but , without doubt , it will make Democratic success far easier than it otherwise would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee . Mr. Henry T. Sperry. of Hartford . was worked up more efficiently than it had been before for years , and the result was that both branches of the Legislature were carried by the Republicans . Under the operation of the President 's civil service order , Mr. Sperry , who is a Special Agent of the Post Office Department , resigned the Chairmanship of the State Central Committee , and Mr. Charles J. Cole . of Hartford , an able lawyer , was selected to fill the vacancy . While it would not be fair to place the responsibility for the political calm altogether on Mr. Cole 's shoulders , it must he admitted that he has worked less resolutely than his predecessor . It may be said that the Democrats have been equally inactive . But , against that , it should be stated that an inactive campaign in Connecticut has always turned cut to their advantage .

The election of Representatives is not considered so important , as their successors will be chosen a year hence , when the United States Senatorship will be the leading issue of the campaign . But if the Republicans can continue their supremacy in the House it will be a splended push toward success next year . The Representative nominations have not been made yet , and will not be to any extent before Saturday night . Both parties mean to put men above the average run of candidates into the field .

The principal business that will come before the session will be on insurance . Reports relative to life insurance in particular will be submitted by the special Insurance Commission , and a report on the codification of insurance laws will also be made . These interests may prolong the session , preventing adjournment until the last of April , but if they can be disposed of promptly the session ought not to last over two months .
