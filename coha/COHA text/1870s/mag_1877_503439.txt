RADICAL *L0TTING5 AGAINST MR . LINCOLN . THE patriotic men of all parties in the free States responded with alacrity to the calls of the Executive for assistance and support during the civil war . There was an element-a remnant of the broken Democratic organization-which throughout the entire struggle persistently opposed every measure of the Government to sustain the Union and the flag . Scarcely less annoying and embarrassing to the Administration , though not as fully and generally understood , were the factious and discontented intrigues which existed in the Republican party . That party was con*posed of individuals who had not been homogeneous in their political principles or party action prior to the interposition of the federal Government in the affairs of Kansas , but who , irrespective of old party organizations , united to vindicate the right of the people to frame their own government . After the election of Mr. Lincoln , on which they agreed , and to elect whom they put forth their combined strength , the discordant materials of the newly created party began to manifest differences , and although all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the method of conducting it , and soon as to the results to be obtained . The members of Congress were not all statesmen , or even intelligent politicians , but nearly all were violent partisans . The policy of the President was generally acceptable to the considerate and rightly disposed of his supporters , but did not give satisfaction to either extreme in Congress . Failing to dictate to or control him , exception was taken to his measures , especially to his amnesty proclamation , and , assuming that the legislative branch of the Government was supreme and absolute , his course was opposed , and a counteracting policy was projected by the radicals . A scheme or plan for what was called reconstruction had been contrived and adroitly prepared , during the first session of the Thirtyeighth Congress , by cerhin radicals in Congress , under the leadership of Henry Winter Davis , a talented representative of Maryland , acute , but not always politic , and of centralizing tendencies , the main object of which was to counteract the mild and tolerant policy of the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent reunion without the express assent of Congress ; and to compel the construction of new constitutions by or for the States in rebellion , which should embrace certain doctrinal points indicated in a proposed law , which Congress had no rightful authority to enact . This revolutionary and mischievously designed enactment , initiated by Davis in December , 1863 , was reported by a select committee , of which Davis was chairman , pending the election and assembling of delegates to the Republican national convention , which convened at Baltimore on the 7th of June , 1864 . It was held for some time in abeyance , to influence party action , but passed the House of Representatives on the 4th of May by a vote of 74 in the affirmative , all of whom were Republicans , and 66 in the negative , all but six of whom were Democrats . A vicious partisan preamble , prepared by Davis himself , and reported by the committee , was stricken out in the House by a majority of eighteen ; more than twenty Republicans voting against it , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Senate , Mr. Wade of Ohio , // chairman of the Committee on Territories , who acted in concert with Davis , reported the bill , with two slight amendments , on the 27th of May , ten days before the mecting of the national nominating convention of the Republicans . It finally passed , six Republicans and every Democrat voting against it , and was submitted to President Lincoln just as Coagress was about to adjourn , when there was no time to prepare a veto ; nor could the radical test movement to cramp the Executive by encroaching upon his prerogative , and limiting his constitutional rights , have been suppressed without endangering the unity of the Republican organization , and perhaps entirely breaking down the Administration majority in Congress . President Lincoln beheld with regret these intrigues , but , earnestly and sincerely desirous for the speedy restoration of peace and national unity , he could not , with his conviction of duty , have given his approval to the project of Davis and his radical associates , which was destructive of our federal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , growing out of the civil war , extraordinary powers had , as already stated , been necessarily exercised by the Government . The President , oppressed with responsibility , had lamented this necessity ; but its exercise by the Executive engendered in the irresponsible majority of Congress-for responsibility there was divided among two hundred-a wild and latitudinous spirit , until the radicals assumed for the legislative branch of the Government omnipotent and unlimited powers above and beyond the other departments of the Government and of the Constitution itself . Not content with the discharge of their legislative functions , they assumed under the war powers executive and judicial authority , and when the rebellion drew to a close arrogated the right of reducing States to a territorial , dependent condition , and of altering and dictating to them their form and framework of government , and of making for them in fact new constitutions . This was the policy of Stevens , Davis , Wade , and the radicals generally , as well as of Sumner , who did not always fellowship with the others ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy , he was extremely reluctant at this peculiar period to have , in addition to his other labors and difficulties , a conflict with the radical extremists , who claimed that they were better Republicans than himself ; that the legislative branch was the Government ; that the other depai-tments were subordinate ; that the Executive must devise no policy , must do no act nor take any step toward restoration , reorganization , reconstruction of the Union , or recognition of the States , without first receiving the permission and assent of Congress . The radicals assumed that the Union was broken , and , dissatisfied with the tolerant and conservative intentions of the President , were determined to make issue with him as to the manner of conducting the war , and of reilstablishing the general Government . The immense armies , indifferently commanded , the meagre results , and the waste and expense of the brief summer campaigns of 1864 , were exhausting the enthusiasm and patience of the people . The radical scheme of reconstruction was artfully contrived to turn the national discontent consequent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent and impulsive minds , in the excitement of party and the uneasiness of the times , were deluded and deceived . Under the pretext of the clause in the Constitution which declares " the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government , " it was claimed that Congress could dictate to the States which had been in rebellion their fundamental law , and compel them to abandon their old constitutions // and governmental ti aditions , and the usages which they and their fathers had prescribed , and frame ncw constitutions , embracing principles and doctrines that were unacceptable , and which had not been in issue in the war . No authority for this exercise of Congressional power was specified , but that of the word " guarantee , " to which H. Winter Davis and his associates ascribed a new definition . It was insisted that to guarantee was not to secure to them their own respective governments , adopted by themselves , and under which they had lived prior to 1861 , but it was to make , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them new constitutions , embracing certain fundamental principles of government in regard to suffrage and local self-government , which the States had reserved and never delegated . Thousands and tens of thousands , wishing to subjugate and wreak vengeance on the secessionists , subscribed to this new definition or interpretation of the word " guarantee . " The essence and intent of this radical question was to confer the privilege of voting on ignorant negroes , and to make its exercise by intelligent whites the exception . But Mr. Lincoln was neither deceived by this extraordinary definition or perversion of the word " guarantee , " nor diverted from the path of duty by the specious pretence and appeals of the radicals ; nor was he deterred from an honest discharge of his obligatious to the Constitution , and a faithful support of the federal and State governments , by the insinuation that his Republicanism was questionable , nor by assertions that he was feeble or too lenient toward the rebels , and not sufficiently energetic in the conduct of the war . He did not subscribe to the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were excluded from suffrage , were not republican , nor admit that the " guarantee " prescribed in the Constitution intended the abolition of slavery and the destruction of existing State governments . Almost every State , at the time the Union was formed , and when the Constitution was adopted , authorized slavery . Yet all were recognized as having a " republican form of government . " Such were the principles and views of the fathers . No one in 1861 , at the commencement of the war , had denied that the governments of Yirginia and Missouri , or even those of South Carolina and Louisiana , were republican . Nor were they less republican after the slaves were emancipated . They had in all other respects the same institutions , customs , traditions , and usages in 1864 that they had prior to 1861 . The federal Constitution was , moreover , formed and adopted by the States , acting not only in the aggregate , but separately , each for itself-all were representednone were excluded in the national convention of 1787 , when mutual concessions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subsequently , by the representatives of a part of the States , to exclude others , and to make and impose new condi tions for the States not permitted to be represented , to dictate new terms to them , and to establish by legislation a new constitution of government , which , if insisted on in 1789 , would have defeated any federal government or union of the States . This was now to be effected by excluding all the States which had been engaged in rebellion-constituting one-third of the whole-from representation , or voice , or participation in the change proposed to be made . The excuse and justification for this assumption was the novel interpretation of the words **guarantee** and republican form of government , " which it was claimed conferred grants of power that had not been exercised during seventy years of our national existence . President Lincoln would not permit himself to be beguiled , deluded , or led astray by any such pretence , though demanded by a majority of his nominal supporters in Congress , embracing some of the most talented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , that could pull down but not build up , received encouragement from political aspirants , who pandered to their emotional demands . To suppress the insurrection and the rebellion , reestablish the union of all the States , and at the same time observe and preserve the rights of each and of the federal Government , were matters of deep and general interest to the people , and important duties of the Administration . They occupied unceasing attention . Different views were entertained by the political friends of the President on each of these questions , and there was the persistent party opposition of that portion of the Democracy-most of them " peace Democrats " - that combined against the Government , and deprecated the prosecution of the war . These peace Democrats , and all who adhered to that organization , were unreasonable if not unpatriotic , and so intensely partisan that little support or encouragement was expected of them . It was the friends who opposed his measures and obstructed his policy who embarrassed the President and sometimes crippled his action . his Republican opponeuts were either fanaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restored or continued federal Union , claiming that war had dissolved political relations and unsettled the Government . They were for altering or modifying the Constitution , and in favor of a change from the federal system of State equality to one of a more central and consolidated character . Great disappointment was felt by the radical leaders when they became convinced that the President would not yield and identify himself with their revolutionary schemes , and participate in or be a party to their designs . But from the day he was inaugurated the polar star which course was guided his the Constitution , and as essential to its stability was the preservation of the federal Union . The Constitution and the Union were with him , and must ever be with an honest and patriotic President , above and beyond any and all mere party or personal considerations . Compelled to exercise authority which a state of peace would not have justified or permitted , he was bitterly denounced by the peace Democrats at almost every step and for every extraordinary but necessary act . They would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly conferred , even for the preservation of the national extistence against State and sectional organizations for its destruction . On the other hand , his radical friends from the beginning accused him of inefficiency , imbecility , and want of proper energy , because he hesitated to resort to extreme measures and the exercise of any and all authority , however arbitrary , which they deemed expedient . It is easier to criticise actions and measures after events have transpired than it was to strike out the true course to be pursued when chaos prevailed , and Government and people encountered an overwhelming and blinding storm which threatened them with wreck and ruin . The emergency did not permit of delay , nor yet were rash and inconsiderate measures to be resorted to . National union was to be preserved ; State insurrection , though under legal forms , was to be suppressed . The President and those associated with him felt the responsibility in all its delicacy and importance , and every step was taken with cautious deliberation , but with intelligent decision and firmness . The times required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the country was without precedent or parallel . No provision of the Constitution met or provided for the crisis . Such an insurrection-organized rebellion by State governments , and resistance by States and people to the federal authority and laws , carrying with it the destruction of the general Government , // the Union , find the whole federal system-had never been anticipated by the fathers of the Constitution . The war had been commenced by the secession leaders with a determination to separate from and break up the Union . They were met , and the war for more than two years had been continued under the direction of the President to maintain the national integrity without infringing on the reserved rights of the States , accompanied with constant efforts on his part to harmonize the conflicting elements , restore peace , and preserve unimpaired both federal and State rights . With these great ends in view he , on the 8th of December , 1863 , issued the proclamalion of amnesty under his constitutional " power to grant reprieve and pardon for offences against the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress which declares that the President is authorized " by proclamation to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion pardon and amnesty , at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare " ; granting to " all persons who have , directly or by implication , participated in the existing rebellion , " with certain specified exceptions , a full pardon to " each of them , with restoration of all rights of property except as to slaves , on condition they would take and subscribe an oath , and thenceforward keep and maintain " h . The oath required them to " faithfully support , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States and the union of the States thereunder . " The amnesty proclamation , with its generous and liberal terms to the rebels , and its restrictive prohibition that none but qualified voters by the election law of the State should vote in reestablishing the su*pended State government , met with instant and violent opposition . On the colored population , who were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying for permanent party ascendancy through the South . But these anticipated recruits were prohibited from voting in the reestablishment of State governments by the President 's policy , which expressly excluded them . The amnesty proclamation brought out distinctly the difference between President Lincoln and the pcsitive or radical element of the Republican party in the winter of 1864 . That difference a few years later eventuated in malevolent hostility to the Administration , and the impeachment of President Johnson . The great objects of President Lincoln and his Cabinet were peace , the maintenance of the federal system , and a restoration of the Union with as little disturbance of the Constitution and the structure of the Government as possible . Were the rebels to disband and quIetly resume their position , acquiescing in the changes which the war , brought on by themselves , had effected in regard to slavery , the proceeding would have been conformable to his views , and satisfactory as an adjustment . Slavery , the cause of the war or the original pretext for it , had been disposed of by the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as slavery was called , was secured to the States , and its existence or extinction depended on or was at the discretion of the States respectively . It was strictly a reserved municipal State right , specially protected and guaranteed to the States where it existed by the fundamental federal law . But not content with this constitutional local security , the slaveholders claimed that slavery was national ; that it should be extended and carried into the Territories , and have new national guarantees . This not being conceded or admitted , they strove to break up the Union , and appealed to arms in the cause of slavery . The issue thus made by themselves became national , and the permanency of slavery itself entered into the secession contest by the acts of the slave States . So long as he could , the President avoided the issue presented . When , // however , in the progress of the war , he became convinced that the slaves were employed against the Government , that they must be against or for us , that the fate of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downfall of the Government was involved and could not be evaded , he did not hesitate to act . No course was left him but . that of a declaration of emancipation , which he made after proper warning . This warning was disregarded , and thenceforward the result was inevitable . Every one had become convinced , even be fore emancipation was pronounced , that in the suppression of the rebellion slavery , the alleged cause of national strife , would cease to exist throughout the republic . It was never doubted by the Administration that the federal Government would be successful in the conflict , and the integrity of the Union maintained . The year which elapsed after emancipation was first announced demoralized and exhausted the rebels , but another and more advanced step became necessary . The Executive felt it a duty to facilitate , by such means and power as he possessed , the resumption of federal and State authority where it had been suspended , even if but a small minority in each seceding State responded . The ideaof embracing the opportunity of a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a favorite scheme of the radicals-never entered his thoughts , was repugnant to his convictions , and opposed to all his views , principles , and intentions . Reconstruction , restoration , and peace were , however , to be effected in a legal and constitutional way , not , as was urged by the peace Democrats , by negotiations with rebels in arms , not by commissioners between the contending parties as with a foreign power , for that would be a recognition and admission that the rebel organization was legal and national , while the people of the States in insurrection were citizens of the 39 United States in revolt , resisting federal laws and defying federal authority . When the rebels should lay down their arms and resume their duties as citizens of the United States , their States would be relieved of the usurped , secession , illegal governments , and each commonwealth would resume its legal , constitutional , and rightful position as a State and a member of the federal Union . But how was this work of reconciliation and restoration to begin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective parties , as between belligerents of different powers or nationalities , thereby securing recognition and making the Confed eracy legitimate . The peace Democrats took . the same position so far as to blame the Administration for not accepting the proposition and appointing commissioners . This matter of negotiation as between two governments had been a point with the rebel leaders from the beginning , before they made an assault on the garrison in Fort Sumter . The object was well understood , but never for a moment was the idea that the insurrection was legal entertained by the President or aay member of the Administration . The insurrection was illegal , and to be suppressed by federal law and authority . The time had arrived when it became a duty to act  --  a time which the President aptly said was not to " be delayed too long or taken too soon . " He therefore , with the unanimous approval of the Cabinet , issued his amnesty proclamation extending pardon to all citizens who would return to their duty , and inviting States to resume their true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was intended as an initiative measure . in the interests of peace and union , deliberately , considerately , and wisely taken , but it gave great offence to the radical friends of the Administration , who arrayed themselves at once in opposition and contributed to defeat the policy of restablishing the Government on the original constitutional basis without still further // change than the emancipation policy , and it was insisted that emancipation should not be decreed by the Executive until " after obtaining the assent of Congress . " The opportunity of the Presidential election was seized upon as a means of accomplishing their purpose of discarding Mr. Lincoln and his policy , and also getting rid of his Cabinet . There were , however , differences among the malcoateats and aspirants in the Republican party , not only in theory , but as to the candidate upon whom they would concentrate . The prevailia* , sentiment among them at the beginning favored the nomination of Salmon P. Chase , the Secretary of the Treasury . This gentleman had an ambition to be President , but was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chief . Differences had existed between him and the Secretary of State , commencing with and even preceding the formation of Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet , which were never wholly overcome . These differences called into activity the vigilance of Mr. Seward and his friends , who , as well as all his associates in the Cabinet , Mr. Chase became aware , watched every movement , and , he was soon convinced , aided to detect and defeat every scheme to substitute Chase for Lincoln . Although he numbered among his partisans some of the leading and most influential Republicans in Congress , and the Treasury officials were largely in his interest , there were no indications of an extensive feeling for him on the part of the people . In the confident belief that he had a strong hold on the popular mind in New Hampshire , the State of his nativity , and in Ohio , of which he was a citizen , an earnest effort was made in the winter and spring of 1864 to procure from the Republicans in these two States an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total failure in each State , for in their party conventions the sentiment was overwhelmingly , almost unanimously , for the renomination and rehlection of Mr. Lincoln . As great unanimity was manifested in other States , sufficient to convince men less sanguine than the Secretary of the Treasury that the Republicans as a party desired the continuance of the administration of Mr. Lincoln for another term . He therefore , on the 8th of March , stated in a published letter that he had some time previously said , " Should our friends in Ohio manifest a preference for another , I should accept their decision with the ready acquiescence due , " etc. ; and the recent action of the Union members indicated such a preference ; therefore it became him to withdraw as a candidate . In withdrawing he dwelt on the importance of energy , and the union of efforts to suppress the rebellion , themes urged by his friends , but it was noticed gave no intimation or wish in behalf of the President with whom he was associated , and for whom his constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Republican party were not inattentive and inactive during the winter , but instituted a secret organization , of which Samuel C. Pomeroy , a Senator from Kansas of unfortunate notoriety , was chairman . Pomeroy was an adventurer from Massachusetts , sent in to Kansas in tLe early days of that Territory as the agent of an association in Boston , to aid in resisting the encroachment of slavery and assist in establishing free government . He was reputed to have so managed his agency as to advance his own personal interest quite as much as that of the association in whose behalf he acted , and shortly after Kansas was made a State , succeeded in procuring the election of himself to the United States Senate , where , in the disturbed condition of affairs growing out of the civil war , and the agitation of the slave question , he was recognized for his zeal in the radical cause . Having always his personal and pecuniary interest in view , Pomeroy soon ingratiated himself // with the Treasury , and readily consented to take the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new scheme , which he and his associates were induced to believe would supersede the Republican organization . It was a flank movement against President Lincoln , who was assailed by the Democrats for prosecuting what they denounced as a relentless and ruinous war at the same time that the radicals accused him of lack of energy and of too great forbearance toward the rebels . There was not , however , perfect accord between the radicals and their ambitious but conservative allies or fellow laborers in the . Republican party . The former , over confident from their success in controlling Congressional action , were resolute and unyielding against the reillection of Mr. Lincoln , regardless of consequences , while the latter were not prepared to engage in the contest unless well satisfied they could be successful . Mr. Chase was the representative man of such conservatives as were opposed to Mr. Lincoln , and their avowed candidate . The radicals accepted him not from choice , but because he was considered the most available and prominent man for the position , and was avowedly for a more energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both factions , and agreed with both . Though by no means inclined to go into a minority for any principle , he , after his successful experience in Kansas , persuaded himself that with Treasury patronage the head of that department could be nominated and elected . With these feelings and these backers , a circular was prepared in Washington and issued , to which Pomeroy 's name was appended , and which he and his associates extensively circulated for the purpose of initiating , combining , and stimulatino ' the movement for Mr. Chase . This circular so distinctly presents the views and purposes of those engaged in the opposition to Mr. Lincoln , by the radical and disconL*nted Republicans , that it should be read and understood , in order to rightly comprehend the intri0ue of that date : CONFIDENTIAL . WASHINGTON , ID . C. , February , 1864 . Sin : The movements recently made throughout the country to secure the nomination of President Lincoln render necessary some countoraction on the part of those unconditloisal friends of the Union who differ from the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forestall the political action of the people , it was both wise and patriotic for all true friends of the Government to devote their influence to the sufpression of the rebellion . But when it becomes evident that party machinery and official influence are being used to secure the perpetuation of the present administration , those who conscientiously believe that the interests of the country and of freedom demand a change in favor of rigor and purity and nationality have no choice but to appeal at once to the people , before it shall be too late to secure a fair discussion of principles . Those in behalf of whom this communication is made have thoughtfully surveyed the political field , and have arrived at the followin' conclu-sions : 1 . That even were the reClection of Mr. Lincoln desirable , it is practically impossible a , ainst the union of influences which will oppose him . 2 . That should he be reCiected his manifest tendency toward cc#npromises and temporary expedients of policy will become stronger during a second term than it had been in the first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation suffer proportionately ; while the war may continue to languish during his whole administration , till th' public debt shall become a burden too great to be borne . 8 . That the patronage of the Government , through the necessities of the war , has been so rapidly increased , and to such an enormous extent , and so loosely placed , as to render the appli. cation of the " one-term principle " absolutely essential to the certain safety . of our republican institutions . 4 . That we find united in Hon. Salmon P. chase more of the qualities needed in a President during the next four years than are combined in any other available candidate . His record is clear and unimpeachable , showing him to be a statesman of rare ability and an administrator of the very bi*hest order ; while his private character furnishes the surest obtainable guaranty of economy and purity in the mana , ement of public affairs . 5 . That the discussion of the Presidential ques. tion , already commenced by the friends of Mr. Lincoln , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his warmest admirers ; and , while we are aware that this strength is at present unorganized and in no condition to manifest its real magnitude , we are satisfied that it only needs systematic and faithful effort to develop it to an extent sufficient to overcome all opposing obstacles . For these reasons the friends of Mr. chase have determined upon measures which shall present his claims fairly and at once to the country . A central organization has been effected , which al // ready has its connections in all the States , and the object of which is to enahie his friends everywhere most effectually to promote his elevation to the Presidency . We wish the hearty cooperation of all those in favor of a speedy restoration of the Union upon the basis of universal freedom , and who desire an administration of the Government , during the first period of its newlife , which shall to the fullest extent develop the capacity of free institutions , enlarge the resources of the country , diminish the hurdens of taxation , elevate the standard of public and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and in all things make our American nationality the fairest example for imitation which human progress has ever achieved . If these objects meet your approval , you can render efficient aid hy exerting yourself at once to organize your section of the country , and hy correspondin* , with the Chairman of the National Executive Committee , for the purpose either of receiving or imparting information . Very respectfully , S. C. Poxzuov , Chairman National Executive Committee . The Pomeroy intrigue , by whomever instituted , proved a failure , and after the pronounced opinion of the Republicans of Ohio and New Hampshire , Mr. Chase , as already stated , became convinced that any effort in his behalf at that time would be to his injury . Hetherefore gave up the question , and made known that an doing so he " considered it more a privilege than a duty , and that no further consideratior* be given to his name . " A few days later , Pomeroyin open Senate-in a prepared speech defending and explaining the circular , denied that it was secret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and notwithstanding Mr. Chase proposed to withdraw his name , declared , " We still believe him to be the man whom the people will delight to honor , " because , among other reasons , his election would insure " the confiscation of the property of leading rebels , and the organization , in the disloyal States , of a republican form of government , " and " such subordination of States to the general Government as shall secure a true nationality . " These were the motives which impelled the radical movement against the reilection of Mr. Lincoln , the key to the radical demonstration , and the ground work of their opposition to him . Other topics , such as " the immediate Crushing out of the rebellion by every power in the Government , without amnesty proclanwstions , " " Constitutional amendments abolishing and for ever prohibiting slavery , " the Monroe doctrine , ** " rigid economy , " " a sound system of national currency , " the " one-term policy , ** the protective system , ** and " aid toward the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on most of which all sections of the Republican party were agreed . President Lincoln was pronounced too lenient-not sufficiently severewas not proscriptive toward the rebels ; sought to induce them to return to duty by kindness and amnesty , which the extreme Republicans disapproved and the radicals denounced ; he had issued emancipation and amnesty proclamations , but the radicals , who denied that the three great departments of the Government were independent , and claimed that the Executive was subordinate to the Legislature , wanted more than an Executive ordera measure of war necessity-insisted that the President could not act until he obtained the assent of Congress , and required an amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery . Moreover , behind all this were latent purposes , which the radicals did not avow and make a test , because the place-politicians , with whom they affiliated , were not then prepared to go full length with them . These were the enfranchisement of the negroes , conferring upon them , by federal authority , the privilege of voting in the elections , ' and a proscription and subjugation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , involving the absorption of the States and conversion of our federal system into a more consolidated government , with supreme central power . These were important objects of Thad . Stevens , H. Winter Davis , and the master spirits of the radicals . Pomeroy , whose name is appended to the circular , acted , as he declared in // open Senate , in behalf of " the National Committee "  --  a self-constituted committee , " composed of members of Congress and other citizens , " of whom he was one , and was a co-laborer and willing instrument . This committee issued the " letter-called by some a circular-which he said was not private or secret , for it was sent by mail " to " distinguished persons . " The President was apprised of secret meetings of some of his professed friends in Congress , and their radical associates , who had in view a change of administration and of the policy of the Government , by substituting a new candidate for the office of Chief Magistrate in the approaching election . While he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more hostile to the policy that he believed best for the country than to himself personally , he took no direct steps to counteract them , but remained a passive though not inattentive observer of the artifices and schemes of these quondam friends . That he was aware of the movements against him I did not doubt , though for a time he studiously avoided alluding to party electioneering which concerned himself . But in a conversation of a general character with myself and two or three others - al ) out the time that the call of the Republican National Committee in February was issued-when the intrigues that were active against him were mentioned , he said he had been informed of them , and that circulars-which were to be privately circulated-had been prepared , l ) ut were not yet signed ; one had been put into his hands . He had not read it , and said he probably , never should . There was doubtless more or less personality , which he always avoided . He understood , however , that issue was taken to the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their restoration to the Union , to which the men engaged in getting up this circular were opposed . This was , he belicved , the chief objection to the Administration ; and if they sincerely believed a different policy was best for the country , and would bring about union and peace , it was probably a duty on their part to try to effect a change . It was impossible for him to engage in any persecuting scheme against the erring people who had undertaken to secede from the Union . He had no desire to kill them , to exile them , to subjugate them , to confiscate their property , or deprive them of their legal and constitutional rights for mistaken views or even for their criminal conduct . " A great wrong , originating in political differences , has been committed , by which we and they are sufferers . The question is , Are we ever again to be united and fellow countrymen ? If so , * there is , by my theory , much to forgive . Those who are in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am for conciliation : they seem to be governed by resentments . They believe we can be made one people by force and vengeance : I think we are not likely to bring about unity by hatred and persecution . If there is really this difference , our paths are different , and there is no necessity for secrecy or concealment . " No mention was made of candidates , noi4was there direct allusion to any individual , by the President or either of the gentlemen present , though doubtless each of them had the same persons in view . When the circular was published Mr. Chase was announced as embodying all the requisite qualifications for an efficient Chief Magistrate ; and the reelection of Mr. Lincoln , who had them not , was denounced as a practical impossibility . On the 22d of February the National Committee , which had been appointed in Chicago in 1860 , issued a call for a Republican national convention to nominate candidates for President and Vice-President . The committee designated Baltimore as the place , and the 7th of June as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts were made , particu // larly by the friends of Mr. Chase , to induce the committee to postpone the convention to a later period ; hut having the welfare of the country and the success of the Republican party in view , they acted upon their own convictions , irrespective of factious or personal aspirants , or the well meaning but mistaken advice of individuals . This call , with the unquestioned preference of the Republicans in the several States for Mr. Lincoln , satisfied many , if not all the radicals , that the renomination of the President could not be at that time easily prevented . Some very worthy gentlemen , who had become interested for Mr. Chase-as well as some men not so worthy-were nevertheless unwilling to relinquish their preference for that gentleman , and still less willing to accept Mr. Lincoln for a second term . They therefore , in the latter part of March-after Mr. Chase 's letter and Pomeroy 's circular had been published , and after the speech in the Senate explaining and defending the circular-addressed a formal and earnest communication to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nominating convention until September . W. C. Bryant  --  the veteran politician and poet , a friend of Mr. Chase-was persuaded to head this letter . The reasons , as set forth by these gentlemen , for postponement , were , the importance of union in support of a single candidate and acquiescence in the nomination when made-with an assertion that unanimity could not be obtained so early as June ; a declaration that the continuance of the existing administration or a change of leaders depended on the measures pursued during the spring and summer ; and an opinion or intimation that postponement would allay the acrimony of Presidential strife . The committee thus addressed were not only not convinced , but , with one exception , took an entirel*r different view from that presented by the distinguished gentlemen , as regarded the c *podieucy of postponement , and dissented entirely from the correctness of the reasons urged for delay . They were awarethough some of the gentlemen who addressed them probably were not-that there had been intrigues and secret meetings of the radicals , the discontented , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supplanting Mr. Lincoln ; that while lie and his friends were occupied in carrying on the Government and prosecuting the war successfully , the inalcontents of the Republican party , of every shade , were making common cause against the President , and exerting themselves to create a prejudice , in the Republican party , against the Administration . The very object of some of the gentlemen *ho urged delay was to make diversion and gain time to promote dissension and discord , which might tend to the advantage of their favorites . The President was a mark against whom the shafts of all the disaffected Republicans , as well as the peace Democrats , were directed . This the Committee , better than their advisers , well understood , and therefore wisely declined to listen to the suggestions and recommendations of the respectable gentlemen who appealed to them for delay . When it was conclusively ascertained that the Executive Committee would not postpone the meeting of the convention , and that it would assemble in June , a scheme to forestall and embarrass it was adopted . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland on the 31st of that month , appeared , signed by a large number , who styled themselves " The People 's Provisional Committee , " at the head of which was B. Gratz Brown , the youthful Senator from Missouri . Some forty or fifty prominent men , of active and extreme political views , constituted this People 's Provisional Committee . By whom they were appointed and for whom they were authorized to act , was not stated . They appeared to be selfappointed . The primary cause assigned // for this proceeding was the danger to be apprehended from the patronage of the Government , and the devotion of the People 's Provisional Committee to the principle of one term ; opposition to a national convention at Baltimore , by reason of its proximity to the centre of all the interested influences of the Administration ; the distance of that place from the centre of the country ; and a conviction that there should be a central position indicated , to which every one might go and express his individual opinions and preferences . This call was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal , not State rights ; putting aside the federal features of the Goveminent , and making it entirely central . Almost simultaneously with this appeal another call was published , signed by about an equal number of persons , from different parts of the country . At the head of them was Lucius Robinson , a prominent politician of New York , since elected Governor of that State . These gentlemen invited the citizens of the United States , who meant to . uphold the Union and suppress the rebellion , without infringing the rights of individuals or of States , and who were for amending the Federal Constitution so as to exclude slavery , to meet in mass convention at Cleveland on the 31st of May . Still another call was issued , by the Central Fremont Club and others , for those who were for the . " immediate extiaction of slavery by Congressional action , and for the absolute equality of all men before the law , without regard to race or color , and such a plan of reconstruction as shall conform to the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the loyal , and executing with vigor the law for conftscating the property of all rebels , " to also assemble at Cleveland on the 31st of May . This last call declared the Cleveland convention was convoked in consequence of " the imbecile and vacillat. ing policy of the present Adminis tration in the conduct of the war being just weak enongh to waste its men and means , to provoke the enemy , but not strong enough to conquer the rebellion ; and its treachery to justice , freedom , and genuine democratic principles in its plan of reconstruction , whereby the honor and dignity of the nation have been sacrificed to conciliate the still existing and arrogant slave power , and to further the ends of an unscrupulous partisan ambition , call in thunder tones upon the lovers of justice and their country to come to the rescue of the imperilled nationality and the cause of impartial justice and universal freedom , threatened with betrayal and overthrow . The way to victory and salvation is plain . Justice must be throned in the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assassination of Lincoln language like this was applied by the radicals , who had then obtained control of " national legislation , " to President Johnson , who adhered to and maintained the Lincoln " plan of reconstruction , " and suffered impeachment from a radical House of Representatives for his honesty and fidelity to the Constitution . These several calls , differing in phraseology , and specifying in some respects different purposes , were well known to be but parts of one great intrigue . It was a concerted scheme by a few individuals some of whom had a personal preference for another candidate than Mr. Lincoln-whose efforts for peace and union , they thought , were too mild toward the rebels  --  but the movin* spirits , whose designs were most dangerous and are more apparent in the last of the above calls , intended not only a change of administration , but of the structure of the Government . Many , doubtless a majority of those who gave their names to these several calls for a meeting of factions , on the 31st of May , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a political party election , a revolution-the // subversion of our federal system and the establishment of a central consolidated power that should be supreme and absolute over the States and also regulate the local affairs of the country and people . The names of the principal scheming managers and prompters in this revolutionary purpose do not appear in either of these calls-they were studiously withheld . Although the movement was vigorous and active , and the machinery put in operation was extensive , the Cleveland convention or conventions were each and all abortions . There was quite a gathering of wayward , impracticable , and theoretical minds , with crude , fanatical , and strange ideas of government and of the fundamental law-men with wild notions of liber* ty and equality , and of State and personal rights . Some were possessed of an absurd and ridiculous conception of the power and authority of the federal executive , and seemed ignorant of the constitutional limitations of the federal Government , and with them all was a substratum of hate and vengeance under the cloak of philanthropy and patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase and that gentleman himself became aware of the motley , incongruous , and heterogeneous materials of which that gathering was composed , and he persisted in declining to have his name presented or used . Some of the malcontents from the start were opposed to him , and wanted a more avowed radical candidate-one who had not been connected with the Lincoln administration . The result was the nomination of John C. Fremont , with a series of resolutions less offensive in the main tuan might have been expected from such a gathering ; but a reconstruclion of the Union-virtually a change of the governments , State and federal  --  and a confiscation of the property of the rebels , were insisted upon as fundamental . These were the purposes and tendencies of many in that stormy era , and really the great ends cought by the radical leaders . General Fremont promptly accepted the nomination , and as a manifestation of his sincerity and confidence in the success of the movement forthwith resigned his commission of Major General in the army to put himself , without embarrassment , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should subject himself to the reproach of creating a schism in the party , but his justification was the alleged infidelity of Mr. Lincoln to the principles he was elected to defend , which infidelity , Fremont said , had first created the schism . The Administration he denounced as marked by a disregard of constitutional rights and violations of personal liberty and the liberty of the press , with other monstrous wrongs . Against the disastrous condition of affairs brought on , he said , by Mr. Lincoln , Fremont declared the Cleveland convention which nominated him was a protest . He took occasion , however , to express his non-concurrence in some of the fantastical and violent measures of the convention . He especially objected to a confiscation of all rebel property . He also dissented from the spirit of vengeance manifested , because it would not be likely to secure permanent peace , nor was it consistent with the happiness and general tranquillity of the whole country , which were sought by all . If the Baltimore convention in June would nominate any man whose past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican principles , there was , Fremont said , no reason why there should be division . But if Mr. Lincoln was nominated , it would be fatal to the country . A portion of the radicals had from the first preferred Fremont to Chase , and the more earnest thought him a preferable candidate until they read his letter of acceptance , which disgusted extremists like Wade , Thad . Stevens , and H. Winter Davis , whose policy was unqualifiedly for confiscation , subjugation , and vengeance . Others , from different causes , began to doubt , lose interest , became // lax and indifferent , and the Cleveland ticket , which had not much strength to begia with , grew more feeble from the day it was made public . If Fremont would not confiscate-if he would not overturn the governments of the Southern States , convert them into territories , and persecute and subjugate the Southern whites , he was , in the estimation of the radicals , little better than Lincoln . The Treasury agents , a mercenary legion , lost interest when Chase was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the vast machinery which had been employed in getting up the several Cleveland conventions became useless . The seeds of disaffection , which had been extensively sown , were not , however , utterly destroyed , but still retained vitality . Although Mr. Chase had publicly declined being a candidate , his friends or supporters did not wholly discontinue their efforts in his behalf , nor was he displeased with their persistency . They were opposed to Mr. Lincoln , and had persuaded themselves that if the nominating convention could be postponed until autumn , they could , by labor and other appliances , effect his defeat , and probably secure the selection of the Secretary of the Treasury as his successor . Their efforts for delay were consequently extensive and immense . Governor Morgan of New York , chairman of the Republican National Committee , to whom these appeals for postponement were chiefly addressed , was so much annoyed by them , and so much disturbed by the calls from numerous and respectable sources , from every part of the country , as to become alarmed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse without support . He wrote me on the 10th of May to name the month to which I would postpone the convention if I desired a postponement . The request was a surprise , for we had both , in repeated interviews , previously concurred on this subject , and the machinery which prompted these apparently spontaneous demonstrations among Republicans was so transparent , that my answer was immediate and decisive against any delay , for by it the malcontents had everything to gain and nothing to lose . It would give the intriguers and opponents of the President weeks to assail and misrepresent him , and compel his friends to defend him against the assaults , when they could be otherwise better and more usefully employed . Two days after my answer Governor Morgan informed me that he knew my opinion , but had , in self-defence , before addressing me , sent a similar inquiry to every member of the committee , and that every man , except Mr. Spooner of Ohio , had returned an answer similar to mine , but Spooner was for a postponement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the influence of Mr. Chase . The delegates to the Republican national convention assembled at Baltimore on the 7th of June , pursuant to the original call . It was composed mainly of judicious and discreet men , who possessed , and generally deserved , the confidence of the patriotic and loyal citizens whom they represented and for whom they acted . Two sets of delegates appeared from Missouri , and the convention awarded seats to those styling themselves the radical Union delegation , though aware of the discontent of these persons , and their hostility to President Lincoln , the Administration , and the policy of the Government . But if factious and extremists , they probably represented a majority of the Republicans of Missouri , of that date , where the fratricidal warfare had been ferocious and vindictive beyond any other State . The people there had felt the evils of the terrible conflict , and the radicals , fired with resentment , were unforgiving and unrelenting toward not only the rebels , but those Republicans who were not as intolerant and vindictive as themselves . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , it recognized and accepted the majority principle , and so decided . // On the ballot for President Mr. Lincoln received the unanimous vote of every State but Missouri . That delegation was so opposed to him and his policy as to refuse at first to favor his renomination . Nor were they satisfied with General Fremont , who opposed the radical policy of confiscation and vengeance . They therefore cast the vote of that State for General U. S. Grant . On the question of Vice-President there was diversity of opinion . Mr. Hamlin , who was elected with Mr. Lincoln in 1860 , had not displayed that breadth of view and enlightened statesmanship which was expected , and consequently lost confidence with the country during his term , yet there was no concentration or unity on any one to fill his place . His friends and supporters , while conscious that he brought no strength to the ticket , claimed , but with no great zeal or earnestness , that as Mr. Lincoln was renominated , it would be invidious not to renominate Hamlin also . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political circles prior to the meeting of the convention , without any marked personal preference , but with a manifest desire that there should be a change . Mr. Lincoln felt the delicacy of his position , and was therefore careful to avoid the expression of any opinion ; but it was known to those who enjoyed his confidence that he appreciated the honesty , integrity , and self-sacrificing patriotism of Andrew Johnson of Tennessee . There were , moreover , circumstances , political and local , that commended Johnson . lie was a Democrat in his antecedents , was a citizen of a slave State , who alone , of all the Senators of the South , had fearlessly resisted secession . Beyond almost any public man he had been a sufferer for his fidelity to the Constitution and the Union , was proscribed , and with his family had been exiled from his home . He had been found ever true and reliable-selfsac rificing and faithful in the cause of his country . A large portion of the members , but not a majority of the convention , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were considered and discussed the sentiment in his favor became almost universal . When the ballot took place he received two hundred votes , a majority of fifty over Hamhin . Au immediate change took place with those who had not at first supported him , and the final result was that of the 520 votes cast , Johnson received 494  --  and his nomination was made unanimous . Questions arese in the convention as to the reception of the delegates who presented themselves as the representatives of the Union people of Tennessee , Arkansas , and Louisiana , and claimed equal rights and privileges with the delegates of the other States . This subject involved the principle of restoration , reconstruction , and reunion , which had been agitated for two years in Congress , and was a dividing line between the radicals and the conservative Republicans . The convention , by a vote of about two to one , decided to admit them . This decision was received as an afiuirmation and endorsement of the Lincoln policy of conciliation and reconstruction , which the radicals in Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a later day defeated . Those States , with others , after the rebellion was suppressed , and after the death of Lincoln , were under the administration of Johnson denied representation by the radical majority in Congress , and excluded from their undoubted constitutional rights in the republic . The radical leaders , finding themselves unable to stem the overwhehning popular current in favor of Mr. Lincoln , sought to defeat his conciliatory policy . Not content with putting down the insurrection , and maintaining the integrity of the Union , they insisted on the subjugation and vindictive punishment of the rebels by overthrowing their State governments , // confiscating their property , depriving them of their homes , giving their lands to the conquering soldiers , and thus colonizing the South with a new population from the North and West . Outside influenees were brou0ht to bear on the convention and the President , to induee a change of measures by prominent radicals who gathered at Baltimore , aided by the " National Union League of America , " a secret party organization composed chiefly of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their Grand Council , simultaneously with the Republican convention , and sought to make themselves felt by a series of resolutions , which were presented to the President by the league on the same day that he was informed of his renomination by the convention . The country , it was expected , would receive these resolutions as a part of the proceedings , at Baltimore , and have effect by being published with them . The most marked of them , intended as a rebuke and stimulant , resolved , " That the confiscation acts of Congress should be promptly and vigorously enforced , and that homesteads on the lands confiscated under it should be granted to our soldiers , who have been made indigent by the acts of traitors and rebels . " This atrocious scheme of plunder and robbery , by which the Southern people were to be deprived of their homes and driven into exile , had for some time been pressed upon the President , who was not a convert to its justice or a believer that union , peace , and good will could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union League , and formally presented with an address , the monstrous proposition was to him no novelty . Thurlow Weed , the party manager of a not very scrupulous organization in New York , but who possessed a certain influence in that State , had in personal interviews urged this scheme , and in a private letter to the President , on the 8th of November , 1863 , elaborated a plan , advising the President to " issue a proclamation announcing that in the future prosecution of the war , the maintenance of the Government , and the preservation of the Union , all territory , whether it be farms , plantations , villages , or cities , shall be partitioned equitably between and among the officers and soldiers by whom it shall have been conquered . " This vandal proposition , from such a quarter , earnestly pressed , disturbed but did not influence the President in 1863 , nor did its renewal by so formidable a combination as the " National Union League of America , " in 1864 , accompanying his nomination and pending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confiscation , especially general confiscation , had at no time been a favorite project with the President , and when coupled with a scheme to expel , the inhabitants from their homes , was of such a demoralizing and barbarous character as to receive not his approval , but his abhorrence . The author of this vicious scheme , in submitting it to the President in 1863 , gravely stated it would secure an abundance of military recruits - " enterprising yeomen " - who would " have an intelligent reason for entering the army , and who would know that the realization of their hopes depends upon their zeal , fidelity , and courage . And by thus providing homes and occupations when the war is over for our disbanded soldiers , you have scattered over rebel territory an element that may be relied upon for reconstruction of civil government in the seceded States . " The proposed appeal to the cupidity and malignity of the people did not favorably impress the President . Our armies were not made up of mere mercenary soldiers , fighting for Southern farms and homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their rights . It was not a war for disunion , nor yet for exclusion . When the war terminated there were dispersed through the South a needy set of adventurers , not ioaptly termed " carpet-baggers , " who , if they // were not endowed with the confiscated farms and homes of the Southern people , according to the radical programme , contrived to seize the offices , lay heavy taxes , and for years appropriated to themselves a large portion of the revenues of those States . This they were enabled to do , and to misgovern the people , in the subdued and enfeebled condition of those commonwealths , by an extraordinary exercise of federal power , by a radical majority in Congress , enforced by federal arms . It was not by means and methods like these that President Lincoln and the Administration expected to effect conciliation and a restoration of the Union . The Republican convention in renominating him adopted his policy . The National Union League of America asserted the radical policy to which he could not subscribe . To the delegations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gratification that he was thought not unworthy to be entrusted with the place which he NOVEMBER . had occupied for the last three years . While he expressed his assent to and approval of the resolutions of the Republican convention , he passed by the resolutions of the league , which had been skilfully prepared and were presented to him on the same day , and concluded his brief remarks to that delegation by saying : " I do not allow myself to suppose that either the convention or the league has concluded to decide that I am either the greatest or best man in America , but rather they have concluded that it is not best to swap horses while crossing the river , and have further concluded that I am not so poor a horse , that they might not make a botch of it in trying to swap . " I am not aware that the President ever made other comment on the Cleveland attempt to swap horses , or allusion to the assaults of Fremont , than the above anecdotal remark in reply to the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
