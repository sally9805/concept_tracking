NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No0 CCIXVIL-AUGUST , 1872. - VOL . XLV . MOUNT DESERT . SINCE early morning we have been gliding swiftly over the quiet wa'ters which encircle the thousands of islands along the coast of Maiue . Durin* the night , when sleeping , and while journeying from Portland to Rockland , a fog stole in upon us from the ocean . We are a*aiu upon our way , and now the sharp prow of our goodly sized steamer seems to cut its way into the gray wall which appears to be impenetrable , but which , however quickly we may move along , is always before us , l ) y our side , and closes up immediately behind us . In the midst of this intense fog , when you *aa hardly recognize your best friend half the length of the steamer , you would suppose the pilot at the wheel would move with hesitation ; but it is no extravagance of speech to say that he knows every inch of the way . Very often the steamer turns to the right and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never does it slacken speed . Standing at the bow of the boat , the ear of inexperience even detects at times the presence of land by the sound of the thumping paddle-wheels returning in sullen echoes from the rocky cliffs , whose wave-washed base quickly appears to view , almost within reach of hand , and as quickly vanishes from sight behind the gray veil of fog . The morning by this time has advanced , and we are conscious that the all-pervading atmosphere of gray has become gradually , and by imperceptible degrees , of a delicate cream-white . It is an exquisite ethereal substance , the despair of the artist to paint , beyond description ; for while you are gazing , for an instant a gentle breeze fans your cheek , and then , by one of nature 's magical trans CAVE OF THE SEA , SCHOONER hEAD .

XLV. - No. 267-21 // formations , instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide expanse of land and water . Right before us are beautiful islands covered with green fields ; rocky promontories rise up out of the blue water , while the foliage of trees breakH the dim line where meet the water and the sky . To the northwest and behind us the darker waters stretch away to the base of a range of high hills , whose sides , nearly to their summits , are covered with orchards and fields , and , quite near each other , white farm-houses . Astonished by the strange disappearance of the morning fog , and delighted by the beautiful scenes which met our gaze , I experienced a good deal of romantic emotion , under whose influence I exclaimed , " What a wondrous change ! How beautiful ! Is it not sublime * " " P'r'aps ; but it 's my opinion , and I 've been on land and water nigh goin ' on ter thirty year , that the sun eat it . You see , cap'n , the wind drives these pesky fogs away a little , but the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in less than no time . " More rapidly than was agreeable to a sense of dignity I descended from my imaginative height , and turned to observe the individual who had made the above practical answer to my enthusiastic apostrophe . He was a man of about middle age , with an honest , kindly face , albeit about the eyes there was a malicious twinkle which gave the key to the humor of his remark . He was dressed in what are called " store clothes , " to which it was evident he was not used . The immediate and sensible answer to my remark rendered me quite speechless for a moment , and the sailor man continued , answering the look of surprise and inquiry which he saw in my face : " Oh yes , Sir , I 'm used to these fogs along this coast . I was born in one of em , and as boy and man I 've been in and out of em all my life . You 'll find fogs all the world over , but the Gulf Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner , stay longer , and become thicker , and go away quicker than any fog I ever met in all my voyaging . " My new-found acquaintance proved to be an excellent guide in our morning 's ride , to say nothing of his interesting stories of countries and people he had seen in his many journeylugs ; and with my own experience in view , I agreed with him that there was nothing more beautiful than the scenery through which we were passing . To the traveler whose life has been passed in the midst of the redundant foliage of the great river valleys of the West or the tropical vegetation of the South there is a peculiar charm in these islands springing from the waves , patched with low stunted pines , rockribbed , with the merest handful of earth lodged here and there , and scarcely enough of herbage , one would suppose , to fill the stomach of a goat , much less to furnish food of any kind to the people who inhabit the houses which surmount each cliff and hilltop . But the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a single season than would feed a small villag* of these handy , thrifty , closely scrimped people of the islands . Their life is altogether peculiar . The women do the most of what there is iii the way of farming , while the men , from early boyhood , are upon or in the water , chiefly as fishermen , but always as sailors , and unquestionably the best sailors in the world . Meanwhile my companion , whose presence has led to this digression , had pointed out to me , and given titles to , many a ledge and cape and bay and island and hamlet , few of which would have interest to the traveler . He called off these places in an abstracted sort of way , and his thoughts were evidently wandering into the past , when , as the steamboat came swiftly around a high cliff , the sailor became much excited , and his MOUNT DESERT , FROM BLUE BILL BAY . // gaze was earnestly fixed upon a long line of gray and hazy coast which filled the eastern horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " all safe-bless the old shanty ! You must know , Sir , I have n't seen that bit of clapboard over there , " and he poiiited to a white speck among the trees on the far-distant shore , " nigh goin ' on ter three year . My wife and children are under that roof ; and , what 's more , they do n't know I 'm coming . My ship got into Boston Harbor day before yesterday , and I started for home soon as I was paid off . I tell you , friend , unless you 've been at sea , you do n't know what home means . " There was a pardonable tremble in the man's voice as he left my side and stepped to the extreme point of the bow of the boat , while his face was turned fixedly upon that , to m* meaningless white patch upon the shore , but which to him was eloquent with all that is restful , tender , and loving in the word " home . " About an hour before noon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff . It was a comfortablelooking place , with a pretty cottage surrounded by a garden and bright green lawn , which ran down to rough red rocks . These evidences of comfort and cultivation showed that the light-house was never , as are most of these night sentinels , visited by the stormy sea waves . And we soon saw evi deuce of the quiet and security of its position , as we passed through a narrow strait and pushed out into the broader waters . And then , with scarcely any previous warning , we saw one of those grandest of all Nature 's grand displays  --  the mountains rising out of the sea . A beautiful picture was before us . Seaward and to the southeast the steel - blue waters , roughened here and there by the wind , which came in gentle flaws , spread out to the far-off horizon , where the clouds , with shadows of pearl-gray , and the tops in sunlight tinged with vermilion and gold , seemed dipping into the sea . A league away , and right before us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , with irregular , uneven motion , but swiftly , it would run in toward us and toward a bleak line of beach and rocky shore ; and as we sought to give a wide berth to the sunken reef thus revealed to us , and which before now has destroyed many a noble ship , we at the same time gained a better view of the mountains . More loftily , and in more decided forms , these mighty mountains , some thirteen peaks in all , rise out of the clear waters , their graceful outlines sweeping across the blue sky , their summits bare , hard , and unyielding , and with the strong flood of vertical sunlight which now pours down upon them , they have a burnished , brazen look . The lines of shadows , too , made by deep // ravines or wide valleys , are sharp and hard , lacking the softening grace which the presence of foliage lends , but all the contours are of the simple , sweeping , but most impressive mountain forms . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Mountains , yet are far more beautiful , for they are not cut up into several dumpy peaks , and broken in their descent , but from their highest summit undulate gracefully downward into the sea . It was a most pleasant introduction to Mouut Desert , this view from the sea , and it was fully appreciated by the group of passengers gathered on the forward deck , although they gave evidence of their admiration in different ways . A party of young ladies , stowed away among the anchors and hawsers in the bow of the boat , exclaimed , " How lovely ! " " Is n't it splendid ! " " Charmlug ! " AWestern traveler , who was upon saltwater for the first time in his life , and who for half au hour had been raving crazy at sight of two or three whales who had been " blowing " half a mile away , raised his broadbrimmed hat , and whispered , " Thunder ! " There were several Boston people who had the manner of experienced travelers , and who looked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compromise themselves by any expression of opinion . One industrious artist in the company , who had an eye to business , whipped out his sketch-book , and caught the thing , as best he could , flying . There were many others who enjoyed the entire occasion , but who kept up an expressive silence . And so we pushed out toward the sea , gave a very respectable berth to the reef of rocks , which showed its ugly black teeth as we came nearer , ran in toward the shore again , when we found a formidable stone wall thrown up by the waves of the sea ; this we followed for quite a distance-I do n't dare to say whether it was one or three miles  --  but finally we passed an island , which was one of a group lying to the east and at the foot of Green Mountain , rounded a rocky point , and in five minutes had butted against the wooden pier at Southwest Harbor . Ten or twelve years ago Southwest Harbor was the principal place of resort upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came to fly from the summer heats of the warmer regions south . Cole was the pioneer here , as he was in our landscape art , and he had a host of followers . One day Church , when prospecting upon the island , made the discovery of Bar Harbor . The next year , and for I do not know how many years afterward , he took a party of friends to the same place . In the course of time Church 's pictures of scenery at Mount Desert were seen in the exhibitions of the National Academy . At one time and another most all the noted artists have followed on sketching tours , and it is chiefly by this means , in the first instance , that Mount Desert has become so popular as a watering place . There are other reasons why Bar Harbor is considered preferable to other places on the island for longer sojourn , which will be recounted at the proper time . There are delightful attractions to tempt the visitor to remain at Southwest Harbor . The harbor itself which recedes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is surrounded by an amphitheatre sloping gently toward the water . Here and there , by the hills and on the shore , are clumps of evergreen , pine , and cedar , while many a miniature bay or bold ledge of rock invites the timid or bold bather to " take water . " But perhaps the principal attraction here is the splendid view of the mountains which is obtained , especially from the southern side of the harbor . In breadth and scope , in grace of outline and varied forms and color , it is not THE STONE WALL . // ENTRANGE TO SOMEB SOUND . side the traveler will see huge blocks of stone , which appear to be part of an ehor mous wall slipping from its foundations or - - crumbling to pieces . It is overgrown in places by vines and bushes , with here and qwq and once or twice a white light-house stands boldly out upon a sharp promontory , pointing to a passage where the blue waters rush in from the sea . Successively we pass Great Head and Schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , and now , having made the circuit of the mountain , our prow pointing to the west , make our landing at Bar Harbor , and , with ordinary fortune , at about noon of the day we left Rockland . If you have had good advice in the matter , or you have displayed an extraordinary amount of sense , some . two months before this you have engaged rooms for yourself and wife and family , and you are sure to find upon the pier " Old Roberts " - we use the adjective with respect- " Captain Higgins , ** " Captain Roderick , " or some other of the Triton* who ages ago came up out of the sea and planted their tridents as sign-boards to show forth to all comers that there was to be had entertainment for man , woman , and what not-not unlike Balzac 's " Maison Vauquer , " " Pension bourgeoise des deux sexes et autres . " From the moment of landing until you take your departure for other lands you begin to comprehend the limited space in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society expects of its members of a morning . " But where in the world am I to put my trunk ? " exclaims the gentle Mrs. G- . " There is no bureau , nor wash-stand , nor any thing . And , mercy on our bones , this bed is filled with sticks ! " " Patience , my dear , " answers Mr. G " You see we are a little out of the world , and must take things as we find them . " Proceeding upon this theory , as there are no bells to ring , and no servants to answer if there were a thousand , we appropriate a wash - stand and bureau which stand in a neighboring unoccupied room . " But , doctor , " expostulates the perplexed Triton , as , some days afterward , when the theft is discovered , he rubs his tanned and hardened visage , " I got that crc stand and bureau for Mr. Scratchgravel , the great Boston banker . " " I am sorry for Scratchgravel , worthy Neptune ; but when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not mean to give me the floor and bare walls only l " " No , doctor ; but , you see , Mr. Scratchgravel , the Boston banker , is comm ' next week , and- ' * The remainder of the sentence was lost to my ear ; but it may be said that , after much pondering on the part of the landlord , he sent to Boston or Portland for one more wash-stand and bureau . The beds , however , remained as hard and lumpy as ever , with this morsel of satisfaction , that corn husks will , after a while , fit themselves to your body , and , though not a downy couch , you must bear with it until the Mount Desert landlords overcome their prejudices against hair mattresses , or until some civilized hotel-keeper arrives there , and starts a healthy competition . As these pages are written for the information and amusement of the public , and especially of those who may wish to visit Mount Desert , it becomes a solemn duty to // say something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Mount Desert table , the memories of Parker 's beefsteak , or Delmonico 's Poulet *i PEspagnol , to say nothing of the luxuries of the home table , come thronging sumptuously before him to banish whatever little appetite remains . When people cook and eat food of this wretched description , there must be something wrong in their moral condition . I am aware this condemnation as regards food applies equally to other parts of the country  --  to the White Mountains and the far West . The unfortunate creatnres who cook at these places will make bread with about equal quantities of flour and saleratus ; they are determined to fry meat rather than roast , broil , boil , or stew it ; they insist upon calling beans coffee , and so on . At Mount Desert very little meat is furnished tbe hungry sojourner , but he is permitted to feast and fast upon fish . This diet is perhaps satisfying to the intellectual Bostonian , who seeks that food which stimulates and adds to the brain ; but the more sensuous New Yorker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , must have beef fowl , and mutton . One day we begged of our landlord to send to Boston or somewhere and get a barrel of corned beef . " Well now , that is an idee , " he responded , while he shifted one leg over the other and turned his head , as he lay stretched at full length on the store-room counter . " Tbnt 's an idee . Will it keep ? " " The beef ? Not long , for your hungry guests will eat it up . " This was all we got of the corned beef although the question was again and again brought before the clouded mind of the landlord ; and some of us , who could not live on beans , fish , and saleratus bread alone , sent up to the Falniouth House in Portland for other supplies . Perhaps this is a solemn , not to say despairing , aspect of the commissariat question ; but the fact must remain that the food furnished at most-I will not say all-of the hotels or boarding-houses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Christian missionary work needed , here and throughout this country , it is upon this matter of the quantity , quality , and the most healthful way of cooking food . But the crowds of people who every summer flock to Mount Desert are willing to overlook , in a measure , the short-comings of the table . The bounteous feast which nature spreads before them  --  the incentive to pass all day in the open air , either in lengthened pedestrian expeditions , in sailing or rowing upon the waters of the beautiful bay-gives tbem an appetite equal to any situation . Mount Desert is not a fashionable resort , while it is more frequented than any of the watering-places-under which title I do not class Long Branch , which is nothing but a // parasite to the city of New York . The people who pass the summer on the rough , rocky island of Mount Desert leave their big trunks at home . The ladies wear widebrimmed hats and picturesque costumes of red and blue flannel , cut short above the feet and ankles , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gentlemen appear in warm , rough clothing , which will stand the wear and tear of a tramp over the rocks and through the bushes , and which will offer some resistance to the fogs , which penetrate like the rain . There is a good deal of fun in the way of dancing in the evening , and playing of all sorts of games , like unto blindman's-buff and puss in the corner . Daring the day parties of several persons , ladies and gentlemen , start off on walking expeditions of five , ten , and fifteen miles to one or another of the many objects of interest on the sea-shore or up the mountains . There is a vigorous , sensible , healthy feeling in all they do , and not a bit of that overdressed , pretentious , nonsensical , unhealthy sentimentality which may be found at other places . One day three young ladies , who are pupils of William Hunt , asked me if I would allow them to go with me on a sketching expedition across the water to Bar Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to make a landing over there ; you will get your feet wet , and the sharp rocks will tear your clothes . " " May we go ? " " Of course . " When , by means of a small row-boat , we got near the rocky shore , it proved to be unusually difficult to land . The heavy undertow sucked the water away from the base of the rocks , carrying our boat with it inevitably , and then the incoming wave would drive us in with equal force , threatening to smash the whole concern  --  a serious danger but for the skill of our wary skipper , who kept us nicely balanced on the edge of a wave , and who took advantage of an eddy to run the boat up on the rocks . Then we got out with our sketching traps , and tumbled about over the sharp , slippery rocks until we found the places we wished , and , unmindful of wet feet and bruised limbs , man and women sat down and worked with a will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how Hunt 's system of teaching his pupils to look at the broad masses of light and shade , and to lay them in with a big brush , was illustrated by these intelligent Boston girls , for their sketches were worthy the pencil of experienced artists . Our boatman , who was a regular old salt , . could not understand the business at all . " I say , Sir , " he remarked confidentially to me , " what do you go about a-taking them doggertypes fur ? " " For pleasure  --  the fun of it . " " Fun ! " he answered , in a deep guttural , while he gave an extra tug at the oars . " Well , you knows what you 're about ; but I 've been in and out of salt-water more nor fifty year , and it 's guy me the rheumatiz . " Sailing-parties form a marked feature of a sojourn at Bar Harbor , for the neighborhood abounds in pretty , picturesque places to visit . In the harbor proper there are the so-called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for , as seen at a distance , or under the misty veil which so often hangs about them , their abrupt form on the sea front , tapering to a point inland , their backs bristling with the sharp-pointed tops of pine and cedar trees , they are sufficiently like the porcupine to bear the name . It is at a distance only that these islands present a forbidding appearance . As you approach them , and glide gently near tbe shore , you find infinite objects of interest and beauty . The rough cliffs rise a hundred feet , their bosoms bearing the scars of the buffets of the waves of centuries . In places the water has broken through the barrier of rock , making entrance-way into what would be huge caverns , only the earth has fallen in from the top , and you find yourself in a big , deep well , out of which there is no egress save by the low tide of the sea .. Bald Porcupine ( which has recently been purchased by General Fremont ) is among the most celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring land , has a gaunt , bare , and forbidding aspect ; but when you have gained foot-hold upon its ragged shore , a thousand pictures present themselves to your delighted eyes . Bold cliffs rise up , sharply defined against the deep blue of the ocean and the fading gray of the sky . Wild flowers of rarest forms and color and slender grasses cluster in the crevices of the red and gray cliff-side , their graceful , delicate forms ever yielding to , but always resistiug , the fury of the winds or the drenching spray of ocean storms . Above the line of rocky shore there are pastures , where patches of yellow and green grasses afford nourishment for industrious flocks of sheep , which add to the artistic effect of the landscape . On the landward side of these islands , in safe shelter from wind and wave , there are the villages of fishermen ; Pogueville is the title of one of these , and its inhabitants have the reputation of not being especially elegant , not to say civilized . But , as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the temptation to smuggle . The border line of New Brunswick is not so far away but what a few hours ' run in one of their fishing vessels might bring away *i rich cargo of those articles which are made costly by our high tariff . Perhaps the easy consciences of the officials at our great ports of entry make smuggling unnecessary at these out-of-the-way places . One of the points of interest most often // visited by water - it may be reached by land-is known as " The Ovens , " which are caves like those we saw on our way over from Sonthwest Harbor , only they are much larger , and are situated more inland on the northern side of the island . I have no doubt of the safety of these sailing expeditioas , provided always you have a good boat and a careful " skipper , " and both of these are to he had all along the shores of the island . The terrible accident off Schooner Head a few years since , by which several lives were lost , was the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed the boat . There are dangers on the sea as well as the land . One day , when out upon a sailing excursion , my attention was attracted by the words , " There she comes , sure enough I " This was the first audible remark which I heard from the lips of the captain of our pleasure schooner since we had left the pier three hours before . There had been the gentlest sort of a breeze all the morning , which ha hardly appeared to fill the sails , bat impelled b which we slipped along CLIFFS ON BALD PORCUPINE . // his nose was the toughest kind of a knot ; while two little bright brown eyes looked out from an entanglement of wrinkles and knots . He was and is as honest and simplehearted and quiet a man , and as good a sailor , as could be found within a day 's sail of Mount Desert Light ; and although he was not much in the habit of talking , this morning he would scarcely have been heard , for we had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cries and laughter echoing from shore to shore . " Yes , she 's a-coming , sure , " was the second remark from the captain , while his bullet eyes shot away off to seaward . If you wish to establish a good reputation with a down East skipper , you must not betray ignorance upon any topic of sailor craft ; so I looked wise , and looked somewhere in the direction he was gazing , but saw nothing . I was ready to recognize any one of the number of things the sailor calls " she "  --  a whale , a log , any kind of a s*lling craft , a school of mackerel , a squall , or thunder-shower ; but to my sight the sea and sky were as spotless as the limpid blue of a baby 's eye . So for a while I said nothing . But when I saw " Old Knotty " put his helm up , and the boat swing obediently around with its prow toward the village , I began to be curious to know what " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , is she a ? " " Yes , Sir , and fast enough , I tell you ; but we 'll weather her if the breeze holds . Do n't she travel , though * By this time I knew what " she " meant ; for coming round the point of Great Head was a something ghostly gray in color , not higher than the land , and creeping along over the still water with insidious speed , its lower edge lapping over and over , as if it were sucking the sea up into its qwq land was gone , and we were like shadows hanging in space . " How extraordinary ! " " It is like witchery ! " " I 'm frightened ! " were the exclamations from the astonished party . " You well may be , for it 's in such a fog as this the Flying Dutchman comes , " said the captain , solemnly . " You do not mean to say you believe there is such a thing as the Flying Dutchman ? " " I know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find a sailor about Bar Harbor , or any one who belongs here , who do n't believe it . And , what 's more , whenever he comes along there 's a death sure to follow him . " After we got safe on shore , some hours later , we laughed at the superstition of the captain , but it did not seem so strange nor ridious when we were in the fog-bank . There are occasions , however , when this swift rising of the fog becomes more terrible , because filled with danger . Not long ago a party of artists started off in search of subjects for brush and pencil . The sun shone brightly , and the sea was calm and fair for a while ; but suddenly , with even less of warning than we of the adventure narrated above had , the wind came fiercely in from the ocean , and with it that terror of all sailors , the " Black Fog . " Thick , sombre , and impenetrable to the sight , this vaporous mass enshrouded the luckless boatmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tossed the boat about beyond the control of its occupants , who , nevertheless , pulled hard at the oars , hoping to get somewhere toward the solid land . Perhaps there is no class of men who worship so enthusiastically and heartily the sublime and terrible in nature as our artists ; but it 's one thing to represent these thrilling scenes upon the canvas , and quite another actually to participate in them , as did our friends in question . By incessant bailing , with difficulty did they prevent the boat from sinking with the weight of water which poured in from all sides ; and each man , from time to time , gave place at the oars to his companion , already well-nigh exhausted with his labor . The obscurity became more dense , and the prospect of reaching the shore more hopeless , when they caught the sullen sound of the waves thumping against the cliffs . It was ominous of sudden and fearful destruction , for these sharp rocks and whirling waves know no mercy . For hours these resolute men continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and wave , and by gigantic efforts avoided the reefs and rocks which soon came in their way . Meanwhile the sound of the waves upon the cliffs had increased , until it broke upon their appalled hearing like one continual roar of thunder . The wind had increased to a gale , before which the boat sped furiously , and destruction seemed inevitable , when suddenly they found themselves upon more quiet waters , while the roar of the waves sounded away to the left and behind them . When the exhausted but thankful party saw the line of shore struggling through the mist , they knew that a good Providence had led them past the dangers of Great Head into the haven of Schooner Head Harbor . There are as many attractive expeditions on the land as the curiosity , the limit of time , or the power of endurance of the seeker may permit ; for besides the places of special interest , there are the mountain roads , with ever - varying glimpses of wide - extended views ; the by-paths through the woods , fragrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the search after wild weeds and flowers , the cranberry , ground-pine , and cedar , the ferns and mosses ; the line of broken , rocky shore , with its wealth of the foliage of the sea in every pool left by the retiring tide ; and that nameless delight in watching the restless waves as they surge and foam over the sunken ledges and up the pebbly beach . In all my wanderings I remember no place where the lover of the beautiful , the romantic , and the more sublime elements of nature will find so much that will fascinate and captivate him as here . But pleasure-seekers like to have a special destination in their excursions , whether they walk or are carried , and such plac# abound . Schooner Head is one of these , alt hough the " head " itself does not amount to much as a " schooner . " Among many points of interest there is a celebrated cave called the " Devil 's Den , ** the " Cave of the Sea , " and other strange names . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a good degree of muscular effort and a sure foot to descend from the cliff to the entrance of this extraordinary cavern , where , at your very feet , the waves are tearing and roaring over the jagged rocks , now and then leaping up as if in anger with the bold intruder who seeks to learn the secrets of its rocky hiding-place ; and it is well for you not to be found there an hour later , for then the waters have their wild way in the big cave . Now , however , it is as still and quiet nsa dungeon ; but , unlike such melancholy location , here , in the darkest shadow , we find in a pool of water , reposing in complete peace and security , the most exquisite sea-anemones , orchids of richest colors , zoophytes , star-fish , and most delicate weeds and mosses-all of them presenting the prettiest picture imaginable . An object in this vicinity to which is attached more of human interest is the old " Lynam Homestead . " The house itself is not specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while an old well-sweep and a withered tree in the yard give the place a look of loneliness and neglect . But it is the artistic associations of the old house which will make it celebrated , for // within it ? walls have been gathered many of the names most celebrated iii American artCole , Church , Gifford , Hart , Parsons , Warren , Bierstadt , Brown , Colman , and others . The Lynam house is not altogether like the celebrated cottage in the forest of Fontaineblean , whose walls are made priceless by the sketches and studies which have been paiiited upon them by the greatest names of French art history , such as Decamps , Delacroix , Delaroche , Rosa Bonheur , Troyon , and the like , who during their summer excursions were resident there . Bnt while no sketches enrich the walls about the humble domicile at Schooner Head , there are stories and memories of artists and artistic adventure which will make it interesting for a long while to come . It was on the rocks near the Lynam cottage where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order which is noticed above . My wife and I had made a sketching excursion over to Schooner Head from Bar Harbor , and on the cliff near by had selected for our morning 's work a bit of foreground , where the rocks , covered with lichens , cropped out here and there from the firm ground , which in places near the shore like this never gives sustenance to other herbage than the short yellow grass , or the richer tinted moss , or perhaps the beautiful running groundpine . Just beyond a cedar-tree rose up across the broken cliff and the distant line of deep blue where the sea met the sky . It was an excellent subject for a pic fare , and we had got fairly to work , and had settled down into that delicious quiet and calm which only the student of nature can know , when our cars were saluted by several distinct grunts . At first we paid no attention to these sounds , but soon they came nearer and nearer , until the author , an enormous hog , poked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of us . Under ordinary circumstances the presence of a porker , while not fascinatingly attractive , may be submitted to , provided he keeps his distance , which is six feet , to say the least . But our four-legged critic , after a careful examination of the situation , claimed closer acquaintance , and advanced his huge person gradually but positively , when it became apparent to several of our senses that his movement was offensive . To our cries of " Shoo , shoo , shoo ! " " Get out , you beast ! " " Hi , hi , hi ! " an d so on , the horrid intruder paid no heed , but continued his aggressive movement , and we were at last forced to put down palette and paintbox , and , with sticks and stones , drive the creature away . Hardly were we again comfortably seated and at work , when the obstinate beast returned to the charge , and again we drove him away as before . Meanwhile we had laid in a stock of ammunition in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third approach-for at us he came again  --  the batteries opened upon him were fierce and incessant . For a while he halted , unable to resist the blinding fire , DEVIL 'S DEN AND SCHOONER HEAD . // // and sitting down upon his haunches , he emitted a succession of the most extraordinary sounds that ever proceeded from the mouth of a hog . He squealed like a hog , he snorted like a horse , he brayed like a mule , he roared and grunted and whistled . The nervous excitement of the animal was distressing , if not alarming , to see ; he swayed from one side to the other , tossing his head in the air , squinting at us first with one eye and then with the other , and altogether exhibiting a state of mind inexplicable upon any established theory of porcine philosophy . Finally , under a heavy shower of missiles , he gathered himself together and fled to the bushes , where he disappeared from sight and sound . " Thank Heaven ! " we exclaimed , " the vile creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of . " And after mutual wondering at what had occurred , once more we resumed , and for half an hour , in tranquil content , continued our work . But peace was not to be our lot that day , for all at once , right behind us , we heard the crashing of the branches , and turning , we beheld the horrid hog , grunting and squealing , and in the act of dashing furiously upon us . Without the warning sound we should have been overrun , and perhaps dangerously injured ; as it was , I met the assa* with the iron point of the staff of my sketching umbrella , andwasable , byactiveblows , to keep the pertinacious pig away while we packed up and beat a retreat to the outer line of irregular , jagged rocks , where we thought ourselves secure . But , astonishing as it may seem , this creature , with something of the agility of a goat and with all the obstinacy of a hog , followed us out upon the rocks , and for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason of the attraction of this extraordinary hog to myself and companion remains a mystery . Was it the smell of the lunch which we carried in our sachel , and which reached his keen and eager nostrils ? Had he been brought up as a pet , and were his overtures simply evidences of affection ? Or was he not a member of that herd of swine mentioned in the Scriptures into which were driven the unclean spirits , and was not this one of the hogs who was not drowned in the seal Not more than a mile from Schooner Head , and along the same shore , is Great Head , whose title , unlike that of its neighbor , is no misnomer . Here the massive cliffs lift their bald front high in air , as if to challenge the wildest , most furious assaults of wind and wave . The grandeur and might of these huge cliffs were more impressive when we crouched beneath their overhanging walls . It is a slippery , dangerous foot-hold here , but a point of view impressive and thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , by sliding and scrambling over the steep cliff among the loose stones , we find ourselves actually underneath Great Head . Below you-indeed at your feet  --  the waters come swelling up in monstrous waves , not broken as by the uneven shore , nor arched and combing as they fall along the smooth beach , but here they rise in niassive billows , as if lifted up by some mighty hand and cast furiously against the cliff . The wagon road leading to Great Head stops at a farm-house some miles away , and when I last visited that locality a little girl not more than six years old volunteered as guide . She had no covering to her head save a wealth of flaxen hair . Her eyes were beautifully blue , her skin that delicate pink and white which characterizes all the children and women on the island , except the many of the latter who are pallid with consumption . The feet of our little girl were bare , and as she picked her way along over the rough ground , sliding down steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always in danger , it seemed absurd that this little wind - flower should be guiding our large party of men and women . But she in reality was more agile and sure-fooftd , and ran less risk , than any of us . She seemed to me a marked example of the people of this region , who from earliest youth begin to act and think for themselves , to learn to be self-reliant , however ignorant they may remain in other ways . * At this point let me say that I do not wish to be understood that the people of the island are not as well educated and as intelligent as those of other parts of the Eastern States , for the children here have equal advantages in the way of common schools , and they appear to make use of them ; but to the scattered inhabitants along that bleak and rough part of the coast of which I have just now been writing any kind of school education must be attained under great difficulties . It is a long road from the cottage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the strangers from more southern climes seek the island in search of rest and cool bracing winds , the aspect of nature is rough and sterile . Excepting the dark and sombre tones of the evergreen , the landscape is clad in a mantle of russet , and gray ; that luxuriance of foliage which fills the eye with varied tints of green in the more temperate climates of other parts of our country seems impossible here . The air is loaded with the salts of the sea . The island is mostly composed of rocks , and the scanty proportion of earth yields a meagre supply of yellow stunted grass , while the farmer toils in vain to produce thoseharvests of corn orother cereals which fill the granaries in more favored lands .

Whether you ride or walk , after you have passed over half the way you will gaze upon the most beautiful views you have ever seen , although you may have crossed the Rocky Mountains or journeyed over half of the Old World . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit of Green Mountain may be attributed to the fact that it embraces both the sea and the land . You stand and gaze to the south , and see at your feet little villages hugging close to the golden belt of shore which divides the iron-gray cLIFFs AT SCHOONER HEAD . // land from the azure of the sea ; and then , still looking seaward , you raise your eyes slowly in the effort to find some sort of lines which will mark the perspective , and , save little dark specks , which are mighty vessels going to and fro , you perceive a wide , measureless expanse of blue , melting off into delicate gray , and then , looking higher and higher , until you meet the blue once more away up in the zenith . Again , not comprehending how the horizon of the ocean should be as high as the place where you stand , you strive to trace a path up that wall of blue , but just as it reaches the level of the eye the atmosphere cheats you of the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky once more . This delusive effect of perspective is yet more astonishing as seen from a point on the road not quite up to the summit , where you look between two sharp peaks of neighboring mountains , and see what must be , you reason , clouds floating in the sky , but which , thirty miles away , are islands rising out of the sea . It is when you turn your face away from the ocean and look to the east that you once more feel secure that you are not deceived ; for although the mountain pitches suddenly into the deep blue of bay , sound , and inlet , yet beyond that are islands and capes and promontories , and to the north , far across in the silvery hazy distance , the broad sweeping uplands of the main-land , and , fading into the sky , the gray forms of other mountains . There are strong foregrounds to the pictures , which vary , and as you move in the centre of this magic circle , the hard gray rocks lie all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet , and of green where the foliage of fern and brake grows from the crevices of the rock . A flock of white sheep are quietly nibbling the scanty growth of grass and weeds , or , clambering the sharp rocks , they look in vain for fresh fields and pastures new . A most comfortable and home - like look do these sheep give to the scene . Rising harmoniously here and there are groups or single trees of fir or cedar , whose sombre colors come up , dark and clear cut , against the filmy gray of the distant hills and the sky . Just below us is Eagle Lake , looking like a mirror , so brightly does it reflect the sun-lit sky . It is a mirror framed in with ebony , inlaid in walnut , so dark are the forests of pine and cedar which surround it . Across the lake there are the brown hills patched with yellow fields and the primeval forests , and then there is a sudden leap across a broad bay of tranquil water , and beyond that a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze . For two-thirds the circumference of the horizon the land and the water have divided empire ; nearer at hand the land seems more beautiful , for each island and cape li4ts local color , and glimmers like emeralds rimmed with bands of gold ; but far away the water reflects the dazzling glory vizw OF EAGLE LAKE AND TIlE SEA FROM GREEN MOUNTAIN . // of the sunlight , and the beholder may not give the palm of victory to land or water , but gaze upon it all with awe and wonder and unspeakable delight . Dog Mountain has already been spoken of as forming one of the boundaries to Eagle Lake . The mountain itself has not been an object of general visiting interest , but the photographic artists go every where , and they have found at this point some interesting bits of scenery . These indefatigable gentlemen often are the pioneers to the most beautiful views and objects , and especially at Mount Desert have they shown the true artistic eye in the selection of desirable subjects . Flying Mountain is not so well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be seen interesting views , especially of the ocean . But of these , and " Hadlock 's Pond , " and " Carroll 's Mountain , " and " Echo Lake , ** and " Northeast Harbor , " and many another lovely locality to be seen , one must pass summer after summer at the different places on the island in order to do them justice . I have described only one way of approach to Mount Desert-that of the sea . There are many persons who are made unhappy , not to say ill , even , by going on board of a steamboat , and who can not endure so much of motion , which at times is serious in the passage from Portland to Rockland . To these there is the pleasant resource of a stage ride from Bangor all the way by land to any part of Mount Desert ; for although this is an island , there is one point where the mainland is reached by means of a bridge . This gives you a drive of some fifty miles over superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses as I have never elsewhere seen coupled to a stagecoach . It is possible that the opening of the new railroad to the British Provinces may have shortened this distance . There are those who do not consider this distance a great journey . During two summers I passed at Bar Harbor there was a gentleman who every week drove down from Bangor to . Bar Harbor . He would start about nine in the morning of Saturday , and arrive just before sunset , his good roan mare looking as fresh , the hostler said , " as a daisy . " Perhaps this is as proper a place as any uther to halt for a while in my description of the natural beauties of Mount Desert , and relate some really interesting facts regarding the past history of the island . When the traveler visits the southern portions of the United States-at St. Augustine , in Florida , at Savannah , in Georgia , and even at Port Royal , South Carolina-he will find ruins and monuments , and even the descendants , of the French and Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tell you of the descent of Admiral Drake upon the town of St. Augustine , the contests of the Spanish settlers with the Indians , the fights between the French emigrants and the Spanish soldiers , but the antiquarian will show you splendid fortifications and beautiful architecture which had been the handiwork of these people , who had lived and prospered and died so long before , and whose civilization was so different in all ways from ours . The visitor at Mount Desert , if he were to study and search ever so critically , would scarcely suppose that while in 1609 the Franciscan monk was converting to Christianity the savages of Florida , his Jesuit brothers of France , Biard and Masse , had established a colonyin the vicinity of what is now known as Somesvllle , at Mount Desert . This is not , however , the first appearance of the French on the island . It is told that when Dc Monts , a French adventurer , who obtained from Henry IV . a charter for one-half of the Atlantic coast south from Cape Breton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sailed westward , and in order to gratify the curiosity of one Nicholas d'Aubri , he put that gentleman , who was an ecclesiastic of some sort , ashore at Mount Desert , where he remained for a while . Meanwhile the grant of De Monts had been surrendered to Madame De Guercheville , and confirmed to her by the king . This lady was a zealous Catholic , and with the assistance of De Suassaye , who was her agent , caused colonies of Jesuit missionaries to settle at this island in 1613 , whether at the western end , where Biard and Masse were already located , is in doubt ; but it is certain that , coming from Port Royal , they landed at Mount Desert , built a small fort , set up a cross , celebrated mass , and called the place " St. Saviour " and " Mount Mansel . " It is interesting to know , also , that Mount Mansel was the first land discovered by the Massachusetts emigrants in 1630 . Suassayc 's colony soon after this was driven away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they afterward returned , and in 1691 we hear of one " Cadillac , " who , excited by the descriptions of D'Anbriwho , it will be remembered , was put on shore at Mount Desert-established colonies of Jesuit missionaries all through this region . Much could be written of these early settlements at Mount Desert , but all that is known is derived from contemporary reports within the island itself nor can its present inhabitants add one leaf to its earliest history . It is said that there are on the west side of Somes Sound evidences of these early settlements ; but these indications must be very indistinct . The reader will remember that we came from Southwest to Bar Harbor by water , and that mention was made of a route by the land . Upon a recent occasion I resolved // to take this journey across the hills , and so started off one morning in obedience to a prearranged programme . We-there were ladies in the party-were to occupy the most of the day in going to the village of Somesyille , where we were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail or row boat down through Somes Sound to Southwest Harbor , there to meet the steamboat , and then proceed on to Portland . The first stage of the journey , a ride of less than twenty miles , was made with pleasure to all of us , for we saw the mountain , the lake , and woods , and fields under a sky filled with gray clouds , that most charming effect of equal light , when there is neither strong lights nor shadow , and when the chaste and delicate tints of russet and yellow and green find their true values . Arriving at Somesyille early in the afternoon , we rambled about this pretty village , watching the workmen in the ship-yards , wandering along the shore , lined with rocks , and belted with groups of birch and pine and fir trees , and we were never wearied of gazing down the sound , where sailing craft , large and small , were passing up and down , their white canvas in bright relief against the dark masses of the mountains beyond . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look than any thing we had seen for a long while . It is called " Somes House . " A Mr. Somes keeps it , and has kept it any time these fifty years past , as have his ancestors , who were the first settlers here . He is also town-clerk , I think postmaster , and I know not what besides . An excellent example of a down East landlord is Mr. Somes , even if there was a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in our bedroom . " What , in marcy 's name , do you want to go down the sound fur , when there 's a good road all the way ter the harbor ? " was the expostulation of the old gentleman , when we were trying to make the arrangement for the morning 's trip . " It is the scenery we wish to see . " " Yes , I know it 's what them artist men come here fur . But what it amounts ter , after all their squattin ' and fussin ' , I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , his wife , and child , we got into a boat which was adapted both for sails and oars . With the two boatmen there were seven of us altogether , which , for a not very large boat , was a good load , to say nothing of two or three trunks by way of luggage . For the first part of our way we passed close to the shore , where the evergreens overhung the ledges of rocks in pretty picturesque forms which were reflected in the water without a break , except where the bubbles slid past the bow of the boat , or the oars splashed under the vigorous stroke of our conductors . But when we got out into the open water little cat's-paws of wind came scampering along , ruffling the surface ; these ceased after a while , but I knew they were nEAD OF SOMES SOUND . // premonitory of a stronger breeze which was to come by-and-by . There was a solemn stillness which succeeded this little flurry as we entered a narrow pass cleft between the mountains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ; for to the east the mountain slopes gradually to the water , but on the western side the rocky cliff rises perpendicular a thousand feet . Gliding slowly along at its base , and gazing upward , there seemed no limit to its height . But little foliage is to be seen against this wall of iron-gray . At widespread intervals CLIFFS , nec MOUnTAIN , 5OMz5 SOUND . a withered trunk of cedar stood out to view , or a handful of green showed where some fugitive seed had found resting-place in a crevice of the rock . The painful silence of this place was only broken by the cry of the eagle soariug about its nest far above us , or the swift down-rushing and plunge of the osprey seeking its prey and daily food , and as we pulled out from under the shadow of the precipice our attention was riveted to several ospreys , who , screaming with rage , hovered near the top of a stunted pine . With their long , sharp talons outstretched , they would descend almost to the tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air , again to return with threatening gestures . Very soon we saw the cause of all this excitement , for , perched upon a strong branch , stood a splendid specimen of the bald eagle . Unmindful of the cries and threats of the ospreys , he was tearing to pieces with beak and claw a goodsized fish , which a few moments before lie had stolen from his assailants , who were now visiting upon him their furious but impotent rage . " This is a famous place , Sir , " said one of the boatmen , who until now had divided his energies between tugging at his oar and gnawing at a pigtail of very black tobacco , which he carried , with his red handkerchief , in the crown of his hat . " In the Revolutionary war the British fleet used to come in here and get water and things . You know , Sir , there 's no soundings ever been found alongside that mountain , and a man-o ' - war can lie right alongside that cliff and get water enough out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like . " " One would suppose this an exposed point in event of a war . " " Well , Sir , that 's jes what it is , Sir . In the war of twelve " ( 1812 ) " they came in here and sent boats ' crews up the sound ; but I tell you the d-d Britisher got more nor he come fur . They tuk away cold lead with em . Our people fought em hard . The reason they come in here , Sir , is cause we 're handy to the Bluenoses , and cause this is the best harbor on the coast . A thousand vessels can ride at anchor safe from any gale . " " This is a remarkable place , sure enough , " said the strange gentleman , in a quizzical tone . Old Pigtail was unconscious of the sneer .
