ARTICLE VII. - WHAT IS THE TRITE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST 'S SECOND COMING ? No correct opinion is the sole product of an individual intellect . The parentage , temperament , surroundings , all the elements which go to make np the history of the man as well as to a certain extent the history of the entire race , are involved in each opinion . Pre*minently weighty are the historic elements in the formation of a right opinion upon the question now under discussion . Almost all its trustworthy data are historic ; only by the progress of history will its details be in the future successively cleared up . The true doctrine of Messiah 's first advent was never understood until history brought Messiah before men . The prophecies of the Old Testament did not avail to teach them the complete knowledge of that coming . Indeed they scarcely served to put most men into the right point of view . Even the prophets themselves did not in any case thoroughly comprehend , and in many instances doubtless misunderstood , the future events of which they prophesied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still more of historic teaching with regard to it was needed in order to clear away the remnants of erroneous opinion . The apostles required and received this teaching through history . We , after eighteen centuries of historic training , do not fully understand the doctrine of the first advent . History still unfolds its doctrine . Thus does the case stand with the doctrine of the second advent . It will be progressively better comprehended as the various second comings are brought forward in history . Only when the last of those events , the final coming , has been reached , will a completed true doctrine be made possible . The truth just stated justifies , as a fitting introduction to this discussion , these two remarks which follow , and which set forth the only trustworthy method of procedure . Let then , first of all , the truth be acknowledged and adhered // to unswervingly , that no one need hope even to approach this question from the right point of view whose method is not histork* and critical* The only right method of procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact , which this method meets at many hands are indeed numerous . One entire class of writers , the so-called premillennialists , show almost an utter lack of the historic sense . Anything in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is without discrimination welcomed , if only it can be made to fit their theory . The historic conditions under which the different authors of the Bible wrote , and under which its different books are to be valued and interpreted , are by them quite neglected . With restless eagerness they roam over the whole divine pasture-field , and seem not to care what they crop or how they select among the herbage . Much confusing of historic conditions was pardonable in the early Church-may even have been , in some respects , beneficial to them . To return , however , to the unhistoric way of dealing with Scripture and with opinion is not progress , but retro-gradation . Nor can the question be satisfactorily discussed without the free though reverent use of criticism . Lack of acquaintance with the principles of hermeneutics is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means in this regard essentially different from historic or didactic writing . That boldness which leads a man to feel most confidence in his interpretation of language , such as ordinary critical readers find most obscure , may help towards the formation of an hypothesis of a prophetic passage . But for its final interpretation we need another quality of mind . We need the quality which holds the student to the cautious , the conscientious use of grammars and lexicons . There is a sort of confidence in the interpreter which begets distrust in the reader of his interpretation . The author of a little book entitled , " Subjects for the Household of Faith , " sees in Christ 's parable of the mustard-seed the teaching that nominal Christianity will become a " monstrous worldly system " - " a cage of every unclean and hateful bird . " The vulture , the night-owl , and the bat , are sitting in the branches of the tree of the kingdom of heaven . To accor&amp; // with this interpretation , we are then told that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comparison rests in the growing power of evil , which will finally take an entire control of Christendom . With a mind which works in such a fashion , we can simply refuse to hold intellectual commerce . In this refusal we are justified , because the man has renounced , not the formal canons of criticism merely , but the conscientious use of the critical faculty . Second-Our method should be that of procedure from what is clearer to what is more obscure . The two main parties in the discussion of this question of Christ 's second coming take their departure from different points of view . With one class of disputants it is assumed that we have , in the prophetic utterances of inspired men , clear and somewhat detailed information as to the still future development of Christianity . The other class appeal rather to those principles which underlie all its past and present development The one are prone to look upon the strata of the kingdom of heaven from the catastrophist 's point of view : the theory of the other class is uniformitarian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with doubtful interpretation of obscure prophecy , they lay history , reason , and the Gospel under bans not to overthrow their ground of standing . The error of the latter class is apt to consist in a failure clearly to define the estimate which they put upon scriptural prophecy , and the principles which they adopt in its interpretation . Surely there should be found some way of fusing into one these two points of view . At any rate , we must abide by that which is plain , even at the risk of seeming to discredit that which is more obscure . If prediction and the divine order , as revealed in history and in the Gospel , are placed in conflict with each other , we can not doubt which of the two will have to yield . Our hope as Christians is not founded upon prophecy , but upon facts . We can not then by jprophecy nourish any hope which is contradicted by the fundamental facts . Prophecy , rightly understood , we do well to take heed unto . But we take heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day dawn and the day star arise in our hearts . " This truth is verbally recognized even by those who in fact disregard it . // Christ 's 8&gt;'econd Cominq ? 359 We wonder , then , when we read the opinions of men who make the seventh chapter of Daniel their centre of mental solicitude over this question of Christ 's second coming . We are snrprised to find how much they know of Gog and Magog , of the beasts and the stone of the Old Testament prophet , of the beasts , horns , and trumpets of the iRevelator . We are also surprised to observe how little these same men seem to know of God 's broad , gentle , but forceful love , as it flows through all discovered and all hidden channels for the saving of the race . We shall begin and continue the discussion of this question with the determination to make prominent that which is plain in its meaning , rather than that which is obscure . This determination releases us from the necessity of following out in their details many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagancies of less judicious writers , such as the statement of Josiah Litch in his " Prophetic Expositions , " that the king of the perfected kingdom is " possessed of flesh and bones , but not of blood , because that he shed for the race of Adam ; " or the more plausible but erroneous assumption , in which all the millennarian writers seem to concur , that the fourth beast of Daniel 's vision stands for the present governments of Christendom , looked upon as remnants of the Roman rule . This prophecy of Daniel is usually made the key-stone of the premillennialist 's arch . It is placed in its position by misinterpretation . But we claim that , without the necessity of proving this , the true method of procedure requires that we should begin from an entirely different point of view . Principles clearly proven , facts undoubted , must take precedence of doubtful interpretations of prophecy . This preference for what is plain rather than obscure will also limit our discussion in another direction . We shall try to stop where white light fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way clearly beyond the point where we are compelled to stop , their liberty is not restricted . We prefer to go safely rather than far . Let the reader then constantly bear in mind that the present essay makes no pretence to an exhaustive treatment of its subject . Its fundamental thought is , that the treatment of such a theme as this must always be , at least in its details , relative to the progress which the Church has // 360 April , already made . History is now interpreting the predictions of Christ 's future advents . The essay is rather a contribution towards the formation , upon historic and critical grounds , of a doctrine of the second advent , which is acknowledged to be incomplete , but which is true as far as it goes . Having defined our method of procedure , we are now ready to examine evidence . In this work of examination the pressure of dogmatic considerations is usually very strong . We also have our dogmatic point of view . This is given us by a thorough confidence-not growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though strengthened by such inquiry-in the I. Infallibility and sinless purity of Jesus . This confidence gives us the only indispensable doctrinal preparation . We need thus much conceded at the very least . We do not necessarily require that concession should go further than this . There is , however , one class of passages from the Gospels which seem , as they are usually interpreted , to shake even this assumed basis of discussion . When prophesying of certain future comings , Christ uses language which is ordinarily referred to the description of his final advent . In connection with this prophecy , and in so close connection that a fair separation of the two seems impossible , occurs the statement that men then living should see the fulfillment of the prophecy . These passages even Meyer does not hesitate to interpret according to their face . Jesus himself expected his own second advent within the generation of men then living . That is , as Meyer holds , Jesus shared in the mistake upon this point of his disciples , and confirmed them by his teaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate to pronounce . It is , as Alford has said , contradictory of Meyer 's own doctrinal estimate of the person of Christ . Better modify our views of the nature of prophetic language and of the amount of security from mistake , which is guaranteed by inspiration to apostles and evangelists , than accept such a conclusion . The opinion that the teachers and writers of early Christianity misunderstood , with respect to the one point of time , Christ 's doctrine of his second coming , does not concede // anything which is necessary to Christianity . But to admit with Meyer a mistake upon the part of Christ himself does , we are sure , amount to an entire abandonment of its central doctrine . Considerations which will further on occupy us more in detail are required for the right understanding of these prophetic words of Christ . Let it suffice in this place to quote the words of Neander ( L*f* of Ohrist , 254 ) : " In Christ we can recognize no blending of error with truth , no alloy of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is easy to explain how points of time which he kept apart , although he presented them as counterparts of each other without assigning any express duration to either , were blended together in the apprehension of his hearers , or in their subsequent repetition of his language . " This view is certainly preferable , even upon dogmatic grounds alone , to that of many writers , who , through their anxiety to save intact the doctrine of an infallible inspiration for the apostles and evangelists , seem ready to lower their doctrine of the person of Christ . Less outspoken than Meyer but scarcely less damaging in its concessions *s the view of others , and among them Van Osterzee . " It can not be denied , " says Van Osterzee in his Theology of the New Testament ( sec. xvi , 10 ) , that the Lord throughout his teaching , as well as in his ast esehatological discourses , represents his coming as very near at hand . " " There are not wanting , however , clear indications that for Jesus himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were by no means identical . " Jesus , we must then assume , taught that his second coming would be speedy , by a sort of accommodation , intending thus to secure the right moral results from the wrong impressions of his hearers . But to such a view the answer is near at hand . If these utterances of Jesus refer to his final coming and have been correctly reported . it is an understatement of the difficulty to say that he taught by accommodation , as though this final coming would be speedy . These things granted-He taught , we must rather hold , by explicit statement that his final coming would be within his own generation . To foster a wrong impression by accommodation would be doubtful morality , doubtful expediency as well . To teach // explicitly what turned out untrue can scarcely be called accommodation . Surely it is not justifiable accommodation . But our proof that Jesus did not teach the doctrine of his speedy final coining is not derived from the doctrine of his person alone . A fuller examination of his teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not share the erroneous expectation of his disciples . For , as Prof. Jowett has said , " the words of our Lord are not more in apparent contradiction with the course of experience than they are with other words which are equally attributed to him by the evangelists . " Upon examining those words we find that Jesus did not regard that form of the kingdom of heaven which he was instituting as soon to undergo a final catastrophe . He saw and testified to its slow course of development . At times he glanced down this entire course with such confidence in its result that he could declare : " N*w is the judgment of this world . " The world is already defacto judged . He saw Satan descending from the zenith of his power as the lightning flashes across the eastern sky . At the same time he did not forget that the growth of this kingdom would be first blade , then ear , then full corn in the ear . His connected narratives , which tell us unto what things the kingdom of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for this slow unfolding . The Church is left to do the work . The seed automat ? caily springs up and brings forth fruit , as in obedience to his command the sowers of his Word go forth . The laborers in the vineyard increase hour by hour until the end of the age , and after " much " time the Lord of the servants comes to reckon with them . The whole tenor of Christ 's teaching leads to the same conclusion which is necessitated by our view of his person , that he was freed from the narrow estimate of the world 's destiny which was held by the men about him , and that he was accustomed to have " facts , which it requires the course of ages to make clear , lie open in his eye . " We may , on the other hand , safely take his own statement , whether we interpret the words of his coming to destroy Jerusalem , or of his final coming , that he was ignorant of the hour when the event would take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , such as would have // been given had it been his design to leave for our information a connected scheme of the world 's future history . Ignorance may have led to erroneous expectation in others . Not so in the case of Christ . We conclude , then , that our doctrinal estimate of Christ 's person , as well as his own plainer teachings , compel us to interpret his more obscure teachings in prophecy so as to save his infallibility and truthfulness . And we can not afford , upon dogmatic grounds which touch the doctrine of inspiration , to deny or jeopard truths which are more important and more sacred than any dogma as to the formal working of inspiration can possibly be . This point established , we have next to admit , in order to a successfnl treatment of our question , that , IL The early Church at large , and with them also the apostles and evangelists , expected the speedy final coming of Christ . We are unable to see how any consistent interpretation of the New Testament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is possible without this admission . If it appear to some to be dangerous , we can only reply , the truth is not dangerous , nor does experience confirm the fears which are felt that evil results will follow this admission . It is not the work of the critical investigator into the teachings of the New Testament , nor of the devout learner from inspired men , to tremble about results-from truth . If the admission seem to others damaging to the Christian standing of him who makes it , we can reply , numbers of true and devont men have held and do now hold this same opinion . The evangelical German commentators in general do not hesitate over this admission . Their outspoken way is creditable to their scholarship and to their confidence in Christianity . IDr . Arnold says , " Paul expected that the world would come to an end in the generation then existing . " ( Sermons on the Ghristian Lift , p. 400 . ) " The apostles themselves , " says Conybeare , " expected their Lord to come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared in the expectation . " ( L*4 of Paul , p. 401 . ) Even Mr. Barnes , commenting upon 1 Cor. xv , 51 , says , " I do not know that the proper doctrine of inspiration suffers , if we // admit that the apostles were ignorant of the exact time when the world would close , or even that in regard to the precise period when that would take place , they might be in error . " Surely the admission that they did expect Christ 's speedy second coming , and were therefore upon this point in error , is of itself less objectionable than the theory of Dr. Watts , that the apostles , though not themselves mistaken , permitted the Church to remain in this error from design , that they might find encouragement and support in their trials . Of the opinion which Olshausen maintains , viz : that Christ himself framed his representations so as to keep before the mind the constant possibility of his final coming , we have already spoken . We are loth also to admit that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could teach the early Church by accommodation things which they knew were not strictly true , why may we not suppose them to be now teaching us the same things in the same way ? The apostles certainly did not contradict the general and intense expectation of the early Church . 2 Thes. ii , 1-12 , is sometimes cited to show that Paul did attempt to correct the false expectation . But the passage proves rather , when rightly understood , the reverse of what is sometimes claimed for it . Now the fact that the apostles made no effort to correct the error of the early Church is prima fade proof that they shared the expectation of the early Church . And further , that they did believe upon this point with the churches under their care , there is , it would seem , abundant additional evidence . Certainly Paul , as Van Osterzee phrases the statement , cherished the living hope of the speedy advent of the Lord . This hope is more prominently brought to view in his earlier epistles : it became chastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the intensity and pervasive power of the expectation it is hard to give a correct impression by special citations . You find it warp and woof in many of his letters , especially in those to the Thessalonian Church . Christians are spoken of in 2 Tim . iv , 8 , as " those that have loved his appearing . " God 's discipline , Titus is told ( ii , 13 ) , has for its final purpose that we shall live " expecting the appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ . " // it is a Christian charism which Paul desires for the Corinthian Church , that they shall remain " expecting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ . " The Thessalonians are his hope , joy , crown of boasting , " before our Lord Jesus iu his appearing . " These more general expressions have their meaning definitely fixed by the passages iu which Paul most expressly asserts his expectation . Such assertions are found especially , 1 Cor. xv , 51 , and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , hut we shall all be changed , " he asserts in the passage first cited . Who are the sleepers , and who are to be changed , not having slept , he then plainly gives us to understand . Among the second class he distinctly places himself ; when in the next verse he says , " the dead shall be raised , " but " we , " making an emphatic contrast by use of the word * , ud*- " we shall be changed . " To suppose that " we " who shall be changed are men of at least two thousand years later , among whom the apostle could not be one , takes all pith out of the sentence . Of that change which he so much desired and so confidently expected , he speaks more at length , 2 Cor. v , I if . In 1 Thes. iv , 15 , he assures the troubled Church that " we "  --  and defining the pronoun further , viz : " those who are living  --  and defining still further , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " shall not get the start of them that have fallen asleep . " The Greek language could scarcely be used with more definiteness to form the class , and mark out the class characteristics of those who should be alive at Christ 's second advent , of whom the apostle expressly asserts his expectation that he himself should be one . The method of interpreting these passages , to which they are forced who are unwilling to admit an erroneous expectation in the writings of inspired men , is very unfortunate . It is characteristic also of an entire class of commentators . The question asked should be , What does a fair interpretation of all the passages show to have been the flici ? The que4ion really asked is often this one : Can we possibly interpret each one of these passages so that it shall not necessarily contradict our opinion of what the fact safrlq could lie ? In the present case all the passages , at least with only one apparent exception , look one way . Why not admit that the truth lies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view upon crit ' *al grounds is by a wrong interpretation of 2 Thes. ii , 1 f. // Paul , it is argued , could not have expected the second coming of Christ during his own life , because he warns the Thessalonians not to be soon shaken in * as that the day of Christ is at hand . " But the verb sVz'Jr*uz occurs six times besides in the New Testament , and always with the meaning , " to be present . " " Proxime irtstans " is a Latin equivalent . With the grammarians o ivso*rc* ( *p6vo* ) was the present tense . In two of the six other places of its occurrence the word is expressly contrasted with ra* pdVXovra  --  the things which are yet in the future . In the supposition that the day of the Lord was already upon them , these Thessalonian Christians had fallen also into practical errors . Paul corrects their irregularities by assuring them that the day which they and he both expected was not just upon them . A further development of the power of evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one man , Anti . christ , should precede the coming of the day . He , however , expected to see all this accomplished . In this very epistle he prays , " the Lord direct your hearts into the patient waiting for Christ . " In this expectation of Paul shared Peter , James , and John , as the writings of them all abundantly testify . " The end of all things draweth nigh " ( 1 Pet . iv , 7 ) ; " patiently and bravely persevere until the coming of the Lord " ( Jas. v , 7 ) ; " little children , it is the last hour " ( 1 John ii , 18 ) ; such are the declarations , such the exhortations of the early teachers of Christianity . There is scarcely another fact of early Christian life better established than that of this attitude of constant expectation , in which the early Church and the early teachers of the Church stood towards the coming of Christ . The fact is usually brought into prominence by premillennanan writers . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its legitimate inference by the remark-Paul is still waiting ; he has only changed his place of waiting . This is no better than quibbling . By all these writers it is maintained that our attitude should be like that of the early Church . But to admit that men eighteen centuries since were in the constant and intense expectation of seeing , during their lives , the Lord come in bodily presence , and then also to admit , as we are forced to do , that the expectation was disappointed , makes the continuance of a similar attitude on our part psychologically impossible . // Many opponents of the premillennialists lose , however , the very gist of their objection to premillennialism by refusing to confess both the error of early times and the coloring given by that error to the teaching of those times . A few words as to the dogmatic consequences which are often attributed to the view here maintained . As has been already said , many in fact hold this view who study and love the New Testament as devoutly as those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to let the facts be overborne in their testimony by preconceived notions of what the formal results of inspiration must be . It is our work to learn what inspiration has accomplished . We need not fear to do this work . The only safe theory as to the products of inspiration is that given by the inductive method applied to those products themselves . But , second , it is frankly admitted by all that these same apostles , at least in their early discipleship , held mistaken notions as to the nature of Christ 's second coming . The socalled eschatological discourse of our Lord was called out , according to Matthew , by the double question from his disciples- " When shall these things be , and what the sign of thy coming and of the cud of the age . " These two events , the destruction of Jerusalem and the final advent of Messiah , were , as Ellicott has remarked ( L* of Ghrist , p. 289 , note ) , by the disciples " instinctively connected . " This opinion was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belonged as to Messiah 's advent . Their mistake upon the point of time is obvious . With the near catastrophe which Christ expressly limited to that generation , they were expecting the formal establishment of Messiah 's triumphant rule . Their mistake as to the mode of his coming is equally obvious . For what view must these questioners of our Lord have held as to the nature of that coming , for the sign of which they inquired so eagerly ? He was with them . They did not at any time previous to his death believe that Christ would go away before he came to them ; for we know by their subsequent conduct that his death was unexpected by them . Plainly , they were then looking for the setting up of Messiah 's kingdom , according to their views of it , in the life-time of Christ , and in connection with calamities to // Jerusalem . The half of truth was enough for them . The half of their opinion was untrue . The descent of the Spirit led them , according to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the needs of the Church . And , third , the error of the New Testament prophets with regard to the time and mode of complete fulfillment for their own prophecies is like that of the Old Testament prophets . Both spoke things which they did not themselves fully understand , larger than themselves knew . Both lived with their eye upon the future , but as well upon their own times . They caught and applied to all ages the principles which they saw exemplified in occurrences at their side . To the vision of Isaiah , the deliverance under Messiah and the return from the Assyrian captivity are one event . In like manner ilosca , Amos , and Micah connect with the Messianic advent the deliverance of the Jews from Babylon . Thus in the minds of New Testament prophets things remote were brought near , and seen under forms furnished by those nearer times . They too , when they prophesied , saw future events projected in space rather than trustworthily arranged as to the time of their occurrence . There is an obvious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneous expectation , found within and coloring the teaching of inspired men , and an explicit error in their teaching . But whether the distinction can be maintained or not , the presence of such expectation both as to the predse time and mode in which their prophecies should be fulfilled , is to be detected in many prophetic passages of both Old and New Testaments . But , fourth ,  --  every one who deals critically with the New Testament is forced into admissions which virtually contain as much as is asked for here . What is meant when an exegete like Ellicott compares , upon the questions contained in this very discourse , " the narrative of the second and third Evangelists with the more grouped records of St. Matthew ? " There are few who will venture to hold that , according to the view of the apostles , the second coming of Christ was not even liable to occur in their day . But an erroneous expectation would have been involved in the opinion that Christ might come as well as in the more decided conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that according to the plan of God the final advent of Christ might not have come so soon after his first advent . This fact , that the early Church , including the apostles and evangelists , expected the speedy final coming of Christ , has been treated at some length because it is of great importance for the formation of a correct , and especially of acor*sistentopinion upon the whole question of the second advent . By it we are led to compare the doctrine of Christ 's first advent as given in the Old Testament with the doctrine of his second advent as taught by the New Testament writers . The teaching of both classes of writers required to he progressively cleared up by the history of the Church . In both instances the truths taught were too large for the full comprehension of the men who taught them . They are mixed with mistake at least as to the time and in some respects as to the nature of their fulfillment . When the Church stands with reference to the second coming where we now stand with reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible , but not till then . If , basing our convictions upon a wrong view of the prophetic utterances of even inspired men , we run in opinion counter to or beyond that which Christ has plainly taught , we shall scarcely be able , like those apostolic men , to avoid dangerous practical errors growing out of a wrong expectation . We are now prepared to inquire , HI . What is the sum-total of Christ 's teaching with regard to his second comino ? We reply : Only so much as is contained in certain great principles ; only so much as countenances the most sober , rational , and cautious views of the future of the Church . 1 . The conception which lies back of Christ 's teaching regarding the fate in the future of his kingdom is that of development . It is certainly not the conception of a godless and aimless development . It is that of an expanding of forces and powers already planted by God within the world as seeds , and destined by growth under the constant rule and presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , ultimately to result in the conversion and sanctifying of the world . This development does not exclude marked epochs , even startling // catastrophes . The law of all growth is two-fold . Growth is for the most part uniform ; but all growth has also its epochs . Thus it is and shall be with the kingdom of heaven . The proof that Christ taught the general spreading of his kingdom through the preaching of the Gospel has been in part given . The parables of Christ , in which his coming to the work of separation and judgment is made prominent , are by no means averse to this truth . In them , as for instance those of the ten virgins , the talents , the workers in the vineyard , the tares and wheat , the kingdom of heaven is given in a picture which represents simultaneously its characteristics for all time and under all circumstances . To draw from them the relative steps of advance , with the distinctions in time and in details of method which a completed esehatological doctrine requires , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in relief the views of a general and finally universal spread , under the power q/ the Gospel , of Christ 's kingdom : the parables of the leaven and the mustard-seed teach precisely this truth . It is also implied beyond doubt in Christ 's command to his followers , " to make disciples of all the Gentiles , " and in the accompanying promise , " Lo I am with you aiway , even unto the end of the age . " The Gospel of the kingdom he distinctly asserts shall be preached in all the orbis terrarum for a witness to all the nations , and not till then shall the end be . To assert that the prediction has been fulfilled , or that it is so small as not to lack thus far much of fulfillment , is to belittle the words themselves . 2 . But more specifically of his teaching regarding his second advent , it is of first importance to observe that he himself attaches a varied and shifting meaning to the phrases which he employs . The one lesson which accompanies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day will come unexpected , a day of separation and purifying ; therefore , watch . In one place he speaks of himself as coming to answer prayer and bring desired deliverance , and adds the question , " When the Son of Man cometh , shall he find faith in the earth ? " He teaches the doctrine of repeated and continuous comings , when he declares to Caiaphus , " From now on ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming upon the clouds of heaven . " Notice carefully the language with which // this progressive advent is described . It is a picture of the Son of Man borne upon the clouds of heaven . He has ever since the prediction been thus majestically coming to his Church and to the world . A similar though modified meaning seems best to suit the words of Jesus spoken to his disciples , John xiv , 3 . This too is a progressive advent ; consisting not so much , however , in majestic approaches of Christ to the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual gifts , and especially perhaps in the favor of a removal by death from earthly trials , to be with himself and with the Father . Preiiiminently in the Gospel of John does Christ teach the doctrine of a spiritual second coming . " I will not leave you orphans , T come to you . " And when he comes the Father also comes , according to his own statement : " We will come unto him and make our abode with him . " Nor was this coming to be long delayed : " Yet a little while and the world no longer seeth me , but ye see me . " With Christ 's perpetual coming is connected a perpetual judgment . " Then , " says the Psalmist , ( xcvi , 12 ) " shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord , for he cometh , he cometh to judge the earth . " In similar conception is brought to us the glad news of a perpetual judgment of our Lord . " Forjudgment I came into the world : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He that believeth not hath been already judged ; " these are declarations of Jesus . A perpetual resurrection is also connected with this perpetual coming : " The hour cometh and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God . " These words last quoted certainly do not warrant us in denying the doctrines of a general simultaneous judgment or of a similar resurrection , but leave their claims to be decided upon other grounds . Nor do the previously quoted words of Christ to Caiaphus and to his disciples warrant us in denying that the several comings of the Son of Man will culminate in one final coming , most majestic and most noteworthy among them all . But passages like these selected from the sayings of Jesus do warrant us in agreeing with the declaration of Schmidt , when he writes , Christ 's coming is " near at hand and far away ; it is definite and indefinite at the same time . " Christ then speaks of himself as ever with his people , and // yet in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come and come again . He will keep coming . 3 . Christ gave his disciples more special information respecting his coming in the first great epoch of his kingdom . That e1 ) och , which was the break of his kingdom with the Jewish nation , was for them the all-important coming . To it many passages often interpreted of his final coming primarily refer . We say primarily , for they have by parity of principle an indefinite application until the end of time . This epoch is , as the comings of Christ in history always are , a time of liberation and a time also of judgment . To this great epoch-making advent of Jesus reference is made in the following passages . " Whenever they persecute you in this city flee into the other , for verily I say unto you , ye shall not have finished the cities of Israel until the Son of Man shall have come . " ( Matt. x , 23 . ) After making the prediction , " the Son of Man is going to come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall he reward each according to his doing , " he adds , " Verily I say unto you , there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . " ( Matt. xvi , 27 f . ) It is of interest and importance to notice that Christ describes this advent with all possible majesty of draping ; though by limiting it to that generation for fulfillment he compels us to interpret it of his break with the Jewish nation . To this event many other passages ( Luke ix , 26 f. ; xxi , 8-32 : vid. also John iv , 21 ) refer . And to it the attention is primarily directed throughout the entire esehatological discourse of Matthew in the twenty-fourth and following chapters . No satisfactory division of these chapters can possibly be made . We know that certain portions of them refer primarily to the destruction of Jerusalem . The only consistent and safe interpretation is to refer them primarily as a whole to this and the accompanying events . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Matthew 's twenty-fourth chapter refers " mainly but not exclusively to the destruction of Jerusalem , " and that what follows refers " mainly but not exclusively to our Lord 's second advent and the final judgment , " and then to stretch the meaning of the Greek word s'v$iw* so as to make it cover centuries of time , seem to us like the abandonment of all attempt // at a critical interpretation . Nor is the point where the discourse is supposed to change at all agreed upon . Robinson would place it as the forty-second verse . Ellicott and others at the twenty-ninth . Let it not be objected that some of the language here used by Christ is too significant and awful to describe his coming in judgment to the Jewish nation . To this objection the reply is ready . Language as significant and awful as any in the entire passage is to be found in those portions of it which confessedly refer to the destruction of Jerusalem . What event , even the total destruction of the world , could be more awful than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish nation ? We are also to remember that it is the custom of the Bible to use language of this sublimity in connection with even local and temporary calamities . Christ , as we have seen , represents all his comings in history as advents " upon the clouds of the heavens . " The angels accompany him in his continuous dealings with the earth . The sun was turned into darkness and the moon into blood when the Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost . In this same discourse , Christ describes a certain catastrophe in these words : " The stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens be shaken " * * * " all the tribes of the earth shall mourn and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory . " This catastrophe is the destruction of the Jewish nation , as is shown by the following statement that the fulfillment of the prophecy should fall within that generation . All attempts to alter the meaning of the word " generation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that Christ makes similar predictions with the use of similar language in other passages . In the epoch of the Church to which this entire discourse has primary reference lies the type of all the epochs . This fact gives us our warrant for applying the truths of the first epoch to times still future . That which those who bring us the report of Christ 's saying supposed would occur once for all within their own life-time , occurs substantially the same again and again in the history of the Church . " All critical and creative epochs , " says Neander , " correspond to each other and collect // ively prefigure the last judgment and last creation  --  the consummation of the kingdom of God . " We glean then these truths from Christ 's teaching upon the question of his own second advent . The gospel , carried by his disciples into the whole world , is to convert the world . By a varied use of language , for which we have the warrant of Christ himself , we may speak of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the race . These comings are all majestic , consolatory to his Church , condemnatory of the unbelieving world . One of these great historic advents he describes more particularly to his disciples as being that one in which they and the fate of the early Church were most concerned . Its two characteristics are liberation and judgment . It is the type of all Christ 's comings in history . Its general features will hold true to the end of time . Jesus as the agitator of human society and of the Christian Church will not suffer his winnowing-fan to pause in its ceaseless swing , until he has thoroughly purged his floor . He is judge and king , not to be merely , but now in fact operating in the world . 4 . The principles which Jesus lays down in all his teaching upon the doctrine of his second coming , as well as more especially that closer view of God 's method which we obtain from looking upon the first epoch-making advent as the type of all other advents , warrant us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those conceptions accord with the profoundest , truest views of the nature of sin and of righteousness* with the correct philosophy of human progress , and with the fundamentals in the teaching of the apostle Paul . The day of upturnings , of catastrophes has not ended . The general impression pervades many , at least of the more progressive minds , that there will be no more historic commotion over religious concerns . The sword which Christ came to send upon the earth seems ready to be sheathed . If once sheathed , the assumption is made , it will never again be taken from its scabbard . Would that this pleasant view of the future might be made plausible by the unconditional surrender of those forces which are opposed to Christ 's kingdom . As the matter now stands , we can see how the intensifying and culmination of evil forces may coexist with the growth , both extensive and // intensive , of the forces which make for righteousness and for the success of Christ 's kingdom . We may then still have to feel such blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole earth shake  --  and that not once only , but again and again until the final coming . Of that final coming we know essentially the same truths that are revealed to us concerning all of Christ 's advents . It will be a time of both liberation and judgment ; it will be majestic , consoling the righteous , condemning the unjust . 5 . Further , as to the details of the future of his kingdom Christ gives us no information . Nor , so far as we can conj ccture , is it best that he should . his bidding is , ceaselessly " watch . " Not that we are to turn oar bodily eyes upward expecting to see his bodily presence at any hour . The truth is grander than that . The words of Paul when he declares , " the trumpet shall sound , " are scarcely satisfied when we interpret them a trumpet of brass or silver will be blown by a visible angel in the air above our heads . Some will perhaps think it strange to find in this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last come bodily and reign in person upon the earth ? It is certainly not the design of the essay to answer this twofold question with a decided negative . There are many considerations , however , which are opposed to the affirmative answer . We , at least , seem warranted in saying it were better for us that such a coming should not occur . If Christ 's final advent be in the body to reign here upon the earth , he will come of course under all the conditions which necessarily belong to a bodily man*festation . The questions , just where will he come ? - how many ( how few ) can see him come ? - what benefit will it be to us here to know that he is in Palestine , where we could not possibly all of us in bodies surround him ? - what chaos , rather than order , will not be introduced into the Christian life under such circumstances ?  - -  - are all questions relevant to the view ? They who maintain it are rather than their questioners responsible for the putting of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what would be best the sole measure of what will be fact . Only we can find no teaching of Christ which leads us to adopt views such as seem themselves to lead , when legitimately carned // out , to so many difficulties . Does not clear thinking show many difficulties as inevitable conclusions from the opinion that the final coming will be in body and for a personal reign upon the earth ? Nothing better refutes this view than to ask the one who advocates it-precisely what do you mean ? We are reminded , however , that in Acts i , 11 , the disciples are assured , " this same Jesus " . . . " shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven . " The words *v rp*rov appear to be added to *3vrc* for the express purpose of insisting upon the comparison . As he had ascended so he should descend from heaven in a cloud . But we are thrown into much doubt as to how far we shall press this comparison when we remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloud ( vid . Luke xxi , 27 , and compare Matt. xxiv , 30 ) within his own generation , and that he declared to Caiaphas ( Matt. xxvi , 64 ) : " From now on shall ye see the son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven . " We can not find , then , that those whose knowledge of the future is much more detailed than has here been indicated have the authority of Jesus . 6 . Nor have we , it should be further noted , in the views of the New Testament writers a firm basis for esehatological teaching which goes beyond that of Christ . The truth of a triumph for Christ 's kingdom through the preaching of the Gospel was heartily accepted by them . No fact of their history is more firmly established . Their view of the time and method of this triumph may have been somewhat obscured by false impressions which still lingered from their old habits of thought . We may also be unable to tell how theoretically Paul reconciled his view of salvation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of Christ 's speedy advent . We do know that he guarded that expectation most carefully against the wrong practices which some were ready to derive from it . He strenuously combatted the same practical tendencies which are at work in the present day . They unnerved the Christian workman . They took the joy and assurance from his work . As we have already seen , among the disciples John dwells most upon the spiritual second coming of Christ . In his view the second coming is preceded by a course of // development , in which the spirit of Antichrist must be overcome . The perfection of the individual believer is connected with Christ 's second advent : " Beloved , now are we children of God ; " " when he shall appear we shall be like him . " ( 1 John iii , 2 . ) In Peter 's view the development of the kingdom was perfected in the coming of Christ , though according to his expectation also that coming was near at hand . We are not to wonder that a logical adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of the apostles . Such adjustment is still with many minds a thing of the future . No one is ready for presenting its perfected product . We shall make no attempt in this essay either to combat false views of the prophecies of Daniel or the Revelation , or to throw light upon the doctrine of the second advent by presenting the true views . Those prophecies seem to us the carrying out , with reference to events which have already occurred , of those principles which lie at the base of all correct views of God 's kingdom . To form from them a connected scheme of the world 's future is to misuse them . Whenever such a scheme , however confidently derived , contradicts truths upon which is founded the whole historic course of God 's rule , we have no need to give it a detailed examination . If our method of treatment seems to cramp too much the information given in divine utterances , we reply , it is , as far as it goes , safe . Let him who can sajdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we will follow no man s teaching , even when based upon an assumedly correct interpretation of inspired prophecy , if that interpretation proves itself false by contradicting plain truths . A more detailed doctrine than we have ventured to give , if possible for any one , is at least permissible only when that doctrine shall abide certain tests . IV . We close our discussion with a brief statement of those tests . They seem to us entirely decisive against the vagaries of premillennialists. 1 . No doctrine can be accepted , which , being ostensibly based upon prophecy , builds itself up by ignorance of first principles for the sound interpretation of prophecy . This is habitually done by premillennarian writers . They are repeating to-day // many of the errors of opinion found among the Jews of Christ 's time . As those Jews misunderstood the true meaning of Old Testament prophecy , so they that of the New Testament . They misuse prophetic imagery . In this particular they are oftentimes even more inconsiderate than those whom they resemble ; and for their misuse they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any consistent defence . Their stronghold is the seventh chapter of Daniel , but they largely misinterpret this prophecy . They call constantly for a literal interpretation , but in attempting their literal interpretation of prophecy one runs great risk of stultifying the writers of prophecy . They themselves are led to expect Christ sitting bodily on Mount Olivet , the Jews his chief instrument for the conversion of the nations , violence his chief method , a world made up of men , some with ordinary physical bodies , and some with resurrection bodies , all literally worshiping together at Christ 's feet -- these things and other like things which are too many now to mention . This is a sort of literalism which is illiterate and leads to the grossest absurdities . They refuse also the belp of history in the interpretation of prophecy . This refusal is expressly made by Mr. Darby . " I do not admit history , " says this writer , " to be in any sense necessary to the understanding of prophecy . " " I believe that the attempt to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its real rneanin*. ' * We confidently assert that no view of prophecy could be more opposite to the true view . To say that prophecy is never interpreted except by history would be much nearer the truth . We , therefore , feel much more confidence in the interpretation which is historically derived than in that which is given us by Mr. Darby . History always and grandly keeps the word of promise to the heart , though it sometimes , perhaps usually , breaks it to the ear . The premillennialists try to keep it to the ear , but sadly do they break it to the hearts of men . Without history we do not know the meaning of prophecy , either to the mind of the prophet himself or as correctly interpreted by the course of the ages . Their mode of interpreting prophecy also concentrates unduly the attention upon comparatively unimportant details . // In many of their discussions we feel no great interest . With Prof Cowles -- we do not care to debate " the question in celestial geography whether this earth , purified at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future eternal heaven . " 2 . No theory of the second coming can be true which contradicts the faots of human progress , and of the vast contributions to this progress which have been made by the gospel . To deny these facts emasculates the gospel of its power to engender life in the world . We by no means relish much of the inane boasting about progress which is now so common . It is hard , however , to see how any thorongh and healthy research into history can be undertaken without establishing the fact of progress . It is the growing power of God 's forces . It is the Logos shining more and more in the world . This we call human progress : call it rather God 's forward movement through the ages . Nor can it reasonably be doubted that to this progress Christianity has largely contributed . If this be not so , Christianity has small valid claim upon us for acceptance or even for respect . If it has been working for eighteen centuries upon the race only to show itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it God 's power for the salvation and lifting of the race ? The following , according to the view maintained by the writer of a book , entitled , " Hopes of the Church , " is the sum-total of the Gospel 's showing . " All is in disorder . " - - - " As to the present , that is the time during which Christ is sitting at the right hand of God . everything is in a state of misery . " - . - " Christendom is in a state worse than that of Jews or Pagans. " - - - " Instead of permitting ourselves to hope for a continued progress of good , we must expect a progress of eviL " But what , may we not ask , is the inevitable conclusion from statements such as these ? If the Gospel can do nothing for the race , the race does not want the GospeL Observe then , 3 . No view can be true which degrades the Gospel as a present and prospective power in the world for the salvation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gospel in its connection and work with the entire race , that we utter our most earnest protest . Strong feelings arise in the heart , and strong language is apt to flow from the pen , when we see such // a comparatively paltry influence assigned to the preaching of Christ 's cross in the general movement of the kingdom of heaven . We gratefully recognize the amiable Christian character of many of those whose views upon this subject we must strenuously oppose . The worst effect-as is seems to us after a candid reading-of the dreary and disjointed literature with which they have flooded the country is this , that it tends to shake the confidence of men in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ as a present and prospective power in the world . It is in vain for the advocates of the view to disclaim the tendency . It is only too widely and too obviously apparent . They who take such a doleful view of the Gospel 's past have of course no cheer as to its future . Dr. IDuffield puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , which forms the nucleus of the whole discussion is one and very simple- " is the kingdom of heaven a new dispensation to be introduced on earth by the visible personal coming of Christ ? " Let the issue be thus stated . If Jesus teaches anything clearly , he clearly teaches us that the kingdom of heaven is now , and has been since his first advent , among men . His first cry was , " The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand . " " The kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it : " the kingdom of God is in the midst of you ; to this teaching the entire lives of Christ and his apostles are pledged . The whole Church in the past has been built upon the teaching . The error which denies this truth is fundamentaL It degrades , as to a matter of prime importance , the Gospel of our Lord . This premillennarian view degrades the Gospel as to its product also . That product is the Church , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Church , according to the premillennarian theory , is no saving power in the world ; it is tolerated only until the time for sweeping it away shall come . This theory also degrades the Gospel in the person of its author . The view of the Saviour which the theory presents is , though certainly not thus intended by its advocates , a degrading view . It is a return to the old-time erroneous notions of Messiah 's rule . The blood of Messiah is unavenged , and to avenge it we must go back to the literal interpretation of the // passages which represent him as threshing the heathen in anger , and ruling the nations with a rod of iron . What precisely do these writers intend ? The New Testament emphasizes the power of Christ 's humiliation and death . The Cross and the preaching of it are the power of God for winning men . If we debase the power of spiritual forces , how shall we expect results from the miraculous working of forces which touch only the physical man ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces convert the world ? how indeed can he conrert it at all if it will have successfully resisted conversion through those same forces ? Will he thresh sin out of men and beat salvation into them by displays of physical force ? We are to believe his word , that it is far better for us and for his cause that he be bodily from us in order to be spiritually with us in all the ages . The victorious Messiah , trampling out his enemies by visiting physical disaster upon them , then reigning in bodily presence upon the hills that surround the capital of little Palestine , would have small attractive or compelling power for us , compared with the crucified , self-forgetful , humble Jesus . Surely this is a gross and false conception of Messiah , returned to fill again the imagination of men . To exalt that which is sensuous in its form and which works by producing sudden and great convulsions , above the slower , more secret movement of spiritual forces is a fundamental mistake in the interpretation of the past of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conception of its future development . We recognize the influence of epoch-making catastrophes ; but after all , great catastrophes generally do very little spiritually for those who are in the midst of them , and the men of the next generation at once forget their lessons . What reason have we to suppose that the bodily descent of our Lord would of itself do more to change men 's souls than did his presence with them in the first advent ? Are we not agreed that the elements of real power in that first advent , now multiplied , are working successfully in thousands of places where the golden throne of king Messiah could not be set up ? Finally-no theory can be true whose legitimate tendency is towards the letting down of tone in the whole Christian life . // We have no wish to use the argumentum ad irwidiam . We deplore that we are forced to speak in this manner of a view which many Christian brethren hold . We are moving , however , under the profound inj unction of Coleridge , to be tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false opinions . Upon the peg of constant expectation of Christ 's bodily presence the premillennialists propose to hang the whole Church . They propose what is psychologically impossible . The Church can not live for centuries in intense expectation of an immediate realization of Christ 's bodily coming . For his coming they are always to watch . But if they watch according to the expectation of the premillennialist , the hope breaks down . And breaking , it carries somewhat down the Christian character of most men who hold the hope . Yet it is this precise , welldefined expectation which these theorists insist is necessary for keeping in tone the Christian life . Not so : the constant spiritual coming of Christ does this . We can watch for Christ 's spiritual comings , for his comings in history , and for the sweetly awful coming to the soul in death , and be benefitted by the watching . To try to expect that which we have no warrant to expect , and which is constantly disappointing us , is injurious . The definite statement is made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed upon the doctrine of Christ 's speedy bodily advent . We have little doubt what would be the effect upon them of such pabulum . In the case of men of long standing in the Christian life , its obvious tendency appears in the nourishing of a condition which seems to us a sort of refined spiritual selfishness . Some of these writers are very hard upon their brethren who do not hold their views . The Church at large seems to them a nest of unclean birds . They especially distrust missionary enterprises . The missionaries and their supporters , according to Dr. Lord , " are acting on mistaken notions of God 's purposes and of their instrumentality , and will be disappointed . " Their error , he thinks , is in many instances one of the heart also . Imagine Paul 's fierce denunciation of a view like this  --  the man who had gone from Jerusalem in a cirenit to Illyricum , and late in life purposed to reach also Spain , preaching the Gospel . Let it be distinctly understood , this attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmanly and well calculated to realize the teaching of the men who take the attitude , viz : that Christ 's Gospel is , for the regeneration and saving of the race , a proven failure . How any earnest soul can be satisfied with such a selfish theory of salvation , it is hard for us to imagine . We believe that the men are far better than their theory ; but as to the tendencies of the theory we have no doubt . It tends to unnerve the workman . It takes the heart out of the preacher of the Gospel , who especially needs to feel that , when Christ stands by him , he is working for the ages . No manly , thoughtful workman is willing to measure the value of his work by its immediate results alone . He wants to work with Christ frr the race . He is satisfied only if he can have a place in the great scheme of saving , through the Gospel , the fallen race . That theologian 's teaching is vitiated , and that workman is palsied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great conditions , aspirations , and hopes , which concern the race as a race . In viewing these things we have no right unnecessarily to load down our Christian doctrine with opposition to the right use of reason . The outlook is hopeful , though the course be long . like outlook is hopeful because the course is long . Godmysterious as the thought is , awful as it is in some of its applications , God never hurries . In his sight Christianity is not old . She is now in her infancy , and she will never outlive , but rather continually increase the vigor of her youth . There is room for many , many comings , in blended majesty and love , to judge and to liberate , before the final advent of him whose right it is to rule .
