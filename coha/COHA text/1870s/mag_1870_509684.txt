THE ROCK OF THE LEGION OF HONOlt By BERTHOLD AUERBACH , AUTHOR OF " ON THE HEIGHTS , " ETC . CHAPTER I. A MASQUERADE ON THE RAILROAD . AT the railway station , in a mountain district of Central Germany , in the shade of a spreading beech-tree covered with the fresh foliage of spring , stood a handsome open carriage drawn by two white horses . In the carriage , lined with damask , sat at her ease a young lady in a gray suit , with her arms crossed , and her large dark eyes fixed upon the range of hills , whose curving lines were represented in beautiful relief against the sky . Now she threw back her head , on which was a sorL of fashionable Tyrolese hat with green waving feathers , rose from the seat , took from a pocket of the carriage a large port-folio bound in gray linen , and began to draw , casting now a rapid glance upon the landscape , and now fastening her look upon the paper before her . The expression of her countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her face , which was somewhat long , and had lost the freshness of its youthful bloom . Her finely cut mouth , whose upper lip showed a slight down , was closed , as if in vexation ; she did not seem satisfied with her work ; she put it aside and resumed it more than once , shook her head , and at last shut up the sketchbook . Then nodding , as if encouraging her . self , she opened it again , proceeded with her work , and her features gradually assumed a calm , almost a satisfied , expression . The laying out of the railroad had given a view of the beautiful landscape which probably had never been observed before ; for it is a marked characteristic of our time that every thing is presented under a new visual angle . The lady became more and more engaged in her drawing ; and , notwithstanding it was only a moderately warm spring day , she seemed to be heated . She hastily took off her hat and laid it aside . Her dark hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thick braids behind ; and in the middle of her forehead , not remarkable for height , deep lines were drawn whenever she was engaged in thought , whose trace did not wholly disappear in her ordinary mood . The whole countenance plainly showed that the seriousness of life had inscribed upon it a lasting memorial . Mingling with the lark 's song , high up in the air , and the finch 's note in the tree , there was now heard the long , shrill whistle of a locomotive . The lady made , hastily , a few more strokes of the pencil , then shut the book , put it away in the carriage , and crossed her arms in an attitude of quiet , expectant waiting . A servant in brown livery stepped up to the coachman , who was holding the reins , and , lifting his hat , on which was a brown cockade , said to the lady , whom he addressed as Frfinhem , that the train had been signaled. lie opened the carriage door , and made a movement to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into the air , without directing her glance toward the servant , " I shall not get out ; you may bring Frdulein Von Korneck here . " In her voice there was an authoritative tone , and possibly also a slight expression of vexation . Louise Merz , for this is the lady 's name , was expecting on old friend , with whom she had formed an intimacy at boarding-school , generally so short-lived , but in this instance well kept up . It would almost seem as if the expected friend occasioned the restlessness , which she never failed to bring with her ; for Louise stood up and sat down , appearing to consider // whether she ought not to receive her as she alighted from the train ; but as she now perceived that the railway employ*s on the platform at the station were looking toward her , and pointing her out to others , she remained quietly where she was . People should not see that she had a friend of such a lively temperameat , who , no doubt , would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round should understand that Louise Merz had settled down into a staid and matronly demeanor . The horses had to be held by the head as the train rushed so near to them . A white handkerchief waved from a second-class car . Now the train stopped , and a lady carefully handed out and placed in the arms of the servant what seemed a child closely wrapped up , and then alighted from the car . She was of slender form and gayly dressed ; she nodded once more back to the car , and also greeted her friend waiting under the tree . All her movements were quick and lively , and she looked about her , and looked into the faces of people , as if she were always wanting to ask whether there was nothing she could laugh at . Valises and hand-bags were speedily deposited on the ground . The newly arrived passenger took the swathed-np bundle , which seemed to be a child , from the servant , handled it tenderly , and hastened with it to her friend . The servants followed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valises , for he knew the person who had just arrived , whose father had formerly been his captain . When she reached the carriage in which her friend was sitting she cried , in an animated tone , " Louise , what do you say to my bringing with me a child ? " And before the amazed lady could give any reply , she opened the wrappings , and out jumped a brown spaniel spotted with white , which shook its long ears , as if it had just come out of the water , leaped this way and that , looked up into the face of its mistress , who did not vouchsafe a single glance , but who , amidst the laughter of the by-standers , was saying , as she turned now to the d*p6t-master and now to Louise : " Is n't this a clever child , under ten years of age ? The stiff official gentlemen of the railway would n't permit me to take my well - educated friend Scheck into the car . Well , tyranny makes people cunning . I disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merriest kind of adventures . The fashion of only having for tenants in houses persons without children extends also to railways . In several cars which I wanted to get into they cried out , in a very friendly and humane tone , The seats here are all taken , ' and when I , pretty angry , at last succeeded in getting a seat , the ladies wished to get sight of the child , and a quite good-looking widower , to whom I was obliged to confess that I had no husband , almost offered himself to me . Herr Thip6t-master , " said she , turning to that gentleman , " I hope you are no Philistine , to make me pay a penalty . " And as the dog , who seemed to know that he was the subject of conversation , sprang up to his mistress , she said to him , " Yes , you were very clever ; you have human understanding . " The railway employis and all the passengers who had stopped at the station were standing near , and joined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon came up , and the cook appeared at her door to look at the group , not being able to al5sent herself from her realm on account of her attire . The dog seemed to divine that yonder was a heart well disposed toward him , for he suddenly disappeared . Louise looked on all this merriment with considerable vexation , and begged that they would make haste to drive away . This free and easy pleasantry of her friend was distasteful to her . Trunks , valises , and bags were stowed away , and , when they were all ready to drive off , Scheck was missing . After being repeatedly called , he came from the cook 's dominions , still licking his chaps ; casting one look back upon his benefactor , he jumped into the carriage with his mistress . The servants found it very hard to stop laughing . The carriage rolled off on the highway , and the people at the station continued for a long time looking after it . The d*p6t - master told those who were less acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saloon and his wife gave supplementary information , but there were many things that they were ignorant of . CHAPTER II . THE DAUGHTER OF THE PARLIAMEET . OPINIoNs differ , some asserting that Louise was fifteen , and others that she was eighteen years of age when her father , the rich manufacturer Merz , was first chosen deputy ten years previously , and removed , with his only child , to the capital . As an independent , practical , and cultivated man , Herr Merz was a prominent member of the liberal majority , which had a ministry of its own character . This ministry did not proceed , indeed , from the majority by any special constitutional arrangement , but was rather the choice of the prince ; and there prevailed a peculiarly elevated sentiment , as they were acting in harmony with the government , which was in essential harmony with the general tendency . Herr Merz had encountered nothing worthy of being called an opposite party ; and he accepted his authorized position so much the more readily , as he was not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that he could be faithful to his principles and loyal at the same time . It was no easy thing for him to leave his large manufacturing business in the charge of an agent , however trust-worthy he might be ; but he hoped , by a change of scene // and new interests , to overcome and to forget for a season his deep affliction in the recent loss of a wife with whom he had heen most happily united . He hired a house in the capital , and his mother-in-law with his daughter constituted a pleasant household . Herr Merz made no speeches in the Chamber of Deputies ; but he was so much the more industrious in committees , and zealously executed those labors which , like the foundations of a building , make no show , but sustain the superstructure . Louise and her grandmother frequently sat for half a day in the gallery appropriated to the friends of the deputies . The gentlemen in the hall below would often look up at the worthy matron and the beautiful girl by her side , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in intervals of business and during some tedious details , one and another of their more intimate acquaintances among the deputies would join the ladies in the gallery and engage with them in conversation . Louise was generally silent ; but what she heard constituted a peculiar element in the formation of her character . Spring , when the session closed , was hailed as a deliverance ; and when they returned to the manufactory it seemed to all as if they had just come into the free air out of the sultry atmosphere of the Chamber . Louise at once seemed to enjoy new life . And when she returned in the autumn with her father and grandmother to the capital , her mourning now laid aside , she was welcomed by a large circle as an old acquaintance . Some other deputies had brought with them their wives and daughters , and they formed a circle of their own , whose special charm consisted not only in the fact that choice spirits from all parts of the country came together , but that , while away from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiar advantages of a home . The third year there was an inspiring novelty . A boarding-school friend of Louise , Marie von Korneck , had come with her father to the capital . The two girls had been good friends at the school , but their friendship had not been of that kind to pledge them to its continuance after their separation . But it seemed now as if they had been on most intimate terms : there were the common youthful recollections ; they had much to say about their schoolmates scattered in every part of the world , about the pedantry of their teachers , and also about that teacher of history with whom all the pupils were in love . And the very difference in the characteristic qualities of the two girls seemed to constitute a special attraction . Marie had a sort of soldier-like promptness of speech , was never at a loss what to say , and looked at life as a merry game ; Louise , on the other hand , was rather of a reflective turn , was not quick at small-talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she expressed herself it was always in fitting and well-arranged words . Their fathers , too , formed a friendly intimacy ; and , as a liberal ministry was uppermost , and the party of Herr Merz seemed to be its main stay , Major Korneck was not disinclined to be on terms of friendly intercourse with a politician of decidedly liberal tendencies . Marie von Korneck had very soon entered into the . social pleasures of the capital , and became acquainted with the best dancers and the most amusing old gentlemen ; while the young Ensign Von Birkenstock , who was a distant relation , and was permitted to call her cousin , was her obedient admirer , and also showed himself devoted to her friend . Louise was soon drawn into the whirl of winter dissipations . The saloons of the minister and the best social circles were thrown open to the deputies and their families , and through many a dancing-hall Louise and Marie promenaded arm and arm , while many eyes , spectacled and unspectacled , were directed toward them . There was also some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly to every one , and showed no particular preference for any . She was an enlivening element in the society of men , combative and positive in her replies ; and she had not been a listener to the debates for several sessions , sometimes siding with one speaker and sometimes with another , without perceiving that she lacked independence of judgment , and that it needed to be cultivated . An entirely new life was opened to her when she and Marie entered the painting - school which a celebrated artist had opened for girls . Marie could draw human figures well , but she liked far better to make caricatures ; Louise had a decided talent for landscape . In the studio Marie was the chief speaker , and knew every thing that was going on at the capital , especially in military circles . As was to be expected , Louise was regarded as possessing the soundest judgment ; and when her opinion was asked she gave it with such reasons , and such a consideration of objections , that she received very naturally the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humored and cheerful , and particularly merry with the father of Louise . After his wife 's death he had resolved to devote himself exclusively to his child and to the general good of his country ; but before the close of the first winter he found himself so greatly cheered and enlivened by her daily intercourse in the family that his determination became somewhat shaken . Marie was not indisposed toward him-was , in fact , quite confidential ; and her father , the major , bore himself toward Herr Merz in a manner that said : " Why are you so faint-hearted , old boy ? The affair could be all settled with two words . " For weeks herr Merz heard nothing of the debates going on in the House of Deputies-he was listening to the debates within himself . // and these were so stormy , and the parties contended in such an unparliamentary way , that the president , in the shape of calm reason , had frequently to call them to order . Herr Merz closed up every avenue by which these commotions of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not escape the notice of his mother-in-law . While every one else was in raptures with Marie 's cheerful disposition , father and daughter vying with each other in her praise , and while her absence seemed to leave a void  --  the old lady would shake deprecatingly her gray head , as she dropped her knitting-work from her delicate hand , and say : " What a great pity ! Friiulein Von Korneck would make a first-rate actress ! " Herr Merz put a restraint upon himself , and was careful to say before Marie , as well as in her father 's presence , that he had unconditionally given up every thought of changing his own way of life , and placed all his dependence on Louise . lie hoped that his child would soon find the man who would appreciate her rich heart and mind and her solid qualities . Louise , too , was ready enough to confess that she was not unwilling to be married ; but year after year passed , Louise was in friendly relations with some of the best men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest , that it seemed as if married men were the only ones who conducted themselves toward her in a sensible and straightforward manner ; she always found the bachelors either foppish or sentimental , and sometimes she was inclined to believe that one and another were attracted to her on account of her expected wealth . During the summer a letter was received from Marie , in which she wrote that her father was dead , and that she was left alone and destitute . Louise wanted her father to receive her into the house , but he positively refused , although , in general , every wish of his child was to him a law . He maintained that Louise , by means of such an association with her friend , would fail to gain an individual reliance upon herself ; she ought not to get rid entirely of the desire to have an independent household of her own ; but secretly he had a dislike to Marie , which , strangely enough , proceeded from the compulsion he had put on his inclination . Marie wrote soon afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady on a journey . Herr Merz , who desired to devote himself more and more to political life , and regarded it as a duty that men of independent position should give their whole attention to it , sold his manufactory . He wanted to live the whole year at the capital , but he yielded to Louise 's urgent entreaty , and retired to an estate which he possessed in the mountains . But that very year in which he had become entirely at leisure to devote himself to public life he failed of an election . After the first pain of disappointment he consoled himself by saying  --  and with him it was not a mere form of words-that there were a great many clever men who could represent the various interests of the country . Tie would often say : " One must obey her call , but one must also wait , if he is not called , until the right time comes. ** At the same time there occurred a change in political matters , which made it desirable to a man of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where party lines were strictly drawn . He was not one of those combative natures who enjoy a sharp antagonism ; he loved comfortable quiet , so far , of course , as was consistent with the maintenance of his principles . Now could he peacefully await in his ark the deluge which the chaos seemed about to usher in ? The newspapers were the doves which brought to him news of the height to which the flood had risen in the world . He read very diligently the proceedings in the Chamber of Deputies ; he had telling and well-arranged speeches in his head , which now , alas ! there was no opportunity of delivering . He devoted himself energetically to the affairs of the community and the neighborhood , but he felt a continual void , and hoped for some new interest in life only through the marriage of Louise . But she was now more than twenty-five years old , and openly asserted that she had definitively closed up her account with life , and would devote herself exclusively to her little talent . Marie had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was living with the old lady in the garrison city . On her first visit to the coeintry house of Herr Merz , when she was alone with him , she at once perceived his embarrassment , and said , in the liveliest way : " Ah , Herr Merz , why did yon not marry me years ago ? It is too late now ; I am engaged . " " May I ask to whom ? " inquired Herr Merz . " No ; that is a secret . " Since that first visit they had not again seen each other . Now Marie had been invited to visit them , as they wanted to be together a few days before Herr Merz and his daughter set out on their journey to Italy . CHAPTER III . ON ONE 5 OWN GROUND . Tun carriage containing the two young ladies drove at a quick trot along the highway . " Ah , how happy you are to call such a carriage your own ! " cried Marie . " No one would believe that a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy . " Louise knew the perpetual wrangling of her friend with her pecuniary situation , and she nodded at the remark , so that Marie , by jesting freely in regard to her peculiarly hard and dependent position , might be relieved and // cheered . Marie possibly perceived her friend 's drift , for she declared that life was a mere farce , and the best way was to play it briskly . She told very humorously some of her traveling adventures . Louise diverted her from these by asking how she got along with the lady with whom she was living as a companion . " Ah ! " cried Marie , " she is all the time complaining about her former companions , and will most assuredly complain about me to future ones . The nobh* lady is always wanting to be loved , and at the same time to be very little out of pocket ! She ought to have a broom and duster crossed on her coat of arms , Cor sweeping and dusting are the objects of her existence . Every evening her servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thea she scatters these into every nook and corner of the rooms , so as to make sure the next day that every place has been swept . " " But you must be glad that you have a calling , " Louise said , attempting to turn the conversation . " Calling ? I say with Riickert  --  or is it some one else ? - If I had had a hundred thousand dollars income , I would never have dished myself up for you . ' Calling ? Never use that word again to me . If I were rich , I would marry a man who pleased me , and let others take the calling . " Marie now struck into a serious vein , and exhorted her friend not to continue playing the prude , and decline all suitors . Louise replied that she had given up the world . " Given up the world * " laughed Marie . " Why do n't you say , too , I am dead and buried . ' You are a year younger than I. Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once 1 " " Tame me ? Am I wild ? " " No ; do n't misunderstand me , you are , on the contrary , too tame-I mean too cultivated . " " Too cultivated ? " " Yes , you have seen a great deal too much , thought a great deal too much . You perceive each one 's deficiencies , and you think , besides , that he does not want me , he wants my money . You open a parliamentary debate when any one makes his appearance . You are the Daughter of the Parliament . " " Good ! You have now said the whole , and now I beg that you will say nothing more on the subject . " Louise uttered this in a decided tone , and for a while they drove on in silence . They were approaching some of the outlying buildings which were a short distance from the manorhouse . The farm-dogs barked , they took note of the new arrival , and Scheck was quick at reply , like his mistress . But Marie ordered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed . The carriage stopped at the steps of the house , and Herr Merz bade Marie welcome . There was a slight flush in the countenance of the elderly man , who , perhaps , had not wholly overcome the impression that he had once had a passing , repressed inclination toward his daughter 's friend . Marie immediately addressed Herr Merz in a tone of raillery , and he replied in a friendly way . Marie was conducted to her chamber , but , she soon came down , and promenaded with Herr Merz up and down in front of the house . She asked what that unfinished addition was which had one large window with a single pane of glass . Herr Merz replied that he had built it for Louise 's studio , and that it was to be completed during their proposed journey to Italy , as Louise wanted to devote herself wholly to her artistic talent . " This is very wrong in you . You must not do this ! " exclaimed Marie , defiantly . In answer to his amazed inquiry , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her proposal to give up the world . Now a suitor would have to encounter additional resistance . " I stick to this , " cried she , " that Louise must marry . And if I am obliged to conjure up here the swan-knight , she shall be married . Done with life ! All done ! Did any one ever hear of such a thing in a beautiful , rich girl , who is-well-is twenty-six years old ! Do you give me full power to set in motion what I please ? " " And what if I should not ? " " To be sure ; but I should do just the same without it . Yet it 's better that I have said what I have . This respite is mine , and I will use it , ' " she recited in pathetic style . Louise came down and her father went away in a short time . She and Marie strolled in the park arm in arm . Suddenly Marie stopped and cried : " Ab , I should like to know how one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way ! " She raised her dress a little , disclosing a handsome foot in brown gaiter boots , and she set it firmly on the ground . Then she went on to depict in enthusiastic terms how happy that person must be who could call a piece of ground his own , and who had a settled home . Louise made no contradicton , for she had a sincere compassion for a girl who , belonging to the higher class of society , was homeless iu the world , and obliged to eat the bread of service-a service really , though seeming to be a voluntary work . She simply said , at last , that Marie was rich enough-she had such an inexhaustible fund of humor . " Do n't appeal to that ! " cried Marie , with an expression of trouble . " When one appeals to that it is all over . " They had entered a copse where the birds were singing merrily . Louise stood still and asked her friend whether she did not wish to tell her something more about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not just now , " Marie hastily exclaimed ; // " but by-and-by I will tell you . Do n't , I beg , ask me any further . When the right time comes I will let you know every thing , and you must help me . " They spoke now of the proposed journey to Italy , and Louise expressed her regret that Marie could not accompany her . She would have been a good guide , for she had already been over the ground . Marie knew , and Louise guessed , why the father , usually so indulgent to every wish of his child , had positively refused to have Marie accompany them . Silently they went through garden and park , and then returned to the house . The grandmother of Louise , who had not been well during the day , had recovered by evening . They sat together in pleasant mood , and after tea Marie began a game of chess with Herr Merz . She was a very skillful player , and , as the game lasted a long time , Louise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone . Hardly had they been left alone , however , tl*n Marie broke up the game and said she must speak still further about Louise . Herr Merz was to name over the men in the neighborhood who were to he his guests the next day , who among them might he suitors of Louise , and which of them he himself would desire ; for it was of great importance that a friend should express herself pleased with a wooer , and she hoped tv bring Louise in this way to a definite point . He named over several , among them a proprietor and a young official from the county town not far off , between whom he had no choice , but who were equally indifferent to Louise . Marie was very confident that she could bring her friend to the point . CHAPTER IV . A REVIEW . Tnu next day , which was clear and cool , saw the arrival of guests of both sexes in carriages and on horseback . Marie had induced Louise to adopt a new style of wearing her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite shade of sombre drab , as Marie called it . The neighbors gazed at her in surprise when she first met them , and Marie was pleased at this , for she knew that Louise was looking unusually young and animated . When the neighboring landed proprietor and the young government official were introduced to Marie she made a courtesy , and , instead of casting down her eyes , looked steadily at them . She passed them both in review , and found that in respect to external appearance the choice was by no means difficult . Fortunately for Marie , the man held in highest estimation in this circle of friends was an old comrade of her father . By this means she was at once accorded a high place of honor ; the whole circle gathered around her , and Louise did her best to make her the centre of attraction . The young official saw at once that Marie 's opinion had decided weight with Louise , and he therefore showed her a great deal of attention . He attended her when the company took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conversation incidentally mentioned that he was an officer in the militia . He could see that this made quite a favorable impression . Marie thought well of his appearance and general bearing , but he either was , or pretended to be , rather bashful ; he was not sufficiently confident and self-asserting . She came to the conclusion in her own mind that he would not do , for whoever would win Louise must excite in her a positive interest . He appeared to be familiar with landscapepainting not only in reference to the character of the foliage and the fore-ground , but he was quite enthusiastic in speaking of the necessity of haviug an artistic eye , and of the prevailing taste for landscape-painting as in harmony with the tendencies of our age in its study of natural science . He pointed out a group of trees , and extolled to the skies the happiness of being able to revel in light and air . All this he reeled off to Marie like a book , as they say , with the idea that she would report it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swain is played out ; let us see what sort of a child of humanity the landed proprietor is ! " The proprietor attached himself to father Merz . " Good manners , and not a bad move , " thought Marie . " He really has a high respect for the old gentleman , or else he pretends to have . No matter which , it will have a good effect upon Louise , for she loves her father to distraction , and he who loves him too is in a fair way to gain her good graces . " The proprietor , on the other hand , took a different view from the official , and looked upon Marie as in the way . He was a seriously disposed man , and , next to his own life-calling , devoted to politics . He had soon seen through Marie , and thought that a friend of a character like hers would be apt to make Louise frivolous and fickle . He even imagined that there was a visible constraint in the bearing of the latter toward her friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with her . And when Louise asked him how Marie pleased him , he replied , in a straightforward way , " She pleases me just as she does you . I think that you would not like to live all the time with such a sparkling , effervescing , fun - loving temperament . " Louise endeavored to modify his opinion , but she did it in such a way that he was convinced he was not wholly in the wrong , and for the first time he began to eatertain some hope . The dinner passed off cheerily ; the old Herr Von Beuthen , who conducted Marie to the table , felt that he had the privilege of saying what he pleased . // The conversation turned on the intended journey to Italy , and the old Herr said : " You have begun in the wrong way . What mak s you put up a studio for our dear Louise ? A nursery-room would be more to the purpose . " There was a general laugh . Marie looked around the table with sparkling eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor joined in the laughter . All glanced toward Louise , but she looked straight before her , as if the joke had no reference to her at all . Finally , feeling that she must say something , she observed , in a quiet and undisturbed tone , " I am very glad to have given the opportunity to Herr Von Beuthen to exercise his pleasantry . " She occupied herself very zealously with a stately gentleman who sat next , so that his wife , whom the young official conducted to the table , became more and more flushed in the face ; and this redness was not lessened by the several glasses of wine which she drank at the persuasion of the official . At last they rose from table , and while the older gentlemen were sitting on the terrace , smoking their cigars , Herr Von Beuthen exclaimed , in a very loud voice , " It is a disgrace to all bachelordom that Louise is not yet mar-ried ! " The younger portion of the company enjoyed themselves in the garden . Louise remained for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at table , but yielded finally to Marie 's urgent entreaties and joined the younger part of the guests iu the garden . Jest and merriment were the order of the day , and from a thicket came the sound of a lively Swiss jodel , such as the mountain-boys sing . Marie had induced Louise , who could not sing especially well , but who excelled in this Swiss caroling , to give a specimen of her skill . She did not like to be seen when she did this , and so she went aside , placed her delicate left hand to her cheek , and jodeled so loud that it seemed as if the mountain-sides were echoing and re-echoing the notes . Old and young now mingled together , and all were in good spirits until evening came and the guests went away . When they were again alone Louise said to her friend , blushing deeply , " Ah ! Marie , it is indeed horrible , and I ca n't understand it . I am so- " " So what ? " " No ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even to me. ? Speak out 1 " " Well , there were here some cultivated and able men " - naming several- " but those who pleased , those whom I find clever and agreeable , are- " " Married , " interrupted Mario . " Yes , " assented Louise , covering her face with her hands . " Why is it that only such please me ? Why can I speak with freedom only to them ? " " Do n't you know why ? - you , the Daughter of the Parliament ? It 's a very simple matter . You allow yourself to he free with them , and they can be unconstrained in their conversation with you . But when you are with an unmarried man you are thinking all the time that he has some designs on you , and , most probably , on your wealth , and so you are never natural - never free from constraint . " " Oh , how right you are-how much in the right For a long time they were silent , and then Marie suddenly said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come here and sit by me ; I will tell you my secret . " She grasped the hand of Louise , and her voice was choked ; Louise thought it was from deep emotion , hut it was from a wholly different cause . Marie related , in a hesitating and broken way , in marked contrast with her usual offhand fluency , that she was as good as engaged to Von Birkenstock , a cavalry officer in the neighboring garrison city , who was a distant relative of hers , but whom she had seen only nt brief intervals . She had now the desire , as*t was important that she should become more intimately acquainted with him , that Herr Mcrz should invite him to make a visit ; he could lodge at the tenants house . And , besides , it was his intention to resign and take up farming , as he was the son of an agriculturist . Louise promised to bring it about . Marie went to her room , and not long afterward Louise brought her an unsealed letter of invitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night writing a letter , which a messenger carried to the railway station . CHAPTER V. A GAME OF ChESS . LOUISE wanted to accompany her friend , who was to drive , two evenings after this , to the station to meet the cavalry officer . Louise spoke of him as Marie 's betrothed , though the latter protested against it ; hut , as Louise persisted in calling him so , Marie let it pass . Marie drove alone to the station , hut she did not when there remain seated in the carriage , as did her friend a few days previously ; she walked back and forth on the platform and in the garden , which had been freshly laid out , and as yet showed hut a scanty growth , and looked frequently at the watch which she wore in her belt . The train came in , and a young man , with a fresh , grave countenance , and very heavy and long mustache , beckoned from the cars . He alighted , and , although he wore a citizen 's dress , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier . In an easy , off-hand manner he said to Marie : " You have not invoked the spirit of the hussar in vain . Here am I ! I obey your mysterious summons . I have an ample leave of absence . // Now unfold : where is the adventure ? Where is the monster , the dragon ? " Marie begged him not to ask any questions now , and , above all , not to speak German . They seated themselves in the carriage , and he asked : " Are not my eyes to he bandaged ? " Marie smiled , and said no . He further asked if he might he permitted , as modern knights were , to smoke . Leave was given . " What should you say , ' began Marie , at last , " if this carriage , these horses , and with them a fine manor-house and some hundreds of thousands in a fire-proof safe , were your own " With , or without a wife ? " " With . " " With you ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ah , we are all nothing but Philistines , I as well as the rest . Why amIall at once so nfl-aid ? " " You afraid ? Is there such a word in your dictionary ? " " You are right ! It is such a beautiful and advantageous-in fact , a moral intrigue which you are to engage in with me . " You see me armed and equipped for every thing , like a hero in some fairy tale ; and , more especially , I have the virtue of silent obedience . I listen to your oracle as patiently as Tamino in the Magic Flute . " ' " It will soon be all revealed to you . Do you remember Louise Merz ? " " Who could forget her ! Am I to marry her ? " " Yes " I am ready forth*vith . Let the churcrh hells be rung I I am of age ; it is spring ; and I have some new gloves with me . " " Cousin , I am in earnest . " " Dreams are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me , how I danced with her at that time at the minister 's ? Does her father remember me ? He has one good quality-he smokes capital cigars . " " Albreeht , do n't make fun of the really worthy man . To win Louise you must respect him . " " I regard him now as most eminently respectable . " " Albrecht , tell me , in the first place , whether you would marry Louise if she had no proper-ty ? " " No . " " That is honest , at any rate . " " I pray you , dear cousin , let me finish what I was going to say . I could not marry her if she were poor ; but if she were poor and I rich , then- " " Then you would marry her ? " " I* then I would marry you . " Marie blushed , and forbade her cousin to joke any farther in that manner , or he would not answer for the business in hand ; for he must for a while pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired that it should be so . " I do n't understand , " laughed the captain . " The good knight must consent to have his eyes a little blindfolded , " replied Marie . She recovered her good spirits , and said that Louise was prejudiced against every man who was not already bound . With those who were married and betrothed she unfolded all the amiable qualities of her nature , and acknowledged also the fine traits in their character . And therefore her cousin was to pass for a while as her betrothed . " But , Marie , what are you playing with ? You know that you are to me- " " I beg you to stop . You know- " " Certainly , certainly , " observed he , making a motion in the air with his hand as if he were using a paint-brush . Marie shrank back in the carriage , but quickly recovering her position , said , in a lively tone : " But do n't regard me as prudish . I permit all the attentions which your cousinly relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I beg for a kiss . " " For shame ! And you are trifling with your good fortune . But if it must be , here , kiss my hand . " " Take off your glove , I beseech you ! " " No . And one thing more-be kind to Scheck . If you must show tenderness , practice it on Scheck . And , do n't you play chess ? " " My fame is great ! Who could stand the tortures of outpost duty without tobacco and chess ? " " And you can draw ? " " Do n't slander the military school I " " You understand , too , how to take landscapes , and to talk about trees in the foreground , and pe*pective ? " " My gracloiN Frilulein ! Observe this tree with its melodious branches , this rhythm , this symphony- " " Very well ! " " No , it wo n't do , " said he , seriously . " We shall make ourselves contemptible , and your friend an enemy . Can the prim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed ? Is this throwing cold water upon a fine adventure the hussar bravery you spoke of ? Be easy . After a few days we will have a quarrel , and we must arrange that Louise shall be an involuntary listener . Then I will give you your dismissal , and you will thank me-I will allow you on your knees to thank me-you will express your high opinion of me , and honestly confess that you-what is the term they use ? - madly , distractedly , infatuatedly love Louise . And trust me , you will not have to lie , it will be the actual truth . " For some tune neither of them spoke . The captain seemed to be thinking of the part he was to play . Then he , aroused from his long reverie , stood upright and offered his cigarease to the coachman and the footman , who accepted the cigars with thanks . They had both been soldiers , and knew how to appreciate this courteousness in an officer . Marie nodded triumphantly . Herr Von Birk // enstock had one good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept regularly a brief diary , which luckily he now had with him . He found the date noted down at which he had met Louise , and some particulars which refreshed his recollections . Marie was very well satisfied with the various points he introduced , and was able to supplement them from her own memory . The campaign was well begun , and in high spirits they drove up to the manor-house . CHAPTER YJ . A SKILLFUL MAN*EUVRE . LOUISE welcomed her friend 's betrothed with hearty warmth , as if he were a member of her own family . She had carefully attended to the arrangement of a room for him in the neighboring farm-house , and when he thanked her there seemed a strange contradiction between his look of youthful strength and the emotion in his voice , and the shy , almost timid expression of his eyes , as he first looked full at her and then cast them down , while she begged him to look upon her as a friend . He reminded Louise of their meeting at the capital , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dress and flowers which she then wore , and what they had said to each other . " How do you like him ? " asked Marie when she was alone with Louise . " I do n't see how you can ask how any on* likes the man to whom you ha* given yourself for life I " answered Louise . Marie seemed impressed by her earnestness , and her usually ready tongue hesitated and stammered a little as she excused herself , adding that her engagement to the captain was not yet so absolutely settled . The captain was soon on good terms with the father of Louise , although he said directly that he had but little interest in the political questions of the day ; his manner of looking at the estate , and his pertinent remarks expressed in few words , which he skillfully and modestly put in the form of questions , won for him immediately the favor of the master of the house , who expressed his liking for him to his daughter . The captain told Marie that he felt less constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether the latter understood the position of affairs ; but Marie would not let him ask any thing further . She felt a pleasant excitement in her cousin 's moving in the dark , as well as the rest . This gave his bearing a certain gentleness which she thought taking ; and , moreover , she had not herself decided whether Herr Merz ought to share the secret . Meanwhile , she delayed the decision until a favorable moment . The grandmother had known the captain 's mother , and an unexpectedly pleasant relation was established between them ; the old lady , who , at other times , generally sat silent in her arm-chair by the window , often talked with the young man , in whose looks and whole bearing she saw a resemblance to his mother . Thus the days passed pleasantly on the estate . They rode and drove in the country about them , or walked to fine points of view on the neighboring mountains , and Louise could not help frequently congratulating her friend on having found such a man for a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever-jesting Marie should be united to a man who showed , considering his youth , a remarkably earnest character . It often happened that Marie walked with Herr Merz and Louise with the captain ; and a special sympathy was established between them from the fact that the captain had a talent for landscape-drawing . They worked together and compared their sketches , and Louise could give the young man many useful hints , as he had , he said , used his talent but little . The captain was very quick in learning , and oftea surprised her by the ease with which he knew how to apply her instructions . Marie often withdrew , when Louise was with the captain . The father remarked to his daughter on the strange coldness that struck him in the demeanor of the pair ; but Louise thought it just as it should be , and depicted the captain 's character in a sympathizing and feeling manner . When the father spoke of this to Marie , she begged him to go into the garden with her , and there explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished , and remembered how often his mother-in-law had said that Marie ought to have been an actress . How was it possible to carry out such a comedy in real life , which belonged to and might be allowed on the stage ? For a long time he could find no words , and declared at last that Marie 's proceeding was , to say the least , a mistaken one , for she would not accomplish the object she aimed at . hereafter he would have to make an effort to treat the captain in the way he had begun . What sort of a man was he to lend himself to such a plot ? Louise and the captain had one day begun to sketch the ruins of a castle in the neighborhood , which they wished afterward to paintthe captain , in water-colors , Louise , in oils . They worked busily all day . Marie and the father were to go for them toward evening . On the way Herr Merz expressed great uneasiness at a course which would lead to nothing , and leave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overfiowin* good humor , represented to him that this was making much too serious a matter of the little plot ; Louise would be surprised , even angry at first , but would afterward rejoice that an opportunity had been given her to become acquainted with so intelligent a man in uncon // strained intercourse . She repeated to him how often Louise had said to her that it was her misfortune to know well only married or engaged men . Now this misfortune should be turned to advantage . Marie spoke with such animation and cleverness that he could only shrug his shoulders . They arrived at the point from which the sketches were taken ; a good lunch was brought from the carriage , and they sat comfortably together . Louise , however , was very gave , she often looked dreamily before her , and said she was much dissatisfied with her work . The captain confessed that he had expected something better of her ; there was neat precision shown in her drawing , but it was worked up too carefully , with too minute a fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in surprise as he expressed this opinion , but she soon smiled again : just this frankness , this honest fault-finding , would be the most likely to win Louise . CHAPTER VII . FLEEING FROM ONE 'S SELF . TUE four wandered about the ruin , and did not enter the carriage to drive home till the moon had risen . Little was said as they drove on , the father slept , and Marie seemed asleep also ; only the captain and Louise were awake . The stars shone in the sky , the nightingales sang in the bushes , and a spicy breath of spring filled the air . The captain seized Louise 's hand . He held it fast , and she could not withdraw it though she tried ; she trembled . He pressed her hand , and she-did she return the pressure ? She did not know . An icy chill ran over her . Is it indeed so ? Do you love a man who belongs to another ? " No , no ! " she muttered to herself , as she clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fa-ther ! " " What is it ? " asked her father , awaking from his nap . " Ak ! did I call you ? " " Yes . " " I did n't know I did ! Yes ! I should like to get out . " She called to the coachman to stop , opened the carriage door , alighted , and begged her father to get out with her . She would not allow the others to come with them , but abruptly ordered the coachman to drive on ; and as the carriage rolled away she fell on her father 's neck , crying : " Alas , alas ! I am wicked , very wicked , a miserable creature ! Father , help me Her father could hardly utter a word to calm her . Louise threw herself on his breast , and cried , in a heart-rending tone : " Oh , father , I 'm afraid I may , I shall love Marie 's betrothed , and he me . " " But what if he were free ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us not speak a word , I beg you . " Her father did not know how to explain the strange position of affairs . lie could not say that he knew of the plot , for he could not but acknowledge to himself that , in doing so , he should lose all influence over his child ; and the longer he walked in silence by his daughter 's side the better it seemed to him that she should exert self-control and stifle the first germ of love for a man who would lend himself to such a game . They reached the house in silence . Louise hurried to her own room , and sent word that she wanted to see no one that night . She sat on her sofa in an agony of painful self-accusation . It was past midnight when she finally went to rest ; but she could not sleep . She rose again , and sent to wake her father and beg him to come to her . He came , and she entreated him to set her free while there was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried again to explain that perhaps the captain still- But Louise would not let him speak ; she cried : " No , never ! I should be dishonorable in my own eyes ! " She begged her father that they might set out on their proposed journey directly-that very night ; she could not see Marie or her betrothed again . Her father tried once more to soothe her ; but Louise vowed that she would leave the house in the night , and wander out into the world , if her father would not comply with her wish . He had never seen his child so overmastered by excitement , so resolved and determined to break all bonds asunder . He agreed to her proposal . Louise wrote a letter telling her friend that for the next few months she would hear no news of her . She wrote also to her grandmother ; and in the gray of the morning , while Marie was still asleep , the carriage rolled away in which Louise and her father sat . The captain , who , in the farm-house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his window at dawn , believed himself to be dreaming when he saw the carriage pass , heavily laden with trunks , and bearing away Louise and her father . CHAPTER VIII . PLAYING WITH FIRE . FATHER and daughter were far away-Louise sleeping , or at least sitting motionless with closed eyes , in a corner of the carriage-when Marie came down to breakfast in the gardenparlor . She was surprised to find no one there , for Herr Merz was generally early . The housekeeper brought her two letters . One was from Paris ; the other had no address . Marie reddened when she saw the first , but quickly opened the other . It contained the lines which Louise had left behind . Marie could not understand what had happened ; she opened the second letter , but seemed unable to read it properly ; // she put her hand to her head several times , then sat down , staring before her , and holding the letter in the hand which hung nerveless by her side . The captain was announced ; Marie quickly hid both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake all night . He told Marie that he saw he was not yet fit for such adventurous enterprises ; he spoke jestingly , but there was a seriousness in his tone as he spoke of the painful position in which he was placed . He stood between two girls , both worthy to be wooed ; one must pass for his betrothed , the other become his wife ; he was in a false relation toward both ; this must not go on . Marie listened patiently ; she pressed her lips tightly together ; and when the captain asked at last whether he had been dreaming , or had really seen Louise and her father drive away in the early morning , she handed him the letter left by her friend . She was not a little surprised when the captain exclaimed , joyfully : " I 'm thoroughly glad of it ! Now I 'm rid of her and her money . I might have deluded myself into a sentimental mood . I was on the road to it , but we are not fit for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-union can be founded on such an intercourse as ours here . It may do on the stage , where people do n't ask : How does it fare now , after the curtain has fallen ? What are the after-effects of her game of hide and seek ? " ' He stopped suddenly , and Marie said : " They did not want to send us off , and so they have gone out of their own house . " The captain nodded , and Marie went on : " I ought not to have said any thing about it to Herr Merz . " " Did you do that ? " cried the captain . The blood mounted to his brow , his eyes flashed as he continued : " Now all is well ! I am free , and glad of it . I am rid of the gold-devil , and have the angel of sweetness instead . I 'm glad the play is over . We will show the purse-proud people that we have fooled them . Are you agreed ? " " Agreed ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you alone are fit for me . Now tell me frankly , do n't you think , too , that I am the only right person for you ? To be sure we have nothing , but if we have each other we are rich , and we are no Philistines to make many cares for ourselves . I nm strong and courageous ; I will make my way . Now only say one word . have I not already made my way ? Have I not won you ? Say only one word ! " Marie put her hand in her pocket : she was on the point of taking out the other letter , which she had received from Paris , but she drew her hand out again empty , and held it out to her cousin : " Do n't make me speak now . I did not know that I had something in me-they call it jealousy , but-pray , do n't make me speak now . Trust me , I will consider it all . We are no longer children , you and I. No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , to consider for us . Pray go away now , but do n't give yourself any hopes-remember , I have said nothing at all . Good-by ! When the time comes you shall hear from me . But again-remember , I 've promised you nothing . " " And I do not give you up , " exclaimed the captain ; " I put my seal on your mouth . " He embraced and kissed the trembling Marie , who resisted at first , then passionately returned the embrace . Suddenly she tore herself away , and left the room . The captain gazed after her ; then he went to the farm-house , took off his citizen 's dress , put on his uniform , and returned to his post . Marie also went away in the evening . On her return-journey she did not conceal little Scheck , in saucy defiance of the rules , for the inspector allowed her to take him with her openly in the carriage . She sat still a long time , and Scheck watched her in wonder , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a single word , or even a glance . After some time she took Louise 's letter from her pocket , read it through quickly , and tore it into little bits , which at intervals she allowed to flutter out of the window of the railway carriage . The pieces of paper were scattered at wide distances ; no one could have collected them again . She took out the other letter . Shaking her head she looked at the photograph inclosed in it , then read : " Whose is this picture ? No , that you will not ask when your eyes , beaming with warmth and light , rest on this photograph . " I have certainly changed much in appearance , but if a photograph of my soul could be taken , you would not find a single strange feature in It . " And now , where are you ? How do you live ? Have I still a right to speak to you thus ? Are you still free ? Are you still your own , to become mine ? " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you . What I vowed to you on the swiftly-moving vessel is now fulfilled . I have attained an honorable position , and am in a position to make for you-for us  --  a cheerful home , free from want and care . " I come to you , wherever you summon me . Only one thing , in all sincerity and good faith . If I should not seem to you as I did , you are free . We will solemnly clasp hands and say , It must not he ! " I read this letter over . I have written confusedly , but my mind is clear , though I do not know how to express myself otherwise . " My heart beats as it did when I saw you gliding down the Rhine . I am full of courage and confidence , and , so long as I live , would be your Marie made a rent through the name . She was about to tear this letter also , but she stopped , and said to herself , " He calls you free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make some new experiment . No , no ! He is a true , frank soul , without deceit ! Yes , that he was . Is he still ? " She gazed long at the photograph ; then put letter and picture again into her pocket . When she reached home she found the old lady busied with her accustomed occupation of strewing . scraps of paper in all the corners of the room . //
