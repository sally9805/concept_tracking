txt THE SYMPATHY OF RELIGIONS . BY THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON . Our true religious life begins when we discover that there is an Inner Light , not infallible but invaluable , which " lighteth every man that cometh into the world . " Then we have something to steer by ; and it is chiefly this , and not an anchor , that we need . The human soul , like any other noble vessel , was not built to be anchored , but to sail . An anchorage may , indeed , be at times a temporary need , in order to make some special repairs , or to take fresh cargo in ; yet the natural destiny of both ship and soul is not the harbor , but the ocean ; to cut with even keel the vast and beautiful expanse ; to pass from island on to island of more than Indian balm , or to continents fairer than Columbus won ; or , best of all , steering close to the wind , to extract motive power from the greatest obstacles . Men must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they talk of anchoring here upon this bank and shoal of time . It would be a tragedy to see the shipping of the world whitening the seas no more , and idly riding at anchor in Atlantic ports ; but it would be more tragic to see a world of souls fascinated into a fatal repose and renouncing their destiny of motion . And as with individuals , so with communities . The great historic religions of the world are not so many stranded hulks left to perish . The best of them are all in motion . All over the world the divine influence moves men . There is a sympathy in religions , and this sympathy is shown alike in their origin , their records , and their progress . Men are ceasing to disbelieve , and learning to believe more . I have worshiped in an Evangelical church when thousands rose to their feet at the motion of one hand . I have worshiped in a Roman Catholic church when the lifting of one finger broke the motionless multitude into twinkling motion , till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . But I never for an instant have supposed that this concentrated moment of devotion was more holy or more beautiful than when one cry from a minaret hushes a Mohammedan city to prayer , or when , at sunset , the low invocation , " Oh ! the gem in the lotus  --  oh ! the gem in the lotus , " goes murmuring , like the cooing of many doves , across the vast surface of Thibet . True , " the gem in the lotus " means nothing to us , but it means as much to the angels as " the Lamb of God , " for it is a symbol of aspiration . Every year brings new knowledge of the religions of the world , and every step in knowledge brings out the sympathy between them . They all show the same aim , the same symbols , the same forms , the same weaknesses , the same aspirations . Looking at these points of unity , we might say there is but one religion under many forms , whose essential creed is the Fatherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguised by corruptions , symbolized by mythologies , ennobled by virtues , degraded by vices , but still the same . Or if , passing to a closer analysis , we observe the shades of difference , we shall find in these varying faiths the several instruments which perform what Cudworth calls " the Symphony of Religions . " And though some may stir like drums , and others soothe like flutes , and others like violins command the whole range of softness and of strength , yet they are all alike instruments , and nothing in any one of them is so wondrous as the great laws of sound which equally control them all . " Amid so much war and contest and variety of opinion , " said Maximus Tyrius , " you will find one consenting conviction in every land , that there is one God , the King and Father of all . " " God being one , " said Aristotle , " only receives various names from the various manifestations we perceive . " " Sovereign God , " said Cleanthes , in that sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many names , and who rulest alone , ... it is to thee that all nations should address themselves , for we all are thy children . " So Origen , the Christian Father , frankly says that no man can be blamed for calling God 's name in Egyptian , nor in Scythian , nor in such other language as he best knows . A To say that different races worship different Gods , is like saying that they are warmed by different suns . The names differ , but the sun is the same , and so is God . As there is but one source of light and warmth , so there is but one source of religion . To this all nations testify alike . We have yet but a part of our Holy Bible . The time will come when , as in the middle ages , all pious books will be called sacred scriptures , Scripturae Sacrae . From the most remote portions of the earth , from the Vedas and the Sagas , from Plato and Zoroaster , Confucius and Mohammed , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned Alexandrians and the ignorant Galla negroes , there will be gathered hymns and prayers and maxims in which every religious soul may unite ,  --  the magnificent liturgy of the human race . The greatest of modern scholars , Von Humboldt , asserted in middle life and repeated the assertion in old age , that " all positive religions contain three distinct parts . First , a code of morals , very fine , and nearly the same in all . Second , a geological dream , and , third , a myth or historical novelette , which last becomes the most important of all . " And though this observation may be somewhat roughly stated , its essential truth is seen when we compare the different religions of the world side by side . With such startling points of similarity , where is the difference ? The main difference lies here , that each fills some blank space in its creed with the name of a different teacher . For instance , the Oriental Parsee wears a fine white garment , bound around him with a certain knot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , he repeats the four main points of his creed , which are as follows :  --  " To believe in one God , and hope for mercy from him only . " " To believe in a future state of existence . " " To do as you would be done by . " Thus far the Parsee keeps on the universal ground of religion . Then he drops into the language of his sect and adds ,  --  " To believe in Zoroaster as lawgiver , and to hold his writings sacred . " The creed thus furnishes a formula for all religions . It might be printed in blank like a circular , leaving only the closing name to be filled in . B For Zoroaster read Christ , and you have Christianity ; read Buddha , and you have Buddhism ; read Mohammed , and you have Mohammedanism . Each of these , in short , is Natural Religion plus an individual name . It is by insisting on that plus that each religion stops short of being universal . In this religion of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same leading features . The same great doctrines , good or bad ,  --  regeneration , predestination , atonement , the future life , the final judgment , the Divine Reason or Logos , and the Trinity . The same religious institutions ,  --  monks , missionaries , priests , and pilgrims . The same ritual ,  --  prayers , liturgies , sacrifices , sermons , hymns . The same implements ,  --  frankincense , candles , holy water , relics , amulets , votive offerings . The same symbols ,  --  the cross , the ball , the triangle , the serpent , the all-seeing eye , the halo of rays , the tree of life . The same saints , angels , and martyrs . The same holiness attached to particular cities , rivers , and mountains . The same prophecies and miracles ,  --  the dead restored and evil spirits cast out . The self-same holy days ; for Easter and Christmas were kept as spring and autumn festivals , centuries before our era , by Egyptians , Persians , Saxons , Romans . The same artistic designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the temples of Europe , but in those of Etruria and Arabia , Egypt and Thibet . In ancient Christian art , the evangelists were represented with the same heads of eagles , oxen , and lions , upon which we gaze with amazement in Egyptian tombs . Nay , the very sects and subdivisions of all historic religions have been the same , and each supplies us with mystic and rationalist , formalist and philanthropist , ascetic and epicurean . The simple fact is , that all these things are as indigenous as grass and mosses ; they spring up in every soil , and only the microscope can tell them apart . And , as all these inevitably recur , so comes back again and again the idea of incarnation ,  --  the Divine Man . Here , too , all religions sympathize , and , with slight modifications , each is the copy of the other . As in the dim robing-rooms of foreign churches are kept rich stores of sacred vestments , ready to be thrown over every successive generation of priests , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorate each new Messiah . He is predicted by prophecy , hailed by sages , born of a virgin , attended by miracle , borne to heaven without tasting death , and with promise of return . Zoroaster and Confucius have no human father . Osiris is the Son of God , he is called the Revealer of Life and Light ; he first teaches one chosen race ; he then goes with his apostles to teach the Gentiles , conquering the world by peace ; he is slain by evil powers ; after death he descends into hell , then rises again , and presides at the last judgment of all mankind : those who call upon his name shall be saved . Buddha is born of a virgin ; his name means the Word , the Logos , but he is known more tenderly as the Saviour of Man ; he embarrasses his teachers , when a child , by his understanding and his answers ; he is tempted in the wilderness , when older ; he goes with his apostles to redeem the world ; he abolishes caste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers outcasts whom Pharisaic pride despises , and he only says , " My law is a law of mercy to all . " Slain by enemies , he descends into hell , rising without tasting death , and still lives to make intercession for man . These are the recognized properties of religious tradition ; the beautiful garments belong not to the individual , but the race . It is the drawback on all human greatness that it makes itself deified . Even of Jesus it was said sincerely by the Platonic philosopher Porphyry , " That noble soul , who has ascended into heaven , has by a certain fatality become an occasion of error . " The inequality of gifts is a problem not yet solved , and there is always a craving for some miracle to explain it . Men set up their sublime representatives as so many spiritual athletes , and measure them . " See , this one is six inches taller ; those six inches prove him divine . " But because men surpass us , or surpass everybody , shall we hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , somebody must stand at the head , in virtue as in intellect . Shall we deify Shakespeare ? Because we may begin upon his treasury of wisdom almost before we enjoy any other book , and can hold to it longer , and read it all our lives , from those earnest moments when we demand the very core of thought , down to moments of sickness and sadness when nothing else captivates ; because we may go the rounds of all literature , and grow surfeited with every other great author , and learn a dozen languages and a score of philosophical systems , and travel the wide world over , and come back to Shakespeare at length , fresh as ever , and begin at the beginning of his infinite meanings once more ,  --  are we therefore to consider him as separated from mortality ? Are we to raise him to the heavens , as in the magnificent eulogium of Keats , who heads creation with " things real , as sun , stars , and passages of Shakespeare " ? Or are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enthusiast soberly say , " that it is impossible to think of Shakespeare as a man " ? Or shall we reverently own , that , as man 's humility first bids him separate himself from these his great superiors , so his faith and hope bring him back to them and renew the tie . It paralyzes my intellect if I doubt whether Shakespeare was a man ; it paralyzes my whole spiritual nature if I doubt whether Jesus was . Therefore I believe that all religion is natural , all revealed . What faith in humanity springs up , what trust in God , when one recognizes the sympathy of religions ! Every race believes in a Creator and Governor of the world , in whom devout souls recognize a Father also . Every race believes in immortality . Every race recognizes in its religious precepts the brotherhood of man . The whole gigantic system of caste in Hindostan has grown up in defiance of the Vedas , which are now being invoked to abolish them . The Heetopades of Vishnu Sarman forbid caste . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation of the narrow-minded ; but , to those of a noble disposition , the earth itself is but one family . " " What is religion ? " says elsewhere the same book , and answers , " Tenderness toward all creatures . " " He is my beloved of whom mankind are not afraid and who of mankind is not afraid , " says the Bhagvat Geeta . " Kesava is pleased with him who does good to others , ... who is always desirous of the welfare of all creatures , " says the Vishnu Purana . In Confucius it is written , " My doctrine is simple and easy to understand ; " and his chief disciple adds , " It consists only in having the heart right and in loving one 's neighbor as one 's self . " When he was asked , " Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one 's life ? " he answered , " Is not ' Reciprocity ' such a word ? What you wish done to yourself , do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a negative form , in which it is also found in the Jewish Talmud ( Rabbi Hillel ) , " Do not to another what thou wouldst not he should do to thee ; this is the sum of the law . " So Thales , when asked for a rule of life , taught , " That which thou blamest in another , do not thyself . " " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , " said the Hebrew book of Leviticus . Iamblichus tells us that Pythagoras taught " the love of all to all . " " To live is not to live for one 's self alone , let us help one another , " said the Greek dramatist Menander ; and the Roman dramatist Terence , following him , brought down the applause of the whole theatre by the saying , " I am a man ; I count nothing human foreign to me . " " Give bread to a stranger , " said Quintilian , " in the name of the universal brotherhood which binds together all men under the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on any suffering as foreign to himself ? " said the Latin satirist Juvenal . " This sympathy is what distinguishes us from brutes , " he adds . The poet Lucan predicted a time when warlike weapons should be laid aside , and all men love one another . " Nature has inclined us to love men , " said Cicero , " and this is the foundation of the law . " He also described his favorite virtue of justice as " devoting itself wholly to the good of others . " Seneca said , " We are members of one great body , Nature planted in us a mutual love , and fitted us for a social life . We must consider that we were born for the good of the whole . " " Love mankind , " wrote Marcus Antoninus , summing it all up in two words ; while the loving soul of Epictetus extended the sphere of mutual affection beyond this earth , holding that " the universe is but one great city , full of beloved ones , divine and human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy of religions extends even to the loftiest virtues ,  --  the forgiveness of injuries , the love of enemies and the overcoming of evil with good . " The wise man , " said the Chinese Lao-tse , " avenges his injuries with benefits . " " Hatred , " says a Buddhist sacred book , the Dhammapada , " does not cease by hatred at any time ; hatred ceases by love ; this is the eternal rule . " " To overcome evil with good is good , and to resist evil by evil is evil , " says a Mohammedan manual of ethics . " Turn not away from a sinner , but look on him with compassion , " says Saadi 's Gulistan . " If thine enemy hunger , give him bread to eat ; if he thirst , give him water to drink , " said the Hebrew proverb . " He who commits injustice is ever made more wretched than he who suffers it , " said Plato , and adds , " It is never right to return an injury . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that it is better to do injustice than to bear it . " " We should do good to our enemy , " said Cleobulus , " and make him our friend . " " Speak not evil to a friend , nor even to an enemy , " said Pittacus , one of the Seven Wise Men . " It is more beautiful , " said Valerius Maximus , " to overcome injury by the power of kindness than to oppose to it the obstinacy of hatred . " Maximus Tyrius has a special chapter on the treatment of injuries , and concludes : " If he who injures does wrong , he who returns the injury does equally wrong . " Plutarch , in his essay , " How to profit by our enemies , " bids us sympathize with them in affliction and aid their needs . " A philosopher , when smitten , must love those who smite him , as if he were the father , the brother , of all men , " said Epictetus . " It is peculiar to man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do wrong .... Ask thyself daily to how many ill-minded persons thou hast shown a kind disposition . " He compares the wise and humane soul to a spring of pure water which blesses even him who curses it ; and the Oriental story likens such a soul to the sandal-wood tree , which imparts its fragrance even to the axe that cuts it down . D How it cheers and enlarges us to hear of these great thoughts and know that the Divine has never been without a witness on earth ! How it must sadden the soul to disbelieve them . Worse yet to be in a position where one has to hope that they may not be correctly reported ,  --  that one by one they may be explained away . A prosecuting attorney once told me that the most painful part of his position was that he had to hope that every man he prosecuted would be proved a villain . What is the painful circumstance in Mrs. Stowe 's Byron controversy ? That she is obliged to hope that the character of a sister woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is this to their position who are bound to hope that the character of humanity will be blackened by wholesale , who are compelled to resist every atom of light that history reveals . For instance , as the great character of Buddha has come out from the darkness , within fifty years , how these reluctant people have struggled against it , still desiring to escape . " Save us , O God ! " they have seemed to say , " from the distress of believing that so many years ago there was a sublime human life . " Show such persons that the great religious ideas and maxims are as old as literature ; and how they resist the knowledge ! " Surely it is not so bad as that , " they say . " Is there not a possibility of a mistranslation ? Let us see the text , explore the lexicon ; is there no labor , no toil , by which we can convince ourselves that there is a mistake ? Anything rather than believe that there is a light which lighteth every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose the very facts of history must be suppressed or explained away . Sir George Mackenzie , in his " Travels in Iceland , " says that the clergy prevented till 1630 , with " mistaken zeal , " the publication of the Scandinavian Eddas . Huc , the Roman Catholic Missionary , described in such truthful colors the religious influence of Buddhism in Thibet that his book was put in the index expurgatorius at Rome . Balmes , a learned Roman Catholic writer , declares that " Christianity is stripped of a portion of its honors " if we trace back any high standard of female purity to the ancient Germans ; and so he coolly sets aside as " poetical " the plain statements of the accurate Tacitus . If we are to believe the accounts given of the Jewish Essenes by Josephus , De Quincey thinks , the claims made by Christianity are annihilated . " If Essenism could make good its pretensions , there , at one blow , would be an end of Christianity , which , in that case , is not only superseded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a criminal plagiarism . Nor can the wit of man evade the conclusion . " He accordingly attempts to explain away the testimony of Josephus . E And what makes this exclusiveness the more repulsive is its modernness . Paul himself quoted from the sublime hymn of Cleanthes to prove to the Greeks that they too recognized the Fatherhood of God . The early Christian apologists , living face to face with the elder religions , made no exclusive claims . Tertullian declared the soul to be an older authority than prophecy , and its voice the gift of God from the beginning . Justin Martyr said , " Those who live according to Reason are Christians , though you may call them atheists .... Such among the Greeks were Socrates and Heraclitus and the rest . They who have made or do make Reason ( Logos ) their rule of life are Christians and men without fear and trembling . " " The same God , " said Clement , " to whom we owe the Old and New Testaments gave also to the Greeks their Greek philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lactantius declared that the ancient philosophers " attained the full truth and the whole mystery of religion . " " One would suppose , " said Minucius Felix , " either that the Christians were philosophers , or the philosophers Christians . " " What is now called the Christian religion , " said Augustine , " has existed among the ancients , and was not absent from the beginning of the human race , until Christ came in the flesh ; from which time the true religion , which existed already , began to be called Christian . " Jerome said that " the knowledge of God was present by nature in all , nor was there any one born without God , or who had not in himself the seeds of all virtues . " F How few modern sects reach even this point of impartiality ! The usual course of theologians is to deny , and to deny with fury , that any such sympathy of religions exists . " There never was a time , " says a distinguished European preacher , " when there did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients and the ideas of Christianity . There is an end of Christianity if men agree in thinking the contrary . " And an eminent Unitarian preacher in America , Rev. A. P. Peabody , says , " If the truths of Christianity are intuitive and self-evident , how is it that they formed no part of any man 's consciousness till the advent of Christ ? " How can any one look history in the face , how can any man open even the dictionary of any ancient language , and yet say this ? What word sums up the highest Christian virtue if not philanthropy ? And yet the word is a Greek word , and was used in the same sense before Christendom existed . G Fortunately there have always been men whose larger minds could adapt themselves to the truth instead of narrowing the truth to them . In William Penn 's " No Cross No Crown , " one-half the pages are devoted to the religious testimony of Christians , and one-half to that of the non-Christian world . The writings of the most learned of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , and the conflict between the bigot and the scholar makes him deliciously inconsistent . He states a doctrine , illustrates it from the schoolmen or the fathers , proudly claims it as being monopolized by the Christian church , and ends by citing a parallel passage from Plato or AEschylus ! " The ancient poets , " he declares , " seem never to have conceived the idea of a spirit of resignation which would sanctify calamity ; " and accordingly he quotes Aristotle 's assertion , that " suffering becomes beautiful when any one bears great calamities with cheerfulness , not through insensibility , but through greatness of mind . " " There is not a passage in the classics , " he declares , " which recognizes the beauty of holiness and Christian mildness ; " and in the next breath he remarks , that Homer 's description of Patroclus furnishes " language which might convey an idea of that mildness of manner which belonged to men in Christian ages . " And he closes his eloquent picture of the faith of the middle ages in immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Socrates , that " a man who has spent his life in the study of philosophy ought to take courage in his death , and to be full of hope that he is about to possess the greatest good that can be obtained , which will be in his possession as soon as he dies ; " and much more of that serene and sublime wisdom . Yet all this is done in a manner so absolutely free from sophistry , the conflict between the scholar and the churchman is so innocent and transparent , that one forgives it in Digby . In most writers on these subjects there is greater bigotry , without the learning which in his case makes it endurable , because it supplies the means for its own correction . H And , if it is thus hard to do historical justice , it is far harder to look with candor upon contemporary religions . Thus the Jesuit Father Ripa thought that Satan had created the Buddhist religion on purpose to bewilder the Christian church . There we see a creed possessing more votaries than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Its traditions go back to a founder whose record is stainless and sublime . It has the doctrine of the Real Presence , the Madonna and Child , the invocation of the dead , monasteries and pilgrimages , celibacy and tonsure , relics , rosaries , and holy water . Wherever it has spread , it has broken down the barrier of caste . It teaches that all men are brethren , and makes them prove it by their acts ; it diffuses gentleness and self-sacrificing benevolence . " It has become , " as Neander admits , " to many tribes of people a means of transition from the wildest barbarism to semi-civilization . " Tennent , living amid the lowest form of it in Ceylon , says that its code of morals is " second only to that of Christianity itself , " and enjoins " every conceivable virtue and excellence . " It is coming among us , represented by many of the Chinese , and a San-Francisco merchant , a Christian of the Episcopal Church , told me that , on conversing with their educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as enlightened as his own . Shall we not rejoice in this consoling discovery ? " Yes , " said the simple-hearted Abbe Huc : so he published his account of Buddhism , and saw it excommunicated . " No ! " said Father Ripa , " it is the invention of the devil ! " I With a steady wave of progress Mohammedanism is sweeping through Africa , where Christianity scarcely advances a step . Wherever Mohammedanism reaches , schools and libraries are established , gambling and drunkenness cease , theft and falsehood diminish , polygamy is limited , woman begins to be elevated and has property rights guaranteed ; and , instead of witnessing human sacrifices , you see the cottager reading the Koran at her door , like the Christian cottager in Cowper 's description . " Its gradual extension , " says an eye-witness , " is gradually but surely modifying the negro .... Within the last half century the humanizing influence of the Koran is acknowledged by all who are acquainted with the interior tribes . " J So in India , Mohammedanism makes converts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no more intelligent authority ) where Christianity makes but a handful ; and this , he testifies , because in Mohammedanism there is no spirit of caste , while Christians have a caste of their own , and will not put converts on an equality . Do we rejoice in this great work of progress ? No ! one would think we were still in the time of the crusades by the way we ignore the providential value of Mohammedanism . The one unpardonable sin is exclusiveness . Any form of religion is endangered when we bring it to the test of facts ; for none on earth can bear that test . There never existed a person , nor a book , nor an institution , which did not share the merits and the drawbacks of its rivals . Granting all that can be established as to the debt of the world to the very best dispensation , the fact still remains , that there is not a single maxim , nor idea , nor application , nor triumph , that any single religion can claim as exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , nor disinterestedness , nor forgiveness , nor patience , nor peace , nor equality , nor education , nor missionary effort , nor prayer , nor honesty , nor the sentiment of brotherhood , nor reverence for woman , nor the spirit of humility , nor the fact of martyrdom , nor any other good thing , is monopolized by any one or any half dozen forms of faith . All religions recognize , more or less distinctly , these principles ; all do something to exemplify , something to dishonor them . Travelers find virtue in a seeming minority in all other countries , and forget that they have left it in a minority at home . A Hindoo girl , astonished at the humanity of a British officer toward her father , declared her surprise that any one could display so much kindness who did not believe in the god Vishnu . Gladwin , in his " Persian Classics , " narrates a scene which occurred in his presence between a Jew and a Mohammedan . The Mohammedan said in wrath , " If this deed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die a Jew . " The Jew said , " I make my oath on the Pentateuch , and if I swear falsely I am a Mohammedan like you . " What religion stands highest in moral results if not Christianity ? Yet the slave-trader belongs to Christendom as well as the saint . If we say that Christendom was not truly represented by the slaves in the hold of John Newton 's slave-ship , but only by the prayers which he read every day , as he narrates , in the cabin ,  --  then we must admit that Buddhism is not to be judged merely by the prostrations before Fo , but by the learning of its lamaseries and the beneficence of its people . The reformed Brahmoes of India complain that Christian nations force alcoholic drinks on their nation , despite their efforts ; and the greater humanity of Hindoos towards animals has been , according to Dr. Hedge , a serious embarrassment to our missionaries .

" Instead of virtues , " said Cadwallader Colden , writing as early as 1727 , " we have taught them vices that they were entirely free from before that time . " The delegation from the Society of Friends reported last year that an Indian chief brought a young Indian before a white commissioner to give evidence , and the commissioner hesitated a little in receiving a part of the testimony , when the chief said with great emphasis , " Oh ! you may believe what he says : he tells the truth : he has never seen a white man before ! " In Southey 's Wesley there is an account of an Indian whom Wesley met in Georgia , and who thus summed up his objections to Christianity : " Christian much drunk ! Christian beat man ! Christian tell lies ! Devil Christian ! Me no Christian ! " K What then ? All other religions show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe till it tries to exclude the rest . Test each sect by its best or its worst as you will , by its high-water mark of virtue or its low-water mark of vice . But falsehood begins when you measure the ebb of any other religion against the flood-tide of your own . There is a noble and a base side to every history . The same religion varies in different soils . Christianity is not the same in England and in Italy ; in Armenia and in Ethiopia ; in the Protestant and Catholic cantons of Switzerland ; in Massachusetts , in Georgia , and in Utah . Neither is Buddhism the same in China , in Thibet and in Ceylon ; nor Mohammedanism in Turkey and in Persia . We have no right to pluck the best fruit from one tree , the worst from another , and then say that the tree is known by its fruits . I say again , Christianity has , on the whole , produced the highest results of all , in manners , in arts , in energy . Yet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's only hope seemed to be in the superior strength and purity of pagan races . " Can we wonder , " wrote Salvian ( A.D. 400 ) , " if our lands have been given over to the barbarians by God ? since that which we have polluted by our profligacy the barbarians have cleansed by their chastity . " L At the end of its first thousand years , Christianity could only show Europe at its lowest ebb of civilization , in a state which Guizot calls " death by the extinction of every faculty . " The barbarians had only deteriorated since their conversion ; the great empires were falling to pieces ; and the only bright spot in Europe was Mohammedan Spain , whose universities taught all Christendom science , as its knights taught chivalry . Even at the end of fifteen hundred years , the Turks , having conquered successively Jerusalem and Constantinople , seemed altogether the most powerful nation of the world ; their empire was compared to the Roman empire ; they were gaining all the time . You will find everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak Christendom seemed against them in the middle of the sixteenth century ; and Lord Bacon , yet later , describes them in his " Essays " as the only warlike nation in Europe , except the Spaniards . But the art of printing had been discovered , and that other new world , America ; the study of Greek literature was reviving the intellect of Europe , and the tide had begun to turn . For four hundred years it has been safe for Christendom to be boastful , but , if at any time during the fifteen hundred years previous the comparison had been made , the boasting would have been the other way . It is unsafe to claim a monopoly of merit on the basis of facts that cover four centuries out of nineteen . Let us not be misled by a hasty vanity , lest some new incursion of barbarians teach us , as it taught the early Christians , to be humble . We see what Christianity has done for Europe ; but we do not remember how much Europe has done for Christianity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away Greek literature and Mohammedan chivalry and the art of printing ; set the decline of Christianity in Asia and Africa against its gain in Europe and America ,  --  and whatever superiority may be left is not enough on which to base exclusive claims . M The recent scientific advances of the age are a brilliant theme for the rhetorician ; but those who make these advances are the last men to ascribe them to the influence of any exclusive religion . Indeed it is only very lately that the claim of superiority in civilization and the arts of life has been made in behalf of Christianity . Down to the time of the Reformation it was usual to contrast the intellectual and practical superiority of the heathen with the purely spiritual claims of the church . " The church has always been accustomed , " says the Roman Catholic Digby , " to see genius and learning in the ranks opposed to her . " " From the beginning of the world , " said Luther , " there have always been among the heathens higher and rarer people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence and skill in all arts , than among Christians , or the people of God . " " Do we excel in intellect , in learning , in decency of morals ? " said Melancthon . " By no means . But we excel in the true knowledge and worship and adoration of God . " N Historically , of course , we are Christians , and can enjoy the advantage which that better training has given , just as the favored son of a king may enjoy his special advantages and yet admit that the less favored are equally sons . The name of Christianity only ceases to excite respect when it is used to represent any false or exclusive claims , or when it takes the place of the older and grander words , " Religion " and " Virtue . " When we fully comprehend the sympathy of religions we shall deal with other faiths on equal terms . We shall cease trying to free men from one superstition by inviting them into another . The true missionaries are the men inside each religion who have outgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to meet the men of other religions upon the common ground of Theism . In Bishop Heber 's time , the Hindoo reformer Swaamee Narain was teaching purity and peace , the unity of God , and the abolition of castes . Many thousands of men followed his teachings , and whole villages and districts were raised from the worst immorality by his labors , as the Bishop himself bears witness . But the good Bishop seems to have despaired of him as soon as Swaamee Narain refused conversion to Christianity , making the objection that God was not incarnated in one man , but in many . Then came Ram Mohun Roy , forty years ago , and argued from the Vedas against idolatry , caste , and the burning of widows . He also refused to be called a Christian , and the missionaries denounced him . Now comes Keshub Chunder Sen , with his generous utterances : " We profess the universal and absolute religion , whose cardinal doctrines are the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man , and which accepts the truths of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The movement reaches thousands whom no foreign influence could touch ; yet the Methodist missionaries denounce it in the name of Christ , and even the little Unitarian mission opens against it a battery of a single gun . It is the same with our treatment of the Jews . According to Bayard Taylor , Christendom converts annually three or four Jews in Jerusalem , at a cost of $20,000 each . Nothing has been more criticised in the course of the Free Religious Association than its admission of Jews as equals on its platform ; and yet the reformed Jews in America have already gone in advance of the most liberal Christian sects in their width of religious sympathy . " The happiness of man , " says Rabbi Wise , in speaking for them , " depends on no creed and no book ; it depends on the dominion of truth , which is the Redeemer and Savior , the Messiah and the King of Glory . " O It is our happiness to live in a time when all religions are at last outgrowing their mythologies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together " the luxury of a religion that does not degrade . " The progressive Brahmoes of India , the Jewish leaders in America , the Free Religious Association among ourselves , are teaching essentially the same principles , seeking the same ends . The Jewish congregations in Baltimore were the first to contribute for the education of the freedmen ; the Buddhist Temple , in San Francisco , was the first edifice of that city draped in mourning after the murder of President Lincoln ; the Parsees of the East sent contributions to the Sanitary Commission . The great religions of the world are but larger sects ; they come together , like the lesser sects , for works of benevolence ; they share the same aspirations , and every step in the progress of each brings it nearer to all the rest . For us , the door out of superstition and sin may be called Christianity ; that is an historical name only , the accident of a birthplace . But other nations find other outlets ; they must pass through their own doors , not through ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground of God 's providing , which bears no man 's name . The reign of heaven on earth will not be called the Kingdom of Christ nor of Buddha ,  --  it will be called the Church of God , or the Commonwealth of Man . I do not wish to belong to a religion only , but to the religion ; it must not include less than the piety of the world . If one insists on being exclusive , where shall he find a home ? What hold has any Protestant sect among us on a thoughtful mind ? They are too little , too new , too inconsistent , too feeble . What are these children of a day compared with that magnificent Church of Rome , which counts its years by centuries , and its votaries by millions , and its martyrs by myriads ; with kings for confessors and nations for converts ; carrying to all the earth one Lord , one faith , one baptism , and claiming for itself no less title than the Catholic , the Universal ? Yet in conversing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modernness , and scanty numbers of their church . It is the superb elder brother of our little sects , doubtless , and seems to have most of the family fortune . But the whole fortune is so small ! and even the elder brother is so young ! Even the Romanist ignores traditions more vast , antiquity more remote , a literature of piety more grand . His temple suffocates : give us a shrine still vaster ; something than this Catholicism more catholic ; not the Church of Rome , but of God and Man ; a Pantheon , not a Parthenon ; the true semper , ubique , et ab omnibus , the Religion of the Ages , Natural Religion . I was once in a foreign cathedral when , after the three days of mourning , in Holy Week , came the final day of Hallelujah . The great church had looked dim and sad , with the innumerable windows closely curtained , since the moment when the symbolical bier of Jesus was borne to its symbolical tomb beneath the High Altar , while the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beating of cheeks in the darkness , while ghostly processions moved through the aisles , and fearful transparencies were unrolled from the pulpit . The priests kneeled in gorgeous robes , chanting , with their heads resting on the altar steps ; the multitude hung expectant on their words . Suddenly burst forth a new chant , " Gloria in Excelsis ! " In that instant every curtain was rolled aside , the cathedral was bathed in glory , the organs clashed , the bells chimed , flowers were thrown from the galleries , little birds were let loose , friends embraced and greeted one another , and we looked down upon a tumultuous sea of faces , all floating in a sunlit haze . And yet , I thought , the whole of this sublime transformation consisted in letting in the light of day ! These priests and attendants , each stationed at his post , had only removed the darkness they themselves had made . Unveil these darkened windows , but remove also these darkening walls ; the temple itself is but a lingering shadow of that gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us God 's pure air , and teach us that the broadest religion is the best .
