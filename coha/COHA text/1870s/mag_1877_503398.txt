VOL . XXJV. - SEPTEMBER , 1877. - No. 3 . HAS THE DAY OF GREAT NAVIES PASSED ? IN 1805 one of England 's greatest admirals , after hearing Fulton explain his torpedo plans , and thinking of the encouragement these plans had received from the Prime Minister , exclaimed , " Pitt was the greatest fool that ever existed , to encourage a mode of war which they who commanded the sea did not want , and which if successful would deprive them of it . " The revolution in naval warfare thus foreshadowed is close at hand indeed , it is not too much to say that the complete paralyzation of the vast navy of France during the late war with Germany , through the fear of German torpedoes , shows that this revolution has already taken place , and that the days of ocean supremacy and of great navies have passed away . This momentous change has been brought about by the submarine torpedo , an instrument which assails the ship from underneath , below the water line . The consequence is that no thickness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her protection . This potent instrument of destruction has added far more to the power of the defence than it has to the power of attack ; and in this light , like some other instruments for human destruction , it may be looked upon as a peace-maker . So long as sails were the only means for the propulsion of ships , England , by reason of her superiority in trained seamen , maintained a position superior to any other power ; but the screw propeller slowly made its way as the universal naval motor , and gradually this great advantage was lessened . When the iron-clad came upon the scene , it was followed , in less than fifteen years , by a change in naval ordnance , which is summarized by stating that in 1860 the heaviest naval gun weighed some seven tons , using a charge of sixteen pounds of powder and a shot of less than seventy pounds ; whereas the largest naval gun now weighs one hundred tons , and throws a projectile of no less than two thousand pounds , with a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to the shot one hundred-fold greater , while the shot itself weighs a ton , against a comparatively few pounds seventeen years ago . To mount and handle such monster ordnance has taxed the resources of engineers , and such is the extent of the almost innumerable mechanical contrivances which enter into the construction of the latest European monitors , that such sailors as were the pride and strength of Nelson 's fleets are almost as much out of their element in the present war machines as they would be if placed in the galleys which fought at Salamis and Actium . But while the Duilo , the heaviest of ' these floating gun carriages , as a monitor may be called , is still on the stocks , Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1877 , by ShELDON &amp; CO. , in the office of the Librarian of Congress , at Washington . 19 // so great has been the progress in submarine warfare-in attack under water , far below the armor-that the one hundred-ton guns of this Italian iron-clad , or the eighty-ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable against any harbor or roadstead than were the twelve-pounders of Nelson , or the eleven-inch smoothbores of Farragut in their day . It is said that one of the latest Italian or British monitors will cost , fully equipped , upward of $2,500,000 . Less than the cost of one of these ships would supply abundant submarine defences such as the skill of our engineers have produced to destroy a fleet of these monster iron-clads of a certainty , should they persist in an attempt to force an entrance through any of the channels leading to our great cities . Thus we see how important to us , with our small navy and extended sea-coast , is the development of the submarine torpedo-an engine which we can cause , to neutralize the greatest navies of the world , and all of them put together . " If we consider gunpowder as an instrument of human destruction incalculably more powerful than any that skill had devised or accident presented before acquiring , as experience shows us , a more sanguinary dominion in every succeeding age , and borrowing all the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall be appalled at the future prospects of the species , and feel perhaps in no other instance so much difficulty in reconciling the mysterious dispensation with the benevolent order of Providence . " Thus wrote the famous historian Hallam about that invention which far more than any other made the greatest change in warfare and in the destinies of nations . Much the same might with truth be said respecting modern submarine warfare , or in more popular phrase , the torpedo . Like gunpowder , the use of this instrument of destruction was long talked about before it took practical shape and became a vital factor in naval science . It was not until the overwhelming naval superiority of the Union aroused the Confederates to the consideration of some means of defence against this force , which traversed every river and sound in their territory , that this mode of defence , which has now transformed naval warfare , was actually given practical shape . The appearance of irondads , invulnerable to any artillery that could be brought against them , was another reason which caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote great attention to perfecting a means of enabling them to thwart their enemies . A brief account of the rise and progress of such an element in modern war as the torpedo is , before calling the reader 's attention to a description of the several systems that have been experimented with or adopted , will enable him to see how long a time it has required to bring a method of defence , apparently feasible on its face , to the full recognition of its powers . One of the chief reasons which prevented the earlier acceptance of the torpedo as a weapon of war was the almost universal feeling that its use would be barbarous and inhuman . It was thought to be , as Sir Howard Douglas said of horizontal shell firing from war vessels , " a merciless , barbarous idea , the object of which is to set fire to the ship at heart , and if possible blow her up . " John Quincy Adams stigmatized it as " cowardly , and no fair or honest warfare . " These are examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt*in Alden , United States Navy , in an official report speaking of the blowing up of the Tecumseh , with all on board , exclaimed , " Sunk by a torpedo ! Assassination in its worst form2 ' Passing by many propositions that have been made for destroying ships by exploding gunpowder beneath the water line and in contact with the bottom , some of these more than a century old , we come to Captain David Bushnell , an officer of the Revolution , who was the first to put the idea // of a torpedo into anything like practical shape . He devised a submarine boat , the plan of which he placed in 1787 before Thomas Jefferson , then minister at Paris . Bushnell made his first trial in 1776 against the flagship of Lord Howe , lying at anchor in New York harbor . The vessel narrowly escaped destruction . He also attacked the British frigate Cerberus , at anchor off New London , with a " drifting " torpedo ; the torpedo was captured and hoisted on board a schooner , where it exploded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Delaware with these " drifting " torpedoes , which had the appearance of kegs as they floated on the surface . The efforts made by the British to capture and destroy them with small boats are known in history as the " battle of the kegs . " The torpedo question now slumbered for twenty years , when it was taken up by Robert Fulton , the father of steam navigation , who revived the ideas of Bushnell , and attempted to introduce attack below the water line in the French navy . With a submarine boat in 1801 he blew up a launch in the harbor of Brest , which was the first instance of a vessel being destroyed by the explosion of gunpowder against the side below the water . Making no headway in France , Fulton went to England , where , supported by Pitt , he made many trials of his contrivances , and succeeded in experimentally destroying the brig Dorothea ; but his plans were finally rejected , and he came to America , where he was also given the cold shoulder , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in steam navigation , Fulton abandoned for ever his torpedo schemes . His connection with this subject , however , alone shows him to have been a man of genius far ahead of his time . His writings on submarine attack , read in the light of the present , are really prophetic . There is a grim humor in one of his letters , called forth by the determined and effectual oppo sition of Commodore Rogers : " I might be compared to what Bartholomew Schwartz , the inventor of gunpowder , would have appeared had he lived in the time of Julius C*esar , and presented himself before the gates of Rome with a four-pounder , and endeavored to convince the Roman legions that with such a machine he could batter down the walls and take the city ; a few catapults casting arrows and stones would have caused him to retreat ; a shower of rain would destroy his ill-guarded powder , and the Roman centurions would therefore call his machine a useless invention , while the manufacturers of catapults , bows , arrows , and slings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attempts are the last we hear of movable torpedoes , until the Confederates began the construction of steam launches , called " Davids , " arranged with a spar carrying a torpedo . Thirty years after Fulton 's day , however , Colonel Colt of fire-arm fame elaborated a system of anchored subjuarine mines to be fired by electricity . The Crimean war in 1855 was the occasion of the first application of these mines for harbor defence . Several explosions occurred under English frigates , but the charges were so small that no serious elTect was produced . But , as we have alrea*dy said , the real application of submarine warfare dates from the efforts of the Confederates during the late war . In October , 1862 , a " torpedo bureau " was established at Richmond , which made rapid progress in the construction and operation of these weapons until the close of the war in 1865 . Seven Union iron-clads , eleven wooden war vessels , and six army transports were destroyed by Southern torpedoes , and many more were seriously damaged . This destruction occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of war , and it is suggestive to think what might have been the influence on the Union cause if the Confederate practice of submarine warfare // had been nearly as efficient at the commencement as it was at the close of the war . It is not too much to say , respecting the blockade of the Southern ports , that if not altogether broken up , it would have been rendered so inefficient as to have commanded no respect from European powers , while the command of rivers all important to the Union forces as bases of operation would have been next to impossible . A brief record of the work of the Confederate torpedoes ought to be read by every one who wishes to comprehend the degree of development that submarine warfare had attained in this country so long ago as the close of the war . In the important naval victories of the Union during the early part of the war-Hat-teras , Port Royal , and New Orleans-no submarine defences were used by the Confederates , and the loss of life and damage to vessels on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of these vi@ories . Evidently it was a keen appreciation on the part of the Confederates , brought a by these successive defeats , of their utter inability , by artillery or any other means then recognized , to prevent the Union fleets from entering every harbor where there was water enough to float them , which drove them to take up the submarine torpedo . The first authenticated appearance of this machine was on February 18 , 1862 , when our fleet endeavored to force its way into the Savannah river , above Fort Pulaski , in order to assist in the reduction of that stronghold . The fleet encountered at the mouth of the Mud river a system of anchored floating torpedoes , strung across the river and moored so that they were visible at low water . They were arranged to be fired by ordinary friction primers , and the lines attached to them were to be pulled by passing vessels . Fortunately they were discovered and removed ; otherwise a disaster would almost certainly have followed an attempt at passing them . The next discovery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore Rowan , who , in ascending the Neuse river , found some thirty torpedoes , each containing two hundred pounds of powder . These were arranged like those in Mud river , and they were in like manner discovered and removed before they had done any damage . These incidents in torpedo history were before the " torpedo bureau " at Richmond had begun to make its efforts felt . The next case on record , the blowing up of the United States iron-clad Cairo , made our naval officers begin to think that the new mode of defence was worthy of a good deal more attention than they had before been willing to admit that it deserved . The Cairo , one of the heaviest iron-clads on the Western rivers , was blown up near the mouth of the Yazoo December 13 , 1862 , by a torpedo fired by electricity by an , operator on shore . The water covered her decks in less than three minutes , and she was a total loss . In reporting this disaster to the Navy Department Admiral Porter said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding out of the ninny hundreds planted by the rebels ) , that officers have not felt that respect for them to which they are entitled . " The next case on record is the attempt , which nearly succeeded , to blow up the monitor Montauk , February 28 , 1863 . This powerful iron-clad , with her twentyton guns , and armor impervious to any artillery then in service , and which , under the command of the gallant Worden , ran boldly under the guns of Fort McAllister , and destroyed the Confederate privateer Nashville , then lying under its protection , in a few days after , and about one thousand yards below the scene of her victory , had a torpedo exploded under her bottom . Fortunately the charge was insufficient to do more than make a small fracture in the bottom , the leak through which was speedily stopped , and the vessel beached. // The Confederates now began to have confidence in the power of their torpedo system . On the other hand , the Union officers became more cautious in entering channels commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of their new weapon that he is reported to have said that he " placed more reliance on one torpedo than on five teninch columbiads , " for preventing the Union fleet from occupying Charleston harbor . The Navy Department began to be anxious for the success of the monitors , and applied to Captain Ericsson for some apparatus which would free the channel of Charleston harbor from these submarine mines , and permit the iron-clads to effect an entrance without encountering any more serious obstacle than the fire of the Confederate guns , to which they were impervious . Ericsson accordingly designed a " channel scraper , " which consisted essentially of a torpedo about twenty feet long and ten inches in diameter , holding some seven hundred pounds of powder . This was suspended , about fifteen feet under water , from a heavy wooden raft , which fitted on the bow of a monitor . It was to be pushed ahead , to be exploded by coming in contact with torpedoes or any other obstacle . " The novelty of the invention , a dread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as upon friendly vessels in the event of a collision , prevented its use , and the attack was finally delivered without it . " As everybody knows , Dupont 's attempt to enter Charleston harbor was a complete failure , the commanders of the monitors not daring to pass by the forts , but stopping in the focus of their fire to be battered with their guns . This apparatus was afterward suspended , at a depth of thirteen feet , from a raft at the bow of a monitor , and fired ; the explosion of seven hundred pounds of powder was hardly perceptible on the iron-clad , " while a body of water was displaced and thrown upward to a height of from forty to fifty feet . " During Dupont 's disastrous attack the heavy iron-clad New Ironsid*s , belonging to his fleet , came very near being destroyed , as the following letter , found on a Confederate vessel , afterward captured , explains : The Ironsides was for an hour directly over our big torpedo . Mr. , the operator , says that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have placed her better ; but the confounded thing would not explode , owing to some defect in the insulation of the wires . It is said that the Confederates were so angry that they charged the operator with treachery , and he narrowly escaped punishment , but fortunately for him the true cause ( as just stated ) was found out . This torpedo was described as " a large boiler containing upward of two thousand pounds of powder ! " The Union fleets escaped further disaster from the submarine foe until July 22 , 1863 , when the powerful ironclad Baron de KaIb was blown up on the Mississippi river . The report says that as she " was moving slowly along she ran foul , of a torpedo , which exploded and sunk her . There was no sign of anything to be seen . While she was going down another exploded under her stern - . - Many of the crew were bruised by the concussion , but no lives were lost . - . - The usual lookout was kept for torpedoes , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster on the record is the exploding of a torpedo nearly under the gunboat Commodore Barney , in August , 1863 , as she was passing down the James river with General Foster on board . As the Barney was running at full speed the explosion took place just astern . She was careened violently , and a great volume of water was thrown on board , washing overboard some twenty of the crew , many of whom were drowned . The vessel was nearly wrecked , and the failure to utterly destroy her was explained by a defect in the electrical apparatus , which prevented the charge // from being fired at the proper moment . The torpedo now began to attract universal attention . The newspapers *ere filled with the most exaggerated statements respecting the danger of the Confederates destroying our fleets and rcndering the blockade of the Southern coast ineffective . The " infernal machinations of the enemy " were continually talked about , and submarine warfare was spoken of as an " unchristian mode of warfare . " But the necessities of the situation changed all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States of the employment of this " infernal weapon . " The Confederates with great energy and secrecy had constructed on the Roanoke river an iron-clad ram , afterward called the Albemarle . The iron vessels in that locality were inadequate to contend with this iron-clad , and the water at the inlet at Hatteras was insufficient to allow our iron-clads to cross . In this emergency , September 13 , 1863 , Secretary Welles wrote to the Secretary of War , suggesting " an effort on the part of the army to surprise and destroy the rebel ram or of obstructing the river by torpedoes to prevent her descent . " In consequence of this letter the United States placed torpedoes at the mouth of the Roanoke river . The enemy , finding this out , captured the party in charge of them , and immediately attacked the Union fleet of eight powerful gunboats , and put them to flight . In about a year after this event Admiral Farragut , who , sailor like , never lost an occasion to ridicule both iron-clads and torpedoes , was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potency of the Confederate system of submarine warfare . He said : " I am placing heavy iron cutters on the bows of my vessels , and shall also have torpedoes , to place me on an equality with my enemy if he comes outside . No doubt he will have the advantage of me inside , as they are planting them every day . We can see them distinctly when at work . " A lull now came in the series of disasters to the Union fleet from the submerged monsters of the enemy . No vessel was blown to pieces until April , 1864 , when the transport Maple Leaf was sent to Davy Jones 's locker by a torpedo in the St. John 's river . Next in order came the Eastport , a powerful iron-clad , one of the vessels of the unfortunate Red river expedition . Her hull was so smashed by the explosion of one of these subaqueous devils that it sank , a worthless wreck . Respect now took the place of the levity with which torpedoes had been treated by naval officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of Admiral Lee ( May , 1864 ) , who , with General Butler , commanded the expedition which was despatched up the James river to cooperate with General Grant , who was then , by way of the Wilderness , operating against Richmond , and who , without the possession of this river as a base , would have been brought to a stand or taken at a serious disadvantage . One of these general orders of the Admiral , which goes into great detail , relates wholly to the precautions to be observed by their vessels to avoid being blown up by the submarine enemy . Notwithstanding these precautions , one of the most terrible disasters of the war occurred on the 6th of May . The Commodore Jones , carrying seven guns and one hundred and twenty-seven men , was passing up the river dragging for torpedoes , when she came over a torpedo exploded by electricity , containing two thousand pounds of powder . " A single stake planted upon the opposite bank served to indicate-by the vessel being in line with his station and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . With the patience of a spider watching for its victim , it is stated that for thirteen months this officer remained waiting for the opportunity to explode this mine with effect . " At length the Union fleet advanced , the Commodore 's vessels being the second in the // HAS THE DAY OF GREAT NAYIES PASSED ? advance . The Commodore Jones , car* rying seven guns and one hundred and twenty-seven men , was permitted to pass the mine in safety , the explosion being held to blow up the flagship ; but an order having been passed from the deck of the next vessel , and heard by the operator on shore , for the Commodore Jones to fall back and drag for torpedo wires , the operator exploded his mine , when in backing down she came directly over it . In an instant the doomed vessel seemed by spectators to be lifted into mid air ; then a huge column of water was seen to pass right through her hull . When the noise of the explosion and the foaming water had subsided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fragments , split fine enough for kindling wood , floating on the surface . An episode of the war , which took place shortly after this disaster , is very instructive as showing the mingled feelings of fear and contempt with which our admirals regarded the torpedo . Early in the summer of 1864 , the army of General Grant , after the bloody repulse at Cold Harbor , was being pushed forward for the south side of the James river . The command of this river was absolutely necessary for the movements of this mighty army ; without it the campaign would have ended in disaster . The Confederates were preparing to dispute its possession by means of submarine attack . Anchored and floating torpedoes , " Davids " as well as fire rafts , were prepared for use against the large river fleet in the river , then commanded by Admiral Lee . General Butler , at the head of the army of the James , became alarmed at the threatening preparations of the enemy , and urged upon the Admiral the necessity of obstructing the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infernal contrivances . To this the Admiral stoutly objected , saying that he was unwilling to do anything which could be construed " as implying an admission of superiority of resources on the part of the enemy . " The commander of the army of the James urged that the " military necessity of holding the river was overwhelming , " and General Grant agreeing with him , the Admiral reluctantly consented , and obstructions were placed so as effectually to prevent the Confederates from coming down , or the Union fleet from passing beyond them up the river ! a striking example of the power of the new engines . We must be brief in what remains to be said regarding the war record of the torpedo . In August , 1864 , the formidable iron-clad Tecumseh , belonging to Admiral Farragut 's fleets , while attempting to pass the defences in Mobile bay , was destroyed by a torpedo , which exploded directly beneath the vessel , making a large hole in the bottom . She sank so quickly that seventy of the officers and crew went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next disaster was the blowing up of the large gunboat Otsego , while attempting to ascend the Roanoke river . She was totally destroyed . The gunboat Bazely in going to her assistance was blown to fragments by a torpedo exploding under her bottom . On the 15th of January , 1865 , the monitor Patapsco , while on picket duty in Charleston harbor , was destroyed by a floating torpedo , notwithstanding she had her " torpedo fenders " down , and had a netting stretched around her . The diabolical mine burst near the forward part . " A man in the windlass room saw a flash and heard a sound like that of a shell near him . The lamp was extinguished . " In the pitch darkness the rush of water was heard , and down went the illfated craft , carrying sixty-two officers and men with her . All this happencA in a fraction of the time it takes to relate it . This man by some miracle found himself afloat in the water . What a spectacle was this  --  a vessel whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success1877. 299 // fully resisted the heaviest guns then used in war , against whose armor the heaviest artillery was of no avail , sunk in an instant by a contrivance which probably did not cost five hundred dollars ! A premonition that the days of great navies were passing might well alarm the naval mind . The glories of the quarter deck were fast departing , and the magnificence and pomp of naval display were giving place to the labors of grimy mechanics operating infernal machines . From this time to the close of the war , which was now rapidly approaching , Admiral Dahlgren 's flag steamer , the Harvest Moon , the double-turretted monitors Milwaukee and Osage , the gunboats Rodolph , Sciota , Ida , and Althea , were in rapid succession destroyed by torpedoes , killing and wounding many officers and men . But the terrible war record of the torpedo is not completed . The Confederates , encouraged by their success in the use of torpedoes as means of defence , began to carry the war into Africa by employing it as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is now known as the " spar " torpedo . These spars were from twenty-five to thirty-five feet in length . They were carried suspended , pivoted over the bows of small cigar-shaped boats , some thirty feet in length , and nearly submerged . On the extremity of these spars was placed a canister containing from fifty to seventy pounds of powder , and provided with a contact exploder . On approaching the enemy 's vessel the end of the spar carrying the torpedo was lowered beneath the surface of the water far enough to strike the foe well below the water line . It was then rammed against her side , the contact producing the explosion . These were more difficult to manage than the defensive , moored , or floating torpedoes . They were more complicated , and owing to the deficiency of the Confederates in mechanical resources , were rudely built . Still they did considerable execution , and spread consterna tion among the Union fleets . The name " David " was given to these boats-an appropriate name , as the comparison is obvious between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clad in armor of brass . The name was generically adopted , and such craft were always afterward called " Davids . " The capture of the iron-clad Atlanta by the monitor Weehawken was the first evidence that the Confederates had adopted an offensive torpedo . The Atlanta had a huge torpedo suspended from an iron outrigger , some forty feet beyond her bow , and it was only the terrible blows she received from the fifteen-inch gun of the Weeb awken , which caused her surrender before she could get within striking distance , that prevented her from destroying that monitor . This is a lesson that should impress itself on our naval authorities , as it shows the folly of using vessels larger than mere launches for torpedo purposes unless they are proof against the enemy 's shot . It points out that either the tiny " Davids " copied from the Confederates -- which now form part of every navy-must be employed , or else invulnerable vessels , properly called torpedo carriers , with which to defend roadsteads and harbors from hostile fleets . The first attempt with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at anchor off Morris Island , in front of Charleston , on the night of October 5 , 1863 . The official reports state that about nine o'clock a scarcely discernible object was observed rapidly approaching . It was challenged in the usual manner . To this hail there was no reply but a rule shot , which killed the officer of the deck . Simultaneously with this shot a fearful explosion occurred close alongside , and the Ironsides quivered from stem to stern ; her decks were deluged with water . For a moment it was supposed that her side had been blown in , and that the sea was rapidly filling her ; but , as was afterward ascertained from Confederate sources . // the explosion occurred prematurely . The torpedo , which contained sixty pounds of powder , was not in contact with fhe hull , and no extensive damage was effected . But the bold attempt and the narrow escape of this powerful vessel , whose battery had long been a terror to the Confederates , made a deep impression on Admiral Dahigren . He at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard against future attacks from these dreaded engines . Booms , nets , and many other contrivances were hung around the vessels , and commanding officers were ordered to keep the small boats continually rowing about the ships at night , on a sort of picket duty . For a long time there was very little sleep in this squadron . Every unusual sound was taken as a sort of premonitory sign that the vessel was about to be blown up . Those who have not been in ships exposed to the attacks of such infernal weapons , can have but little idea of the ceaseless strain on one s nerves from the time darkness sets in until daylight appears . A stand-up light , when the enemy is met face to face , is as nothing compared with this constant dread of an ignominious end from a stealthy and unseen foe . The next trial with a " David " was more successful . On the night of February 17 , 1864 , the Housatonic , a splendid sloop of war , carrying a heavy battery , while at anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , was attacked and sent to the bottom by one of these pigmy devils . The report says something was discovered in the water " about one hundred yards from and moving toward the ship . It had the appearance of a plank moving in the water . It came directly toward the ship ; the time from when it was first seen till it was close alongside being about two minutes . The cable was slipped , engine backed , and all hands called to quarters . About one minute after the Da- vid ' was close alongside , the explosion took place , the ship sinking stern first , " and the torpedo boat going down also . In this case the " David 's was supposed to have been sunk by the volume of water which came on board from the explosion of her own torpedo . As a consequence of this first disaster the Admiral suggested to the department " the policy of offering a large reward of prize money for the capture or destruction of a David - not less , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that to us . " A similar attempt was shortly after made on the United States steamer Memphis , in North Edisto river , South Carolina , but the " David " being discovered too soon to safely make the attack , turned about and disappeared . Shortly after this a " David " assailed the frigate Minnesota , at anchor at Newport News , nearly in the same position where the Cumberland was sunk by the Merrimac . About two o'clock in the morning the " David , " sling in hand , was seen approaching . The usual hail was given , but no attention was paid to it , and the determined foe came straight on and exploded his torpedo under water near the frigate 's side . The " David " then turned about and " escaped without loss , under the fire of heavy guns and musketry " from the Minnesota . Fortunately , owing doubtless to the inadequacy of the charge-which was but fifty-three pounds of powder-the frigate was not sunk , but her hull received such extensive damage that the resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last attack made with a " David " by the Confederates was on the 19th of April , 1864 , when an attempt was made against the huge frigate Wabash , on the blockade , well to seaward , off Charleston harbor . Fortunately the enemy was discovered at considerable distance . The scene is thus graphically described by Captain Barnes , late United States Navy : " The frigate slipped her cable and moved ahead at full speed , directing the fire of her broadside and a fusilade of musketry in the supposed direction // of her diminutive assailant . The darkness , the small size of the target , and the confusion of the moment , prevented any accuracy of aim , and the David ' returned in safety to Charleston . A curious and novel spectacle  --  a mighty frigate , with her tremendous armament , and crew of seven hundred men , absolutely put to flight by four men in a little boat of less than a ton burden , whose only armament was a few pounds of powder extended on a spar ahead of her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to adopt a similar mode of warfare . This was done by constructing a number of steam launches , fitted with condensing engines , which were nearly noiseless , a necessary feature in order that they might steal unawares upon the foe . These launches were fitted with spar and torpedo almost similar to the apparatus used by the Confederates . It was with one of these United States " Davids " that the gallant Cushing blew up the Confederate iron-clad Albemarle , which had long had her own way in the inland waters of the North Carolina coast. * We thus bring to a close the record of the use of the torpedo during our civil war . And what a record it is ! Think of the destruction this infernal machine effected , and bear in mind that its use came to be fairly understood , and some system introduced into its arrangement , only during the last part of the war . During a period when scarcely any vessels were lost , and very few severely damaged by the most powerful guns then employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used from these small and slender craft of the " David " species , is the inability of carrying a charge sufficient to do much more than rupture the outer skin of the later iron-clads . The space between the inner and outer skins of these vessels is divided into numerous cells , and the hull within is partitioned off by bulkheads ; hence in order to destroy one of these monsters by breaking up the hull sufficiently to sink them , a very large quantity of explosives must be fired in contact with the bottom . The effect of firing such a charge from a " David " would without doubt destroy her and all on board . actual war , we find this long list of disasters from the use of this new and in the beginning much despised comer into the arena of naval warfare . But it required just such a record as this to arouse naval officers to ask themselves the question , " Is not the day of great navies gone for ever ? " If such comparatively rude and improvised torpedoes made use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror among the Union fleets , what will be the consequence when skilful engineers , encouraged by governments as they never have been before , diligently apply themselves to the perfecting of this terrible weapon ? The successes of the Confederates have made the torpedo-which before was looked on with loathing , a name not to be spoken except contemptuously-a recognized factor in modern naval warfare . On all sides we see the greatest activity in improving it . As the main purpose of this article is to show how it came to pass that this weapon , which nearly seventy years ago the genius of Fulton , with no encouragement , urged upon our government , came to occupy the foremost rank as a means of naval defence , and has taken from the most powerful irondads in the world the ability to assail seaports or occupy roadsteads that are defended by the new champion , only a brief statement can be given respecting what has been done since the close of our war in the way of invention and improvement . Torpedoes are classed under one of two heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have naturally been taken up by the army , and they are relied upon by the U. S. Engineer officers as the chief means of closing the channels leading to our sea-port cities , against the heavy monitors and iron-clads of the European powers . These submarine mines , as they should properly be called , consist of magazines of explosives , which in future will doubtless consist of some of the nitro-glycerine preparations or gun-cotton , // rather than gunpowder , anchored in the channels , and arranged to meet the requirements of depth of water , strength of current , etc . In order to shut up a channel , several lines of yr ps of mines will be placed across it . These groups , to borrow an engineering phrase , will " break joints , " so that it will be impossible for a vessel to pass through a channel so defended without coming in contact with a nest of these mines . If the water is not too deep , the mines will be placed on the bottom , with a float attached , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be struck by the bottoms of passing yeseels . The stationary mines now adopted by our Engineers are in all cases fired by electricity ; the batteries , conducting wires , and circuit closers being so contrived that , if desired , contact with a vessel 's bottom will explode the mines . But as such an arrangement would close the channel against all vessels , friends as well as foes , an ingenious arrangement has been adopted , so that the operator on shore , by the simple movement of a telegraphic key , can so fix the mine that it will explode either by contact or at will . When the latter mode is used , and it is observed that a vessel is within the zone of destruction-which has been previously marked out and laid down upon a chart before the eye of the operator-he will , at the proper moment , touch a key and explode the mine . Of course these mines are placed with great precision , and their position is laid down on charts made for the purpose ; so that with suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels respecting their proximity to the mine is 8upposed to be instantly and accurately known . This is a very meagre outline of this branch of the subject ; but space warns us that we must close with a brief mention of the next class-movable torpedoes . Since the time of Bushnell , nearly one hundred years ago , until a recent date , the efforts of inventors to make a movable torpedo have been in the way of attempts at the construction of a submarine boat ; that is , a boat that can be held at a given distance below the surface , and there propelled by men inside of it-some means being supposed to be provided for keeping a supply of fresh air . With such a boat the inventors have aimed at fixing a torpedo to the bottom of the enemy while at anchor . Every attempt at a contrivance of this sort , including the one for which the United States paid some *15,000 , has turned out a complete failure . Perhaps it will not be too rash to say that for the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect any practical results to be reached by efforts in this direction . It is now couceded by the best authorities that a movable torpedo , to be a practical weapon , suited to the exacting conditions of actual warfare , must have , 1st , high speed ( not less than twelve knots ) ; 2d , must progress under water at any desired depth ; 3d , must carry an explosive charge equal in force to not less than 500 lbs . of gun cotton ( which is equal to about one ton of gunpowder ) ; and 4th , must be under the complete control , with respect to steering , of the officers directing it , from the time it is put in motion until it strikes the side of the vessel attacked . Some naval men go so far as to say that unless these exact conditions are met no amount of iagenuity and mechanical skill will make movable torpedoes anything more than mechanical curiosities . On the contrary , meet these conditions , and the defence is supplied with as terrible a weapon as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now nearly completed , under the direction of the Chief of Ordnance of the Navy , with the Ericsson tubular-cable pneumatic torpedo , show that these apparently almost unattainable requisites will probably be satisfied ; and that our Navy De
