txt Upon our arrival here three Weeks ago we found a revolution in progress , but its proportions were by no means great , and there appeared to bo very little uneasiness felt hero on account of it . Jaclemel , quite an important seaport on the south Side of the island , bad been seized by the insurgents , but they appeared to ho making no efforts to extend their territory . The Havtian Navy , consisting of two small vessels , had been emit around to capture the place , and an American mimed Gordon bad been employed to fire their guns . That ' did come to an engagement , but it amounted to nothing , for the ships were afraid to go near the insurgents guns and they finally withdrew . Soon after wo heard that other districts in the South had declared in favor of the revolution , and about the same time there was an uprising in the North , beginning at Cape Haytien . Forces started out from there to make the conquest of the island , and in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marks , two ports to the north-west of this place , but on the same bay ; and about a week ago we heard through couriers that the insurgents were marching noon this place with a force of about five thousand men . The people here - there in span pathy with the revolutionary movement , but did not dare express their views because of the summate way the President Dominque had of shooting all who were even suspected of complicity with the rebels , but they were only awaiting their opportunity . Tho Vice President , Rameau , was considered the virtual head of the Gdvernment , and the people hated him especially . ? Quite a number of people were shot upon suspicion , and some wore to have been shot on the 0th , among them a Gen. Alexis Noir , but a diplomatic delegation waited upon the President , and upon their solicitations their lives were spared . There has been considerable fear here for some time that the President would be unusually severe when reduced to the last extremity , and oven the foreign residents were alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister and others , but the presence of foreign men-of ? war in the harbor held the Government , in chock . On the 13th Alexis Noir was liberated , and at the same time it was reported that the President would abdicate on Sunday , the 16th , but matters were somewhat precipitated by circumstances , The Secretary of State declared for the insurgents and took refuge with the American Minister Saturday morning . Early in the afternoon of the same day Domingo() and Rameau sent their personal effects with a guard of soldiers down on to the dock , intending to send everything on board of a vessel in the harbor and follow themselves and , sail for Aux Cayes , w whence they came , and where they expected strong support and to be able to make a stand against the revolution , Among other property were a hundred boxes , each con. taining 11,000 in American silver , and so marked . While the soldiers wore guarding this , word was carried to them that the General in command of the Department of Port-an-Prince had declared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of " Down with Dominque , " and commenced breaking open the boxes with their bayonets or picking them up and throwing them into the dock with all their force . Much of the money was lost overboard in the general scrambling , and the rest was carried off by the soldiers . Clothing and everything was degreyed or carried away . Some of the boxes contained a largo quantity of paper-money in sheets , which was to have ? been put in circulation in Aux Cayes . This the soldiers showed their contempt for by tearing to pieces and carrying it off on the points of their bayonets , mattering it through tho streets . The soldiers then made a raid upon one of the principal banks , where there was seine of the Government money , and robbed it of all they could get . About that time intelligence was received that the insurgents were close outside of the city . Upon this the people became Infuriated , and an uncontrolled mob of soldiers and citizens , all armed , rushed about hero and there through the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . At the solicitation of the President some of the foreign diplomatic corps went out to meet the insurgents and ask an armistice of twenty-four hours ; but before their return the President saw there was no one to support him , so be sent for Alexis Noir and hauled down his flag from the palace and ail the forts , where the white flag was soon hoisted to show that they had surrendered . Dominque and Rameau attempted to reach the French Consulate foe.proteetion , and the former was successful ; but the latter , although accompanied by the French Consul , wee shot when within a stone 's throw of the Consulate . As soon as he was killed the people became brave and commenced firing upon him from alt sides , evincing the greatest brutality , and they did not cease firing at his body till about noon the next day . They would not allow the body to be removed , but treated it in the most brutal manner , kicking it and spitting upon it , and his eyes were torn from their Becket ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and hold them np tor the crowd to see . About dark , Saturday evening , tho French gunboat Saud sent her , armed boats ashore and carried off to the ship President Dominque , his eon. and one or two others . Tho French ond Spanish Consuls escorted Dominque down to the boats to protect him from the mob ; but alley were not entirely successful , for he was badly clubbed with the butt of a musket , and so much injured that it was thought he could not live , and it was reported the next day that he was dying . I hear that lie is out of all danger now . The Sand sailed this morning for St. Thomas . It seems strange that the mob did not kill Dominque as well as Reiman , but they regarded the latter as the one responsible for all acts that had dia. pleased thorn , and the former as an unbectio old man , too weak to harm them , and therefore they did not care for his blood . Saturday night there was no semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of a mob which recognized no controlling power . It roamed through the city seek ? lug the blood of every eupoosed enemy to the people , and all who thought themselves in danger took refuge at the Consulate 's . A. few days before a Gen. Lorette , who had been quite popular with the people , escaped from too city and joined the advancing insurgents . It was thought that he might exorcise a controlling authority over the mob , and the English minister , who like the rest was anxious to see order restored , induced Lorette to come into the city . ' le was not received as was expected . The mob thought he was going to declare himself President , and they were not ready for that yet , so they turned against him . Lorette took refuge in his own house and was besieged there , and finally shot through a window , but he first shot two of the mob , hoping to drive them away . His body was at once dragged from the house , and treated with as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people fired upon it even after it had been thrown into its grave . Gen. Alexis Noir , who had been liberated from prison but a few days before , thought the mob would listen to and support him . Ho declared him ? Belt ' in military command until a Government could be established ; but the people set upon him and he fled to the United States Legation . A. provisional Governinent was established later In the day by a committee ; with Riviera at its head . The revola. tion hero was effected by a mob of soldiers and citizens . The insurgents did not come in till yesterday morning , and then they met with little greeting . The condition of affaire is by no means settled wet . There is no harmony between the Northern and Southern factions , and each of the principal leaders wants to be the President . The successful one must kill all the rest , or they will revolt and overthrow him . Their revolutions are always successful and accomplished without much bloodshed , but five have bean killed thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child killed accidentally at Jacniel . Cowardice , unreliability , and brutality have characterized the people through the whole of it . There has not been a single shot fired when a man was In a position to make any defense , and Lorette was the only armed man they attempted to kill . Although Rameau was unarmed the mob did not dare show themselves against him until ho was first shot by some one who was concealed . It la just announced that the Southern far , I Lion has agreed to abide by the decisions of the Revolutionary Committee . There is one thing that will tend to unite all parties , and it is believed that it will succeed . Canal was exiled about a year ago , and it was in his interest that they rebelled In the North . He Is also very popular throughout the whole island . Ho arrived here . last night from Kingston , intending to go to Cape Haytien , but finding that the Government had been overthrown he landed here this morning and received a most cordial welcome from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people through the streets , first to the church where some form of service was held . The people hero are very superstitious , and think such a beginning is necessary to a successful ca. reer . Canal appears to be the best man in the country . All the rest have robbed the treasury of all they contd . He has served as Senator , but would accept no remuneration whatever from the Government for his services . Although he has been ' an important political character for Borne time , he has never taken any part in any of the butchery , or in any brutality whatever . He appears also to have sound ideas of progress and liberal views . It is thought that he will be made Provisional Governor until the next meeting of their Parliament , which , according to the Constitution , must elect the President . There seems to be no doubt of his election by that body , and I presume they would not dare to elect any one else when the popular feeling is so , strong in his favor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , so they are very good friends . They met in the street this morning and had unite an affectionate embrace , and the crowd of about live thousand people shouted , " hurrah for the American Minister . Hurrah for Mr. Bassett . " I think I can safely say now that the revolution is over , and peace will bo restored throughout the land ; but I ca n't say I expect much prosperity among this people , for there may be another revelation within a year , and all that I have described be repeated .
