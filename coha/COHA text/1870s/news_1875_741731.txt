txt We presume that there will be a good deal of political didactic writing on the result of the Maine election , and the . public will doubtless accept with proper appreciation the solid blocks of wisdom to which they will be treated . The facts are , however , very simple , and whatever instruction there is in them is not far to seek . The two parties were not very distinctly divided from each other either by candidates or principles . Botha candidates were well known , both had excellent characters , both had been in the Army , and were in sympathy with the strong patriotic feeling of the State , a " fact which had a negative rather than a positive value . The platforms of the two parties were not very different , and ou the important national issue of the finances there was no essential difference whatever . The Democratic managers , encouraged by the successes with which their party has met irk other States , made a very . active canvass , and . succeeded in calling out a heavy vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvass was also an energetic one , but it lacked the stimulus of recent successes . The Democrats added about thirteen thousand to their vote of last year . The Republicans only added.about six thousand . The result is that the Republicans carry the State by a majority some seven or eight ? thousand less than last , year . For the advantage which the Democrats have thus gained , whatever it amounts to , they have in part to thank the superior " discipline " of their rank and file , and in part their avoidance of every distinctive feature of their party policy as declared in other States . So far as the result in Maine throws any light on the probable course of elections in other States this Fall , or next year , it may be said to show that the disgraceful and . dangerous policy of the Democrats in Ohio and Pennsylvania has not yet disgusted the party elsewhere , and that the decent portion of the party does not despair of , getting the upper hand of the knaves and fools . In that feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doomed to disappointment . The Maine election shows in the same way that the Republicans of the State are not yet aroused to a clear understanding of the grave responsibility which rests upon them , and of the fearful dangers with which the country is threatened and . which Republicans must meet . Yet it would . be the rashest folly to infer from the present temper of a very small fraction of the Republicans of Maine ( an addition of one vote in ten would have entirely changed the complexion of things ) that our party is not fully able and willing to take up the task which circumstances have given to it to perform . But , whatever any of us may think of the incidental election of Monday , there is no room for question or hesitation as to the duty of . all citizens who value the good name and prosperity of their country . That duty is to strengthen the hands of the Republican Party in every possible way , that it may prove a sufficient shield against the hifmihation and peril which threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to a policy of dishonesty and communism . It has , in the great States of Ohio and Pennsylvania. , fallen completely under the control of a baud of greedy and unprincipled demagogues , who are engaged in teaching the people the lessons of theft , spoliation , and public rascality . These men are proclaiming the possession of property as a crime , and inciting the popular passion against those who have Ient their money to the Government as oppressors whom it is right to rob . They are describing the distress and want which have followed in the train of overspeculation and . paper money as the effect of a vast conspiracy on the part of the possessors of capital to enrich themselves at the expense of the laborer . They come before the country with the sponge in one hand and the torch in the other . With the one they would wipe out the solemn.promises of the nation and blot its good . name for genera tions , and with the other they would kindle a conflict of the poor with those who are not poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only those whose poverty is temporary and . the result of mistbrtune , but those who are willfully poor  --  the idle , the vicious , and the desperate . Our country has as yet known absolutely nothing of the evils with which this gang of reckless and hungry agitators threaten it . But it has escaped them by the happy immunity of youth , by ample natural resources , an industrious and substantially homogeneous population , and the influence of traditions of wisdom and honor which came down to it from the sagacious founders of the Government . But these are privileges which can not last . The country is no longer the young and healthy nation it once was . It is no longer free from a large percentage of bad and ignorant voters , and the system of the fathers isdestined to severe strains from such conflicts of interest and passion as that which now seems to be impending . While the great Democratic Party presents the spectacle of an active and hardy set of leaders putting the whole country in peril to gratify their mean ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dares oppose these leaders . Prominent men who must know to what the party is drifting , and who despise the rascals who have got control of it , sit in silence and see the bad . work go on . This is the most pitiful and the most alarming feature of the situation , for it gives infinite encouragement to the repudiationists , and it leaves honest men - without hope so far as the Democratic Party is concerned . Everything , therefore , depends on the Republican organization , and , as we have said , all honorable men should strengthen it to the utmost . In this State it has a sound . platform and good candidates . It only needs carefully selected legislative and local candidates , and such honest work as every good citizen ought to contribute . Then it will go into the great contest prepared to do its best . If it win , it will be well for the country . If it lose , it will try again , for its cause is one that can not be lost , and the sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
