txt Self-helpfulness is a virtue which grows ; mu:loner among civilized men the further ine moves toward the West . The nations if Europe regard English vigor with envy , Ind Englishmen look upon Yankee energy with mixed feelings of hostility and admieition . It is very fitting , therefore , that Western men should show that self-helpulness and energy , which is in some sort their birthright , even when they come to teal with matters of greater delicacy than Ale products of farm labor or the dry goods trade . It has been said that artists languish in the United States , owing to the want art patrons and a ready market for their work . For the most part they are thrown apon their own resorirces , their friends and Families seldom doing anything for them , ind although not many in number , yet they ire frequently unable to live comfortably . Small as the supply of art works is , yet the market is overstocked . Moreover , the artsts whose works are iu most demand are . ; onerally inferior lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little work if the hard , brain-tasking variety on each popular picture . That is the way of the world ; the man who will make a Little go a great way is sure to be paid better for that extended . little than he who condenses much into a work that is to live . There is no u30 wailing over this state of affairs ; it is what exists , and artists ought to make the best of it . But do they ? It can hardly be said that as a class they do . Their tendency is to seclude themselves in their studies and continue the old round of oil painting after oil painting , with only now and then , by way of r lief ; a sketch in water colors . Some of them dabble in literature a little . with the very natural feeling that knowledge and an acquaintance with another art will tend to broaden their eharacters , and so make them better workmen in their own profession , but when the wolf is at the door , a man returns soon enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their paintings or statues alone which bring them in any direct return , and so they get quickly back into the old ruts . And yet it is only necessary to look about one to see a thousand points on the exteriors as well as in the interiors of our houses and public buildings where the want of an artistic taste has left ugliness and incongruity . Not only are buildings put up without the slightest reference to the street in which they stand , but the outer and inner walls almost always lack harmony , or , mity , or whatever other word may ' serve to express the sense of completeness which we perceive in buildings designed and executed . by men competent for the work . The facades are either intensely monotonous , or crop out hero or there into Some erratic design , which may be in itself good , but by standing alone becomes ridiculous .

Now , it certainly would be to the advantage of builders , whether private or corporate , to get all the advice they can before , exposing their individual tastes in architecture and house . decoration to the criticism of the City , and to that end ? to employ artists as well as architects as counsel . There is no surer sign of semi-civilization than the readiness shown by many people to dictate what should and what should not . go to the decoration of a house . There is a taint of barbarism in the presumption which leads men who have never given thought to art or the harmonies of visible objects , to consider themselves . competent judges of what is beautiful and . graceful . Our poor young artists who now brood gloomily over their pro4ects in unfrequented studios should be summoned to give the country the benefit of whatever genius they may possess or art learning they may have amassed , by offering them tasks in a somewhat different lino of art , but one which it would do them all good to pursue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much apt to be fine gentlemen to work as the old Italian artists used . This may be true of a few , but of the many it surely is not . Lot them have the benefit of the offer , and let the offer be liberal as to limits ; for to hamper au artist with vexatious limitations is to stifle his talent . The internal decorations of houses afford the first and easiest field . for artists . who can not exist on the proceeds of " high art . " Next come public buildings , like churches , theatres , and halls , all of which are now decorated . in violation of the first principles of color ; and good taste . The employment for artists of exquisite taste or bold ingenuity is , indeed , without a limit , should the public once realize that the same sum of money artistically expended will purchase many times the amount of pleasure to be expected under the present order of things .
