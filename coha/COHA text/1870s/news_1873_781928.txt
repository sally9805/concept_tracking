txt After a lapse of twenty-four years , Rochester promises to become once more a centre of attraction to investigators of spiritual , phenomena . In 1849 , what is known as modern spiritualism may be said to have had its chief start in that historic city . The Fox sisters , after having " raised " the spirit of a murdered peddler from the malerious atmosphere of a cellar at Hydesville , Arcadia Township , Wayne County , N. Y. , proceeded to Rochester , as they asserted , by spiritual advice , and opened public sefances at Corinthian Hall . A committee of respectable citizens Was appointed to inquire as to file nature of certain noises which weie beard by the audience , and a report was rendered to the effect that , although a thorough inquiry had been . instituted , it had been found impossible to discover the source of the noises . This was accepted by thousands of persons at the time as proof positive that the spirits of the departed might , under favorable conditions , return to earth and do unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The FOXES , having thus cunniugly acquired a reputation fur wonderful " mediumship , " were enabled . to visit the principal cities ' La the country , and to draw a considerable amount of gold into their purses . A few years subsequently , mysterious noises were heard at it house in the vicinity of Rochester , but they were soon forgotten , the cariosity and astonishment produced by the Foxes elsewhere having proved the greater attraction . But now that the fame of these " girls " has been so thoroughly eclipsed by other " mediums , " the American Spiritualists may find it profitable to make use of some " manifestations " which are said to be at present in full operation at the residence of Mrs. GASCOIGNE , in the towneland of Chili , within a short distance of Corinthian Hall . We have it on the authority of the Rochester Union that Mrs. GASCOIGNE , " with her family , consisting of herself , her son , twelve years of age , and . several smaller children , have been driven to the very brink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during many months . " Some years ago , it appears that the mysterious mansion at Chili became the property of a person , the initial of whose name has only been published by the Union . Ho made it his residence , and , for a reason which has not been explained , took Mrs. GASCOIGNE into his service as housekeeper . In this capacity she continued down to about five or six months ago , when Mr. A. died , leaving her in possession of his effects . For a few nights after his demise , " the stillness of death reigned . " Scarcely au entire week had passed , however , when Mrs. GASCOIGNE 'S repose was disturbed by " the familiar footsteps " of the deceased . At first , she , of course , thought it was fancy , and tried to compose herself to sleep , but it was no use . ; She distinctly heard the creaking of the door of the room which had formerly been occupied by A. , and presently she was still farther alarmed . by the bed-slats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Then she heard what seemed to her like sounds that would be produced by a person engaged in the act of putting on tight boots . As soon as the last stamp was given to the floor a noise was made as if somebody was ascending the stairs . On the following night the manifestations were more varied . The chairs and tables in the parlor were tossed about rather freely , and at certain intervals " a single whistle , of an apparently human voice , shrill and distinct , " was heard by every person in the house . Mrs. GAScOIGNI : adds , that night aff-r , : r night a little dog which had . belonged to the deceased responds to the whistle in the most eager manner , but never gives evidence of seeing anything . o these singular pranks , doubtless lest th should become menetopens , the " ghost " very often adds the more exciting one of snatching the bedcovering , with lightning quickness , from the almost paralyzed body of the twelve-year old GASCOIGbTE . Four men , neighbors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the mystery . One of the number states positively that a form , which in every respect resembled Mr. A. in the flesh , on one occasion passed before him as he lay upon a lounge . He immediately jumped up , and had jes ; begun to propound a number of questions , when " the spectre , if such it were , soon disappeared . " Mrs. GASCOIGNE remains in the house by the advice of counsel , for the purpose of making good her claim to it in law . Otherwise , she declares she would prefer to gather her children around . her , and take shelter in a barn . Surely facts like these can not be allowed to go iminvestigated . The peddler 's depressed spirit in the Arcadian cellar , as material for an " excitement , " was as nothing compared with the whistles , clothes-snatchings , and boot-pullings of this Chili ghost . The opportunity afforded for ' a revival at Rochester of the scenes of 1849 is decidedly tempting , and we shall be very much surprised if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a kindly service to a much-afflicted family to relieve it of the presence of one of the most trying of annoyances.
