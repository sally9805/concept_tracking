txt The American colony in Paris has been in commotion during the past few days on account of the arrival of Gen. Grant , and business of various kinds has been generally neglected . The splendid reception that the ex-President had in England roused the pride of his compatriots here , and we felt that it behooved us to do something to make his stay in the French capital as agreeable as possible . Gov . Noyes , our new Minister , called a meeting at his house to devise ways and moans , and it was there resolved to pay the ex-President such honors as we could . At this meeting there wore some 50 of the leading ? members of the American colony present , and after some talk it was resolved to let Gen. Grant go the round of his official visits , and then give him a national banquet at the Grand Hotel . A committee was formed under the Presidency of Consul-General Torbert , and it met at the Consulate the next day to arrange the details of the reception of our illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to arrive in Paris , and at 6 o'clock nearly 100 Americans were assembled at the Northern Railway station . As I have already remarked , the General had a magnificent reception in England , and the public took so much interest in his movements that several of the journals wanted to send correspondents to accompany him upon the Continent . With characteristic modesty the offer was declined . But numbers turned out to see the General and his family off by the train . The managers of the South-eastern Railway gave him a special train , and ordered up the company 's special yacht Victoria to take him across the Channel . The French Northern Railway Company gave him a special train to Paris , and the time-table was so arranged that there should be only eight hours between London and Paris . The French Government sent orders to its functionaries to receive the General , and to provide for his safety and comfort on the voyage . In a word , they were instructed to pay him the distinguished honors accorded to royalty , less the grand ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little after 6 o'clock the principal members of the American colony here met Minister Noyes at the Gare du Nord , and on arriving there we learned that the ex-President 's train had been delayed by the rough weather upon the Channel . The sea was running high , and the Victorlawas not pressed in a way to render the trip uncomfm-table . The French Government was very polite and attentive . Police agents were sent up in squads to keep the way open , and from time to time we received telegrams to note the progress of the train . The station was specially illuminated and carpeted , a carpet being spread out of doors to the carriage in waiting , and a special saloon was given for the reception . Awaiting the arrival in the station I remarked the following persons : Admiral Worden , Mr. Partridge , Minister to Brazil ; Gen. J. Meredith Read , Charge d'Affaires at Athens ; Dr. Johnstone , Mr. Woods , Mr. Winthrop , Mr. Munroe , Vice-Consul Hooper , Dr. Evans , Dr. Crane , Dr. Warren , Mr. Ryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others whose names do not occur to me at this moment . Minister Norris was accompanied by Henri Vignaud , second Secretary , and by Consul-General Torbert . There were also present several members of the French and English press . One of the latter . Theodore De Grew , of the Figaro , could not keep his eyes off of Admiral Worden , and continued to look at him all the time we were waiting . He had been reading a history of our war , and regarded him as a real hero . He frequently remarked that it did his eyes good to look upon a brave man like that . There was present also an old Confederate officer who helped to save the Admiral when he was brought into Montgomery at the beginning of the war , when a vast crowd , excited by the report of Gen. Bragg regarding Fort Pickens , wanted to hang him to the , nearest lamp-post . Probably no man was ever nearer his death than Capt . Worden at that moment . A few men who knew what the old officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its course , and tolling them that Capt . Worden would surely be hanged the next day . It was with the greatest difficulty that he was got off to the County Jail , where he remained for seven months . He never knew what a few men did for him in that hour of passion , but , having suffered for seven months in a miserable hole , he can not yet speak of the affair without indignation . History has since told us that the whole thing was a mistake , which came from a hasty charge made by Gen. Bragg based upon a suspicion which had no sort of foundation . That night he was to attack Fort Pickens , and , finding Slemmer prepared for him , ho too hastily inferred that Papt . Worden had carried the news of the intended attack into Fort Pickens . It was while ping over these reminisences of our war that time slipped rapidly away , and presently we heard that the train was signaled . The gas in the station was turned up , a squad of agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in citize &s; dress came forward to direct their movements . When the train entered the station Minister Noyes went forward to meet Gen. Grant , and Consul-General Torbert offered his arm to Mrs. Grant . The Americans present ranged themselves in two lines in the saloon , Mrs. Grant , Mrs. Sartoris , and Jesse Grant passed rapidly through to the carriages , but the ex-President was stopped and greeted with three rousing ' cheers . He shook hands with those present , calling several of his personal friends by name , , and then went out to his carriage . Mr. Leon Chotteau was there offering a magnificent bouquet to Mrs. Grant . A large crowd of French had gathered about the door , and as the ox-President went out one single voice , weak and squeaky at that , cried " Vive la Republique I " " Ah ! there 's the man that stole my umbrella , " cried a person by my side , thereby raising a laugh in which the Police agents joined most heartily . G en . Graut and his family were welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marshal De , and by M. De Molard , Grand Master of Ceremonies , and then taken to the Hotel Bristol , where apartments had been engaged for him . Yesterday at 2 o'clock he called upon the President of the French Republic , and , as etiquette demands , the Marshal immediately returned the visit by calling at the Hotel Bristol . In a day or two he dines with the Marshal , and on Monday next the . Marshal 's Ministers dine with Gen. Grant at the house of Minister Noyes . The dinner will be followed by a general reception which will be attended by the Marshal . The committee formed the other day have resolved to give Gen. Grant a banquet at the Grand Hotel , and it will probably take place on the 6th of November . As vet the political situation here remains undefined , and we have no idea what is to be the result of the present struggle . The Republicans pretend that the Marshal has nothing to do but to resign ; the Conservatives pretend that no can not resign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880 . The situation is becoming more and more difficult , and I fancy that is beginning to see the error of the course he was counseled to pursue by De Broglie and his other advisers . The Republicans are now giving their attention to the Sena torial elections , for the purpose of reducing the majority in the Upper Chamber , if possible . Should they succeed in doing this , they will be armed with the very weapons that were prepared for the overthrow of the Republic . Very little can be said before the supplementary eleccions are over , but when the exact state of affairs is known the serious combat will begin . It is said that M. Gr6vy going to accept the mandate of the electors of the Ninth Arrondissement of Paris , since that brings him more en evidence than if he simply represented the electors of Dole , a small circumspection fin the Jura . M. Gainhetta is actively preparing for the campaign , and has just made another speech which is very disagreeable for the Ministers . The question now under consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who do not belong to either the Senate or the Chamber , but it seems to be surrounded by serious difficulties . The project for governing with the majority in the Senate has not yet been fully abandoned . I have just come from a meeting of the committee appointed to arrange the details of Gen. Grant 's reception , and it was decided that a grand banquet should be given him on the 6th of November , in the large saloons of the Grand Hotel .
