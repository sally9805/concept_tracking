txt There are very few American readers of newspapers and novels who have not a tolerably distinct notion of what constitutes a French marriage , , and there is a still smaller number whose notion is not in the main erroneous . Most of us have an idea that a French marriage is entirely a matter of cool calculation , that its obligation sits lightly on both parties , that to the man it is a question of more or less dowry , and to the woman a license to go into society , and that it leads but seldom and in a very slight degree to unity of feeling , deep affection , common happiness or mutual development of character . Those who have any considerable acquaintance with French literature admit occasional suspicions that there are some elements of error in this conception , and those who by rare chance have seen the institution in actual operation have been glad to correct , as far as they could , the persistent mistakes of their countrymen . But the general impression remains , and it would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American school-girl that it is not unimpeachably correct . A volume to which we have already had occasion to refer with praise  --  the essays on French Home Life , republished from Blackwood  --  if it obtains anything like the circulation it deserves , will go a great way toward substituting a definite and reasonably accurate notion of a French marriage for the one that now prevails . Accordingto the careful and well-informed writer of these essays , French marriages are , indeed , matters of calculation to a degree quite incomprehensible to American minds , and especially to the minds of American candidates of the gentler sex for the honors and responsibilities of wedded life ; but the results are very different from those of which we carry about so complacent a judgment . The immediate parties to a marriage in France , the husband and wife that are to be , ' take but a small part in the inception and completion of the arrangement . Custom and law forbid that they shall do otherwise . These powerful forces combine to place the affair in the bands of relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often been racked by the sufferings of lovers between whom the decrees of custom have raised almost insurmountable obstacles . But in France these obstacles are not only as great , but greater ; so great , iu fact , that no one thinks of trying to overcome them . And if this were not so , the inexorable terms of the Code Napoleon puts resistance out of the question . By its porvisions , the consent of parents must be had , though the lovers be sixty years of age ; or , failing this consent , the parents must be shown to be dead , or they must have been proven in court , by a tedious process . to have interposed unreasonable objections . The real parties to the original negotiations are , therefore , the parents and the relatives of tho parties to the actual relation . The considerations which are weighed by the negotiators are very numerous and varied , and among them the existence of anything like passionate or even decided attachment between the young man and the young woman is of the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two families , the prospects in life of the young man , the temper of each , their health , their habits  --  especially those of the man ? these are the eminently practical concerns that claim the attention and determine the course of the contracting powers . To most of us this seems unnatural , arbitrary , a defiance of the central facts of human nature , and only an invitation to an indefinite and interminable amount of unhappiness . But the habit of many generations has given it the force of second nature ; what we are used to regard as unconquerable impulses have become subdued and fitted to it ; an innate lightness and contentedness of spirit help the nation to regard it with equanimity ; and , after all is said and done , the testimony is very strong that it results in frequent marriages , happy homes , extraordinary conjugal fidelity , and ninny of the most desirable and most fortunate elements of married life . We would not be understood as saying that the French mode of arranging marriage causes these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be introduced in America to-morrow , nothing is more certain than that it would lead to many abuses and much misery . We only desire to call attention to the fact that it works as it does in France . On this point the testimony of the author to whom we have already referred is quite explicit . " The French , " he says , " are , indoors , a contented nation ; their marriages , as a whole , present enviable results . " , They ( the husband and wife ) generally . come together ; in the origin , without much passion or indeed much love ; the conditions under which their marriages are arranged make that fact easily comprehensible ; but love does grow up between them in nearly every case , and they end by feeling for each other an attachment quite as real , as thorough , and as deep as we find in countries where other systems are in use . It is far from easy to discover really unhappy marriages in France . " " The testimony of society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward each other in France than they are in other lands , in no way indicates any multiplicity of failures . " " The marriage tie is vigorously felt in France ; husbands and wives cleave there to each other , and do not now seek for illicit joys , whatever some of them may have done in days gone by . " On one principal point only our author 's testimony is adverse . French marriages , he says , are relatively childless . In Germany the birth-rate is 1 in 25 . In England it is 1 in 30 . In France it is only 1 in 9 , and it is decreasing . A hundred years ago , when the population was but two-thirds what it now is , the - births were as numerous . Among the lower classes this is the result of prudence . " Ii fast , " says the French peasant , with a philosophy worthy of MILL and . MALTHUS , " ii fast faire /a soupe avant de faire Z'enfant . " But ' no such motive can apply to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the revolution . This is a subject it is not easy to discuss intelligently . The facts , however , are indisputable , and every one can form his own theory in explanation of them .
