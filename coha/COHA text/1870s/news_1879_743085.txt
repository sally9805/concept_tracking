txt The estimate made by the Committee - on Ways and Means of the Darien Canal Congress of the rate of toll which might be reasonablS , charged for the use of this water roadway when completed , seems , in view of the rates of freight which have for a few years past been paid for sea transportation , toObe excessively high . The committee starts out with the supposition that 6,000,000 tons.per annum will pass through the canal , and . that by charging three dollars per ton , a gross income of $18 , - 000,000. can be obtained . We have no means of definitely knowing how the sum total of usage has been arrived at , but presume that it includes a very considerable portion of the carrying trade between Europe and the Eastern United . States and . the west coast of North and South America , Australia , and , to a certain extent , China and Japan , transportation which is now chiefly done by sailing vessels , but which may in time be partially taken by steamers . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a canal at Panama could be made of benefit each year to this volume of trade . But having established this fact , the more important one remains of determining the extent of benefit which each class is to receive , and how . much they can afford to pay for it . In coming to a conclusion on this subject the Ways and Means Committee made a very serious mistake , and though this appears to have been corrected by the Committee on Commerce , the fact that such blunder was made indicates that many ( . ) f those who are active in this matter have but a superficial knowledge of the great trade movements whose currents they are proposing to change . It is true that the rates of freight have been exceedingly low for three or four years past , and that in time there is strong probability of an improvement ; but in making estimates in an undertaking of this magnitude , it is by far the safest way to base one 's calculation at a low level rather a high one . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Means gauged the income of the canal on what must have been an era of more than ordinarily high freights ; and as matters now stand , put what would be to the bulk of commerce a prohibitory tariff on the use of their proposed improvement . The gains that the canal would offer ocean commerce vary considerably when the different routes are taken into account . For instance , the short cut would be of much more benefit to a steamer going between Liverpool and San Francisco than to one going between Liverpool and Valparaiso , and the same would hold . true in a less degree of sailing vessels , though with these the influences of the trade winds have to be considered . no less than , the question of distance . Now , if the gain in time is only slight , and the toll excessive , it is not at all probable that the canal will be used . Again , the character of 1 the ? cargoes is something which ought to enter into the calculation . The owner of a cargo of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have his goods landed at their port of destination in one-third . less time than is now required to make the trip ; and a similar unwillingness would . probably be exhibited by the shippers of grain from California and Australia , and of nitrate and guano from Chili and Peru . Now , merchandise of this kind forms much the larger part of the 6,000,000 tons per annum which it is supposed will pass through the canal ; but in order to draw it in this direction the canal toll must be placed at a point which will allow the ship-owner to make a saving in the present cost of sailing his vessels . If his ship contained a cargo of tea or any commodity whose freshness made it especially desirable , every day saved might bo of great value ; but in the other cases the gain is merely in the interest on the worth of ship and cargo , and . in the wages and provisions of the crew , and on a steamer in the cost of extra coal , for the port charges and stevedores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long or a short one . As , on an average , the gain will not be more than one-third in , time , by using the canal rather than the circuitous routes now followed , it is evident that the toll charges should not bear a larger proportion than this to ; the freight money received . for transporting the merchandise . If this ratio is maintained , the canal can hardly be said to be an advantage to the ship-owners ? and shippers , as they would make fully as much without it as with it . But in the scale of toll prepared by the Ways and Means Committee this , limit has been greatly exceeded , as can readily be seen by comparing it with the current freight rates between the several great shipping points . A few illustrations will suffice to ex-plain-our position : Callao - to Europe , ( guano , ) $8 50 per ton ; England . to Callao , ( coal , ) $5 per ton ; England . to Valparaiso , ( coal , ) $4 50 per ton ; Australia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong to the United States , ( miscellaneous , ) $5.50 per ton ; England . to Hong Kong , ( coal , ) $3 50 per ton ; San Francisco to England , ( wheat , ) $8 50 per ton ? it has been $6 75 ; England to San Francisco , ( coal , ) $3 per ton ; New-York to San Francisco , ( miscellaneous , ) $8 per ton ; ; England . to Japan , ( coal , ) $375 per ton . These all are rates by sailing vessels ; but then a great part of ' the merchandise named , ; even if it was -. transported by steamer , would ' have . to go at nearly as low terms , in order to ' secure any profit to the shipper with prices as they now are ; and , what is more , the list we have enumerated includes a greater part , in tonnage , of the business which the canal is to benefit . It is hardly necessary to say that at a toll of $3 per ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes could . afford to use the short cut at the Isthmus . If the projectors of the canal can not find a profitable return in the enterprise at a less severe rate of taxation , it will'be prudent for them to postpone active operations until the further development of commerce gives them a broader margin in tonnage to work upon than that which they now possess .
