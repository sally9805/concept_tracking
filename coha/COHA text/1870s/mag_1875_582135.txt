unable up to this time to obtain from either Indians or white men any information which would give us a clue to any other trail down to the river . Having organized at Salt Lake City , we made our way southward to the valley of the Sevier River , and then up to the headwaters of that stream . There we were at the summit of a great water-shed . The Sevier itself flows north , and then westward into the lake of the same name . The Rio Virgen , rising near by , flows to the southwest , and enters the Colorado sixty or seventy miles below the Grand CaPon . The Kanab , also rising near by , runs south into the heart of the Grand CaPon . The Paria , which has its source in the same vicinity , runs a little south of east , and enters the river at the head of Marble CaPon . To the north-west of this point other streams , which run into the Colorado , have their sources . Forty or fifty miles away we reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of which stream is but a short distance below the junction of the Grand and the Green . The Pauns-a-gunt Plateau terminates in a point which is well marked by a line of beautiful pink cliffs . At the foot of this plateau on the west , the minute upper branches of the Rio Virgen and Sevier Rivers are dovetailed together ; the upper surface of the plateau inclines to the north-west , so that its waters roll off into the Sevier ; but from the foot of the cliffs , quite around this sharp angle of the plateau for a dozen miles , we find numerous springs , whose waters unite to form the Kanab ; and a little farther to the north-west the springs gather into streams that feed the Paria . Here , by the upper springs of the Kanab , we established a rendezvous camp , and from this point we were to radiate in a series of trips southward and eastward to the Colorado . Hamblin , the Mormon missionary , who had been among the Indians for more than twenty years , had collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were camped with us . They were certain that we could not make our way to the river , but promised to show us the spring and water-pockets , which are very scarce in that region , and to give us all the information in their power , so that we might examine the country for ourselves . Here we fitted up a pack-train for the transportation of our supplies , bedding , and instruments , and for a day or two we were engaged in preparation for a difficult trip . One day , while this general work of preparation was going on in camp , I took with me a white man and an Indian , and started on a climb to the summit of the Pauns-agunt Plateau . Our way for a mile or more was over a great peat-bog that trembled under our feet ; now and then a mule saiik through the broken turf ; and we were compelled to pull him out with ropes . Passing the bog , our way was up a gulch at the foot of the Pink Cliffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We soon left the gulch , and climbed a long ridge which winds around the right toward the summit of the great table . Two hours ' riding , climbing , and clambering brought us near the top . We looked below and saw clouds drifting up from the south , rolling tumultuously toward th' foot of the cliffs beneath us . Soon all the country below was covered with a sea of vapora billowy , raging , noiseless sea ; and as the vapory flood still rolled up from the south , great waves dashed against the foot of the cliffs , and rolled back toward the south , and another tide came in and was hurled back , and another and another , lashing the cliffs until the fog rose to the summit and coy ered us all .. There is a heavy pine and fir forest above , beset with dead and fallen timber , and we made our way through the undergrowth to the east . And then it rained ! The clouds discharged their moisture in torrents , and we made for ourselves shelters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiv ering by a great fire of pine logs and boughs , which we kindled , but which the pelting storm half extinguished . One , two , three , four hours of the storm , and at last it partially abated . During this time our animals , which we had turned loose , sought shelter for themselves under the trees , and two of them wandered away beyond our sight . I went out to follow their tracks , and came near the brink of a ledge of rocks , which , in the fog and mist , I supposed to be a little ridge . Here I looked for a way by which to go down . While I stood there , a rift was made in the fog below , by some current or blast of wind , and an almost bottomless abyss was revealed . I looked from the brink of a great precipice , more than two thousand feet high ; the forms below were half obscured by the mist , and all reckoning of distance was lost ; it seemed ten thousand feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Catching our animals , we returned to camp , and found that the little streams which came down from the plateau were greatly swollen . At camp , however , they had had no rain . The clouds which drifted up from the south , striking against the plateau , were lifted up into colder regions , and discharged their moisture on the summit and against the sides of the plateau , but there was no rain in the valley below . On the ninth of September we made a fair start from , the beautiful meadow at the head of the Kanab , and crossed the line of little hills at the head of the Rio Virgen , and passed to the south by a pretty valley , and at ten o'clock came to the brink of a great geographic bench  --  a line of cliffs . Behind us were cool springs , green meadows , and forest-clad slopes ; below us , stretching to the south until the world was lost in blue haze , was a painted desert-not a desert plain , but a desert of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinnacled rocks , naked rocks brilliant in the sunlight . By a difficult trail , we made our way down the basaltic ledge , through which innumerable streams here gather into a little river running in a deep cafion . The river runs close to the foot of the cliffs on the left-hand side , and the trail passes along to the right . At noon we rested , and our animals grazed on the luxuriant grass . After slow progress along a stony way , we camped at night under an overarching cliff , on the side of a beautiful glen or park , which is inclosed with high rocks on all sides except up and down the river . Here the river turns to the west , and our way properly was to the south , but we wished to explore the cafion that was below us .

Between the little river and the foot of the walls was found a dense growth of willows , vines , and wild-rose bushes , and with great difficulty we made our way through this tangled mass .

After our trip through the cafions of the Colorado the year before , on our way from the mouth of the Virgen to Salt Lake City , we could see these buttes as conspicuous landmarks from a distance of sixty or seventy miles , away to the south-west . These tower-rocks are known as the Temples of the Virgen . Having explored this caPon to its head , we returned to Schunesburg , arriving quite late at night .

From this point we sent a part of our Indians to the rendezvous camp , keeping two with us , // qwq it . To be out two days with only the water that could be carried in two small kegs was to have our animals suffer great ly . At five o'clock we came to the spot , and to our great relief found a huge water - pocket containing several barrels . Here we camped for the night . We were up at daybreak the next morning , for it was a long day 's march to the next water , so the Indians said . Our course was southward . From Pipe Spring we could see a mountain , and I recognized it as one I had seen the previous summer from a cliff overlooking the Grand CaPon . It was just behind this mountain that I wished to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which it is the highest , whom I wished to visit on the SOME Ov OUR INDIAN GUIDES . qwq gorges that flank the Grand Cafion ; in the multitude I could not determine whether the latter was in view or not . The memories of grand and awful months spent in their deep gloomy solitudes came up , and I lived that life over again for a time . I supposed before starting that I could get a good view of the great mountain from this point , but it was like climbing a chair to look at a castle . I wished to discover some way by which it could be ascended , as it was my intention to go to the summit before I returned to the settlements . I saw a steep and apparently impassable cliff stretching across the face of the mountain , and my problem was still unsolved . I hurried down again , sliding on the cinders , and making them rattle and clang . The Indians told us that we were to have a short ride that day , and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Our way was across spurs that put out from the great mountain as we passed it to the left . Up and down we went across deep ravines , the fragments of lava clanking under our horses ' feet ; now among cedars , now among pines , and now across mountainside glades . At one o'clock we descended into a lovely valley with a carpet of grass . We were told by Chu-ar that at some seasons of the year water runs through this valley from a spring above , but that he supposed it would be dry at this time ; yet he was not sure , and thought it possible that some of the Indians whom we were seeking might be found near the spring . So he rode on to find them , and to say that we were friends , for should we come without notice , they would run away , or propose to fight . Soon we saw Chu-ar riding at full speed , and heard him shouting at the top of his voice , and away in the distance were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other still ran on , and was soon lost to view . We rode up and found Chuar talking with the one who had stopped . It was one of the ladies resident in those mountain glades , whom we called Godiva . She told us that her people were at the large spring , that it was only two hours ' ride , and that her own good master , whom we had seen running so lustily , had gone on to tell // them we were coming . We sat down and ate our luncheon , and shared our biscuit with the lady of the mountain , who had been gathering seeds . Then we sent Chu-ar on to the village to apprise them of our coming , and to allay any fears they might have , keeping with us Shuts and Godiva . We rode along the trail another half-hour until we came to a pass between two high cinder-cones , of which I concluded to climb the one to the left . So , leaving the train to pursue its way , I rode my horse as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summit , from which I could see the Grand Cafion . I now knew where I was . I recognized some landmarks on its brink which I had observed the year before . Below me to the north-west the Indian village was plainly seen . They had a lovely little park for their home  --  a meadow in front , and a grove of tall pines behind . I could see the smoke curling up from their fires , and with my glass could watch the approach of the little train , and see the I ) eople coming out to meet it . The men unsaddled their horses , and an Indian boy took them out to graze . I descended the mountain , and reached camp at sunset . After supper , we put some cedar boughs on the fire ; the dusky villagers sat around , and we had a smoke and a talk . I explained the object of my visit , and assured them of my friendly intentions . Then I asked them about a way down into the cafion . They told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties could go down , but that no one had attempted it for a long time ; that it was a very difficult and dangerous undertaking to reach the " Big Water . " Then I inquired about the Shi-wits , the tribe that lives about the springs on the mountain-sides and cafion cliffs to the south-west . They said that their village was about thirty miles away , and promised to send a messenger for them the next morning . Having finished our business for the evening , I asked if there was a " tu-gwe-wa-gunt " in camp-that is , if there was any one present who was skilled in relating their mythology . Chu-ar said To-mor-ro-un-ti-kai , the chief of these Indians , the U-in-ka-rets , was a very noted man for his skill in this matter ; but they both objected , by saying that the season for tu-gwe-nai had not yet arrived . But I had anticipated this , and soon some members of the party came with pipes and tobacco , a large kettle of coffee , and a tray of biscuits , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , warmed up by this ( to them unusual ) good living , it was decided that the night should be spent in relating mythology . I asked To-mor-ro-un-ti-kai to tell us about the So-kus Wai-un-ats or OneTwo Boys , and to this he agreed . The long winter evenings of an Indian camp are usually devoted to the relation of mythological stories , which purport to give a history of an ancient race of animal gods . The stories are usually told by some old man , assisted by others of the party who take secondary parts , while the members of the tribe gather about and make comments or receive impressions from the morals which are enforced by the story-teller , or more properly story-tellers , for the exercise par- // qwq at which their wonder increased until the grandmother said , " Surely some strange thing is about to transpire . " Then the boy went to the heap where they had been placing the roots , and found that some one had taken them away , and he ran back , exclaiming : " Grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered : " No , my child . Perhaps some ghost has taken them off . Let us dig no more ; come away . " But the boy was not satisfied , as he greatly desired to know what all this meant ; so he searched about for a time , and at length found a man sitting under a tree , whom he taunted with being the thief ; throwing mud and stones at him until he broke his leg . The stranger answered not the boy nor resented the injuries he received , but remained silent and sorrowful ; and when his leg was broken he tied it up in sticks , and bathed it in the river , and sat down again under the tree , and beckoned the boy to approach . When the lad came near , the stranger told him he had something of great importance to reveal . " My son , " said he , " did that old woman ever tell you about your father and mother ? " " No , " answered the boy , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you see these bones scattered on the ground ? Whose bones are these ? " " How should I know ? " answered the boy .

One day , they were digging flag-roots on Then the stranger asked : MARY 'S VEIL-THE UPPER FALL OR PIER CREEK . // " Is your mother in yonder lodge ? " " No . " " Does your mother live on the banks of this river ? " " I do n't know my mother , " answered the boy . " I have never seen her ; she is dead . " " My son , " replied the stranger , " Stone Shirt , who killed your father , stole your mother , and took her away to the shore of a distant lake , and there she is his wife today . " And the boy wept bitterly ; and while the tears filled his eyes so that he could not see , the stranger disappeared . Then the boy was filled with wonder at what he had seen and heard , and malice grew in his heart against his father 's enemy . He returned to the old woman , and said : " Grandmother , why have you lied to me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she knew that a ghost had told all to the boy . And the boy fell upon the ground , weeping and sobbing until he fell into a deep sleep , when strange things were told to him . His slumber continued three days and three nights , and when he awoke he said to his grandmother : " I am going away to enlist all nations in my fight , " and straightway he departed . Here the boy 's travels are related , with many circumstances concerning the way he was received by the people , all given in a series of very extended conversations , which we omit . Finally , he returned in advance of the people whom he had enlisted , bringing with him Shin-au-av , the wolf , and To-go-av , the rattlesnake . When the three had eaten food , the boy said to the old woman , " Grandmother , cut me in two ! " but she demurred , saying she did not wish to kill one whom she loved so dearly . " Cut me in two ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe which he had brought from a distant country , and with a manner of great authority , he again commanded her to cut him in two . So she stood before him and severed him in twain and fled in terror . And lo ! each part took the form of an entire man , and the one beautiful lad appeared as two , and they were so much alike , no one could tell them apart . When the people or nations whom the boy had enlisted came pouring into the camp , Shin-au-av and To-go-av were engaged in telling them of the wonderful thing that had happened to the boy , and that now there were two , and they all held it to be an augury of a successful expedition to // the land of Stone Shirt ; and they started on was standing , that he might make a long their journey , detour about some hills and come upon him Now the boy had been told in the dream from the other side .

" and they answered his journey among the nations , and the they did not .

Shin-au-av walked on said , " I can see you ; you are doing " - so their right , and To-go-av on their left , and and so , telling them what they were doing , the nations followed in the order in which but they could not find him . they had been enlisted . There was a vast Then the rattlesnake came forth , declarnumber of them , so that when they were ing , " Now you know I can see others , and stretched out in line , it was one day 's journey from the front to the rear of the column . When they had journeyed two days and were far out on the desert all the people thirsted , for they found no water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had been deceived , and they cursed the One-Two . But the So-kus Wai-un-ats had been told in the wonderful dream of the suffering which would be endured , and that the water which they carried in the cup was only to be used in dire necessity ; and the brothers said to each other , " Now the time has come for us to drink the water . " And when one had quaffed of the magical bowl he found it still full , and he gave it to the other to drink , and still it was full , and the One-Two gave it to the people , and one after another did they all drink , and still the cup was full to the brim . But Shin-au-av was dead and all the people mqurned , for he was a great man . The brothers held the cup over him and sprinkled him with water , when he arose and said , " Why do you disturb me ? I did have a vision of mountains , brooks , and meadows of cane , where honey-dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drank also ; but , when he had finished , there was none left . Refreshed and rejoicing , they proceeded on their journey . The next day , being without food , they were hungry , and all were about to perish , and again they murmured at the brothers and cursed them ; but the So-kus Wai-un-ats saw in the distance an antelope standing on an eminence in the plain in bold relief against the sky , and Shin-au-av knew it was the wonderful antelope with many eyes which Stone Shirt kept for his watchman , FILLING ' S CASCADE-TN LOWER FALL ON PINE CREEK . and he proposed to go and kill it ; but To- qwq So the brothers were convinced and permitted him to go , and he went and killed the antelope . When Shin-au-av saw it fall he was very angry , for he was extremely proud of his fame as a hunter and anxious to have the honor of killing the famous antelope , and he ran up with the intention of killing Togo-av ; but when he drew near and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast for the people , his anger was appeased . " What matters it , " said he , " who kills the game , when we can all eat it ? " So all the people were fed in abundance , and they proceeded on their journey . The next day the people again suffered for water and the magical cup was empty , but the So-kus Wai-un-ats having been told in their dream what to do , transformed themselves into doves and flew away to a lake , on the margin of which was the home of Stone Shirt . Coming near to the shore , they saw two maidens bathing in the water , and the boys stood and looked , for the maidens were very beautiful . Then they flew into some bushes near by to have a nearer view , and were caught in a snare which the girls had set for birds . The beautiful maidens came up , and taking the birds out of the snare admired them very much , for they had never seen such birds before . They carried them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My daughters , I very much fear these are spies from my enemies , for such birds do not live in our land , " and he was about to throw them into the fire , when the maidens besought him with tears that he would not destroy their beautiful birds ; he yielded to their entreaties with much misgiving . Then they took the birds to the shore of the lake and set them free . When the birds were at liberty once more , they flew around amongst the bushes until they found the magical cup which they had lost , and , taking it up , they carried it out into the middle of the lake and settled down upon the water , and the maidens supposed they were drowned . The birds , when they had filled their cup , rose again and went back to the people in the desert , where they arrived just at the right time to save them with the cup of water , from which each drank and yet it was full until the last was satisfied , and then not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen Stone Shirt and his daughters . The next day they came near to the home of the enemy , and the brothers , in proper person , went out to reconnoiter . Seeing a woman gleaning seeds , they drew near and knew it was their mother , whom Stone Shirt had stolen from Si-kor , the crane . They told her they were her sons , but she denied it , and said she had had but one son ; but the boys related to her their history , with the origin of the two from one , and she was convinced . She tried to dissuade them from making war upon Stone Shirt , and told them that no arrow could possibly penetrate his armor , and that he was a great warrior , and had no other delight than in killing his enemies , and that his daughters also were furnished with magical bows and arrows , which they could shoot so fast that their arrows would fill the air like a cloud , and that it was not necessary for them to take aim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrows to the hearts of their enemies , and thus the maidens could kill the whole of the people before a common arrow could be shot by a common person . But the boys told her what the spirit had said in the long dream , that he had promised that Stone Shirt should be killed . They instructed her to go down to the lake at dawn , so as not to be endangered by the battle . During the night the So-kus Wai-un-ats transformed themselves into mice , and proceeded to the home of Stone Shirt , and found the magical bows and arrows that belonged to the maidens , and with their sharp teeth they cut the sinew on the backs of the bows , and nibbled the bow-strings , so that they were worthless ; meanwhile To-go-av hid himself under a rock near by . When dawn came into the sky , Tum-pwinai-ro-gwi-nump , the Stone Shirt man , arose and walked out of his tent , exulting in his strength and security , and sat down upon the rock under which To-go-av was hiding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh of the hero . Stone Shirt sprang high into the air , and called to his daughters that they were betrayed , and that the enemy was near , and they seized their magical bows and their quivers , filled with magical arrows , and hurried to his defense . At the same time all the nations who were surrounding the camp rushed down to battle . But the beautiful maidens , finding their weapons destroyed , waved back their enemies as if they would parley , and standing for a few moments over the body of their slain father , sang the death-song , and danced the death-dance , whirling in giddy circles about the dead hero , and wailing with despair until they sank down and expired . // The conquerors buried the maidens by the shore of the lake , but Tum-pwi-nai-ro-gwi-nump was left to rot , and his bones to bleach on the sands , as he had left Si-kor . There is this proverb among the Utes : " Do not murmur when you suffer in doing what the spirits have commanded , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What matters it who kills the game when we can all eat of it ? " It was long after midnight when the performance was ended ; the story itself was interesting , though I had heard it many times before , but never perhaps under such circumstances . We were stretched beneath tall , somber pines , and the great camp fire was surrounded by old men , wrinkled , and ugly ; de* formed , blear-eyed , wry-faced wom * en ; lithe , stately young men ; pretty , but simpering maidens , naked children-all intently listening , laugh * ing or talking by times , their strange * faces and dusky forms lit up with * the glare of the pine-knot fire-all * the circumstances conspiring to * make it a scene strange and weird . One old man , the sorcerer , or * medicine man , of the tribe , pecu* liarly impressed me . Now and * then he would interrupt the play * for the purpose of correcting the speakers , giving the moral of the story a strange dignity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ludicrous ; yet at no time did it make me smile . The story finished , I took Chuar aside for a talk . The three men who left us in the cafion the year before found their way up the lateral gorge , by which they went on or the Shi-wits Plateau , lying to the west of this , where they met with the Indians , and camped with them one or two nights , and were finally killed . I was anxious to learn the circumstances , and as the people of the tribe who committed the deed live but a little way from these people , and are intimate with them , I asked Chu-ar to make inquiry for me . Then we went to bed . Early the next morning the Indians came up to our camp . They // had concluded to send out a young man after the Shi-wits . The runner fixed his moccasins , put some food in a sack , and some water in a little wicker-work jug lined v*ith pitch , strapped them on his back , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down the caibn , hoping to meet the Shi-wits on our return . Soon we were ready to start , leaving the camp and pack animals in charge of the two Indians who came with us . As we moved out , our new guide came up ,  --  a blear-eyed , wizenfaced , quiet old man , with his bow and arrows in one hand , and a small cane in the other . These Indians all carry canes with a crooked handle , they say to kill rattlesnakes , and to pull rabbits from their holes . The valley is high up in the mountain , and we descended from it by a rocky , precipitous , trail down , down , down , for two long weary hours , leading our ponies , and stumbling over the rocks . At last we were at the foot of the mountain , standing on a little knoll , from which we could look into a cafion below . Into this we descended , and then we followed it for miles , clambering down , and still down . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafion by lateral channels , and these angular fragments of basalt made the way very rough for the animals . About two o'clock the guide halted us with his wand , and , springing over the rocks , was soon lost in a gulch . In a few minutes he returned and told us there was a little water below in a pocket . But it was vile and nauseating , and our ponies refused to drink it . We passed on , still ever descending . A mile or two from the water-basin we came to a precipice more than a thousand feet to the bottom . There was a cafion running at a gfeater depth , and at right angles to this , and into which this entered by the precipice , and this second cai'ion was a lateral one to the greater one , in the bottom of which we were to find the river . Searching about , we found a way by which we could descend to the left along the shelves and s*teps and piles of broken rocks . We started , leading our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our right . At places our way was along shelves so narrow or so sloping that I ached with fear lest a pony should make a misstep and knock a man over the cliff with him . Now and then we started the loose rocks under our feet , and over the cliff they went thundering down , and the echoes rolled through distant cafions . At last we passed along a level shelf for some distance , then we turned to VOL . X.-44. the right , and zigzagged down a steep slope to the bottom . Now we passed along this lower cafion for two or three miles to where it terminates in the Grand Cafion ; as the other ended in this , the river was only eighteen hundred feet below us , and it seemed at this distance to be but a creek . Our withered guide , the human pickle , seated himself on a rock , and seemed wonderfully amused at our discomfiture , for we could see no way by which to descend to the river . After some minutes he quietly rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a narrow sloping shelf on the right , which was to be our way . It led along the cliff for half a mile to a wider bench beyond , which , he said , was broken down on the other side in a great slide , and there we could get to the river . So we started out on the shelf ; it was so steep we could hardly stand on it , and to fall would be to go-we dared not look to see where . It was soon manifest that we could not get the ponies along the ledge . The storms had washed it down since our guide was here last , years ago . One of the ponies had gone so far that we could not turn him back until we had found a wider place , but at last we got him off . With part of the men , I took the horses back where there were a few bushes growing , and turned them loose . In the meantime the other men were looking for some way by which we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Captain Bishop , had found a way , and gone down . We packed bread , coffee , sugar , and two or three blankets among us , and set out . It was then nearly dark , and we could not find th' way by which the Captain went , and an hour was spent in fruitless search . Two of the men went around an amphitheater more than a fourth of a mile , and started down a broken chasm that faced us who were behind . These walls that are vertical , or nearly so , are often cut by chasms where the showers run down , and the tops of these chasms will be back a distance from the face of a wall , and the bed of the chasm will slope down with here and there a fall , and at some places be chocked with huge rocks which have fallen from the cliff . Down such a one the two men started . We worked our way for a time , until we came to the " jumping-off place , " where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . We feared that we should have to stay there clinging to the rocks until daylight . There is a curious plant growing out from the crevices of the rocks in this region : a // dozen stems will start from one root and grow to the length of eight or ten feet and not throw out a single branch or twig . At this crisis our little Indian , who seemed fully to comprehend the circumstances , gathered a number of these dry stems and tied them together in a bundle , forming a fascine . Then he lighted one end , and held it up . With this we could see a way out of our trouble ; and helping one another , holding torches for one another , and clinging to one another 's hands , we worked our way still farther into the depths of the cafion . While we were doing this , we noticed that the party coming down the gulch on the opposite side of the amphitheater would occasionally kindle a fire in a bunch of dried stems , which would flare up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to find a way down difficult points , it marked to us their progress down the gulch . Then Captain Bishop kindled a huge fire in the drift-wood on the bank of the river . Soon every man of our party had a torch of his own , and the light by the river , and the lights in the opposite gulch , and our own torches , made more manifest the awful darkness which filled the stupendous gorge . Still on we went , for an hour or two , and at last we saw Captain Bishop coming up the gulch , with a huge torchlight on his shoulders . He looked like a fiend waving brands and lighting the flames of hell , and the men in the opposite gulch were imps lighting delusive fires in inaccessible crevices over yawning chasms ; while our little Indian was surely the king of wizards . So I thought , as I stopped to rest for a moment on a rock . At last we met Captain Bishop , with his flaming torch , and ashe had leamed the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado . We were hungry and athirst and almost starved , and we lay down on the rocks to drink . Then we made a cup of coffee , and , spreading our blankets on a sand beach , were lulled to sleep by the roaring Colorado . The next morning we looked about us to see if there were no better way by which we could bring rations down to the river , and finally concluded that we could make that point a depot of supplies , should it be necessary ; that we could pack rations to the point where we left our animals the night before , and employ Indians to carry them down to the water 's edge . While looking about we discovered , on a broad shelg the ruins of an old house , the walls of which were broken down , and could see where the ancient people who lived here had made a garden , and used a great spring that comes out of the rocks for irrigation . On some rocks near by we discovered some curious etchings . Still searching about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked here and there by steps which had been built in the loose rock . Elsewhere there were hewn stairways , and we found a much easier way to go up than that by which we came down in the darkness the night before . We were in the Grand Cation , by the side of the roaring Colorado , more than six thousand feet below our camp on the mountain-side , eighteen miles away ; but the miles of horizontal distance represented but a small part of the day 's labor before us . It was the mile and a-quarter of altitude to be compassed that made it a Herculean task . We started early , and soon reached the place where we had left our horses , and found them mad with thirst . It was with difficulty that we were able to catch them , though they were hobbled ; but at last they were all secured , and we started up the cation with our jaded ponies until we reached the second cliff . Up this we climbed by easy steps , leading our animals . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our ponies had had no water for thirty hours , and were eager even for this foul fluid . We carefully strained a kettleful for ourselves , then divided what was left between them , two or three gallons for each ; but this did not satisfy them , and they raged around , refusing to eat the scanty grass . We boiled our kettle of water and skimmed it ; straining , boiling , and skimming made it a little better , and plenty of coffee took away the bad odor , and so modified the taste that most of us could drink it . Our little Indian , however , seemed to prefer the original mixture . We reached camp about sunset , and were glad to rest . The next day , September 19 , we were tired and sore , and concluded to rest a day with our Indian neighbors . During the inclement season they live in shelters made of boughs or bark of the cedar , which they strip off in long shreds . In this climate , most of the year is dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shelter . Clearing a small circular space of ground , they bank it around with brush and sand , and wallow in it during the day ,  --  and huddle together in a heap at night , men , women , and children , buckskin , rags , and sand . They wear very little clothing , not needing much in this lovely climate . // Altogether these Indians are more nearly in their primitive condition than any others on the continent with whom I am acquainted . They have never received anything from the Government ; they are too poor to tempt the trader , and their country is so nearly inaccessible that the white man never visits them . The sunny mountain-side is covered with wild fruits , nuts , and native grains , upon which they subsist . The oose , the fruit of the Yucca or Spanish bayonet , is rich and not unlike the paw-paw of the valley of the Ohio . They eat it raw , and also roast it in the ashes . They gather the fruit of a cactus plant which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from them express the juice , making the dry pulp into cakes , and saving them for winter ; the wine they drink about their camp-fires until the midnight is merry with their revelries . They also gather the seeds of many plants , such as sunflowers , golden rod , and grasses . For this purpose they have large , conical baskets , which hold two or more bushels . The women carry them on their backs , suspended from their foreheads by broad straps , and with a smaller one in the left hand , and a willow-woven fan in the right , they walk among the grasses and sweep the seed into the smaller basket , which is emptied now and then into the larger until it is full of seed and chaff . Then they winnow out the chaff and roast the seeds by a curious process : the seeds with a quantity of redhot coals are put into a willow tray , and by rapidly and dexterously shaking and tossing them , they keep the coals aglow , and the seeds and tray from burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crones in this work , they roll the seeds to one side of the tray as they are roasted , and the coals to the other . Then they grind the seeds into a fine flour , and make it into cakes and mush . For a mill they use a large flat rock lying on the ground , and another small cylindrical one in the hands . They sit prone on the ground , holding the large flat rocks between the feet and legs , then fill their laps wTith seeds , thus making a hopper to the mill with their dusky legs , and grind by pushing the seeds across the larger rock , where it drops into a tray . It is a merry sight to see the women grinding at the mill . I have seen a group of women grinding together , keeping time to a chant , or gossiping and chatting , while the younger lassies would jest and chatter and make the pine woods merry with their laughter . Mothers carry their babes curiously in baskets . They make a wicker board by platting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is fulled in the middle so as to form a sack closed at the bottom . At the top they make a wicker shade like " my grandmother 's sun-bonnet , " and wrapping the little one in a wild-cat robe , place it in the basket ; and this they carry on their backs , strapped over the forehead , and the little brown midgets are ever peering over their mothers ' . shoulders . In camp they stand the baskets against the trunk of a tree or hang it to a limb . There is little game in the country ; yet they get a mountain sheep now and then , or a deer with their arrows , for they are not yet supplied with guns . They get many rabbits , sometimes with arrows , sometimes with nets . They make a net of twine , made of the fibers of a native flax . Sometimes this is made several hundred yards in length , and is placed in a half circular position , with wings of sage brush . They have a circle hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they are shot with arrows . Most of their bows are made of cedar , but the best are made of the horns of mountain sheep . These are taken , soaked in water until quite soft , cut into stnps , and these glued together , and such bones are quite elastic . During the autumn grasshoppers are very abundant . When cold weather comes , these insects are numbed , and can be gathered by the bushel . At such a time they dig a hole in the sand , heat stones in a fire near by , put some in the bottom of the hole , put on a layer of grasshoppers , then a layer of hot stones , and continue this until they put bushels on to roast . There they are left until cool , when they are taken out thoroughly dried , and ground into meal . Grasshopper-gruel and grasshopper cake are articles of common food . Indians of the same race , farther to the east in the Rocky Mountains , obtain grasshoppers in great quantities , collected in another manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grasshoppers are fully fledged , they rise in vast numbers like clouds in the air and drift eastward with the upper currents . Coming near to these high snowclad mountains , they are often chilled , and fall on the great sloping sheets of snow that are spread over the mountain-sides , and tumble down these snow banks in vast numbers until they are collected at the foot in huge wind-rows , often containing hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands of bushels . Here the grizzly bears come and gorge themselves on this dainty food . There the Indians // come and kill the grizzly bears and gather grasshoppers . Grasshopper pudding , with bear-grease sauce , is considered a great delicacy . Their lore consists in a mass of traditions or mythology . It is very difficult to induce them to tell it to white men ; but the old Spanish priests in the days of the conquest of New Mexico , spread among the Indians of this country many Bible stories which the Indians are usually willing to tell . . It is not always easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pagan legend , it becomes a curious plant , and sends forth many shoots , quaint and new . May be , much of their added quaintness is due to the way in which they were told by the " fathers . " But in a confidential way , when you are alone , or when you are admitted to their camp-fire on a winter night , you will hear the stories of their mythology . I believe that the greatest mark of friendship or confidence that an Indian can give , is to tell you his religion . After one has so talked with me , I should always trust him , and I felt on very good terms with these Indians from the night on which we heard the legend of One-Two . That evening , the Shi-wits , for whom we had sent , came in , and after supper we held a long council : a blazing fire was built , and around this we sat : the Indians living here , the Shi-wits , Jacob Hamblin , and myself . This man Hamblin speaks their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians in the region round about . He is a silent , reserved man , and when he speaks , it is in a slow , quiet way that inspires great awe . His talk was so low that they had to listen attentively to hear , and they sat around him in death-like silence . When he finished a measured sentence , the chief repeated it and they all gave a solemn grunt . But first , I filled my pipe , lit it , and took a few whiffs , then passed it to Hamblin ; he smoked and gave it to the man next , and so it went around . When it had passed the chief , he took out his own pipe , filled , and lit it , and passed it around after mine . I could smoke my own pipe in turn , but when the Indian pipe came round I was nonplussed . It had a large stem , which , at some time , had been broken , and now there was a buckskin rag wound around it and tied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge mouthful . To gain time I refilled it , then engaged in very earnes*t conversation , and all unawares I passed it to my neighbor unlighted . I told the Indians that I wished to spend some months in their country during the coming year , and that I should like them to treat me as a friend . I did not wish to trade , did not want their lands . Heretofore I had found it very difficult to make the natives understand my object , but the gravity of the Mormon missionary helped me much . I told them that all the great and good white men are anxious to know Very many things , that they spend much time in learning , and that the greatest man is he who knows the most ; that they want to know all about the mountains , and the valleys , the rivers , and the cafions , the beasts , and birds , and snakes . Then I told them of many Indian tribes , and where they live ; of the European nations , of the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that came to my mind . I told them of the ocean , of great rivers and high mountains , of strange beasts and birds . At last I told them I wished to leam about their cafions and mountains , and about themselves , to tell other men at home , and that I wanted to take pictures of everything , and show them to my friends . I told them that I could stay with them but a short time then , but that I should be back again and stay with them many months . All this occupied much time , and the matter and manner made a deep impression . Then their chief replied : " Your talk is good , and we believe what you say . Your heart is good . We believe in Jacob , and look upon you as a father . When you are hungry you may have our game . You may gather our sweet fruits . We will give you food when you come to our land . We will show you the springs and you may drink ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , when you come , we shall be glad . We shall tell the Indians who live on the other side of the great river that we have seen Kahpu-rats , and he is the Indian 's friend . We shall tell them he is Jacob 's friend . We are very poor . Look at our women and children ; they are naked . We have no horses ; we climb the rocks , and our feet are sore . We live among rocks , and they yield little food and many thorns . When the cold moons come , our children are hungry . We have not much to give ; you must not think us mean . You are wise ; we have heard you tell strange things . We are ignorant . Last year we killed three white men . Bad men . said they were our enemies . They told great lies . We thought them true . We were mad ; it made us big fools . We are very sorry . Do not think of them ; it is done ; let // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , in understanding , compared with you . When we do wrong , do not get mad , and be like children too . " When white men kill our people , we kill them . Then they kill more of us . It is not good . We hear that the white men are a great number . When they stop killing us , there will be no Indian left to bury the dead . We love our country ; we know not other lands . XVe hear that other lands are better ; we do not know . The pines sing , and we are glad . Our children play in the warm sand ; we hear them sing , and we are glad . The seeds ripen , and we have to eat , and we are glad . We do not want their good lands ; we want our rocks and the great mountains where our fathers lived . We are very poor ; we are very ignorant ; but we arc very honest . You have horses and many things . You are very wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Nothing more have I to say . " Kah-pu-rats is the name by which I am known by the Utes and Shoshones , meaning " no right arm . " There was much more repetition than I have given , and much more emphasis . After this a few presents were given , we shook hands , and the council broke up . Mr. Hamblin then fell into conversation with one of the men , and held him until the others had left , and learned more of the particulars of the death of the three men . It seems that they came upon the Indian village almost starved and exhausted with fatigue . They were supplied with food , and put on their way to the settlements . Shortly after they had left , an Indian from the east side of the Colorado arrived at their village and told them about a number of miners having killed a squaw in a drunken brawl , and no doubt these were the men . No person had ever come down the cai7ion ; that was impossible ; they were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a great rage ; they followed , surrounded the m*n in ambush , and filled them full of arrows . That night I slept in peace , although these murderers of my men , and their friends , the U-in-ka-rets , were sleeping not five hundred yards away . While we were gone to the cafion , the pack train , and supplies enough to make an Indian rich beyond his wildest dreams , were all left in their charge , and all was safe ; not even a lump of sugar was pilfered by the children . So strangely do virtues and vices grow together in the human heart ; here were savages faithful to a trust on one day , who , but a short time before , had been guilty of horrible , though unconsidered crime . He who sees only their crimes , and studies the history of their barbarities as it has been recorded for the past three or four centuries , can see in the Indian race only hordes of demons who stand in the way of the progress of civilization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a more intimate knowledge of Indian character and life some* times forgets their baser traits , and sees only their virtues , their truth , their fidelity to a trust , their simple and innocent sports , and wonders that a morally degenerate , but powerful civilization , should destroy that primitive life . Social problems are so complex that few are willing or able to comprehend all the factors , and so the people are divided into two great parties , one crying for blood , and demanding the destruction of the Indians , the other begging that he may be left in his aboriginal condition , and that the progress of civilization may be stayed . Vain is the clamor of either party ; the march of humanity can not be stayed ; fields must be made , and gardens planted in the little valleys among the mountains of that Western land , as they have been in the broader valleys and plains of the East , and the mountains must yield their treasure of ore to the miner , and , whether we desire it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ; and we may comfort ourselves with the reflection that they are not destroyed , but are gradually absorbed , and becoine a part of more civilized communities . The next day the train started back to the Elfin Water-Pocket , while Captain Bishop and I climbed Mt . Trumbull . The U-inka-ret Mountains are volcanic-great irregular masses of lava , and many cones , one hundred and eighteen in number . On our way we passed the point that was the last opening in this volcanic region . It seemed but a few years since the last flood of fire had swept the valley . Between two rough , conical hills it poured , and ran down the valley to the foot of a mountain standing almost across the valley at its lower end-a great cone ; then it parted , and ran on either side . This last overflow is very plainly marked ; there is soil with trees and grass to the very edge of it on a more ancient bed . The flood was everywhere on its border from ten to twenty feet in height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On cooling , it shattered into fragments , but // these are still in place , and you can see the outline of streams and waves . So little time has elapsed since it ran down , that the elements have not weathered a soil , and there is scarcely any vegetation on it , but here and there a lichen is found . And yet so long ago was it poured from the depths that , where ashes and cinders have collected in a few places , some huge cedars have grown . Near the crater , the frozen waves of black basalt are rent with deep fissures transverse to the direction of the flow . Then we rode through a cedar forest up a long ascent until we came to cliffs of columnar basalt . Here we tied our horses , and prepared for a climb among the columns . Through crevices we worked , still toiling up , till at last we were on the mountain ; a thousand acres of pinelands spread out before us , gently rising to the other edge . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the one that seemed the highest , then made a long hard climb to its summit . And there , oh ! what a view was before us . A vision of glory ! Peaks of lava all around below us ; the vermilion cliffs to the north* with their splendor of colors ; the Pine Valley Mountains to the north-west , clothed in mellow perspective haze ; unnamed mountains to the south-west towering over cafions bottomless to my peering gaze ; and away beyond , the San Francisco Mountains lifting their black heads into the heavens . We found our way down the mountain , reaching the trail made by the pack train just at dusk , and following it through the dark until we descried the camp-fire  --  a welcome sight . Two days more , and we were at Pipe Spring , and another , at the bank of the Kanab
