ARTICLE V.-YALE COLLEGE-SOME THO UGLITS RESPECTING ITS FUTURE . THERE is a somewhat general feeling , we believe , among those who are most deeply interested in Yale College , that the institution is about entering on a new era of its existence . The work of the last seventy years , it is felt , has been a good and a great one , but it is mainly accomplished . Like that of the first century of the College history , and like that of every epoch in the progress of every growing institution , it has laid the foundation for what is larger and higher than itself-not higher , indeed , in the nobleness of the working , but in that the working is nearer to the final and full completion of the plan . The past now is to open itself toward and into the future , and a great step forward is to be or ought to be taken . Indications of this are seen on every side . The suggestions which are presented by those who think earnestly upon the subject of education ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other , have been so frequent of late and which , we regret to say , have not been always made either in a wise or a generous spirit ; the proposition to change the governing board of the institution by the introduction of new members from the alumni ; and the sentiments and aspirations of the instructors within the College walls , all alike bear witness that the coming years are looked upon as containing within themselves possibilities and hopes , which as yet have been unrealized . What are to be the characteristic features of the new era , and what its peculiar and distinctive work , are , therefore , questions of much importance , at the present time , and worthy of serious consideration . Our object in this Article is to present some thoughts as a partial answer to these questions . The first and most important work to be done in the years immediately before us is , as we believe , a work of unification . Yale College , like most of the older American Colleges , began as a sort of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who came to it beyond the point which they // had reached in the lower schools of the time , and opened the way for them to enter upon their active life . But it was limited in its aims , and in the results which it accomplished , by the limitations of the age . Men had not come , as yet , to take the widest views of education . The various sciences and branches of learning had scarcely begun to develop themselves-some of them had not begun to exist . Even in the department of theological science , which was nearest to the minds of the fathers , the demands and possibilities were comparatively small . A. general course , moving on but a little way , wa* all which , as it would seem , could be devised . The wisdom of the early founders was displayed , not in their accomplishment of the entire work , but in the fact that the plan which they formed was one which would , readily and naturally , enlarge itself to meet every requirement or change of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The school , which they established , would become a university in the course of generations . The College , which , in their day , was a whole in itself , would gradually become but one among several portions of a greater institution . It would lose something of its own prominence as it associated with itself other departments for more special training , but it would gain a new honor in their company , which it could never know without them . It was after the beginning of the present century that the change came . The new features of the times , and the growth to which we have alluded in all branches of knowiedge , gave the opportunity , and , in giving the opportunity , they presented the call foi a new work . The sagacious and far-seeing mind of the remarkable man who , at that period , had the interests of the College in his special keeping , understood the call . He saw that , if the institution lingered in the old work , it might increase , indeed , in numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place which was offered to it among the educational institutions of the country . Professional schools must be established , which should take the students at their graduation from the collegiate or academic department and fit them , by a special course of study , for their own peculiar sphere in the world . The beginning , at least , must be made , which should prepare the way for future growth // and render possible the completion of the work . Accordingly , at the earliest practicable moment , he established one of these scl ) ools , and devised the plan for another , which was founded a few years later . His immediate successors , who had been largely under his influence , carried forward the same plans . All the professional departments of the College were established , or strengthened until some of them attained a considerablo eminence . Finally , within the past twenty-five years , the Scientific School and the department of Philosophy and Philology have made time institution complete in its parts . The work of which we have thus briefly spoken , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the College , has been the work of the past half-century . We have alluded to it , however , not for its own sake , but because we would call attention to a point which is of especial importance . The history of these two great periods of the past shows that the development in this , as in other similar institutions in our country , has not been a development of all the parts together . It has been , on the contrary , a growth for a hundred years of o*me department alone by itself , and then an addition to this one department of others , which , from their later origin , have seemed to be gathered around it as their center . The life and vigor of our American Colleges-even where they have widened into Universities , as at Yale and Harvard-have continued largely at this center ; and the governing powers have regarded the academical department as the object of their peculiar and almost their sole care . The institutions have thus , with all their enlargement and success , been , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of coordinate and coequal branches . They have not had a well rounded and perfect development , but one which has been partial and one-sided iu its character . This result has been a natural , perhaps in some measure a necessary , result of the origin and history of the institutions . But of the reality of the fact we think no intelligent observer can doubt . Now the point , which we have to urge , is , that the future years must unite these departments into a common whole , giving the same care to the growth of all . The age of mere // colleges in this country , in a certain sense , is past . Not that colleges will not continue to exist , and to be needed , and to do a good work . But they are not to be the highest institutions to whIch we look and which we ask for hereafter . The great centers of education , like Yale and Harvard , must be centers of universal education ; and , if they cease to be so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seminaries , which make no such claims as they are making . It needs no argument to prove this . The very peculiarity , which distinguishes these higher institutions as a class by themselves , is not the superiority of their instruction for undergraduate academical students or their superiority in respect to the number of their undergraduates . If these things be all which they have to elevate them , they will only reach the higher places among the institutions which have merely an academical course . They will be far in advance , indeed , of the colleges just established in the western states , but they will still belong in their company . If they are to leave their company altogether , they need something more than this . To the university-in the sense in which the word is most appropriately used , that is , as distinguished from the college-what have sometimes been called the " outside " schools are essential . They are , even , the e88ential thing . It will scarcely require any more argument to show , . that , if these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a steady and permanent growth , this name , which has been assigned to them because their origin was later than that of the collegiate branch and they were thus added to it , must be laid aside as no longer suited to mark their real position . They must , in a word , become " inside " schools , having each and all of them the same rights and privileges and care with the original academic section of the university . If they do not have this , they can not prosper in the long run . If they are left to provide for themselves altogether-in the expressive phrase of recent years , " hanging on the verge of the government " - they may succeed , for a while , through the power and self-devotion of the members of their faculties , but , when these men are called away or die , the institutions will prove to have little or no independent life of their own . They will show that they rested on the reputation // of individuals , and that the want of cmstant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . We hold it to be even self-evident , that , if the governing body of any institution or of any country give their thoughts to one part of it alone , or if they manifestly place it in their thoughts above the others , these other parts will , sooner or later , suffer in their life in consequence . Neglect , if it be only partial , always checks and dwarfs the thing neglected . If it be total , it destroys it-not , perhaps , as speedily , but almost as surely as does a violent putting it out of existence . If the medical school of a university , for example , is looked upon as of little consequence , because its number of students is smaller than that of the undergraduate or some other department , or because it is very limited in its funds and it seems a difficult matter to increase them , or because medical science , for the time , is regarded with less favor than physical or theological science , or for any other reason , it will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its vital energy . It will gradually move toward the level at which others would place it , and , if it finally falls even below that level , surely it need be no matter of surprise . The feeling must be-if success is to be attained  --  a widely different one from this . The spirit of the University must be the spirit of unity and fraternity . If one member suffers , the sentiment must be that all the members , of necessity , suffer with it , and if one member rejoices , that all the members rejoice with it . So far from leaving those that are weaker or younger to move on as best they can , these more needy portions must have so much the greater encouragement and aid . This is the rule in every other institution or body in the world , and the necessity of its observance in these great educational institutions requires only to be stated , in order to be admitted by every candid mind . It is a rule which , if it be not observed , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential and fundamental it is . The whole body will , in time , suffer if any part of it is disregarded . It will inevitably lose the fullness of its glory . It will meet the penalty of its own neglect . The history of our larger institutions , in the past even , has proved the truth of what we say , in greater or less degree . If the future should be like the past , the coming history will // prove it far more clearly . It will do so , because the past has been only the time of the beginning-of the arrangement and formation of the plan , so far as the more recent departments are concerned ; but the future is to be the time of their progress and development  --  the time when the question of their permanent success , and , in connection with their success , of the success of the Univereit* is to be determined . But how , it may be asked , is the unifying work , of which we have spoken , to be accomplished ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken in order to reach it ? We answer , in the fret place , that the general sentiment and feeling in the University must be in this direction , as we have already intimated . The old ideas , which have been the natural growth of the way and order in which the departments have come into existence , must pass away altogether , and in their place must arise the better and more correct views , which look upon the institution as made up of equal and equally important parts . Age or numbers , in this matter , must not be regarded as , necessarily , having any weight whatever . The branch of the university which was founded twenty-five years ago must be held as important to the completeness of the whole body as that whose origin was more than a century earlier . And while the success of any school is to be determined , in a measure , by the number of its students , it must not be forgotten , that a law school of sixty or a hundred , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be as successful as an academical department of five hundred or a thousand . We say as successful , because it as nearly reaches the present possibilities of its growth . But supposing any section of the university not to be successful , as measured by this standard , or to be beginning to lose ground , it must gather to itself so much more of the energy of the governing power and of the sympathy of the whole body , and thus it must be borne up and carried forward to a new life . We believe that every officer of a great institution , like Yale , should be as ready to give or to labor for the prosperity of every other department of it-so far as the calls of his special work will allow-as for the one with which he is more particularly connected ; and that every trustee or overseer should be equally // and large-heartedly devoted to them all . There may be some apology if this has not always been the case in earlier times , but there will be none in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new era , at its very beginning , if these sentiments and feelings are wanting . But we rejoice to believe that they will not be wanting . There are unmistakable signs that these ideas are gaining ground in Yale Collegewhatever may be true of other colleges  --  and that the future is to see the completion of the plan here , which the past has only formed in its parts  --  the rounding out and perfecting of the University as a whole . To the end of strengthening the sentiment to which allusion has been made , and as a further means of accomplishing the object in view , we think , secondly , that there should be not infrequent meetings of the several faculties of the university as one body , for consultation respecting the common interests . There are , in every such large educational institution , many questions continually arising , which have exclusive reference to particular departments . These should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the particular faculty of the department to which they belong . But there are , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertain alike to the welfare of all , and to the advancement of the entire institution . Subjects of this nature , certainly , should not be limited to the deliberations of one or two of the separate faculties , but should be discussed in a general meeting . The interests of all should be fairly and fully represented , and the needs and claims of each should be urged , as they only can be , properly , by those who have the most intimate knowledge of them . The reasonableness amid wisdom of such a course would seem to be evident at its very first suggestion . And yet , so strong has been the influence Gf the past history of our colleges and of the order of their development-that , as far as we are aware , such common meetings have never , as yet , been known anywhere . In the future , we anticipate that they will be known , and , so soon as they are , it will be a matter of wonder that they had not been held long before . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faculties towards each other , there can be no doubt . The opposite // course , by which decisions affecting the general well-being are made by a part only of those interested , seems really a sort of interference with privileges , much as if one of the faculties should attempt to control the affairs which are properly under the supervision of another . Whenever there is such interference or want of kindly consideration , there can scarcely fail , at times , to be a greater or less sense of a sort of injustice and a weakening , in some degree , of the ties that bind all together . But when every one has free opportunity to say and to do all that he can for the common benefit  --  to make suggestions , and urge needed improvements , and meet all others in friendly discussion , and influence them , or be influenced by them-he will be , almost of necessity , a hearty well-wisher and helper to his associates . When he is in the minority , or when he is in the majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision , or , at least , will feel that his views have received respectful attention and will , thus , be so far satisfied . The university and the collegiate department of it-it can not be too often repeated-are not the same thing . And , in the matters which have reference to the university , the menAzers of the several faculties of the university should be consulted , just as truly as , in those which bear upon the collegiate department only , the discussion should be open to all the members of its particular faculty and not be limited to a selected portion of them . It must be so , as we believe , if the harmony of the faculties is to be always unbroken . It must be so , also , if the highest good of the institution is to be attained* The members of one faculty are , almost necessarily , limited in their views and sympathies to some extent . IMlen look upon subjects from their own standpoint , and they need to be influenced and modified in their opinions by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the common welfare will often be lost sight of . The officers whose daily work and thoughts are within the sphere of a theological department may feel as kindly as possible toward those belonging to the associated scientific school , but they can not determine alone what is best for the two schools together . The two bodies need to confer freely with each other  --  the two sides need to be fully represented in order to reach the most enlightened and liberal decision // The same thing is true of any other two departments , and even more true , if possible , of any one as related to all the rest . And here , lest we may be misunderstood as giving to the faculties the power which belongs to the trustees or corporation , let us say that we have no such intention . The spheres of the two bodies are distinct , and the final controlling power is with the trustees . But we believe that all persons who have been familiar with our colleges or universities will agree with us in holding , that a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trnstees must originate with the faculties . The members of the corporation are generally nonresident . In many matters , they can not watch the progress and wants of the institution from day to day . They must look to the members of the board of instructors , oftentimes , for information and advice . If they attempt to go forward alone , mistakes of a very serious nature will , inevitably , be made . The faculties and the trustees should be in reality , if not in name , two houses in the government , and many measures should have their beginning only in the lower house . A college can be governed to death , as well as any other organization , and one of the dangers , to say the least , which is incidental to that change in the corporation , which meets so much favor at present , is that it will bring more interference from the higher powers with the freedom of the working of the University . This freedom has been the glory of Yale College in the past - even beyond all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University speak of it as one of the inestimable privileges of this institution , as compared with his own . The traditions and influences here are all in favor of it . The success and harmony of the college have depended more upon this , perhaps , than upon any other single cause . We hope the day may be far distant when it shall be lost in any measure . The ideal way , beyond all doubt , is that of a wise and hearty co3poration between the two bodies ; and , wherever there is such wise and hearty cooperation , the faculty will have very large influence in the counsels and acts of the government . This influence , however , ought , in those cases where the University at large is concerned , to be the combined influence of all the faculties . But in order to this end , there must // be not infrequent meetings of the several faculties as one body . The recommendations made must come from the whole body . The University must be carried forward by a corrimon impulse . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have spoken , we mention the raising of a large fond for the Univer8ity . Efforts made heretofore for the collection of money have always been put forth for some specific object or for some special department . Such efforts have been repeated , from time to time , and have met with gratifying success . They have proved beneficial to the whole institution , in so far as they have strengthened one or another of its larger or smaller parts . But no general and wide-extended plan has been entered upon , which should embrace all the departments and should continue until its complete accomplishment , no matter how long a period might be required for that end . The need of such a plan , and of an energetic prosecution of it , we believe , is apparent . Every other plan , involving efforts only in a single line , must be partial in its chamacter . Two or three such partial plans , if entered upon at the same time , will , almost necessarily , interfere with one another 's success in considerable degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid such collision , they are entered upon successively , a large amount of valuable time is lost for one portion of the University in waiting for another . Yale College , too , can speak to its alumni and its friends with more emphasis and impressiveness than can any of its separate departments by itself . Moreover , the other methods have been tried long enough , and everything is now propitious for a general movement for the general interests . What has been already done has shown that there is a vast amount of money in the country , held by persons who are desirous of using it for the highest benevolent ends . it has , also , become equally clear , that energy in the work of making known the wants of the college and the good it is accomplishing will be rewarded . The story of the necessities and the work of this institution has never failed to meet a favorable response from the generosity of many benefactors . And , from the experience of years past , we are constrained to bear testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of the College is owing as largely to the want of con. // stant and untiring energy in the work of solicitation , as to that of willingness on the part of men , who fully understand the case , to give with liberality . Giving , we are well aware , is a a slow work for most men . Asking men to give is a still harder work . But the man whose cause is a good one , and who does not grow faint-hearted in his labors , will , finally , receive full measure for the asking . We know this , because we have been associated intimately with a small circle of men who have been asking for one of the good causes of this institution . They have been earnest in their labors , but they might have been more so , and we have no more doubt of their having attained a far greater success , if they had been , than we have of the success already gained . Yale College is the largest and highest educational institution , under real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a past history of nearly two hundred years . Its graduates , in the past , have been among the noblest men in the former generations . Its living alumni are scattered everywhere through the land . They are men of eminence , of large means , of Christian usefulness , of wide-spread influence . Its friends are more numerous than either they or itself know . What cause is better than its cause ? What asking will meet a readier and heartier answer than its asking ? Why should it not ask for all that it needs * ( AV There have been , as we conceive , two unfortunate things , in respect to this matter , in the history of this institution . The first is a despondent feeling as to the likelihood of success , if solicitations should be made , and the second , which is closely allied to the other , is a shrinking from a constant and earnest pressing of the wants of the College on the attention of those interested in it . We hope that the many gifts , which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remove these things in the future . Certainly the work of the future can not be accomplished unless they are removed . A grand , combined movement , which shall appeal to and interest every friend of the College and every graduate of any of its depait. ments , is the thing which is needed . The widely extended impression , that the College is wealthy-even with a superabundance of riches ,  --  must be carefully counteracted by repeated // presentations of the facts of the case . The specific wants must be made known with all clearness and fullness . Men must be urged to give to anything which awakens their special interest ; and all , who will do so , must be urged to give to the general fund of the whole University . When this general fund is gathered in , it must , if the end of which we speak is to he attained , be divided among the several departments according to their need . Everything must be done with a view to the common good of all . This work , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for years . The enlistment must be for a long period ; and , under the guidance of the central power , every man , who can be called on to aid , must be suminoned to do good service in the cause . The sum aimed at must be a large one-sufficient to cover all necessities . The age is ready for large things , and more likely to do them than it is to do small ones . And there must be no faltering or fainthearteduess to the very end . There is no real occasion for any such feeling , for the dangers of failure in this matter are such as always pass away before a determined energy . There is not a department of the University , we verily believe , which ,  - -  starting , by itself alone , with a heroic energy worthy of its case ,  --  would not obtain , within a single year , an amount of aid surprising , in its largeness , both to itself and to all its friends . Fear and the weakness of effort which follow upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They bring their own defeat-a defeat just proportioned to their magnitude . f such a fund should be raised for the University  --  and that it can be , in case the work be undertaken in the spirit and with the energy indicated above , all the lessons of our past experience , so far as they teach anything , clearly show-and if , as and after it is raised , it is divided according to the dictates of those feelings which , as we have said , ought to characterize the new era , it would greatly help the University to grow in all its parts , and to become what it ought to be . There are departments here , which are suffering , to day , beyond measure because they are almost entirely without funds . They ought to be provided for , first and most carefully , in such a distribution . The attention of the governing powers ought to be at once and earnestly given to them , that they may be // strengthened according to their necessities . When this is done , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it-should have its wants thoroughly investigated and proportionately provided for . We believe that a million of dollars can be collected from the friends and *raduates of Yale for the promotion of its means of instruction within the next ten years . We believe that measures should be at once introduced , looking toward the accomplishment of this result , and that those whose proper office it is to institute and carry out these measures should say to themselves continually , " There is for us no such word in the English language as failure . " We believe that every year 's delay in this matter is a loss of opportunity , and an endangering of the final issue . The present is a golden period . lit is being taken advantage of on every hand . If men here defer their working , or go forward with little efficiency , other men , elsewhere , will bear away the rewards , because of their greater promptness and vigor . We hope the new era will be one of as much energy in respect to the gathering in of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been of skill in the management of funds already gathered in-that the new era will be one of forth-putting power , and will not exhaust itself on what it already has . But , however great may be the results , if they are not used with a true impartiality toward all the departments-if they are devoted to the collegiate school alonethe University-life will die away or be destroyed , and its destruction will be owing to the want of any true idea of what the University is , or any true desire to have it grow in power . We can hardly persuade ourselves that the friends and goverm*s of Yale College will , in any such way , reject the possibilities , which are offered them , of making this institution one of the great Universities of the country . If they do , they will prove themselves unworthy sons of those noble men , who , in the day of small things at the beginning of this century , had a vision of the possible future , and , with their scanty means , provided for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw only in the distant prospect . We add , as afourth means of bringing the whole institution into unity , and thus of accomplishing the work of the new // era , a suggestion as to the chief office of the University . The President of Yale College is the presiding officer of the Board of Trustees , and is the head of the faculty of each and every department . He is , thus , the one person who , according to the theory of the institution , meets with and forms the center of all the official bodies within it . In the practical working of the institution , however , the theory is not fully carried out . The institution , in this point as in all others , feels the influence of its origin . It began as a collegiate school , with its presiding officer as one of its teachers . When , in subsequent times , other schools were added to the original one , new bodies of instructors were appointed for their peculiar work , but the President did not extend his teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been limited , ( except , indeed , in the giving of a few lectures , in special cases , of late years , ) to the college or academical branch of the institution . He has met with the faculty of that branch only , in their regular meetings , and his work has been mainly in association with them . Having so many duties in that department-more , even , at times , than ought to be imposed upon any single man-he has scarcely been able to take upon himself similar duties in other departments . The necessities of the case have made him , in reality , the president of one faculty only , while , in name , he has been the head of all . If we look back thirty or forty years , we doubt whether the College President ever , ( except in the most extraordinary emergencies , ) sat in session with the officers of the professional schools . In late years , such meetings have been more frequent , but , even now , they take place only at intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one session in every week . The difference is owing to the impossibility that one man should do everything . Human powers can not go beyond certain bounds ; and , so long as the President has , in the college department , daily recitations to hear and daily lectures to give , and all the work upon his hands of what is known to college men as a " division ' * officer ( involving the hearing of excuses and other such petty duty , ) and is , it would seem , almost an office-clerk for everybody to write to or to call upon , it can scarcely be demanded of him that he should give himself largely to the professional and scientific schools . But , // if he does not devote himself to all , and meet often with all faculties , the inevitable result will be , that he will not have the same minute knowledge of the life and wants of all ,  --  and the almost inevitable result will be , that his personal interest in all can not be like that which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose daily life he is constantly brought . He must be a larger-minded and largerhearted man than most men are , if he is able to overcome these limitati* , ns which beset him , and to feel , at all times , that every department of the University is just as important as his own . But , if he does not feel this ,  --  inasmnuch as he is the center of power and influence , and the sole representative of the faculties in the corporation  --  the other schools will , sooner or later , suffer in comparison with the one to which he especially belongs ; and the danger of this result will be increased , because the officers of that school have nearer and more constant access to him than those of any other . Yale College has become a wide-extended institution . Its growth , within the last twenty-five years , has been very great . It seeiris to us a question worthy of the most serious consideration , whether it has not become so large as to require the old system of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the time approaching-we do not say it *8 , but is it not-when the chief office in the University shall be changed in its character , and shall no longer bear such a special relation to a single department ? Does not the work of the new era , which is to change the institution from a College with outside schools into a University composed of coordinate and coequal branches , require for its accomplishment that the head of the institution shall have precisely the same relation to all the branches ? We have , already , seen that there is work enough , and more than enough , for such an officer as the academical department needs to preside over its affairs . But to those who thoughtfully observe the common life and interests of the whole University we believe it is equally clear , that there is work enough connected with those common interests to occupy the mind and the time of the ablest man who can be found to discharge it . If , however , this be so , it becomes , to say the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // should not be done by a dean of the academical faculty , ( with similar officers in the other faculties , so far as needed , ) while the President should be connected alike with all faculties in reality as well as in nan*e , and should have especial charge of the great common interests and life . Of the uniting power of such an office-of its immediate tendency to proinote the growth of the University as distinguished from the Collegeit would seem that there could scarcely be any doubt . Unless , therefore , some weightier argument from some other source can be brought against such a change in the constitution of affairs , it ought to be made . And to the consideration of the whole question the minds of the governing powers , as it seems to us , may well be given at the proper moment . Why should not the remaining period of the present administration , whose past years have been so useful and so honorable , and whose continuance for years to come the graduates of Yale so generally desire , be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this be for any reason impracticable , why should not the succeeding administration begin with the assignment of these new duties to the highest officer of the institution ? Certainly , at some time in the new era , this matter will press itself : , and , we can hardly doubt , will be decided in favor of the change . All that we would hope is , that its discussion may not be deferred so long as to lose any advantages to the University in conscquence . The change here referred to need not , as it seems to us , and ought not to diminish the intellectual or religious influence of the President upon the students of the University . It might even increase that which should be exerted upon those belonging to the other departments beyond the academical . The President , in our view , ought never to be a mere business agent of the University . He should have some share in the instruction of the students , and should have the opportunity of coming in contact with them . Otherwise the office will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on the other hand , there will be a great loss of possible good influence . His very office gives the President-if he meets them and they know him in the class-room-two or three times the power with the students , which even the same man would // have as one of the professors . This power ought to be used . But it is not essential to his discharging the duties of instruction , that he should be confined to the collegiate department . He can be a University lecturer , lecturing on subjects which are of importance and interest to the students of all the schools . He can give different courses , to a certain extent , adapted more particularly to the wants of each of the separate schools . If he is set apart by ordination to the office of the ministry , as always has been , and we hope always will be , the case in this institution , he can preach frequently in the University Chapel , or meet the students in their special or general meetings of a religious character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , or more truly honorable for a man who is fitted for it-than to stand thus at the center of a great and growing University , with his heart and mind open to the wants of its every department-with his efforts ready to bear it forward in all parts alike-with the influence of his character and the impress of ' his intellectual power coming upon every student who finds his way anywhere within its walls . The constantly increasing fame of the institution would be his fame . The lives of thousands of students would bear within themselves , and would transmit to a future generation the lessons which they learned from him . His office would be even a higher and better one than it can be now , just in proc portion as it would have a wider sphere of working , and a greater end to accomplish . It would be to its former self almost as the University is to the College . Before closing our consideration of the means of accomnpushing the work of unifying the institution more perfectly , we desire to add one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that , in addition to the present honors given to students of merit in the different departments , there might be established prizes or rewards which should be open to those of all departments . The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is now offered to students of the schools of science and of the higher philosophy and philology . Might not this degree , or some similar mark of distinction , be made a University honor for all who should prove themselves worthy of it ? Or if not this , might not university prizes be proposed for all , to be given as // the resuli of examinations in the several lines of study pursued by different classes of students ? Of course , from the nature of the case , such rewards could not be offered to undergraduates in the department of arts or in that of science , because they do not stand upon a common level with the graduated students who are found in the professional schools and the higher and more professional branch of the scientific department . But this exclusion of such undergraduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no injustice to or real exclusion of the departments to which they belong , because each of these departments extends itself into the higher schools of philology and science already referred to . There would , therefore , be nothing in such a plan to oppose the University idea , but , on the other hand , there would be everything to favor it , and more perfectly carry it out . Such a plan would , of course , require careful thought before its adoption . Difficulties in the way of its successful accomplishment might present themselves , at first . But it is deserving of consideration and , as we are inclined to believe , will demand consideration in the coming years . If it is wise to adopt the plan , the influence of its adoption on the end which we now have in view-namely , the establishment and growth of the University as distinguished from the mere college , or the making of the University to be one body with codordinate branches-is almost beyond question . In this way , the University will appeal to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are united in one company . Another suggestion which may be offered is , that the graduates of all the departments should be regarded equally as sons of the University . This is the case already , in a certain measure . The students who have completed their course of study in the various schools are recorded in the general catalogue of the college . But it is evident to every observer , that those whom the college regards as its alumni , in the full sense of the word , are the graduates of the academical department only . This sentiment is a growth of all the past history of the institution and of the way , already pointed out , in which it has become what it is . A college , which has , so to speak , taken on , in the progress of years , certain outside schools , will // naturally feel itself to be the central and essential thing . It will claim for its graduates the privileges of the household . It will look upon others as holding only an inferior place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the innermost circle , and will appropriate to himself the name of the institution in a sense in which he concedes it to no other . But , so long as this continues to be the case , the University spirit will suffer in its development . The insensible but inevitable influence of such feelings in the academical department and its graduates upon the other departments will be a depressing influence . Their graduates will see that they are regarded as a less privileged order ; and , because they are not of the collegiate school , they will lose something of the spirit of ' the place . The recent years have , already , witnessed a considerable change in this respect . The growth in numbers or in what we may call the " institutional " life of some of the other schools has , in a measure , broken in upon the old feeling , and we anticipate in the future a far more complete change . And why should there not be such a change ? The student in theology or law is pursuing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure mathematics or of the ancient languages . The person who enters upon th * general course in the scientific department , whatever may be thought of the comparative value of the education he receives , is as tr ulya son of the University as the one who gives himself to the regular course of the department of arts . The old idea has had a very natural origin and growth , but it is , nevertheless , a false one . Every man graduating at Harvard or Yale-whatever degree he may have taken-is a son of Harvard or Yale . He ought to have all the privileges of such sonship . He ought to be recognized everywhere as on an equality , as a graduate , with every other ; and we are sure that he will be hereafter . Of the uniting influence upon the life of the University of his being thus recognized , we say again , as we have , already , repeatedly said in other connections , there can be no doubt . We suggest further , as another step in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a sort of satisfaction , we confess , in the minds of the friends of this institution , that it has always had the name of College . So // long as schools of scarcely the dignity of our higher academies , and with no pretence to any department exc3pt the collegiate , and with not even students enough for a respectable class , are calling themselves universities , it is pleas mt to think that a great institution like Yale has always kept its old unpretend ing name . But if we look at the facts of the case , the time has passed for the appropriateness of this title . It no longer describes what the institution really is . It creates endless confusion , because the word college must be used in two senses ,  - -  at one time , referring to the academical department only , and , at another , to all the departments as united together . A man may thus be a pr&amp;essor or a student in the college and not in the college at the same time , and what the college is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It tends , also , to give the collegiate branch the pre*imuinence above all others and to perpetuate the want of codordination among the various schools . Names are very important , oftentimes . They represent things . They are , as it were , the tImings t emselv.es . They ought , therefore , to be given according to the nature of the things . Yale College , as a mere college , is only a partit is only one of five branches of the institution which is known by that name . There is a university at New Haven , which includes the college , which has grown out of , indeed , but far beyond the limits of the college . Why should it not designate itself by a name which is suited to distinguish irs peculiar character ? It is a university-why should it not be called one ? But , whatever may be the desirableness or nudesirableness of adopting this name on other grounds , it appears to us that its adoption must tend to the accomplishment of the object of uniting the departments by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become , to their own apprehension and the apprehension of the world , members of the one body-members with equal privileges and an equal rank . The constant use of the new title would be a continual reminder to all of their relations to one another , and would be a sort of outward manifestation and declaration of the true idea of the university . These last mentioned suggestions , as we have intimated , may be considered of mninor importance , as compared with // those which were previously presented . They are not , however , without weight . The institution is not beginning now , without any old traditions . It is bearing in its life the influences of a history of nearly two hundred years . These influences , so far as the point now before us is concerned , have been largely in a direction opposite to the university idea . They must , therefore , be counteracted , if that idea is to gain its proper place . Everything may well be done , under such cii ' - cumstances , which , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right one . Even names , and things of inferior consequence , if they will prove helpful to the end , may wisely be cared for , and , as it appears to us , those who may have in charge the great and special work of the coming era should thoughtfully consider every measure which may bear upon this work ; and if , after such consideration , any means , even the least , shall seem adapted to bring the end in view , they should promptly decide to use them . The American University-in the highest sense of that word-is a thing of the future . But it is not to be originated in the future . It is not to be established by the resolutions of a mass convention , or by the efforts of a few reformers in education , whose only aim is to overthrow established systems , and all whose ideas are the outgrowth of modern American society . It will have its life rooted in the past . It will have a historic character . Where it will be located , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , which will deserve and bear the name , it may be presumptuous , at this period of the country 's progress , to attempt to determine . But it is not too much to say , that those great institutions which have been growing in strength and solidity and numbers for two centuries have great advantages over all others in respect to the coining time . They have a past history , which is secure . They have the traditions of the past to hold them to a true conservatism . As they are not the creatures of the present , they need not succumb to the passing notions of the hour . They can pass , in their life , from all the sound thoughts of former generations to the still higher ideals of sQholarship of a coming age  --  and can take from the present , as they pass onward , only that measure of its influence which is good . Their // growth is the only healthy growth-that which starts from the beginning of the nation 's life and keeps steadily on into the indefinite future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , we may predict for them-if their course is directed by wisdom-more safely than for any others , the realization of this high idea . Surely , every friend of theirs and every well-wisher of his country ought to desire for them this honorable future , for it will be a glory to the nation if its noblest and highest universities are , in all time , those which have grown with its growth and strengthened with its strength . But , if they are to attain this end , they can not linger in the sphere of mere colleges . They can not neglect the development of any of their parts , but must see that all the parts increase together in the unity and harmony of a common life . A grave responsibility will rest upon those who have the positions of authority in them in the coming years . It will be , however , as in all great works , a responsibility only cummensurate with the good to be accomplished and the reward to be attained . We believe that the time is close at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true guiding thought of all the future-when the old notion of a college with minor schools attached to it must be abandoned forever , and the several departments must be regarded as altogether coequal-when all portions of the institution must be pressed forward with the same energy , and watched over with the same minute and constant care  --  or the hope of the future will be lost . Other institutions of later origin and less noble past history will take the honor which is ready and waiting now for these . We have spoken of Yale College because we are deeply interested in it . Much of what we have said would apply elsewhere , but our thoughts and those of our associates are naturally upon the future of our own University . We hope that future may be marked by wisdom as great as has characterized the past . Through the wisdom of the past , the institution has grown from its small beginnings , in the times of the early fathers , to the greatness of its present numbers and the wideness of its present fame . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments as they were needed , until now it is a complete University in its plan and form . // It needs only that continual growth , which is the necessity of all life , and that more perfect unity of all its parts which shall impart to it still greater strength and vigor for its future course , in irder to make it all that its most ardent friends could desire it to become  --  a complete University in the highest sense . And now is the time to move forward . To-day , in the advantages which it affords , Yale College is unsurpassed . In the plan by which it has determined the question between classical and scientific education most favorably to both , it has been wiser than any of its sister institutions . In the number of its students , it stands in the front rank . The incentives which come from past success , and those which arise from dangers in the future , all point to earnest action . We have attempted to show one of the lines in which such action is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are other lines which might be traced out-there are other works which , as we think , ought to characterize the new era ; but we have trespassed upon the patience of our readers in this article so long that we pass them by unnoticed .
