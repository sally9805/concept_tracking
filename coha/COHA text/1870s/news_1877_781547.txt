txt It was telegraphed from Washington last week that Mr. ADAMSON , the Consul-General of the United . States at Melbourne , had advised the State Department " that no American should emigrate to Australia we o does not carry with him moans for returning in a year , as such emigrants are likely , in most instances , to want to go back to the United States within that time , " We do not know by what facts Mr. ADAMSON Sustains his opinion , or to what particular class ho desires to address it ; but in the form in which it is given to the public , his advice is not very valuable . The question of emigrating to the other side of the globe is by no means a simple one , and no man of averagc common sense would ho likely to make up his mind about it one way or the other on the strength of so vague and incomplete a statement as that attributed to Mr. ADAMSON . Whether it would pay au American to remove to Australia must depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the resources which he can take with him , on his kuowledge and capacity in business or in mechanic arts , by which he could hope to earn money , or his special information touching the country he is going to , and the arrangements he is able to make beforehand . for profitable employment there , and ou other considerations which it is not necessary to detail here . In one sense , Mr. ADAMSON 'S advice is sound as to all emigration . for in this venture those generally succeed best who can take with them a certain amount of capital ; but on the other hand , it is notorious that , other things being equal , emigrants to a new field get on the surest and fastest when they have abandoned all intention of returuiug to their homes . There are certain general facts regarding Australia which support the conclusion that the continent is a ; good place for an industrious , energetic man to live in . We have already called attention to seine of these . But it is obvious tint no intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor would such a person rely entirely on any information that could be conveyed . th  --  oagh the columns of a newspaper. ? He would only be induced by this kind of information to make speciac inquiries in official quarters , or in quarters where he felt sure of the men he was dealing with . With this friendly precautionary suggestion , we shall give some details of life and ' the cost of living in Australia , gathered . from the newspapers of the country , which , we may say , are in the main managed with intelligence , care , and honesty . The first fact which strikes an inquirer in this field is the . remarkable discrepancy , not , uncommon in comparatively new countries , between the number of males and the number of females in the population . In the five colonies , the males are to the females , roughly , as five to four . In Victoria , the ratio is 44 to 37 ; in New South Wales , 33 to 27 ; in Queensland , 111 to 70 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance being most nearly equal in this colony , ) and in Western Australia , 16 to 11 . As a natural consequence of this state of things , the demand . for domestic servants is great and wages are high . The quotations of rates in this branch of the labor market in the Melbourne Argus , Jan , 24 , were as follows : For town  --  House-mauls , $150 to $180 per annum ; female cooks , $175 to WO per annum ; male cooks , $7 50 to $20 per week ; nurse-maids , $125 to $175 per annum ; laundresses , $150 to $200 per annum . In the country districts first-class married couples receive $350 to $450 per annum ; second class , $200 to $250 ; house-maids , $175 to $200 . Turning to the price of land , we find . that the public land alienated in Victoria in 1875 averaged $7 50 per acre ; in New South Wales , $2 93 ; in Queensland , $0 25 ; in South Australia , $2 08 . Tho average product per acre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted table The large yield of wheat and oats in Tasmania , and the still larger one in New-Zealand , will be noted . It may be added . that the weight per bushel of the grains in Australia is from 20 to 60 per cent . heavier than that of American grain . The wages of farm hands are quoted as follows : Farming men , $5 per week ; milkmen and plowmen about the same . At the last advices , which date from the eve of the new harvest , wheat was worth in Melbourne $1 35 per bushel , and oats were quoted at from 75 to 80 Bouts per bushel . In the general Melbourne market for skilled laborers we find the following quotations of wages ( without hoard or lodging ) : In the building trades , masons , bricklayers , and carpenters , $2 50 per day of eight hours ; laborers , $1 75 ; plumbers and gas-fitters , $15 per week , ( eight hours per day ; ) painters , $2 25 per clay . Bakers , first class , receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 . Butchers , $9 to $10 per week . Coopers have $2 50 for tea hours . Tailors from 25 cents an hour to $10 per week . Tinsmiths from $10 to $15 per week . Miners , $10 to $11 25 per week . The dips notes that an effort is being made to lower miners ' wages , and that in several of the trades the supply of labor is greater than the demand for it . We repeat that the information here given is simply suggestive . Such as it is , it would seem to show that the conditions of life in Australia are not strikingly different from those in our own country , and when we consider the risk au emigrant runs from change of climate , the disadvantages he labors under from ignorance of customs and methods of work and business , and the discomfort of separation from friends , there is no very obvious advantage in the change . At the same time , men of enterprise and stamina will find in Australia communities as sober , energetic , and honest as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , cheap Government , and a field whore fortune and credit are by no means unattainable.
