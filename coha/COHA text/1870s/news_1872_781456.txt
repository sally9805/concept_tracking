txt The diamonds of Arizona and the silver mountains of Utah are thrown into the shade , and the splendors of Golconda and of furthest Ind are set at nought forever . The machinations of in gold will henceforth become ridiculous , because utterly powerless , and the dreams of mediaeval alchymists will become realities . Such , at least , will be the astonishing results ? if a man can be depended upon who has just related to the San Francisco Chronicle a tale , which it ushers into its columns with the guarded prefix that " the future may demonstrate its truth , " and the undeniable commentary that , in such an event , " commerce will be revolutionized , " and the possessors of the secret , the wonders of which are disclosed , will be the mercantile dictators of the world . It appears that between three and four months ago , a " plain-looking ' man " of American birth walked into a San Francisco bank , and asked to see the manager . The latter was weary and not happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining stock willaterals were shrinkingtoo fast in value . Almost before the new comer opened Ins lips , the manager anticipated him by a not-over courteous refusal , " Very sorry , " he said . " but ca n't do it , Whatever it is . " The plain-looking , man made no reply , but calmly placed a leather valise on the banker 's desk before him , opened it , took out an ingot of dingy metal , and handed it to the other in silence . " said the man of " gilt-edged . " and other paper , " what of it ? Tin , ai n't it , or deleted 5 lines I 've no time to study this particular specimen . " His visitor mildly persisted , and to this end became more loquacious . " Do you know- gold when you see it ? If not , will you call in some trustworthy expert who does ? " The banker , with some reluctance . assented . A well-known assayer was summoned , and . to him the mass , with some others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked , with excitement , where it came from ; but , receiving no satisfaction , agreed to do what was requested , and took it- away for assay . The next day be came back , by appointment , meeting the two others , and produced a yellow bar . " That looks like gold . " said the banker . " Rather , " returned the assayer . " It is gold  --  nearly a thousand fine ; the finest I ever put in a crucible . " The mysterious owner said . nothing . Questions were put to him as to where . he got the precious stuff , but these were civilly evaded . He desired , as a further teat , that the bar should be sent to the mint . This , too , was done , and the bar came back in due time , transformed into eight thousand dollars worth of double eagles . The cash , by request of the stranger , was put to his credit , and he then disappeared . For a week he was not seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . expecting to find some robbery reported of an up-country treasure box . of ? which his new friend would turn out to be the hero . But this was not to be . At the end . of a week the latter came back , and this time laid before the excited banker a much larger quantity of the same metal . It is gold , " he cried , " pure gold , like the last . Where did . you get it ? " The stranger looked with steadfastness at his interlocutor , and replied , calmly : " I made it- ? I made it myself . " The astonishment of the banker was , of course , unbounded , and was not diminished . by the particulars afterward confided to him . Our modern Midas announced that after long and painful effort he had discovered the secret of the transmutation of metals . He could make gold by the ton ? nay , by the shipload ; but the process he would reveal to no living soul . A bargain was however effected whereby he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friend undertaking its cautions and profitable distribution . The latter did not fail , by way of getting his chance in , so good a thing , to point out the troubles and . dangers that might arise ? from those interested in values the momentous discovery would impair  --  were not eecresy , as to the identity of the inventor , and an intermediary , such as his own bank , judiciously employed . At the time the article of the Chronicle appeared , more than half a million of coin made of the manufactured gold , is said to have been put in circulation , and plenty more of the same sort was soon to follow . The intention of the partners , as stated by the Chronicle , is to try to make San Francisco " the centre of all commercial exchanges , and the great depository of the products of the world . " This part of the otherwise highly credible story , we confess , strikes us as rather dubious . It is intelligible that men should contemplate such a scheme , whose resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may literally roll in gold , cui Bono ? Why not make any other place such a centre , or why bother about a centre at all ? We quite agree with the Chronicle that it is " frightful to reflect what may be the result of their ambition , if it should pass beyond reasonable limits , " and suggest , with deference , to these lucky holders of the Philosopher 's Stone , that a judicious and patriotic use of a trifle out of their colossal means would enable the Government to return at once to specie payment . It is certain that- any use they make of the discovery , must tend to bring down the price of gold , and they might as well earn the credit of doing without delay what they can not help doing at no distant future .
