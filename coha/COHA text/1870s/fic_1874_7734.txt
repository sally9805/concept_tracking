Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : TO MRS . CHARLES LOWE . from To Mrs. Charles Lowe ( 1874 ) Forgive a heart whose thoughts perchance intrude Upon the privacy of blessed grief That seeks in heaven-communing solitude Hope 's ecstasy and earthly woe 's relief ! We in thy loss a friend , a brother , mourn ; Thy gain has given us , too , one angel more : Not far from us , we feel , has he been borne , Exiled to some remote and shadowy shore . That pure and generous soul , that tender heart , The mind that looked from that clear , lustrous eye , While memory lives in us , can ne'er depart ,  --  Still help make glad our earth and bright our sky . " True to the kindred points of heaven and home , " How true he was none knows so well as thou ! And since the angels came to call him home , How home-like heaven ,  --  thy home , how heavenly now ! " ' T is home where'er the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there where its treasure is : With heavenly treasure how enriched thou art , Who such an earthly one henceforth shall miss ! How precious is the memory of that day , When , looking out upon the beauteous sea , With tranquil , trustful , thankful look he lay , Waiting the pilot Death to set him free ! That sea  --  God 's boundless deep of love and light  --  On which , earth 's moorings loose , he launched away , Oh , does it not to faith , almost to sight , Murmur and glow around us night and day ? And there , he is at large ,  --  at work , at rest ! And is not now henceforth this earthly isle , To us who here await the Lord 's behest , Made sweeter , holier by his farewell smile ? These words  --  I feel how weak and poor they are To memories , griefs , and hopes so rich as thine ,  --  Read by thee kindly , will not haply jar Upon the music of that song divine , Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee with in sorrow 's lonely hours , While round that pale , transfigured brow they twine A heavenly chaplet of immortal flowers . C. T. Brooks .
