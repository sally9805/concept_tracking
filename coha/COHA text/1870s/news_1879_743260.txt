txt It iS very evident to those who have had opportunity to watch closely the proceedings of the United States Senate committee now in session in New-Orleans , and haying under investigation the Kellogg-Spofford contest , that the object of the Democrats is not so much to seat Mr. Spofford as to oust Kellogg and place some third man in the position to which , under every law and precedent , ho Kellogg is entitled . The fact is , that the gentlemen who now control the dominant party in this State have no sympathy with Mr : Spofford , and are not particularly anxious for his success . He occupies a social position far above theirs , and has nothing in common with thatn . He is a native of a New-England State , but is nevertheless thoroughly identified with the old school Louisiana Democrats , the men who before the war ruled by reason of their wealth and social standing , and who , if the truth were known , had a very strong suspicion that an " ordinary white man " was not very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this slightly contracted notion , but he is fully identified with an aristocratic clique which did hold such yiews , and , like many other good men , he has to bear the burdens of his associates . The men who DOW control the Democracy of Louisiana are , or at least in the olden time would have been , " ordinary white men . " They are all possessed of much common sense , of great shrewdness , and executive ability of a high ' order , but they were not slaveholders ; they do not , and did not before the war , belong to the planter aristocracy ; and , in consequence , it can not be disguised that they are rather looked down upon by what I may call Mr. Spofford 's set . Such being the case , it can readily be understood that they are not at all . anxious to see him seated in Kellogg 's place . What they do want is to have the Senate declare the seat vacant , and then to have it filled by Major E. A. Burke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of what is known as the Wormley conference , gained a national reputation . Indeed , there is a distinct and direct bargain between Major Burke and his friends , who are all-powerful in New-Orleans , on the one hand , and Mr. Wiltz , the Democratic nominee for Governor , on the other , that after the latter shall have been counted into the Executive office , he will , should the opportunity offer , appoint Major Burke a Senator of the United States . This be would be able to do should Mr. Kellogg 's seat be declared vacant , and the Legislature not be in session , and , as under the new Constitution the General Assembly meets only once in ? two years , Burke would at least be certain of holding the place for that time . To brine about this result , all the power of the Democratic managers here is now being directed . Of course , their first object is to overthrow Kellogg . and to that end they are workiug assiduously and with all the many peculiar appliances at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regularly organized system of false swearing . Louisiana has already gained a somewhat unenviable reputation in this direction . When the pending investigation is closed , there is no doubt that it will be widely extended . Already at least three of the witnesses have clearly perjured themselves . For instance , Bernhard Williams. , whom the Republicans are prepared to prove was a deserter from the Confederate Army , who was arrested for theft , and , with a shaved head and attached to a ball and chain , marched through New-Orleans , deliberately swears . of his owri knowledge , , pending the investigation of his case i Washington , Senator Kellogg bribed seven witnesses to perjure themselves in his behalf . This bribery , according to Williams , was all done at one time and in one room , each of the bribed witnesses seeing the amount of money which was given to his neighbor . Of course , this story is , on its face , a deliberate lie . William Pitt Kellogg has been frequently charged with many corrupt practices . Ho has been most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but until now no man has ever intimated that he was a fool . It is very clear that no one but an out-and-out idiot would/bribe seven men in the presence of each other . Mr. Kellogg has been well enough- chooled in the ways of the Louisiana Democracy not to fall into so grave an error . Indeed , there is not inNew-Orleans a Politician of either party who believes the story told by Williams , and yet , singularly enough , the Democrats on , and before , the committee regard it as one of the main props of their case . Testimony almost as ridiculous as that given by Williams is gravely listened to day after day , and as the inquiry progresses , it becomes more and more apparent that the one object of the local leaders of the Democracy is to so cover the case with apparent fraud and corruption on both sides that the majority of the committee will report that the adherents of both Kellogg and Spofford , if not those gentlemen themselves , were guilty of gross frauds , and that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the object of the Democratic managers in New-Orleans , the Democrats on the committee  --  Senators Hill and Vance  --  are , of course , principally concerned in getting Kellogg out and any Democrat in . Whether it bo Spofford or some other sound party man is Immaterial to them . Their great anxiety in this direction will be the better understood when it is remembered that the political complexion of the Senate may hang upon the decision arrived at in the pending contest . The upper house , as at present constituted , consists of 43 Democrats , including David Davis , and 33 Republicans . On or Mere the 4th of March , 1881 , the following Democratic Senators will retire : Eaton , of Connecticut ; Bayard , of Delaware ; Jones , of Florida ; , of Indiana ; Cockrell , of Missouri ; Randolph , of New-Jersey ; fiernan , of N ew-York ; ' I hurman , of Ohio ; Wallace , of Pennsylvania ; Bailey , of Tennessee , Maxey , of Texas ; Withers . of Virginia ; and Hereford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured in advance that Messrs . Eaton . Kernan , Randolph , Wallace , and Thurman will have Republican successors , while 9nly one of the outgoing Republicans , Mr. Bruce . of Mississippi , is likely to be succeeded by a Democrat . The changes which now seem to be certain will make the Senate consist of 39 Democrats still , including Mr. David Davis , and 37 Republicans . Thera is every prospect that Mr. , of Indiana , will be succeeded by a Republican . This change would tie the two parties , and , by the casting vote of the Vice-President , give the Senate to the Republicans , Still further , the Democrats are alarmed by the knowledge that Mr. David Davis may desert them at any moment and without the least warning , and that Mr. , of New-Jersey , who is very sick with a chronic malady , is likely to die and be replaced by a Republican , thus giving that party a working majority in the upper house , and ousting from their snug berths the little army of ex-Confederat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing all this , the Democrats are , of course , most anxious to delay the coming of the day of doom by capturing the seat now held by Mr. Kellogg . With this end In view , two of their.most faithful representatives are now here wading through a flood of mendacity , perjury , and testimony doctored to Injure the Republican case . The investigation has been reopened after the ease had been decided and closed by the highest tribunal having jurisdiction . It has been so reopened in direct violation of every parliamentary law , ' precedent , and usage of the Senate , Davin gone thus far , there is no reason to believe that the unscrupulous majority will hesitate to declare that Senator Kellogg was never legally elected . The conspiracy may be carried to the . end . It is even stated that Senator Butler . of South Carolina . does not intend to live up to his bargain with Senator Cameron , of Pennsylvania  --  the bargain to which ho owes his seat ; that he will break his word pledged when he was admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he does so , if the plot succeeds , it must heput upon the record that the Democratic majority unseated a Senator whose title was better than theirs . Their title is merely a prima facie one , their seats never having beau contested . Mr. Kellogg 's is not only prima facie , but has been disputed and solemnly adjudged to be faultless . C.
