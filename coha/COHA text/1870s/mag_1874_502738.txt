" THE WETHEREL AFFAIR . " By J. W. De Forest . New York : Sheldon &amp; Co. 1873 . In this latest production Mr. De Forest subjects himself to closer criticism than his earlier ones invited . While describing distant scenes and strange manners , he needed only to preserve verisimilitude ; but when he ventui*es among familiar social relations , and introduces into his story places and characters known to ever*r one , he must be true to reality . His present work stands that test successful ly . Its mystery might well have existed ; the police records contain the outlines of stranger ones yet unsolved . Its characters are natural ; at least the graver ones are , for we meet them every day , though we do not often take the trouble to pierce below the surface , as the author has done , to their structure and motives . As to the lighter ones , the vogue of milliners ' magazines proves that Lmogene Eleonores actually live and move , and have their fantastic being ; the most careless eye and ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only one whose absurdities suggest a doubt whether any mortM could ever really persist through all his waking hours in deporting himself as so prodigious and incongruous a fool . The mystery of the plot depends on a mistake in personal identity . It is a hazardous and not very original motif for a train of tragical misunderstandings and baffling complications , yet it is naturally introduced , and conducted and revealed with skill . Its nianagemnent leads the author to a survey of some evils in modern civilization , in the course of which some forcible passages are devoted to portraying the class of detectives , " usually models either of eminent dishonesty or of eminent incompetency . " He finds occasion , too , for brief discussion of many other points in which the gospel of democracy , as put in practice , is anything but consonant with that other one preached from the pulpit . Not a few shrewd reflections on social anomalies and political falsities are put into the mouth of the 54 gentle philosopher Walter Lehming . It is he , indeed , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is his ingenuity and patience that foresee and work bravely for the end , and it is he that suf. fers most deeply , with least physical power to endure , when that end comes fortunately to the others . There is an element of graciousness mingled with the moral force of his character that wins our sympathy ; and our respect for the moral force itself is the greater because it seems the fruit of crosses and selt*denial . In all the other commendable persons , the tough quality of the New England fibre is that which sustains them in doubt and trouble ; he alone  --  and the preposterous Bowlder-are distinctly set apart from the Wetherel stock . Nestoria Bernard is a fresh , pure , and original conception . She is portrayed as governed by two deep simple emotions-a frank and innocent love for Wetherel , and a dominant religious sense  --  and the conflict between these distracts and almost destroys her . Her conscience is strong with all the inherited instincts of Puntanismn , yet has never been misdirected to morbidness . The pages describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the novel , in their keen analysis and painful scrutiny into the springs of human strength and weakness . There is a close enough family likeness in the minor traits of character to create an interest in her cousin Alice too , in spite of her career among girls of the period , which gives the author opportunities for truthful and amusing sketches depicting a certain sphere of city society . There are plenty of ludicrous errors or grave mischief in the social usages and the political practices prevailing in our country , which have not yet fallen under the lash of censure in fiction . Our a'uthor has treated those which come within the range of this novel with so sound a morality and so dignified a tone of rebuke , while at the same time avoiding the common mistake of making them literally the burden rather thanincidentally the moral of his story , that we trust he will not // neglect the many inviting occasions to deal with others , which may give full scope to his undeniable power of analyzing and skill in grouping and developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Personal Experiences with the Indians . " By General G. A Custer , United States Army . illustrated . New York : Sheldon &amp; Company . General Custer has given us in these papers what is really a detailed history of two important campaigns in the Indian country . The first of these was undertaken to repel the outbreak in 1865- ' 66 , and covered the territory watered by the Kansas , Republican , and Platte rivers . This was the most serious of the conflicts which the Indians had attempted for many years , excepting the Sioux war in Minnesota early in our civil war . It was in fact little less than a general insurrection of the tribes which would have been of the gravest character but for the energetic measures planned by the Government , and conducted with great success by Generals Hancock , Custer , and others . The second was the effective winter campaign south of the Arkansas in 1868- ' 69 , in which the active operations carried out with immense labor and suffering , at a season when the Indians are incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet we have had since its close . General Custer does not confine himself to the expeditions in which he was personally engaged . The unity of his historical account is preserved by giving the operations of other officers , such as the perilous encounter of the frontiersmen under General Forsyth , and General Sully 's movements on the Arkansas , the Kidder and Fort Kearney massacres , etc . Nor is the scope of his book confined to mere details of field service . He enters into the diplomacy of our Government , discusses its policy toward the Indians , and strives to show what is the true path in this much tangled Indian problem . The book before us is a collection of the papers under the same title which have appeared in " The Galaxy 's during the last two years . They were written in an easy style , and the mode of their publication was probably designedly selected in the hope of reaching the people with that directness which the modern system of periodical publication permits . But though cast in a mould which makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time high in favor , as sketches of a peculiar and steadily waning phase of army life , they have a value which is apart from and higher than any cursory picture , however life-like , can be . There is an earnest purpose hid b*hind their light and easy language . General Custer has through long and prominent intercourse with the Indian tribes gained the position of an authority on all questions concerning them , and in this book he shows what his views are , and enforces them less by argument than by the relation of his personal experience . It is the testimony of a competent witness , and his book has especial importance from the fact that it is to a certain extent an explanation and justification of the policy upon which our Government has at last settled . That policy is in the main to establish an effective restraint upon the In* dians , and restrict them to specified ranges of territory beyond which they are not to roam , and within which the whites are not allowed to penetrate at will . The hardship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Indian 's temperament , and that , in common with other uncivilized races , he can not exchange wildness for civilization without suffering rapid decay . This our author does not seem to think inevitable : At all events the fact that the Indians can not be allowed to murder and rob at will is a patent one , and he is of opinion that they can be prevented from doing so by a proper guardianship on the part of the army  --  a guardianship that will still leave the savage his best possible chance for existence in the face of the steadily oncoming whites . Turning from the special purpose of the book , which as we have said is to impress upon his fellow-countrymen the author 's views as one unusually well qualified to form a just opinion , to those details which make the incidents of camp life on the Plains , we find the author has gathered for us a perfect store-house of field lore and frontier fun . There are anecdotes enough to fill an encyclopedia , information concerning Indian habits and Western life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appreciation of humor , and in every chapter the Western scout // appears with as great regularity , and fills as important a place as the fool in a play . One commentator on Shakespeare says that the latter used his fools as his mouthpiece , expressing through them his own individuality , while loftier characters , like kings , conspirators , and lovers , are ideal creations . General Custer seems to put the Scout to about the same use , and in his rude English he has embodied acuteness and wisdom learned in years of hard service . In doing this he renders deserved honor to a noble and manly class . As to the Indians , the account he gives of them and their deeds bears out the conclusions ethnologists have reached concerning the character of those races which either preceded , or had a different origin from , the stock which has produced civilized man . He seems to incline ( though not a positive adherent ) to the theory that the Indians are to be connected with the Jews , and it is satisfactory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes with which I have been brought in contaet carry with them a mysterious something which is regarded with the utmost sacredness , and upon which the eye of no white man at least is ever permitted to rest . " This mysteriously guarded trcasure is supposed to be something like the Ark of the Hebrews , but how it is that , after all the intercourse of white men with the Indians , nothing more definite is known about it , we are left to conjecture . As a writer General Custer is easy , if sometimes diffuse , and chooses his incidents well . His descriptions of how marches and fights in the Indian country are managed are excellent . The part he played in the campaigns described was as honorable as his record during the war , when the name of the dashing cavalryman was in every one 's mouth . To his decision and good management in many important junctures the Far West is largely indebted for its present comparative freedom from alarm ; and in relating the course of his operations he exhibits a modesty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the respect of the reader . " TOINETTE . " A novel . By Henry Churton . New York : J. B. Ford &amp; Co . " Toinette " is a story of old Southern life in some of its least agreeable aspects . Toinette , or Antoinette , is the name of a slave owned by Manuel Hunter , and given to his son Geoffrey Hunter as a Christmas gift . She is a bright , docile girl , almost white , the daughter of an old woman named Mabel . Manuel Hunter had promised Mabel and Toinette their freedom , and the breach of this promise leads to much unhappiness*and injury . Geoffrey carries off Toinette , and , becoming interested in her , b*gins to educate her . They live together for a short time , but in that short time she is very nearly murdered by sonic person unknown , who gets into Lovett Lodge ( Geoffrey 's place , given him by his father ) , in a mysterious way . The house , indeed , has a secret chamber , and appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had lived there with a slave woman named Belle , to whom he was greatly attached . This scandalous connection , however , he at last determined to break up , free Belle and her children , and unite himself in marriage to one Betty Certain , a white woman . This projected marriage was looked upon , however , by his acquaintances as only less objectionable than his former connection , for Betty Certain belonged , or nearly belonged , to the poor white caste , and was therefore no match for Lovett . Nevertheless he determined to carry out his plan , and tried to make his sisters receive his future wiKe amtcably . This , however , he hardly succeeded in doing . Just as he was on the point of being married he was murdered . Suspicion pointed to his sisters , but there was no proof . Everything was now involved in doubt and difficulty . Arthur Lovett had given the Lodge to Belle and her children , but whether they were free and the owners of the property , or slaves , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At any rate they were sold again , and the property itself was bought by Manuel Hunter . All these facts come out when , after the attempted murder of Toinette , Betty Ccrtam is called in to nurse her , and she discovers , much to her astonishment , that the weapon used to kill Toinette is the same used before to kill Arthur Lovett . In the end the reader finds that Mabel , the mother of Toinette , is the person who attempted her death ; that she was in reality Belle , Lovett 's mistress , and that she had intended to kill Geoffrey himself . The first murder she committed because // she doubted Lovett 's intention of freeing her and her children ; in the second case she thought her own miserable history was to be repeated in Toinette . She also tries to kill Betty Certain , and in the end kills herself as an atonement for all her crimes . Meantime , however , Geoffrey Hunter has really liberated Toinette , and sent her North , where her child is born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured . As a prisoner he is nursed by Toinette . In the end she turns out to have been a free woman from the beginning , and to be the real owner of Lovett Lodge . She marries Geoffrey , who has lost his sight from the effect of his wounds , and the book ends happily . Theze is a good deal of good and a good deal of execrably bad writing in it . As a picture of Southern society of a certain kind before the war , we should say it must be very true . it succeeds very fairly to our minds in presenting the extraordinarily sordid character of the " patriarchal institution " as it used to exist . The curious mixture of love and contempt for his " girl " Toinette , in the breast of Geoffrey , is very natural , and his brutal resolution , on finding that she has , at the North , taken his name , and passes for a lady , to expose her ( she having just saved his life in the hospital ) is an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Southe'ner . " IDOLATRY . " A romance . By Julian Hawthorne . Boston : J. R. Osgood &amp; Co . The plot of this crazy book will give some faint idea of its character . It opens in Boston , and by means of a well-known device of romance writers we are introduced to two of the characters , who are sleeping in two adjoining rooms of a hotel which we take to be the Tremont House . By the usual simple machinery , we are made acquainted with something of the past history of the occupants of these two rooms , and get a wide-reaching view of very varied , mysterious , and thrilling events , happening now in the far Orient , now in neighboring New Jersey , and involving scenes and characters both Egyptian and Americo-Scandinavian . This is a sort of overture to the romance , and contains in a small space all the beauties of the work itself . For us , however , it is not worth while to discriminate between what is found in the opening and what in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest , is bathing in the pleasant waters of the Nile , swept away by the current , and carried very near a crocodile , which makes for the unfortunate lad . Nevertheless the boy is not drowned , because at this very moment a boat is coming up the river containing some blonde sons of the North , among whom is one called Thor . Thor saves the boy , and carries him West . Next we find ourselves in an Americo-Egyptian household which consists of Helen , the high - born half-sister of Dr. Glyphic ( hero is his Christian name ) , and her maid Salome , with the Egyptian boy , now grown up , in training for the church , and making love to both . Salome loves him in return , while he loves Helen with a love of the Egyptian sort . Suddenly Thor appears on the scene , and carries off Helen ( who is , however , betrothed to the other ) . Then misfortune ensues . The young Egyptian , Manetho by name , still lingers near Helen , pretending always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly revealing himself in his real character of deadly enemy to Helen , frightens her so terribly that she dies , giving birth to two children , a girl and a boy . To make a long story short , something happens to the girl , and she disappears , whether by fair or foul means there seems some doubt , and the boy turns up a grown man , the hero of the story , in the person of Balder Helwyse . Meanwhile Manetho , still planning deadly revenge upon the family of Helen , acquires the Americo-Egyptian property in New Jersey , just across the Hudson , formerly belonging to Dr. Glyphic . This place is surrounded by a very high brick wall . Outside is plain New Jersey ; inside is Egypt , with wide expanses of green grass , palm trees , strange architecture-in fact , a domicile fit to make Cheops himself feel at home . Here Manetho immures the beautiful girl Gnulemah , whom he believes to be Helen 's daughter , and educates her after a devilish fashion of his own , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan being , after givim*g her this liberal education , to send her forth into New Jersey ; and he looks forward with , delight to the ruin he will cause by her beauty and wickedness . Unfortunately , however , he only instructs // her theoretically and not practically in evil , and the result is that instead of being bad she is good . Old hero Glyphic , it should be said , is now dead , and this New Jersey property of his has been acquired by Manetho through fraud . The only human being Gnulemnah sees is her old nurse , who is in reality none other than Salome , who still loves the wicked Manetho . He does not know the nurse and Salome to be the same person , however ; indeed , we may say parenthetically that , considering the vast wisdom and profound cunning that Manetho is supposed to be endowed with , he does not appear in the pages of this narrative to know much about anything which it would have been for his own interest to know . The crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by young llelwyse and Manetho ( who calls himself Dr. Glyphic ) on the Newport boat to New York , where they fall into deep conversation during the evening . The night is so dark that they can not see each other , and yet with that strange readiness of sympathy which characterizes both the American and the Egyptian races , the subject they select for conversation is Good and Evil , and in the course of their pleasant little chat the unknown Manetho propounds some doctrines on the subject which sound very strange and even attractive to the open-minded young Helwyse-nothing else , in fact , than that what is commonly called evil is in reality good , and that if we only understood the matter rightly , lying , fraud , theft , and other forms of crime are really virtues in disguise . We must say that Manetho does not appear from his conversation to understand his own theory very well , and it is somewhat surprising to find him also revealing , in the thick darkness , to an entire stranger , the worst part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision between the boat and a schooner , and a light is shown above which reveals to Manetho the face of Heiwyse , to him , of course , looking so like that of Thor that the dead seems to have returned to life . He utters a cry , a struggle between the two ensues , and young Helwyse pitches him overboard . Nothing of this has been seen , however , and the boat , having carried away the schooner 's bowsprit , goes ahead again . Helwyse feels that he has committed a murder ( though this seems a strange conclusion for a man o* the world to come to , for there can hardly be a doubt that it was at most manslaughter ) , and finds that in the struggle he has lost some of his accoutrements , containing valuable papers , which if discovered will identify him as the murderer . However , he does not deliver himself up , though he has thoughts of doing so , bat on arriving at New York goes straight to a barber 's and has his beard taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard and top-boots  --  a most awkward dress for any one who wishes to avoid detection ) , and then strolls down to the water side , and directing his telescope at the opposite shore , he sees a castle wall enclosing a great space , and inside somewhere a lady of great beauty stretching out her arms in his direction . Few men could resist such temptation as this , and Helwyse immediately hires a boat to take him across . Arrived on the other bank , he climbs a tree and lets himself down into the interior of Manetho 's enchanted palace , this obvious means of gratifying ' one 's curiosity apparently never having occurred to the crafty Manetho . There he finds Gnulemah , and they love each other at first sight . The crafty Manetho ( who has escaped , and has never been murdered at all ) soon returns , and instead of objecting to their union is delighted to help it on , for he believes them to be brother and sister , and as the laws of New Jersey do not sanction such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evil may triumph . As usual , however , Manetho is mistaken ; they are not brother and sister , for Gnulemah is the daughter of Salome and Manetho himself . So the crafty magician 's plots all end in the happy marriage of Balder Helwyse and the young and lovely Gnulemah . In this brief account we feel that we have fallen far short of the original . We should not have thought of criticising the book at all if it were not that Mr. Hawthorne is spoken of in all directions as a rising genius ; and from his name one is led to expect or at least to hope great things . We must confess that after reading this romance , as it is called , we have only been able to come to the conclusion that the author is no genius , but that he writes astonishing rubbish . He has a good deal of inventive power , but is putting it to a very bad use . // " NIERoD OF THE SEA ; or , The American Whale Man . " By William M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the whale fishery has engaged the attention of descriptive writers , we think the reader will find Mr. Davis 's account of it essentially new . his narrative brings out the wild adventure of the pursuit , the danger as well as the toil of the running down and killing of the largest animal against which man makes war . A landsman finds it hard to reconcile the usual report of the whale 's high intelligence and great powers with the fact that a ship can find him and a boaly 's load of men capture him . But Mr. Davis shows how these things are reconcilable . He represents the whale as an animal which when struck will fight with fury , not crushing his opponent merely in the roll of his huge body and wide-spread flukes , but fighting with the intention of destroying-crushing a boat and then turning one by one on its crew . This treatment of the subject , while instructive to men , will probably put " Nimrod of the Sea " among the classics of children . The author remarks upon the astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy when we compare with it the accurate details which have been ob tamed concerning the habits and structure of animals which have no relation whatever to man 's personal welfare . He gives drawings and descriptions which , while not scientific , enable the reader to form a good idea of what may be called the great subdivisions of the whale . In one respect his b6ok is trustworthy ; it will never entice a boy to sea unless the most disagreeable details of a repulsive life are fascinating to him . The story is perhaps a little long drawn out , but as it covers a three or four years ' voyage , and takes the reader to many lands , this is perhaps excusable . It has several illustrations , which essentially help the reader to comprehend the descriptions of whales and whale capture . " THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSE . " By J. G. Holland . New York : Scribner , Armstrong &amp; Co . We should be sorry to spoil the pleasure of the reader by relating to him beforehand the story of this poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , we may say that the author in a few prefatory verses indicates his theme in this way : In all the crowded universe , he says , there is " but one stupendous Word , " which , it may readily be inferred , we learn , a page or two later , means Love ; and the " humble tale " of Dr. Holland relates to a certain Philip , " bred in northern climes , " who " preached the great word , " which the author , in his peculiar way , strives *o " sing , " as he calls it . Philip brought Mildred from her far home in the South , to be the mistress of his manse ; and their tortunes are the burden of the story . Dr. Holland is so well known as a poet and story teller , that whatever he writes is sure to be read ; yet if this were his first work , we should hesitate some time before being willing to say whether it would be likely to prove a success . The verse runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , the verses and words are frequently meaningless , and the morality of Dr. Holland is not precisely what can be called original . To take the first two verses for ex-ample : A fluttering bevy left the gate With hurried steps , and sped away , And then a coach with drooping freight , Wrapped in its film of dusty gray , Stopped , and the pastor and his mate Stepped forth , and passed the waiting door , And closed it on the gazing street . " Oh , Philip ! " She could say no more , " Oh Mildred ! You 're at home , my sweet , The old life closed , the new before . " It seems to us that it requires a good deal of perspicacity to make out of what elements of the population the " fluttering bevy " were composed ; we are inclined to think , if it means anything , it must refer to the crowd of urchins of both sexes who always appear on the scene when a wedding is taking place ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should " flutter , " or why the word " bevy " should apply to them . The word may contain a dark reference to some local custom ; but in another edition this , it seems to us , ought to be cleared up in a foot note . Then , what is the meaning of " drooping " freight ? There is no evidence at this stage of the story that either of the wedded pair had begun to " droop , " and it seems almost out of the question that there was any freight in the literal and commercial sense of the word on the bridal coach ; while if this supposition be excluded , what have we left save that the // bride or bridegroom , or both , were of unusual size ? But Dr. Holland uses words in such novel ways that we must not expect a too definite meaning . For instance , on p. 37 , we find this line : The bride slid down the oaken stair , when the author evidently means not that she came down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came down in an unusually graceful and light , or as Dr. Holland would probably say , lightsome manner . By some people such blemishes as these may be considered trifling . We trust , however , that in subsequent editions they may not appear , for these little ambiguities and fatuities mar the even mediocrity of Dr. Holland 's work . " Tnu OLD RucnsE IN CANADA . " By Francis Parkman , author of " Pioneers of France in the New World , " " The Jesuits in North America , " and " The Discovery of the Great West . " Boston : Little , Brown &amp; Company . The histories of our childhood contained one solitary picturesque incident relating to Canada  --  the scaling of the heights of Abraham by Wolfe in 1759 , and the brief conflict ending in his and Montcalm 's death . Outside of this epi sode , the history of Canada was in the minds of most Americans a blank . Latterly , however , the growing commerce between the two countries , the discussions as to the basis on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular invasion of the " provinces " every summer by tourists , sportsmen , or fishermen , have done much to clear up this obscurity , and make the actual Canada of today familiar ground . What circumstances have done for us in one way , Mr. Parkman 's researches have done in another ; and as the public in its travelling capacity has made itself acquainted with the Saguenay , Quebec , and La Chine , the reading public has been made familiar by Mr. Parkman with the doings of the Jesuits on the borders of Lake Ontario , with the struggles which raged two centuries ago between provincial church and provincial State , with the lawless adventurers of the coureurs de bois , the heroic self-sacrifice of the religious pioneers , and the wonderful daring and endurance of the hardy men who penetrated the woods with other objects than the saving of Indians ' souls . In the " Old Regime in Canada " he gives a history more political than some of his former books . He introduces the reader to the councils of Louis XIV. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , and the condition of society there . We know of nothing more interesting than his account of the social system which the French king endeavored to build up on the shores of the St. Lawrence . The wonder frequently felt at the decline of the French power in America is considerably heightened after reading Mr. Parkman 's pages . Why did the English , in the struggles between the races on this continent , beat the others ? It was not because they tried to do so giore systematically . The plans for building up French power in Canada were far more elaborate and astute than anything that England or the Englishmen of the colonies ever dreamed of . Everything was thought for ; everything provided . One is tempted at first to think that the French over did their system of inspection , supervision , and protection ; but on the whole , they seem to have done as well as any one would . If French civilization was to spread here , it must certainly be by French means . We could not expect the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system by means of trial by jury , or habeas corpus , and every means except such as those which belonged to other civilizations were tried , and tried with honesty and patience . Nevertheless , &amp;ench power seemed for some reason to be doomed . Canada lost rather than gained ground , and the end of the costly experiment of Louis XIV . is the " Dominion . " The questions connected with the decline of national power and race capacity for development seem among the most insoluble with which even the enlightened sociogist of to-day has to do . " Natural selection " may explain them , but what we need to know is how " natural selection " works in particular cases . " HISTORY or THE UNITED STATES , from the Discovery of the American Continent . " By George Bancroft . Vol . X. Boston : Little , Brown &amp; Company . This volume , which is the fourth of those dealing with the revolutionary period , brings us down to the year 1782 , and // embraces a very interesting part of the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some very distinct virtues and some equally distinct - vices . He is painstaking in his collection of material , and his ordinary style of narrative or descriptive writing is clear and intelligible . He has , however , the defect of exaggerating now and then to his own mind and to that of the reader the magnitude of the topic before him , by the use of inflated language , and there is also a deficiency in him of that calm , judicial imperturbability which this generation is accustomed to demand-though not often to get-from its historical teachers . There are too many indications scattered through Mr. Bancroft 's writing that he regards the creation and rise of this Government to its present powerful position rather as a great dramatic episode in what might be called the epic df freedom and progress , than in the steady unidealizing way in which he would look at the history of other countries . At the very beginning of this volume ( p. 36 ) , the author , speaking of the effect on England which the failure of our revolution would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and justice , which is indeed one for all mankind , was at least seen to be one and the same for the whole English race , it appeared more and more clearly that the total subjugation of America would be the prelude to the repression of liberty in the British Isles . " In this sentence we get a view of a theory of history which is certainly misleadingthat of the course of events all over the world consisting of a struggle for liberty carried on by the " party of freedom and justice " against the paety of wrong and injustice . As a piece of rhetoric this may be very effective , but the struggles carried on in any nation between repressive and privileged governments and the people are but a small part of their whole history , and to get a way of looking at the world as a sort of arena for hand-tohand conflicts between the saviours of humanity and the minions of despots , certainly leads to an oblivion of many interesting considerations , which ar&amp;also of importance . To show that this tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , we may refer to p. 96 , where we find it stated that " every dynasty which furnished troops to Eng land " ( for employment in America against the confederated colonies ) " has ceased to reign , except one , which has now for its sole representative an aged and childless man . " This is apparently mentioned as if it were the result of the wickedness of the German potentates in sending mercenary troops over here , and as a sort of awful historical warning to all future Hessians . But France fought on our side , and France has lost territory and influence in a far more striking way than any of the smaller German States . Are we to infer that this is the result of our alliance ? There is as much connection in the one case as there is in the other . The disposition to exaggerate and inflate leads Mr. Bancroft into the unnecessary interpolation of a good deal of the history of Germany into this volume , and to the adoption , for one of his chapters , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is always an ungracious task to point out the defects of a writer who has devoted himself for years to a great historical undertaking , but Mr. Bancroft 's high position as an historian makes it ne*cessary that attention should be called to the blemishes of his work . " EGYPT AND ICELAND I* THE YEAR 1874 . " By Bayard Taylor . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . For different reasons Egypt and Iceland were never better worth visiting than just now . The present year will be remembered by all interested in Iceland as that of her millenial celebration , while it may be hereafter notable as the last of strictly Icelandic history ; as negotiations for emigration to America on so vast a scale as to embrace the entire population are said to be already in progress . But whether the Icelanders come to this country or not , every year now threatens some break-up ; in these migratory and unsettled days no community in which material discomfort and intellectual cultivation are so widely contrasted as in Iceland can be considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an unusual amount of entertaining writing about Iceland ; Mr. Taylor 's letters and an account published by Mr. Bryce being both far above the level of ordinary description .

Mr. Taylor had very good opportunities , and has made good use of them . Egypt is undergoing such rapid changes that it apparently behooves every one who wishes to know anything about the Egypt of the past to go there at once . Not only are railroads and canals transforming and developing the industries of the countries , while under the management of the Khedive vast social changes and alteratiofls in the land tenure are beginning , but the very climate itself , which has been the providential means of preserving intact the historical remains of the oldest civilization of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal , the increasing cultivation of trees , or some other reasons , the rainless sky of the country of the Nile is gradually growing more like that of Europe .

At the same time , however , that the institutions and climate begin to assume a new face , the researches of the archmologists are bringing to light with every year more and more valuable discoveries ; so that as Egypt becomes modern she becomes more ancient too ; and the same telegraph which brings us quotations of the price of Egyptian cotton , or the floating of a loan on the London market , brings news , perhaps , also of some new monument discovered by M. Mariette , or some other patient Egyptologist , which carries us back an additional thousand years in the chronicles of time . Indeed , when we see before us unearthed statues which were thousands of years old when Phidias was born , we begin to feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison of geological epochs rather than of periods of human history . But the facts can not be disputed , and we can only wonder at the good fortune of the age in which we live-which , whatever evil may be said of it , has certainly revealed man to himself more thoroughly than any of its predecessors . " THE DOCTRINE or E'iroLurmoN : its Data , its Principles , its Speculations , hind its Theistic Bearings . " By Alexander Winchell , L.L. D. New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . Dr. Winchell has attempted in this book to summarize the doctrine of evolution with all the arguments for and against it . Such a task would be formidable in any case , but to embody it in a little volume of one hundred and twenty-three pages is an achievement of no ordinary character . It is well done . The author shows remarkable powers of condensation-powers which can come only from a thorough knowledge of the subject united to a perspicuous , exact , and clear style . We have read few books which present so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning is condensed . There are so many of these that we fear many readers will think the style unnecessarily severe and trying . But though loaded in unusual measure with phrases which , while not closely technical , are still rigidly scientific in character , the work is in the best sense of the term pleasant reading . Exact language is often suggestive , and the language of this book is especially so . The author 's method is first to explain the doctrine of evolution and present the leading arguments in its favor . Next he gives an excellent and concise summary of the various theories of development , and after presenting the leading arguments for genetic relationship , he proceeds to discuss the prominent objections to specific derivation , classing them under three heads : 1 . The field of the facts . 2 . The field of the physiological forces . 3 . The field of abstract ideas . After discussing spontaneous generation , he finally turns to the theistic bearings of the subject . He closes by giving his own views as derived from his studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that evolution does not exclude the idea of a First Cause . He considers that physical studies alone are not capable of leading man to a knowledge of the true origin of life , and says that the requirement of a Creator , " back of the initial point of the succession of physical phases , " is " one of the clearest and strongest intuitions of the human soul . " Science can do all but determine the " Ffrst Cause , " because the rule of the universe is a rule of law which // can be investigated , but when we seek to know how that law was established , reason must step in to answer the last inquiries . Of the suggested methods by which variation of species may be accomplished , lie seems to favor the filiative or genetic processes . This book , with its ample proofs of wide and well-digested reading , will add to Dr. Winchell 's reputation . The references to authors are in themselves a good index to the leading biological literature . " hYDROPHOBIA : Means of Avoidino* its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scientific Soirdes of the Sorbonne . " By H. Bonley . Translated by A. Liautard , M. D. , V. S. New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . This lecture describes with great minuteness the known symptoms of rabies in dogs . The first is a change in the animal 's habits and looks ; he is restless and melancholy , but instead of being inclined to bite , he is on the contrary unusually affectionate . He is not afraid of water , but welcomes it , and tries to drink even when contraction of the throat prevents his swallowing . The desire to bite is an essential characteristic of a later stage , and is at first exhibited upon inanhnate objects or even upon his own body , which has lost the sense of pain . A marked change takes place in his voice . The descriptions of symptoms are sufficiently ex act , the author tells us , to enable any person to form an opinion in regard to his dog , and he speaks of several masters who recognized hydrophobia by the descriptions given in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot iron , and whatever other temporary application is made , this should always be resorted to at the earliest opportunity . If neither hot iron , lunar caustic , gunpowder , nitric acid , nor other means of cauterization is at hand , press the wound , suck and wash it , and apply a tight ligature . One of the most remarkable points brought forward by the author is that when a dog is in what might be called the passive stage of rabies , the sight of another'dog will always bring on an attack of raving and the propensity to bite . This is also true of other animals , who are excited to raving at sight of a dog . It is a piece of good fortune that the dog 's master is in less danger than any other person , and the author thinks that in case of madness the master ought always to boldly approach the dog and chain him . The statistics of hydrophobia given in this pamphlet are not full , but such as they are they may fairly justif*r the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog has gone too far , and that measures should be taken to repress it and lessen the number of these animals attendant upon man . " PHYSIOLOGY FOR PRACTICAL U SE . " Edited by James Hinton . With an introduction by E. L. Youmans . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co . This book is a collection of papers written by several professional men , and published in the " People 's Magazine , " a popular English periodical . Their object was to teach physiology , with especial reference to the promotion of health , by the diffusion of correct information concerning the structure and functions of the human organism . The treatment of the various subjects is not , therefore , a thorough one , in a scientific sense , but it is ample for the purpose , and the style is adapted to the comprehension of persons who are not instructed in anatomy , being indeed much less loaded with technical terms than most books of the kind . The latest discoveries in the field of physiology are . covered , and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to a minimum , and only the best proved results are relied upon . We say this in spite of the fact that some of the views presented are still in controversy . In addition to the structure and functions of the organs of sense , the book discusses such subjects as corpulence , the bath , pain , sleeplessness , etc . In treating of the action of alcohol the ideas of the English school of physicians are followed , alcohol being represented as a food , and as acting by virtue of its strong reducing power . It deoxidizes the blood , and therefore affects most highly and hamediately those organs , like the brain and other nervous centres , which require the most nutrient blood , or that which can yield oxygen the most readily . Cornbined with the special information of the work are many suggestive references to the part which some of the organs have played in the history of the human race . It is shown that the nose now exists in a // state of arrested usefulness , having been supplanted as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater capacity for education , and which also is so correlated to man 's powers over nature , as to serve the purpose of expression in a much higher degree than the nose . Altogether this " Physiology " will be found to be one of the best for common use . " CAMPAIGNING ON THE Oxus AND THE FALL or KHIVA . " By J. A. McGahan . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . Mr. McGahan is a war correspondent to the backbone , full of pluck , a vivid and picturesque writer , with plenty of tact and adroitness . As the New York " Herald " correspondent , he risked his life among Kirghiz and Turcomans , evading Russian officers and patrols of Cossacks , sent to drive him back from the frontier , and finally secured what he was sent for , news for the " Herald " which no one else could get . The story of his chase after Kauffman 's column , and of the many impediments which he overcame by pluck and perseverance , is very interesting and even exciting . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Russian column , and Khiva fallen , the question is apt to recur , " Was it worth the trouble ? " This question forces itself upon any one who reads Mr. McGahan 's book expecting to find any really valuable information therein , for of this there is hardly anything . Of the Kirghiz we learn nothing that was not told us many years since in Atkinson 's " Siberia " and " Amoor , " and the Khivan and Tartar news is a mere repetition of Vamb*ry . That this is not the author 's fault , but that of his position , is true . Mr. McGahan is a quick , shrewd observer , and modest withal . For the latter quality , indeed , he is wonderful , as compared with most " Herald " correspondents . Such a passage as the following ( p. 423 ) makes one think better of the man himself than all the rest of a very fascinating book . He says : " It may be expected that I should say something of the political situation of the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have but little to say . I do not deem that the mere fact of my having been in Central Asia during a short campaign cnables me to say anything new on the question , and there are men who have never been there at all far more competent to speak on it than myself . " These words only make one regret that a man evidently so keen , honest , and capable should have been compelled to take such a hasty glimpse of a subject so full of interest as Central Asia . In a military point of view , one fact ap-. pears plain . The Russians , . who had failed against Khiva many times before , narrowly escaped another failure in 1873 . Had the Khan been provided with the merest semblance of disciplined forces , had the English assisted him with a few officers to teach his swarms of magnificent cavalry , Kauffmann would probably have shared the fate of former generals , and the English would now have no cause to tremble for the future safety of their Indian empire . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garrisoned fort , and Khiva is no longer a foe but a friend . Another fact equally patent is , that Russia holds her power over the wild tribes of Turkistan by the merest thread , and that the genius of another Tamerlane , if it were assisted by England with firearms , might unite all these clashing tribes and sweep Russian domination from the face of the earth in Central Asia . The foes with which Kauffman had to contend were only heat and thirst . The Khan 's resistance was wholly insignificant . With a leader to unite the , brave Turcomans , so wretchedly mismanaged by the Khan of Khiva , there seems to be no reason , even in the nineteenth century , why the wave of Tartar conquest might not flow again .
