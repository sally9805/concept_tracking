txt One of the many foolish sayings which are common in the world is that " Republics are ungrateful . " We do not see where the evidence of it is to be found in our own Republic . If we look around , we shall observe that some of the men who occupy great positions , or who exercise potent influence over other men in great positions . are those who have rendered distinguished services to the people . We can not go over the list  --  it would take too much time , and most of the instances which we should quote ought to be familiar to all our readers . Take only one  --  that of Gen. BUTLER . We need not remind anybody of the value of his services , or recall Gen. Gnaisar 's warm tribute to them on one particular occasion . We think there was something said about a bottle in that tribute , and a slight reference to a cork . As the reward of these services , Gen. BUTLER exercises great power at Washington  --  or is said by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts paper ought to know what it is talking about . The Boston Journal says : " We must take BUTLER and BUTLER 'S men , whether we want them or not . " And so say all the other Boston papers . Our old friend , the Springfield Republican , lashes its tail and roars iu a way that is enough to scare the peaceful New-Yorker : " This means submission or fight , gentlemen . The President forces the issue . He does it upon the advice of BENJ &ML.N; F. BUTLER . " And so on . We do not want to go into the great Simmons fight . It is sufficient for our present purpose to point out that if Mr. BUTLER is the great man they say he is , it must be evident that the Republic is not ungrateful to him . We could easily cite many other instances , but one is as good as a thousand , and it is only necessary to point to one which our own City has produced . We refer to the case of the late Mr. HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gentleman rendered inestimable services to the community , though we would rather not be called upon at the present time to enumerate them  --  they ought to be fresh in the minds of all our readers . He was a very distinguished and successful bank President and Director , and a politician of the very highest type  --  not one of your schemers who hang about Albany trying to corrupt the lofty-minded Assemblyman of the period , but the sort of man whom the Van Cortlandts and Clintons and Jays and Van Burens and Marcys of our State would have been proud to ask home to dinner . How anybody can pretend that the politician of our age is a degenerate being , compared with the men who once managed politics among us , we can not understand . The late Mr. SMITH was surely equal to the best men of - whom our history bears record . And if we want any proof of that , we find it in the unanswerable fact that he received all kinds of unusual honors , not only before , but actually after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ? always a position-of trust and honor . He acquitted himself so well in that capacity that among the lamentations which his unfortunate " demise " occasioned , none were louder than those of the depositors in the Bowling Green and Guardian Savings Banks . He indirectly managed one great public department . He was the head of another  --  the Police Department , one of the most important in any community . His conduct in the latter office seems to have won the approval of friends and . foes alike .. In all his doings he was prompted by the highest sense of duty . You could not persuade him to perform an unworthy action . He would have nothing to do with lobbyists and wire-pullers , or with sinister intrigues of any kind . We believe it is universally admitted that the Police Department was never in a more efficient state than it is at the present moment . All the officers are contented  --  all the men work well . The Police Commissioners , of whom the late Mr. Salmi was at the head , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which that has been managed needs no praise from us , since no one has ever . found fault with it . To be sure , a jealous Legislature has sent a commission here to inquire into it , but there never lived a good man yet who was not calumniated . Integs ' rity and rectitude count for nothing nowaa ' ? days , as a . gentleman named BeerrOetle truly eee-sa . - ses.Las at a ? . e 4-Sg it V , hee ? " Oititednaa-Maase ? Rasa.fun removed from the limited sphere of usefulness which . he enjoyed here below , ' he received honors which are only rarely paid to the wisest and greatest of men . A public funeral was ordered . There was a " lying-in-state " at the City Hall , and on that melancholy occasion we are assured that the " floral tributes " nearly filled an immense room . Some one sent a huge column of flowers broken at the top  --  emblematic of the .. brevity of life . There was an anchor as large as that of an ocean steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to typify the feelings with which the depositors of the Bowling Green and Guardian Banks long regarded the late lamented . The City Hall was lit up night and day , and everything was done that could be thought of to soften the sorrows which the loss of Mr. Saim1 naturally brought upon the whole community . At last the funeral took place ? for however great we may be , that somewhat gloomy ceremony must be pereirmed some day or other for all of us . There was a band of mimic , playing the most deleful. ditties of the great masters . There were numerous " lodges , ' and the Police turned out in a body . There were the Mayor , the Controller , and . the Common Council , the President of the Park Commission  --  and OLIVER CHARLICK , to say nothing of many other eminent men . Nearly four miles of streets were swept thoroughly clean for the sad procession  --  one of the most touching testimonies of affection and respect ever paid to a public man . in this City , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioners have no public money with which to pay for street-cleaning , so that they must have provided the funds out of their own pockets . The flags on all the civic buildings were placed at half-mast , and there were tears in the eyes of every man or woman whom you met in Fifth avenue . We can not , indeed , recall this trying scene without emotion ; and we should have spared ourselves the pain of writing about it but for the anxiety we feel to disprove the foolish proverb about the ingratitude of Republics . The memorable incidents of last week conclusively show that every truly great man is deservedly honored ; and we hope our younger readers will remember that if they wish to rise to power and honor in the community , if they wish to hold posts of distinction during their lives , and after their deaths to have a lying-in-state and a public funeral , they must imitate the noble example set before them in the career of the late Mr. SMITH .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
