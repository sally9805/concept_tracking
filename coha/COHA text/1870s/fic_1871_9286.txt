Chairs , l. and r. of Desk . Chair , l. of Stage . ( Enter Oliver , l. , with letters , which he places on the table . ) Oliver Oliver ( seating himself in chair and throwing his feet upon the desk ) . Eleven o'clock , and Mr. Morton not yet arrived ! Well , he is cutting it fat , and no mistake ! Who 's to attend to clients ? I 'd like to know . Mrs. Peppertongue will soon be here to hurry up that divorce ; and Mr. Sweetlove has been stewing away in the outer - office , for an hour , about his marriage settlement . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does fly when it once gets into his hands ! Would n't I like to be a lawyer ? Such cravats , oh , crackee ! such boots , oh , my ! and such a mustache , oh , Christopher ! and then that team , two-forty on a plank road ! Hi , get up there What yer bout ? Hi , hi ! ( imitating driving horses . ) ( Enter Morton , l . ) Robert . Robert Morton Any letters this morning , Oliver ? Oliver Oliver ( rising quickly ) . Yes , sir : they are on your desk . ( Aside . ) Oh ! just look at that cravat ! ( Exit l . ) Robert Robert Morton ( seating himself at desk , and opening letters ) . Well , my head does ache delightfully this morning , and no mistake . Curse the cards ! I 'm $200 poorer than I was yesterday . But no matter , there 's more where that came from : my rich clients will have to foot the bill . We had a jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What 's this ? ( Reading letter . ) " Mr. Horace Holmes 's compliments to Mr. Robert Morton , and declines to pay the bill presented ; in fact , will see Mr. M. "  --  Oh ! do n't swear , Mr. Holmes ; for it will do you no good . Very cool and very polite , Mr. Holmes , we shall have to show you a little court practice . Ah ! from old Drayton ( Reads ) : " It will be impossible for me to pay the note at present . I am detained at the farm with a touch of my old complaint . My daughter Mary will wait upon you to-day , to see if some satisfactory arrangement can be made for further time . " Satisfactory arrangement , indeed ! As I expected . No ! no ! old Drayton , there can be no arrangement made that will be satisfactory to me , but that of seeing you turned adrift , and Drayton Farm in my possession . I have schemed too long to lose it now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scornful Mary Drayton comes a suppliant to the despised and rejected suitor : well , that is satisfactory at least . The farm once mine ; and then , Mary , we shall see , we shall see ! ( Enter Oliver , l . ) Well . Oliver . Oliver There is a lady in the outer-office wishes to speak with you . Robert . Robert Morton Show her in ( Oliver going ) . And hark you , young man ! no listening at the door , this time . Oliver . Oliver Oh , no , sir ! ( Going aside . ) Perhaps I wo n't . I 's come here to study law ; and I 've been here long enough to know that the best way to study it is through a keyhole . ( Exit l . ) Robert . Robert Morton Now for a touching appeal to my sympathies . ( Enter Mary , l. , Robert comes down r . ) Mary Mary Drayton ( l . ) . Good-morning , Mr. Morton ! Morton Robert Morton ( r . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed a pleasure that lawyers are not accustomed to ,  --  the visit of a lady of such beauty  --  Mary Mary Drayton ( interrupting ) . Spare your compliments , Mr. Morton . My visit is simply one of business . Morton . Robert Morton So I suppose ; still , as an old friend  --  Mary Mary Drayton ( interrupting ) . Friendship has nothing to do with my present business . You hold a note signed by my father . Morton . Robert Morton For $500 , payable fifteen months from date . It has long been overdue . Mary . May Drayton My father has written you , several times , that it is impossible for him to pay it at present . I have called , at his request , to ask further time . The security is still good . Morton . Robert Morton But the payment can no longer be deferred on any terms . I have been very lenient with your father ; but now , I must have the money before twelve o'clock , or I shall take the necessary steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drayton Take possession ? You can not mean it , Mr. Morton ! You would not eject an old man from the only habitation he has in the wide world , the home of his father and his father 's father ! You could not do so base a deed for the pitiful sum you name ! Morton . Robert Morton Pitiful , young lady ! you are jesting . If the sum be pitiful , you surely could pay it . I repeat , either the money , or your father quits the farm . Mary . May Drayton I beseech you , Mr. Morton , take into consideration the circumstances of the case . Three months after that note was given , my father came into possession of just the amount of that note . Morton . Robert Morton So I have heard . Mary . May Drayton Anxious to be free from debt , he despatched my brother Harry to you with the money to pay it . Morton . Robert Morton And neither your brother nor the money have been seen from that day to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morton . Robert Morton Miss Drayton , I have taken into consideration all the circumstances . Your brother was a drunken , worthless vagabond ; and either he decamped with the money , or this story is a villanous trick to work upon me , and rob me of my rightful due . Mary Mary Drayton ( indignantly ) . Mr. Morton , my brother was once your dearest friend ; you and he were inseparable . True , he was a drunkard ; but ' t is my belief that ' t was you who made him so : and , I would sooner believe that your villany has caused this trouble , than that my brother Harry ever touched one penny of that money . ( Crosses , r . ) Morton Robert Morton ( l . ) . Plain words , Miss Drayton , and rather out of place at this time . That note must be paid , or Drayton Farm must be given up . Mary . May Drayton Oh , do not say so , Mr. Morton ! remember the friendship  --  Morton Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confine ourselves strictly to business ; friendship can have nothing to do with our present interview . Mary . May Drayton I beg your pardon , Mr. Morton , if for a moment I forgot the lawyer , and appealed to the man ; but I have been taught that a man 's first duty is to protect the weak and succor the distressed . Morton . Robert Morton Well , Miss Drayton , I trust I am not insensible to duty ; but when a man has been swindled as I have been in this business  --  Mary . May Drayton Hold ! No more of this if you please . You and I can never agree as to who is the swindler . My business with you is to ask for further time . Shall I have it ? Morton . Robert Morton The note must be paid . Mary . May Drayton I know it must ; and so it shall . Give me but the time , and these willing hands shall work both day and night , until your claim is paid , principal and interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before twelve o'clock to-day . Mary . May Drayton Then , Heaven help you , father ! Heaven help you ! for we must quit the farm . Morton . Robert Morton Mary Drayton , that note can be paid . Mary Mary Drayton ( eagerly ) . What say you ? Morton . Robert Morton Mary , I once told you that I loved you . I believed that you were not insensible to my appeal ; and I asked your hand of your father . You recollect ? Mary . May Drayton I do ! I do ! Robert . Robert Morton And perhaps you also recollect his answer ?  --  " Robert Morton , my daughter is not for you . " Mary . May Drayton He believed it was you who made my brother what he was . He did but follow the dictates of his conscience and his heart . Robert . Robert Morton And I but followed the dictates of my heart , when I asked you to fly with me . I but follow the dictates of my heart now , when I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly as then : become my wife , and Drayton Farm remains your father 's property for life . Mary . May Drayton Robert Morton , I once loved you ; how dearly Heaven and myself only know ; but I have been taught your true character : and rather than become your wife , I say to you , take Drayton Farm , burn it to the ground if you will , turn my father forth a wanderer upon the face of the earth ; an honest farmer 's gray hairs will protect , and a daughter 's love sustain him in all his trials . ( Crosses , l . ) Morton . Robert Morton Well , as you please ! I have given you the only terms upon which the note can be cancelled . If you would procure the money , you must be lively ; ' t is now half-past 11 , at 12 o'clock ' twill be too late . Au revoir . ( Exit , r . ) Mary . May Drayton Procure it ! Where shall I look for it , where indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would lend us the money after my brother 's mysterious disappearance . Oh , Harry ! you little know the ruin you have caused . How can I break this to father and mother ? How tell them that the dear old farm is no longer ours , that strangers will soon sit around the hearthstone where we have been wont to gather for so many years ? Oh ! there is some terrible mystery here . I can not believe that Harry was dishonest . ( Sits l. of table , covers her face with her hand . ) Harry Harry Drayton ( outside ) . All right , all right ! I 'll find the way . ( Enter , l . ) Well ! at last I 've managed to give my messmates the slip . Jolly chaps , they wanted to show me the sights , little thinking I knew them better than they . And now to find some of my old acquaintances . So this is Bob Morton 's law-office , is it ? How Bob has got up in the world . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up in the loft of an old hulk of a house , down by the wharf ; and now he 's up town amongst the nobs , with a sign out as broad as a mainsail , Counsellor-at-Law . But I wonder where he is . Ah ! a lady . Mary Mary Drayton No , no ! I can not believe this is the work of Harry Drayton . Harry . Harry Drayton Who speaks of Harry Drayton ? ( Mary turns . ) Why , Mary ! is it you ? Mary . May Drayton My brother Harry alive ? ( rushing into his arms ) . Thank Heaven for that ! Harry . Harry Drayton Why , Mary ! bless your dear little figger-head . How are you ? and how 's father , and mother , and little Aggie ? How 's everybody ? Why ! Mary , I have n't seen the face of a friend for fifteen long months . Mary . May Drayton Harry , we had given you up as dead . Where have you been all this time ? and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been ! why , do n't you know where I have been ? Mary . May Drayton No . Indeed , we had given you up as lost . Harry . Harry Drayton Nor father , mother , nobody knew where I 've been ? Why , Mary , I 've been to Calcutta . I 've been to sea . Mary . May Drayton But what did you run away for ? What have you been doing ? Why have n't you written ? Harry . Harry Drayton Now , avast , my dear little sister ! just put your tongue-tackle in proper trim , and reel off one question at a time . Mary . May Drayton But how you have altered ! When you went away you were  --  Harry . Harry Drayton There , do n't ! stop , Mary , I know what you would say . I went away a miserable broken-down drunkard ; but I have come back , Mary , a different man . I have learned to loathe that which I loved ; I have cast off the chains which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free man . Mary . May Drayton Oh ! this is indeed a happy return . Harry . Harry Drayton But , Mary , how happened I to go to Calcutta ? I thought that father , thinking me incurable , had shipped me off ' o get rid of me . Mary . May Drayton No , Harry ! Father had nothing to do with it . Fifteen months ago , you mysteriously disappeared ; and we could find no trace of you . Harry . Harry Drayton Well , no matter who sent me ; enough , it has made me a better man . Mary , I 've got a secret for you . How should you like a sister ? Mary . May Drayton Why ! we 've got one . Harry . Harry Drayton Yes , I know ! Little Aggie , bless her dear little heart ! how I do long to hug her ! But , Mary , this is another kind of a sister that I mean . Mary . May Drayton Another kind ! Harry . Harry Drayton Yes , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a sweetheart . Mary . May Drayton A sweetheart ! Harry . Harry Drayton Yes , Mary ! a real bona-fide kiss-me-quick sweetheart . You shall see her . I 've got her picture here . You see I carry it next my heart , which she inhabits , and which her sweet influence has made to beat with deeper and holier feelings than ever it knew before . Is she not beautiful ? Mary . May Drayton Beautiful indeed ! ' t is the face of an angel . I give you joy , brother , of your conquest . Harry . Harry Drayton Conquest , Mary ! ' t is she who is the conqueror . You shall hear the story . Sit down , for we sailors are famous for long yarns ( they sit ) . The first I knew of my late voyage was finding myself on board a ship for the first time in my life . I knew I had been placed there while in a state of intoxication ; and when I woke to consciousness , I cursed bitterly those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they would have me ; but I soon found that would not do : I was obliged to take my place with the sailors , and do as I was bid . The love of drink was still strong upon me , and I took every opportunity to indulge my appetite . At every port I revelled with the worthless and abandoned ; and when we arrived at Calcutta , I was so broken-down that I was thrust ashore to die in the gutter . I wandered through the streets penniless and ragged , thinking only of drink , drink ; but naught could I find . In the delirium of thirst , which was devouring me , I determined to destroy myself . I was about to turn to the water , there to put an end to my misery , when my ear caught the sound of a sweet voice warbling a melody that I had often heard from your lips , dear Mary , " Home , sweet home . " How often in the old kitchen  --  with father and mother , you and I gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice gladdened our hearts with these dear words . It all came back to me , Mary . I thought of the old home , where I , though reckless and wicked , always found a warm place in those dear hearts . I thought of myself , a wanderer there , far away ; and the feeling came over me that I must see them once again , if it was only to take one look at their dear faces and die on the threshold I had so dishonored . Tears , the first that I had shed since I left home , came into my eyes ; and almost broken-hearted , I sank upon the steps of the dwelling from where these sounds came . The rest is an old story . The occupant of that house was an American , Mr. Stanly , a merchant ; and you know , Mary , that when an American sailor meets a countryman in a foreign land , be he rich , or be he poor , he finds a brother . I was taken into his house , and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I learned to love Agnes Stanly , whose sweet voice had touched the almost deadened heart , and whose sweet influence sustained me in my endeavors to shake off the curse and be a man again . But the old longing was in my heart to see the dear ones at home ; and I have come back as I went , a common sailor , soon to return for the dear one , whose hand awaits my coming . Mary . May Drayton This is indeed glad tidings that you bring ! You reformed ! ' Twill gladden our old father 's heart , even in the midst of sorrow . Harry . Harry Drayton Sorrow , Mary ! Mary . May Drayton Yes , Harry ! the old farm must be given up . Mr. Morton still holds the note given by father , and if it is not paid at twelve o'clock we must quit the farm . Harry . Harry Drayton Why , Mary ! what do you mean ? Robert Morton holds the note ! Why ! it has been paid and the mortgage cancelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . Harry Drayton By myself . Did n't I pay Bob Morton $500 ? I certainly did , and he wrote a release . Mary . May Drayton But where is the release ? Morton declares he has never received the money . Harry , forgive me ; but it is believed by about everybody that you appropriated that money . Harry . Harry Drayton I appropriated it , Mary ! Who dares accuse me ? Who believes it ? Not you , or father or mother . You do not believe me guilty of so base a deed ? Mary . May Drayton No indeed , Harry ! all at home believe you guiltless ; but there is some mystery about it . Harry . Harry Drayton Mystery ! Fool  --  idiot  --  that I have been ! I know now the author of my sudden voyage . Robert Morton , I thought you reckless , but I did not think you a villain . Mary , there is a mystery here which I alone can fathom . Fear not ; at twelve o'clock the mortgage shall be void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let me try my influence with this crafty lawyer . ( Exit Mary and Harry , l . Enter Morton , r. , seats himself at the table . ) Robert . Robert Morton My fair visitor has at last taken herself off to procure the money , I suppose . Rather a difficult matter I fancy . I have taken too good care to influence those against her father , to whom she would be likely to apply ; and if Harry Drayton but keeps out of the way another month , Drayton Farm will be mine . ( Harry enters quietly and approaches desk . ) I wonder where he is ? Dead , I hope ! Harry . Harry Drayton Not quite dead , Robert Morton , Counsellor-at-Law ! Robert . Robert Morton Harry Drayton ! Harry . Harry Drayton Mariner ! I do n't put up a sign ; but , like you , I have a profession . Morton . Robert Morton Where in the world did you come from ? Harry . Harry Drayton Why ! you do n't seem a bit glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ! Give me your hand ! Harry . Harry Drayton That is a ceremony usually practised among friends ; now , as I am not quite certain you are my friend , you will excuse me if I do not comply with your request . Morton Robert Morton ( alarmed ) . What do you mean ? What do you want with me ? Harry . Harry Drayton I have just arrived in port , after an absence of fifteen months ; is it strange that I should have made my first call upon my earliest and best friend ? Morton . Robert Morton You jest ! Harry . Harry Drayton I do indeed ! I 'll jest no more . Robert Morton , you and I were playmates . Once , while on the water , it chanced that I fell overboard , and was very near drowning . You saved my life . From that time I almost worshipped you ; I followed you everywhere . You led me into temptation ; you taught me to drink ; you taught me every thing that was vile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did a kindness to my father ; you loaned him money , taking as security a mortgage of Drayton Farm . A short time afterward , he came into possession of just the amount of the note given , and sent me to you with it , that the note might be paid and the mortgage cancelled . I came to you , paid you the money , you wrote and signed a release ; it was left lying on your desk . You then produced your liquors and invited me to drink ; from that time I knew nothing until I found myself on board a ship , and bound for Calcutta , to suit your purpose . I have returned , and now I say to you , Robert Morton , I want that release . Robert . Robert Morton And suppose I do not give it up ? Harry . Harry Drayton I am not quite so good a lawyer as you are , Bob Morton ; but I know it would be useless to fight you in a court single-handed . But , mark me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is believed that I appropriated that money , and with that suspicion upon my head , my better efforts would be vain . I must have that paper , Robert Morton , or your life ! Robert Robert Morton ( slipping paper from desk into his pocket ) . Well , well , old friend , we will not quarrel about it . You shall have it . I have been using it as a weapon to secure the hand of your sister Mary ; you know that all 's fair in love ; but as long as you have returned , why , of course , it is yours . Come , shake hands and be friends . Harry Harry Drayton ( aside ) . Can this be a trick ? Well , I 'll shake hands , for he once saved my life ( shakes hands ) . Morton . Robert Morton This is as it should be ! take a seat and I will bring you the paper . ( Aside . ) I 'll not give it up . I 'll try the old game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Aloud . ) Take a seat , I 'll send you some wine . ( Exit , l . ) Harry . Harry Drayton No , no ! Morton ! no wine for me . I have pledged myself to drink no more . He has gone , and for the release . Oh , father ! Your son , whose recklessness you have borne so long and so meekly , shall at last repay you for all your suffering . ( Enter Oliver , with tray and bottles and glass , and places them on small table , centre back . ) I shall not want it , take it away again ! Oliver . Oliver It was Mr. Morton 's order that I should leave it . ( Exit , l . ) Harry . Harry Drayton Well , well , let it stay ; what matters it to me though there were a dozen bottles before me ? I have sworn to drink no more , and it is time that I accustomed myself to the presence of the tempter ; and yet I wish he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes instinctively turn toward it . Where can Morton be all this time ? I ca n't keep my eyes from the bottles , and I feel the old longing . Oh , Heavens ! suppose I should break my vow ! Why do n't Morton come ? What means this sudden parching in my throat , this choking ? Can it be that the appetite so long slumbering is awakening with renewed power ? Yes , it is ! I feel the old longing for one draught of the wine that sparkles so brightly in yonder bottles ; but it must be crushed , it must be crushed . Where can Morton be ? Shall the work of a year be destroyed in a moment ? Oh , this thirst ! this thirst ! Oh ! for one drop of water . Ah ! there may be some upon the table . No , no ! nothing but wine , and I am choking . Morton , Morton ! I can not raise my voice to call . What can this mean ? am I dying ? Oh ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be but one , but one ( pours out wine , and is about to drink , when " Home , Sweet Home " is heard without . Harry stands with the upraised glass , while the music is heard . Music should be very soft , either from a flute or a female voice , and only a few bars ) . What mean these sounds ? that old familiar air again , that once saved me in a foreign land ! Ah , Agnes ! have I so far forgotten you as to again raise the tempter to my lips ? No , no ! though my parched throat crack , I will not touch it . Agnes ! Mary ! Hover around me with your sweet influence , and save me from this curse ! ( Flings away glass , and staggers down to table , r. , and falls into chair , burying his face in his hands on the desk . Enter , Morton , l . ) Morton . Robert Morton So ! so ! The bottle opened , the cup upon the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truly ! I did not think it would work so quickly . Fool ! you have ruined your case . You little dream in your drunken slumber that the prize you covet was almost within your grasp , concealed as it has so long been within that desk ! Now , to have him shipped once more for Calcutta , and all will go well . ( Enter , Mary , l . ) What ! you here again ! With the money , I hope ; ' t is almost twelve . Mary . May Drayton I have not the money . My brother Harry , who has just returned from abroad , agreed to meet me here at twelve ; he will soon be here . Morton . Robert Morton He is here ! Look at him ! look at the long lost brother ; who , though a drunkard , was always honest . ( Crosses l . ) Mary . May Drayton Harry ! brother Harry ! what means this ? Goes to him and stands at his side ) . Morton . Robert Morton There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting up ) . Liar ! ( Mary , with a cry of joy , flings herself into his arms . ) Morton . Robert Morton What means this ? Harry . Harry Drayton It means that you are foiled , and I am saved . Mary , dear Mary ! within that desk , by the confession of this villain , while he thought me a victim to his drugged wine , is the lease ; secure it . ( Mary flies to the desk . ) ( Morton , l . Harry , c . Mary , r . ) Morton Robert Morton ( fiercely ) . Fools ! think you I will be robbed without a struggle ? Lay a finger on that desk at your peril ! Harry . Harry Drayton Robert Morton , the paper in that desk is the property of my father ! ' T is you who are the robber ! stir one step to stop this righteous proceeding , and you shall find that the arms weakened by indulgence are still strong enough to overpower you . Heave ahead , Mary ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats ; out of my path ! ( Throws himself upon Harry ; they struggle , and Harry is thrown back to table , c . ) Now , young lady , away ! or your sex shall not protect you . ( Harry rushes down with a bottle . ) Harry . Harry Drayton Back ! back , I say ! You call me drunkard ! ' T is true , I was a drunkard ; but now I am sober . That paper is necessary to my father 's happiness , to my home . Stir another step , and the bottle you have so long used against me shall spatter your brains upon your office walls ! Now , Mary , quick ! the papers . Mary Mary Drayton ( opening desk ) . The desk is empty ! Harry . Harry Drayton Empty ! Morton . Robert Morton Empty ! yes , fools ! Do you think I am so poor a lawyer as to leave my papers thus exposed ? The desk is indeed empty . Your plot has failed ( approaching Harry ) . Confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Harry . Harry Drayton This bottle ! Morton . Robert Morton Yes , that bottle ! thieves ! Would you plunder me of all ? Harry . Harry Drayton Ah ! There 's a paper in the bottle ( Morton makes a dash at it ) . Not quite so fast ( handing the bottle to Mary ) . Footnote : 1kb See what 's in the bottle , Mary . ( To Morton ) . Away ! ' t is dangerous to oppose me now . Mary Mary Drayton ( slipping paper from bottle , and unrolling it ) . Oh , Harry ! ' t is the mortgage of Drayton Farm . Harry . Harry Drayton And the release  --  Mary . May Drayton Is attached to it . Harry Harry Drayton ( taking mortgage ) . The old farm is ours , Mary ! I can look father in the face now . ( Clock strikes twelve . ) Robert Morton , ' t is twelve o'clock , and I hold the cancelled mortgage of Drayton Farm . Morton . Robert Morton Yes ! for once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better of me . The paper has long been concealed in a secret drawer in that desk ; but just now I managed to carry it from the room , to conceal it in a safer place . I slipped it into an empty bottle in my closet , at the same time bidding Oliver to bring you wine . By some chance he mistook the bottle , and thus my little scheme has been brought to light . Well , we ca n't hope to win in every heat in the race of life . Harry . Harry Drayton Robert Morton ! Do you remember the words we both learned from the lips of our old teacher ,  --  " Let him who is without sin cast the first stone " ? I feel now all the bitterness of my past life of folly ; and , so help me Heaven ! I will atone for it in the future . As for you , your last act has proved you a villain ; for he who would attack the gray hairs of an old man to further selfish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your path and mine separate ; but , I conjure you , as you hope for happiness , reform your life . Morton . Robert Morton Pshaw ! had n't you better turn preacher at once ? Reformed drunkards are attractive lecturers , and your sister  --  Harry . Harry Drayton Hold , Morton ! Do not dare to trifle with the name of my sister . For myself , I can bear much of your taunting ; but dare to speak of her , and I shall forget even that to you I owe my life . Morton . Robert Morton Well , go your way , temperance and virtue ; I am still content to tread the flowery paths of pleasure . Adieu ! my noble friend . ( Exit l . ) Harry . Harry Drayton Go your way for a villain ! Well , Mary ! have , you nothing to say ? Mary . May Drayton My heart is too full , Harry ! The old farm ours again ! Father and mother happy once more ! This is indeed joyful ; but to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than I could have hoped . Harry . Harry Drayton You know not how much I have been tempted , Mary ; but , thanks to that better influence which has once more championed me , I feel that I shall triumph , and gladden the hearts of the old farm again . So , Mary , let 's home at once ; we have that here which shall kindle a bright flame on the old hearthstone , and bring smiles to the anxious faces that have so long awaited the sailor 's return . ( Harry puts his arm around Mary 's waist , and as they turn to exit l. curtain falls. )
