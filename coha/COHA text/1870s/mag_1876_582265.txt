A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES : qwq will not be imitated . Its interior arrangements are being copied in every State . The peculiar method whereby the bills were paid has commanded the attention of thinking men throughout the country . It is in these two aspeKcts that it will be here considered . Its dismal exterior may be quite omitted . First , we may consider the house itself , with some suggestions as to its adornment . Next , we may examine the far more important matter of paying for it . Here is a new house going up . The lot is perhaps 12 , i8 , or 24 feet wide , by 25 to 45 feet deep . That admits of a front door and one wide or two small windows . Over these are one , two , or three windows , as the case may be . This makes the front of two stories . Steps lead up to the door , and beneath the windows are small lights for the cellar . Entering the door , we find a small hall or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room . Next to this is the box stairway , crossing the house on a line with the street , and making a partition between the front and the back of the house . In the rear is the kitchen and the back door leading into the yard . A range or place for a stove is provided , and water is let on from the street . In the yard is an outbuilding , and perhaps a place for an open-air stove for out-door cooking in warm weather , after the Philadelphia fashion . Small outbuildings are added with a gate to the lane in the rear when the lots are deep . Upstairs are two chambers , and a small bath-room , with closet and the usual facilities . Below is an ample cellar . The walls are neatly papered and the wood-work painted . Gas is supplied , and in every respect the house is warm , convenient , and comfortable . Over all is a simple flat roof . Closets may be placed under the stairs in the front room and against the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate means , every convenience is supplied with one spare room . The house small , indeed , but it is good and cheap . Its rent is low , and is price is within the reach of even the laboring man . Its cost will vary from less than $i , ooo up to $2,500 , according to location . The rent will range from $8 to $25 per month , with taxes , water rates , gas , insurance , etc. , be it more or less , according to the agreen*ent with the landlord . Rent is rarely paid . There is a better way than that , and the great majority of people who occupy these and similar houses own their homes , or have it in prospect . Plan A shows a house , 16x31 feet , inclosed by brick party walls , and having a rear wall of hard brick , and the front wall of pressed brick . There is a cellar under all , and a shed for the rear . The stories are each nine feet clear , with stone sills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design indicates , the house fronts on the street line . The cost will vary from $1,300 to $1,500 . Plan B shows another style , 12 x 29 , and set back 25 feet from the street line . This leaves a small garden in front . Such houses are built in pairs , with an 8-feet walk between each pair . The second story of such houses and the posts are the same as in Plan A. Houses built in this way are designed to make the rear building of a possible house , built in the garden at some future time . Plan C shows* the extension in front as the family increase in size and wealth . The elevations over plans B and C show different treatments of the same house . The twostory house costs from $i , ooo to $1,300 ; and the three-story extension , . from $i , 8oo to $2,200 . It must here be noticed that these houses are far more attractive than Philadelphia houses generally , and are the work of an architect of reputation. * Philadelphia is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her people own their houses ; the landlord no longer takes the bulk of the people 's money ; every man is his own landlord , and pays rent to himself . Small wonder is it that her people are steady , thrifty , fore-handed , and domestic in their habits . Real estate rises continually ; the taxable property grows quickly ; the stream of waste that flows to the dram-shops is checked ; the homely virtues flourish , and marriages increase in number . The young man knows he can quickly and easily procure a home , and the young woman is more than ready to aid him if so good a house can be placed at her disposal for so little money . She can even buy and own the house herself independently of her husband , and both can combine to erect and own their own roof-tree , that shall also be their children 's home , and the assured shelter for their declining years .

When it is known that six hundred banking concerns in Philadelphia crowd the papers with their monthly announcements , it is easy to see that an effort must be made to win attention . Money in abundance cheap and free to all able and willing to give decently good security for it ! It is with this money the Philadelphia young man builds his bride a house . With the funds of these associations , poured out at the rate of half a million of dollars a month , Philadelphia has made herself what she is . This is her building capital , with a total yearly value of from seven to ten million dollars . This is the seed from which sprang up her hundred thousand roof-trees . These associatiohs are called building and loan associations . The name is misleading in one respect . They are not building associations in any sense . They are banks without vaults , moneyed concerns without expensive buildings or highly paid officers ; and no stockholders , aside from depositors , stand ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no great fund of money to tempt the thieving president or his brothers , the burglars . A two hundred dollar safe will hold the companies ' assets and books , and a slender bank account represents the available capital . Let us attend one of these meetings - held in a plain , two-story brick house , and over a small fruit store on one of the plainest of these plain streets . Ascending a narrow stairway from an obscure court , we come to a small , bare hall , perhaps 20x40 , provided with plain settees and a desk or two . Here we can sit and view the performance . There is nothing to suggest the bank , and all the fixtures are of the cheapest and most simple character . Over one of the desks is a faded card announcing " Money to Loan . " About the desk are , perhaps , half a dozen middle-aged men . In no wise remarkable , they seem just what they are-plain , matter-of-fact men of family and well-known position . One a mason , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , . another a bookkeeper , the others something equally honest , steady , and well-to-do . These are the honorable officers and directors of the building association that meets in this hall tonight . They were elected by the shareholders of the association and make its responsible head . The secretary enjoys a salary of from two to six hundred dollars a year . The president , treasurer , and other officers work for nothing a day , The honor of the position is their only reward , except their car-fares if they travel for the association . Though they receive nothing for their work , it is far from light or simple . They must overlook the affairs of the association , attend its stated meetings , examine the security offered for loans , and attend to the business generally . Occasionally they must give half a day to the inspection of the property loaned upon , and once in a while there is an evening meeting of the government at some private house . The time has come for business , and the stockholders or lenders begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow stairs and , forming a line , take their turn at // the secretary 's desk . A clerk in very spruce clothes , behind him a shop-girl , pallid with toil , then an elderly man bronzed by a life out of doors . Behind these , two or three children with their hands filled with their little hoard of currency , the result of their month 's small savings . Then more girls and women , evidently people who live laborious days . Others follow who never did a thing in their lives . Then a telegraph boy , alert and bright-eyed ; then more men , retired merchants and small traders , storekeepers , watchmen , people of means and day laborers . Rich and poor , high and low , the hard worker and the idler living on the profits of his shares . Each and all come to pay their one dollar on their several shares . At the desk an old gentleman in glasses examines the money deposited , signs the little pass-books , gives one to the treasurer and the other to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted twice , and then the depositor moves on to make room for the next . The pile of bills on the treasurer 's table grows quickly . The stream of capital flows in by ones , twos , fives and tens , and in a short time the account runs up to a thousand dollars . The majority of the depositors , or lenders , as they are more properly called , . having paid their monthly dues , retire to their homes , content to leave the directors to manage the business meeting of the association that is to follow later in the evening . They repose entire confidence in the direction , and , unless they wish to take out or borrow some of the money , return home without delay . The association is , to them , a superior kind of savings bank , and they trust it far more implicitly than do the depositors in the average savings institution in New York . More than this , they know that no burglar can rob this bank , no thieving president enrich himself with pious irregularities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilded ceilings , silverplated counters and damask hangings , will be incurred to gratify the vanity of officers who never pay a cent of the cost . There is no brown-stone palace , no steel vault , no outrageous rent-only this bare little hall at two dollars a night , a trifling account at a city bank , and one absurd little salary to be pad ; but the best of security for every dollar in good land and well-insured houses . More people come in , . and some take seats at once without joining the line of the depositors . There is quite a sprinkling of women , and among the men are representatives from every station in life . At half-past eight the president of the association calls the meeting to order . The hall is now well filled with a quiet and rather sober crowd . These are the borrowers . Some are members of the association , and others are entire strangers , attracted hither by the winning advertisement of money to loan . All the money collected this evening , together with all received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered freely to the highest bidder , be it man or woman . The president then calls upon the secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting and the directors ' statement of the past month 's business . The minutes are merely formal , and the directors ' report shows what was done with the association 's funds . The names of the successful borrowers at the last meeting are given , with a full statement of the amounts loaned , the premiums they paid , the security they offered , and its location , char*icter and value . From this statement it appears that all the money received up to the time of the last meeting , excepting $2,000 , was loaned out on ample security . This $2,000 added to the monthly dues and interest paid in and the loans returned , etc. , makes a total of $13,000 , all of which is now for sale without reserve . There is a murmur of pleasure at this good financial showing , and the president announces that the sale will now begin . As there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the sale . Any member can borrow on his share , even if it is only one month old . Those who can not give real estate as security , and who have only just joined the association , or who wish to join , must bring a bond signed by some responsible person , that he or she will pay the dues for at least three years . This bond is only for the dues , and not for the loan . Any member who has been in the association more than six months can borrow up to the withdrawing value of his share , without real estate security . All members who can give real estate security can borrow up to $200 ( the ultimate value ) on every share they own , but no one can bid for more than ten shares at once . If he wishes more than $2,000 he must bid again . The premiums offered for loans will be deducted from the loan , and in case the security offered is not acceptable the loan will be refused , . and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the money at six per cent . This is to prevent // qwq from $200 to $2,000 . Some one offers twenty per cent . At once some one bids twenty-one . Twenty-two is offered , and , just as at any auction , the bidding advances , reaching thirty per cent . The demand is active . The officers and directors watch Finally , bids of only a few hundred dollars are made , and in less than thirty minutes the entire sum of $13,000 and several hundred dollars more are sold . This extra money is the premiums that are offered . They are likewise sold , and earn premiums on themselves . // Those who are not members gather round the treasurer 's desk to buy the shares that entitle them to the loans , and to give the locality where the houses and land they , offer for security may be found . In a short time the whole affair is arranged and the meeting adjourns . The money received from the lenders is given to the treasurer , and he takes it home . To-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some bank , there to remain until drawn out by checks to supply the borrowers whose bids are finally accepted by the directors . In a few days one or more of the directors will be detailed to examine the securities offered . If they prove good , the directors in regular meeting assembled at some private house , or elsewhere , will make the loans . The solicitor will then be directed to examine the titles . The securities not deemed good wiJl be rejected and the loans will be refused . In that case the borrower must offer other security or pay one month 's interest on his bid , and then he has leave to withdraw . A month hence these things will be fully reported , and the money left over on refused loans will be offered again in open auction . To such simplicity is this system of cooperative banking reduced . In this easy and inexpensive manner is this business conducted . Lenders and depositors on one side , borrowers for every known purpose on the other , the poor lending to the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an association as this a building and loaning association . In reality , it is , as we have seen , only a saving and loaning bank . The association itself does not build , nor does it ask what its members propose to do with the money they take . It may be for a house or to buy land . It may be capital to start some manufacture , to open a store , buy a piano or sewing-machine , furniture , or wedding outfit , or to obtain an education . If the security is good , that is all the association cares to know . Such is the personal aspect of this mattier . These are the people who made and use these associations . The homes that line Philadelphia 's streets represent the tangible result , The outcome of this system of finance . Suppose a number of people in a certain place wish to start such an association . Some desire to furnish a safe and profitable means of saving the earnings of those about them . Others wish to see the town built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value , or they wish to buy or build a home . There is no capital in the town except in the hands of one or two hardfisted fellows , to deal with whom is always a trial and a grind . There is a good deal of money in trifling sums scattered through the place . If collected in one fund it might be of great benefit in many ways . These people meet at some private house and become the promoters of the enterprise . The affair is duly talked over and the result is that some twenty or more subscribe , , say , twenty-five dollars each , or one advances the money to th' new association and a fund is thus created . This little capital is to aid in procuring a charter , to get the necessary account-books and to advertise the new association . A charter is procured and a name selected and the first meeting is announced . Thus far the association has no existence and no capital . The fund subscribed was only the " starting bar " which sets the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curiosity , partly to see who is likely to be placed at the head of the new bank , and partly by an unexpressed but very eager desire to get the use of the new association 's money . The meeting is called to order and the charter of the new society is read . The number of shares is fixed at 2,500 , and of these a number are offered at one dollar each . Any man or woman can buy one or as many as they like up to fifty . If the people have faith in the promoters , they come forward and buy such as they desire . Perhaps four hundred shares are taken by about one hundred different people . The next step is to organize , and to elect the officers and directors . Each shareholder has one ballot ( without regard to the number of shares he holds ) and the business is soon finished . The laws of Pennsylvania permit each share to have a vote . The best associations disregard this and give each shareholder one vote only . The by-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . In many cases the original promoters are elected to one or more of the offices . If time admits , the officers are installed that evening , and the books of the association are opened . The new directors then hold their first meeting . The pass-books and certificates of stock are issued , the treasurer presents his bonds , and the salary of the secretary is fixed at about $200 a year . Meanwhile , others become interested and call on the secretary for shares . Any one who can pay a dollar a month may purchase a share . Women , whether married or single , or the former independently of their husbands , may take as many shares as they // feel they are able to carry . Parents and guardians may invest for their charges . It is a savings bank , free to all . A month passes and the next meeting is held at some small hall . The cheaper the rent of the room , provided the place is decent and respectable , the better , for it gives the association a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones . The second installment is now paid in , and more shares are sold at two dollars each , and the association declares itself ready to loan money . Capital has appeared in the town . A new and most liberal-minded capit*list stands ready to loan to such as can meet his easy demands . The meeting is called to order , and the secretary announces that the association sold at its first meeting perhaps four hundred shares , that some three hundred more were taken during the month , and that one hundred more have been taken this evening . He adds that two installments have been paid on each , and that about $1,400 is now for sale . If the premiums offered are high , a few hundred dollars more will be added to this amount . In this simple manner is the business of the association started . There is no confusion , no extravagant bill of expenses , no secret meeting of directors , eager and thoughtful for their own interests only . All is plain , fair , and above board . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the end of each year the stockholders appoint from among themselves three auditors , whose duty it is to turn the affairs of the association utterly inside out , and to exhibit its every transaction in the minutest detail in a printed report , a copy of which must be given to every shareholder . Should this report affirm neglect or irregular doings of any kind on the part of the officers , should it point out foolish loans and illconsidered securities , or anything wrong , the entire direction , president and all , may be dismissed and better men put in their places . No one shareholder can gain a ruling interest . Should the poorer shareholders , the holders of single shares , find fault , or be dissatisfied , they have ample redress , for they are almost always in the majority . The stockholders in these building and loan associations are commonly divided into two classes , the borrowing and the nonborrowing . This distinction is shadowy , for any shareholder may become a borrower at any time . First may be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming a borrower . He buys one share , for which he pays one dollar . There is no ceremony , no entrance fee , and no drawback of any kind-he simply pays , and takes the pass-book and certificate of stock . Once a month the stated pay-day comes round . He pays his installment , and gets a rcceipt in his pass-book from the secretary . If lie owns two shares , he pays two dollars ; if five , five dollars , and so on . If he lives at a distance , he may send a check or money-order . He may anticipate his payments to any extent , and , if it is for more than six months , interest will be paid on the advance . Presently he misses the payday , and then comes a small fine for the neglect . If he neglects another payment , the fine is greatly increased . This spurs him up to greater economy , and he begins to be careful and thoughtful of his money affairs . In this way the association becomes an instructor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fortune . The year passes , and then he receives the association 's annual report . Therein he finds that one share is declared to have a value of $i7. *7 . He paid $12 in , and his share of the profits amounted to * His share is not actually worth $i7. *7 , for that sum can not be realized on it . If he wants his money , he may have it , and 6 per cent . interest for the average time , not $17.97 , but $12 , with interest . Let the money rest , and in time that * will be realized , and a great deal more . This fact becomes an incentive for renewed savings , and the second year begins hopefully . Another twelve-month passes . The installments , not without a fine or two , are paid , and then comes another annual report . This is even more interesting than the first . The long and elaborate array of figures is truly impressive ; but the most enticing statements are the valuations of the various series ol shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years old , and it is declared to be worth $38.31 . Its last valuation was he paid during the year $12 more , and the association earned for him $8.34 . In other words , he paid in $24 in twenty-four months , and he has made * by the investment . Turning to another part of the report , he finds that , if he wishes to withdraw , the association is willing to buy his share for the money paid in , and a premium of $* , or $27 in all ; $* from * leaves $11.31 . That is too large a profit for the association , and he decides to let his money rest , and to continue paying his dollar a month . Another year passes , and he finds he has // paid $36 in all , but the new report declares his share now worth $59.78 . This is cheerful . Now is he beginning to be a moneyed man . He is growing rich almost without knowing it . Why did he not take five shares instead of one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps more thought and labor ; but he might have been credited on the association 's books with almost $300 . Indeed , a princely sum for such an one . He goes steadily on , paying his dollar a month year by year , and the one dollar grows to $io8 . Then comes the best report of all . With a great flourish , the directors make the happy announcement that the series of shares he is in , and known as the fifth series , has matured , and reached its ultimate legal limit of $200 . Now there are no drawbacks . For his investment of patience , and $io8 in nine years , is the handsome profit of $92 , and the sum of $200 in crisp bank-notes . He takes his money , surrenders his one share , and then amuses himself in figuring up the rate of interest he has received . This is the experience of a plodding shareholder , content to pay his dollar a month for one hundred and eight months . Another has quite a different experience . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first year he finds he has undertaken too much . He withdraws five shares , and receives the $6o paid , and interest on the money at 6 per cent . for the average time . He has now only $io to pay each month , and at that rate continues another year . The burden is still troublesome , and he decides to withdraw five more shares . The report offers a premium of $* per share . He therefore gets the $120 paid on five shares in two years , and * besides . Misfortunes crowd upon him , and in six months more he decides to take out one share . He then receives * $30 for the thirty months ' installments paid in , and the premium of $. * , declared six months before at the last annual meeting . Six months later , at the end of the third year , he decides to withdraw two more shares . A single share is now declared to be worth say $55 , and the association will buy all shares offered at a premium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make so much out of him ; but he must have his money , and his two shares bring him $i* each , $36 paid in , and the premium of*77 . The difference between the face value of * and the real value of $z* is , of course , *Iost , and becomes the property of the asso ciation . However , he has the consolation of knowing that his two remaining shares will reap a part of this benefit . He continues to pay the dues on his two shares for another year , and then he transfers them , to close an old and troublesome debt . Each share has a face value of $82 , and a selling value of $6o . His creditor is very glad to take them at this Valuation , and they are transferred to him as so much money . The original investor made a number of profits on his withdrawals , and found a safe and ready means of saving his money in his more prosperous days . The new owner may continue the payments till the shares mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as good as money up to their selling value , and every month they increase in value . Thus is the depositor in these savings associations hedged about ; thus is he taught frugality , steadiness , and the elements of finance . The plain and only safe road to fortune is pointed out to him , and every step along the sometimes weary way is made the easier . The monthly payments are easy , . the fines act as a good spur to keep the depositors up to the work . The month 's notice prevents hasty and ill-advised withdrawals , and even then each must take his turn , and at no time can more than half of the available money be taken o ' * . These formalities induce a safe delay , and place the associations above the reach of panics . Commercially considered , they are as safe as any institution of the kind can be , and in every respect they are safer than the ordinary savings bank . The total collapse , the utter vanishing away of all the deposits , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The older an association grows , the richer it becomes . Each month its capital is renewed , and every year an entirely new set of shareholders bring in their fresh capital . Certainly the depositors , be it struggling shop-girl , laborious mechanic , or helpless widow , have everything to encourage , and little to make them afraid . The borrowers , those who use the funds of the association-those to whom it is an efficient aid in buying or building a homeare also members and shareholders . They are divided into two classes : borrowers on shares and borrowers on real estate . The first give their shares as security , the others give their shares and real estate also . Here is a shop-girl who is a member of a well-established association . She has worked at dress-making for three years , and owned // fiv* shares for that time . She manages to save five dollars a month , and merely considers it as so much money laid away in the bank . Suddenly she finds a chance to start a nice little shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some ready money ; not a month hence , but immediately . She goes this very evening to the secretary of her association and tells her story . He hears her patiently , asks about the new business , the probable value of her new venture , the names of the people she hopes to deal with , and , in fact , becomes a friendly business adviser , it is mutual , for , in reality , they are partners in the bank . He consults her account , and finds that she has deposited $i8o in the three years just ending . And there is the premium of withdrawal$7 on a share , or $*3* on the five shares . This added to the $i8o gives $215 . Will she give notice of withdrawal ? When could she have the money ? Perhaps in a month ? Oh , that would never do ; she must have some money now . Why not borrow the money on the five shares ? She had thought of that , but had never been in debt before , and hesitates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay the loan . Still , it is such a good chance to better her condition , and it would break her heart to lose it . Has she no friends , no money or other property ? No ; none . Nothing , save her two hands and two suits of clothes , and one is worn-just a little . Could n't he help her in the matter ? She never attended one of the association meetings , and would n't know what to do . Yes ; he will help her . The association is always ready to lend a helping hand to its members . They are all partners in the bank together . He will bid for her . The auction takes place to - morrow night , and if she will attend he will arrange it for her , and gladly . How much money does she want ? Perhaps $125 would answer . Oh , if that is all , it can be easily arranged ; and the girl goes home feeling comparatively happy . On the evening of the morrow she appears at the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is active at first , and she fears her little loan will fare hardly among all these eager men . At last it calms down , and she hears the secretary bid for one share . it starts at tWenty , and climbs slowly up to twenty-five , six , seven . It keeps on up to thirty , and there it is knocked down to the secretary . Again and again the secretary bids for single shares , and she wonders how many other poor girls like herself are appealing for loans through him . At the end of the sale a number of men and women press round the secretary to hear the fate of their bids . He manages to speak an encouraging word to'her , and , having paid one dollar for the new share , she goes home happy . Perhaps that very evening the directors consider , and allow her little loan , and the next day she calls at the secretary 's office , signs the proper papers and gets a check for $140 . She transfers her five shares as collateral security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or her agent , bid for a loan of $200 on one share in the last new series , and gave her shares , now worth $2 15 , as security . The premium was thirty per cent . This has been taken out and leaves $140 . She has now to pay one dollar a month on the new share , the installments on her five shares , and the interest on two hundred dollars at six per cent . This she pays , a dollar at a time , each month if she wishes . That is $* a month in all , and if at any time she wishes to repay the loan she can do so by giving in the money or by withdrawing some of her shares , or she need not pay it at all , but merely let it pay itself out of her profits in the association . She thanks the old gentleman , though not without a shade of doubt . Only $140 and her shares , if she had withdrawn them , would have brought $215 . But then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By borrowing instead of withdrawing she has saved all that . A whole year passes , and she again call on the secretary . to see how her affairs stand . She has made a little something and would like to repay part of her loan . The secretary examines her account and finds that it presents this cheerful aspect : the interest has been paid , so that is happily out of the way ; the installments paid on her five shares , now held by the associati&amp;n , amount in the four years to $48 on each , and the declared value of a share is $8i , or $405 for the five ; the installments paid on the one share she borrowed upon amount to $12 . Then her debt is paid twice over ? Well , perhaps not . We must only consider the withdrawal value if she wishes to pay up in that way . The last premium offered on withdrawal was $12 , so her five shares may be withdrawn and will bring her $300 ; this , with $ is on the new share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives notice of withdrawal her debt will be declared paid , and she will receive $112 in cash , with a trifle more as interest-on the $12 paid on thenew // share . She is greatly pleased at this sho*ving , and says she will withdraw . Stay a moment ! Will she not lose as much more ? Yes , the bank will gladly pay her $300 for five shares , for they are worth $8i each , or $405 in all . She can do as she pleases in the matter . She considers this a moment and theij asks if she may not repay part of the loan . Yes , but why pay at all ? Does she not need the monkey in her business ? Yes , very much , but she does hate to be in debt . Oh ! that is nothing serious . It is quite as much for her interest not to pay it as it is for the bank 's . Another year passes and she calls again . This time she feels she really must withdraw . She confesses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he-that is - well , what does the secretary think about it ? What are her six shares worth now ? The first five are now declared to be worth $iio each . The year has been a prosperous one for the bank , and her share of the profits makes her five shares Worth $550 . The one share , now two years old , has a face value of $37.50 . In all , her shares are valued at $587.50 , or $387.50 more than her debt . Her eyes sparkle at this brilliant financial statement , but she wants more ready money , she must withdraw her shares . Ah ! yes , the withdrawal premium is $20 on those first shares . The installments paid amount to $6o ; so for the five she can withdraw $400 , or in other words , pay her debt and have $200 besides . The bank will gladly do this for her ; as a friend , he would advise her not to withdraw and lose so large a slice of that * but to keep on paying the interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says perhaps the shop fixtures will bring something . Besides , she intends to give John the shares , and let him pay the dues and interest till they mature . The shop fixtures are sold at an advantage and John prospers . Of course he does . Such girls always have prosperous husbands . Finally the five shares mature , and her debt is paid in spite of herself . The last and most happy report of all declares her five shares worth $200 each . The debt is taken out and declared paid . The interest has been extinguished , a dollar at a time , and the sum of $822.50 15 paid the young couple in good legal tender . Besides this , there is the one share , now five years old and declared tobe worth $135.28 ' 2 . It may be here noticed that she would have received more ready money by withdrawing the one share . In that case she would have had a clean bill for her debt and a check for $983 , and she would have been no longer a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be remarked , had been extinguished gradually by her yearly share of the profits of the association . In this way any manner of man or woman may at any time and for any length of time borrow a sum equal to the paid-up value of the shares he or she owns , and with no other security than the shares themselves . The merchant turns in his shares for a loan to meet a note . When next in funds he may return the money and receive back a portion of the premium paid and resume his shares . This he can do as often as he wishes , and every year he can make larger and larger loans . The music-teacher may put up her shares to purchase a piano , and may repay the loan when convenient . Or she can ( as the association much prefers ) let it rest till the withdraxval , or ultimate value , covers loan and premium , and then it is considered paid . In fact , it is paid all the time , for the borrower only takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fire , or if the owner is no longer able to pay the dues , the association takes her shares , and both they and her debt are extinguished at once . She loses the money paid in and all the profits . The bank recovers both , and its claim is adjusted . Next to these , come the borrowing members who can give real estate as security for loans . A certain man has held ten shares four years and has paid dues amounting to $480 . He wishes to buy a house , valued at $2,000 . He can get it for $i , *oo down , and the rest may remain as ground rent , or , in other words , on a first mortgage to the owner . He bids for $2,000 on his ten shares . He offers a liberal premium , but as he is an old member he gets an abatement on this , and , his security being satisfactory , he gets his loan of $2,000 , less the premium , or $r , *oo in money . With this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He transfers his ten shares to the association , insures the house for its benefit , and gives a second mortgage of $2,000 . Instead of rent he now pays each month his dues of ten dollars , the interest on both mortgages , the taxes , water rates , etc. , and , in all , his expenses do not exceed the rent of such a house , more than about 10 per cent . In this manner he goes on paying dues and interest each month . In five years his shares mature . The ten shares are declared to be worth $2,000 , but instead of the money the // receives a release of his mortgage , and his debt is declared paid . The house is now only subject to the ground rent . When that is paid the house will be his . He has paid $10 per month for one hundred and eight months , and the interest on $2,000 for five years , or $i , 68o in all , and the debt is extinguished . In other words , he made $320 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he buys more shares . There being only that interest to pay , he can afford to carry twenty or more shares , and very soon he borrows the money on them , and the house is his own . This loan pays itself by the installments and profits , and in this easy and simple manner he saves the total loss of the rent , has the use of the house all the time , and eventually owns it outright . Another , a poorer man , wishes a small house . He buys a lot of land on ground rent . He finds a contractor who will put up a house on the land for $1,500 cash . Sometimes the owner will do this . He then buys ten shares , at one dollar each , of some association , and bids for $2,000 on them . He offers a premium of 30 per cent. , and he gets $1,400 . His employer advances him $ioo to make up the price of the house , and becomes his bondsman that the dues and interest shall be paid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place of house rent , to pay his dues , the interest on the loan of $2,000 , the ground rent , taxes , water rates , insurance , and his loan of $ioo . Each year sees the debt reduced , and in eight or nine years it is declared paid . Another venture of the same kind clears away the ground rent , and the house is his . This ground rent system is peculiar to Philadelphia . Any person desiring to build on a lot of land can , instead of buying it , hire it for all time . If , at any time , he wishes to pay for it , the price can be offered , and the owner can not decline it . The owner can never claim payment during the lease , so long as the rent is regularly paid . It seems difficult of belief . How can these building associations make money so fast ? They have several sources of income : First , the installments paid in ; next , the fines for neglect of payment . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated meeting some borrower bids for $i , ooo . He is willing to pay 30 per cent . S for the immediate use of the money . He receives $700 , and the association retains the $300 . This is at once put up at auction , and gains a further profit of 30 per cent. , or $90 . This money is again loaned , and yields a profit of $27 . Each borrower in time gets his money , less the premium , and the association makes a triple profit of $417 in one evening , and the entire $1,417 loaned out begins to draw interest from that day . Next to this must be noticed the compounding of interest upon interest every month . All the dues , premiums , fines , and interest received each month are put together and sold , and the gross sum draws interest at once . One dollar paid in at the meeting in the form of new capital , is in a few minutes sold out and begins to draw interest . It earns a premium , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Besides these , are the profits on withdrawals . If a two-year-old share is worth * and can be bought by the association for the dues paid in and a premium of $. * , it is plain that the association makes $12 by the purchase . There is one share less to draw $200 at the end , and the final division will be reached so much the sooner . This explains the eagerness these associations display in buying up their own shares . As a large part of the shareholders and nonborrowers in any series withdraw before the eight years ' term is up , the profits on the withdrawals increase the general capital rapidly. * Philadelphia may point with pride to her hundred thousand homes , but it is not alone in these things that the chief interest of this subject lies . These associations have done more than help the people build houses , buy pianos , sewing-machines , land , or what not . Their moral are greater than their material results . It is not that they help to build a city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as inspirers of thrift , as liberal aids to industry , and as strong defenses against the stormy days that come in every life . No signal service can give even a probability of these , no cautionary flag flies before such storms , and to many a family these associations have been a sure anchor with which to outride the gale . * See " How to Manage Building A*sociatioris , Edmund Wrigley , ' Philadelphia , 1873.
