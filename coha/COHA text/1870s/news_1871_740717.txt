txt Any suggestion toward the legislation which may be required to harmonize the possessors of labor and capital , so far as they are separate classes , deserves to be carefully considered . Such a suggestion comes to us in the shape of a pamphlet printed at Geneva in 1870 , by an ingenious French writer , M. LA . RUE . The author wrote before the fortunes of war and the stupidity of the present Executive of France had sgiven the working classes , as represented by the Commune , a chance to show what they would themselves do in the matter of legislation , if they got the opportunity . In the light of that experience , his propositions are almost ludicrously out of proportion with the tremendous problem they undertook to solve ; but as they are not unlike the views advanced by some of the representatives of the laboring classes in this country , they are worth a moment 's notice . M. LA Run proposes , in brief , to abolish the legal authority for loans on pledge of property , either real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls " personal credit " ? that is , credit based on the security of personal character and responsibility . This measure , he believes , would compel money-lenders to have more intimate knowledge of the borrowers ' circumstances ; and this knowledge could only be obtained of ' those living and doing business in comparatively limited neighborhoods . Such a limitation would , so far , keep capital from seeking the great moneyed centres of the world , and would confine it to the localities in which it was created . The working classes could then more readily obtain it , and what he calls the " social anomaly " ? that the poor , who need credit , can not get it , and the rich , who de not need it , can always have it  --  would be removed . This suggestion is more worthy of attention on account of the end soaght than . oven on account of the very remarkable means proposed . It is a recognition , of the very general desire of those engaged in " labor reform " movements , to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it , without very much reference to the use likely to be made of it , or the inducements necessary to secure it from the owners of capital . Any attempt to gratify this desire by means of legislation must fail . All that have been hitherto undertaken have failed . Whether they are confined . t0 M. LA RUE 'S modest proposition to indirectly force capital into reservoirs within reach of the laboring classes , or embrace the more ambitious idea of the Socialists of opening to the laboring classes the reservoirs already in existence . they will be baffled by the irresistible tendency of capital to floe from . any place where it is subjected to the operation of force . directly or indirectly . M. LA Rules suggestion is noteworthy , because it originated before the ouvricrs had themselves acted openly on it . It is noteworthy , also , because it shows that in France as in this country , that demand was encountered with a confusion in regard to the possibility of yielding to it , which could only aggravate the evils from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of credit can be extended among the laboring classes in a way to be of any value to them . One is the freeing of labor from the part of the ex- , isting burden of taxation . This is not only feasible , but , in the United States , a matter Of prime necessity . We shall not regret the heat and urgency of the labor agitation if it results in compelling attention to this necessity . The lifting of the burden of taxation will enable laborers to devote a greater share Sf their earnings to productive industry . Just in proportion as they do this , capital will gladly seek them on terms as easy as they can ask for . The second method is by the encouragement of co-operation . This will also extend the facilities for obtaining credit , for the same reason it will extend the facilities for . its profitable employment , and the security of its returning interest . Beyond these methods , which are both of them practicable , all propositions for legislative aid in furnishing the working classes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise degree that they are visionary .
