txt An American sculptor , who has a studio in Florence , nn a recent visit to Rome , remarked : These attacks upon us , which have now become syiftematic and obstinate , are having a sensible effect upon our interest as artists . Hardly anything has been sold from fin American sculptor 's studio the present Winter . " In answer to the inquiry ' whether the artists of other . nationalities , had fared much better , the reply Wile : " It is.true , less than usual has been ordered - Of any one ; but we are those who are most exposed to damage from being the special objects of these - charges of a dishonest use of the talent of others . " If it be true that the present lack of commissions is not the result of a position , of expectancy on the part of purchasers , but a condition of positive distrust , then the question of a remedy for the ill , wherever the root of it may lie , is the one for present attention . If all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; for the charges and recriminations began among themselves , and those who have followed up the attacks outside their professional circle have been stimulated by the unquiet state of mind of some of their number . For our own part , we have no fear that American sculptors or painters will be permanently injured by criticism , however severe , if it be just . What is ? moit to be deprecated is the reckless habit of " pitching in , " so common among those who have had limited opportunities for observation , or have given to the matter little thought or patient attention . The project of bringing the accusers into court to answer to a legal prosecution , if I am correctly informed , has broken down . The Italian law of limitations demands that the suit shall be instituted within three months after the act of libel has been committed . In the present case the suit was not begun until more than three months had passed . For the present . at least , Mr. Conmoney , Mr. Story , and others , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test ' the veracity of those who have made the harsh accusations which so seriously impugn their professional integrity . AN AMERICAN NAVAL MONUMENT . There is no more hard-working or painstaking artist in Rome than Mr. Franklin Simmons , the American sculptor . In the six years of his art-practice in Italy , he has produced much ; but the work now in progress , or laid out , will make a More conspicuous exhibition and a more marked . reputation for the artist when the execution is fully carried out . The naval monument ordered . several years ago for the City of Annapolis . is approaching compleLien , and another twelve-month should be sufficient to finish the figures in marble and put the monument in place . As the original design is enlarged by the addition of other symbols , it has been a happy thought to have the memorial set up in Washington , the metropolis of the nation , instead . of placing it in the city ' lithe only claim to have it is that of being the site of the Naval Academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monument will be raised in some part of thepublic grounds of the capital city , and . will be another among the many new embelhshnients which of late years have made ' Washington more attractive. - STATUES FOR AMERICA . The statue of Roger Williams , sent home a few years back , was much praised . The ' artist was obliged to create an ideal Williams , for no authentic portrait of the founder of Rhode Island has come down to us . That the inhabitants of the little Puritan State , and . the instructed heads of the Ministry  --  who have well studied the ' character of the founder of the State  --  should be satisfied with the ideal which the sculptor bad created was the best proof of success . But Mr. Simmons has just completed . in the clay a statue for the State Of Maine , which is , perhaps , a still more striking evidence of his ability . It is a portrait of Gen. William King , the first Governor of Maine , and is one of the two statues voted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of what is called heroic size , or somewhat above the natural , and less than colossal . The action is full of vitality , without exaggeration ; with the happy combination of dignity and repose , which is the best result of art . It is to us a constant surprise that so many of our artists , who have not come out of the Academy , but have had their training and their inspiration in the great school of nature , should be able to put into their works so much of the vigorous spirit of ancient art . Those make a mistake who suppose that all , or most , of the works in sculpture produced . in Italy are of a high order of artistic merit . A great deal of rubbish can be found here , the abcumulation of modern times ; and , indeed , of every period in - which art has been practiced . Whoever , making his first visit to Rome , enters by the Porta del Popolo , will see two statues , one of St. Peter , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effigies that caricature has ever invented . They ornament the gateway designed by Michael Angelo , although they are certainly not of his master-hand . They dishonor the architectural structure which he raised . Influenced by these specimens , the traveler would turn back with the conclusion ' in his mind that Rome is not the home of the arts . With so much that is good , produced by foreign and native artists , enough also can be found here that is bad . If great blunders have been made at London or Washington , consolation may be Sound in the fact that the " unartistic Anglo-Saxons " are not alone in : esthetic misery ; there are enough Latins to keep theta company . It is an advantage for the United States of America that almost a clean page is offered to those who are called to inscribe upon it in palpable types the art-record of the future . With all the past has left in older countries ? of good . to imitate and bad to avoid  --  there will be less excuse . for the American artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR RHODE ISLAND . A year or more ago , . the City of Providence voted a sum for a monument to the founder of the State of Rhode Island , to be put up in one of the squares of that city . The design of Mr. Simmons was accepted , and the commission was given to him . There will be two figures in bronze to ornament the architectural portion of the structure , which will be in granite or marble . One of the figures will be . the statue of Roger Williams , already made , enlarged to colossal size , and a symbolical figure of the State , represented in the act of writing the inscription upon the monument . The idea is al'ready worked out , and in leas than two years from this the people of Providence will have the satisfaction of seeing another tangible Mus tration added to the monument history which they began to write a few years ago , when the memorial was raised by the State to the soldiers and sailors who lost their lives in the war . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the supervision of this artist , and is about to be sent off . It is to go to Providence , to ornament the front of a building which Mr. Robert Hale Ives has built in that city , and to which he has given the name of one who was fur so many years the head of the University . Mr. *minions has lately completed , in marble , the busts of Mr. Corps and the late Mr. John Carter Brown , of the same city , besides those of Mr. ' Speaker Blame , Mr. Brown , of Maine , and . several others going to different parts of the country . WOMEN LN ART . The native tendency of the feminine mind to artistic culture has had many illustrations , and . America has given several examples of the successful practice of art by women . If there has been no proof of genius , talent more than mediocre , or merely respectable , has been shown , and in the past ten years numbers have practiced art here in Rome . Miss Stebbins , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Freeman , and Miss Roamer , are some of the names to be found on the roll . Miss Roamer is perhaps the one who has been most heard of . and the one most overrated ; for merit is not to . be measured by the amount e praise of partial ft iends . This artist has talent , but has shown little power of composition or invention , as the poverty-stricken design for a monument to Mr. Lincoln sufficiently well shows . Whether she has yet done her best we must wait to see , but study and hard work give better assurance of praiseworthy results than a fretful Concern about fame or the sterile dalliance of an affectation of genius . We , in the infancy of our art-training. are sufficiently prone to discuss wonderful powers where others have only begun to suspect their existence . We are tot ; apt to accept as extraordinary what may be but the commonplace result of a tolerable amount of technical discipline . When artculture becomes more general with us. the liveliness of American talent will doubtless furnish a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as glad a surprise as any we have known in the past .
