ART . IV. - THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION . II . THE imperfections in our National Constitution , demonstrated by experience , have come near making shipwreck of the nation upon several occasions , threaten to do ' it again if not repaired , and should command the attention of the American people . When time has demonstrated imperfections in any system of government , the power of amendment is the only safety that government has from revolution and destruction . The capability of the British Constitution for reform has repeatedly saved that government from revolution ; and our fathers , perceiving this great truth , wisely provided in the Constitution for its amendment by two distinct methods . Perhaps it might not be improper here to explain the interest I take in this question and my connection with it . I had my attention called to the defects of the electoral system some years ago , and in December , 1872 , I offered the following resolution in the Senate - " Resolved , That the Committee on Privileges and Elections be instructed to examine and report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most practicable mode of electing the President and VicePresident , and providing a tribunal to adjust and decide all contested questions connected therewith , with leave to sit during vacation . " The resolution was adopted in March , 1873 , and the committee met in the city of New York in September , was in deliberation for several weeks , and finally agreed on the form of an amendment to the Constitution , to be reported to the Senate at the next session . This amendment was reported in May , 1874 , and is as follows : " Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled ( two thirds of each louse concurring therein ) , That the following article is hereby proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States , and , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States , shall be valid , to all intents and purposes , as a part of the Constitution , to wit : // ARTICLE - . " I. The President and Vice-President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manner following : Each State shall be divided into districts , equal in number to the number of Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress , to be composed of contiguous territory , and to be as nearly equal in population as may be ; and the person having the highest number of votes in each district for President shall receive the vote of that district , which shall count one presidential vote . " II . The person having the highest number of votes for President in a State shall receive two presidential votes from the State at large . " III . The person having the highest number of presidential votes in the United States shall be President . " IV . If two persons have the same number of votes in any State , it being the highest number , they shall receive each one presidential vote from the State at large ; and if more than two persons shall have each the same number of votes in any State , it being the highest number , no presidential vote shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one shall have the same number of votes , it being the highest number in any district , no presidential vote shall be counted from that district . " V. The foregoing provisions shall apply to the election of VicePresident . " VI . The Congress shall have power to provide for holding and conducting the elections of President and Vice-President , and to establish tribunals for the decision of such elections as may be contested . " VII . The States shall be divided into districts by the legislatures thereof , but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter the same . " My attention was called strongly to the necessity for action by an occurrence which took place at the counting of the electoral vote in February , 1873 . We had at that time what was called the Twenty-second Joint Rule , providing a plan and method for counting the electoral vote , and declaring the election of a President . It provided that when the two Houses were assembled to witness the counting of the vote , if any Senator or member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an electoral vote , for any reason , however trivial or immaterial , the two Houses should at once separate , the Senate return to its chainber , and each House vote upon the objection without debate ; and // unless the objection was overruled by both Houses , the vote objected to was to be thrown out , and lost . When the State of Arkansas was called at that counting , an objection was made to receiving the vote of the State , because the Governor 's certificate , showing the appointment of the electors , did not bear the impress of the great seal of the State . There was an impression of a seal upon the paper , which was very indistinct . By taking a glass and looking at it you could see upon it the words , " Secretary of State , " and none others ; and it was said that this impression was not made by the great seal of the State , but by a departmental seal kept by the Secretary of State . The House of iRepresentatives overruled the objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes of Arkansas were thrown out , and nearly half a million of people disfranchised . The Constitution of the United States provides , that " Each State shall appoint , in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct , a number of electors , equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress ; but no Senator or Representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall be appointed an elector . " Each State is to appoint its electors in such manner as the legislature shall provide . This power of the State to appoint electors is conferred by the Constitution of the United States , and not by the constitution of the State ; and the exercise of it can not be controlled by a State constitution . The method of appointing electors is always under the control of the State legislature , and the legislature may repeal at any time a law that may have been passed , providing for the election of electors by the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egislature , and there is no provision made in the Constitution whereby the appointment of an elector can be contested , and the States , except Louisiana , have made no provision for contesting the fraudulent appointment of an elector . Though electors may have been chosen by violence or manifest fraud , and though the whole world may know it , their votes must be received and counted ; and there is no power in Congress or anywhere else to reject such a vote . This is clearly one of the great imperfections of our system , to begin with . The Convention of 1787 had more // difficulty in providing for the election of a President than with any other branch of the Constitution . Twice , by votes long debated , they decided that the President should be elected by Congress ; twice they reconsidered that determination ; and , at the last , the opinion of the Convention was entirely revolutionized upon the subject , and it was held to be necessary , not only that the President should not be elected by Congress , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive should be independent of the legislative ; and for this purpose it was provided in the same section , that " no Senator or iRepresentative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector . " The purpose was to cut off all connection between the legislative and the executive ; so that the President should not be dependent upon the Legislature in any sense , but be beyond its control . The Constitution provides that the electors shall vote by ballot , so that one elector shall not know how the other votes . Our fathers contemplated an electoral college as a deliberative* body , - a body of men who should come together and consider who was the proper man for President ; and then , to insure their perfect independence of the country and of each other , they were to vote by ballot , so that they might vote secretly ; and , to further continue this secrecy and secure their independence , the votes were to be sealed up and sent to the President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very moment they were to be counted in the presence of the two Houses ; and if , when opened , there were imperfections or irregularities , it was then too late to mend or perfect them . As stated in a former paper , the theory of our fathers in regard to the electoral college originated in a profound distrust of the people . I have as much reverence for our forefathers as any one , but to assume that they were infallible or perfect would be a very great mistake indeed . They did not expect the legislatures would provide for appointing electors by the people ; on the contrary , the history of the Convention shows that they were opposed to that . The proposition to choose electors by the direct vote of the people was voted down time and again , and the method of selection was left to the legislatures ; and it was understood that they were to be chosen by the legislatures themselves . The idea of electing them by the people made slow // progress ; and until 1861 , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electors by the legislature . The idea was of aristocratic and monarchical origin . It had come down from ancient times , in countries where the nobility elected the monarch . While this was the theory of our fathers , it has been completely overturned in practice . So far from these electors being left free and independent to make a selection of a President , it came to pass that in every instance they were pledged in advance . They were nominated expressly on the condition that they were to cast their votes for this or that man , or to represent this or that set of principles ; and the very freedom and deliberation they were to exercise , and for which they were alone created , has been entirely abolished in practice . Our safety consists in having them over .. turned . The fact that electors are pledged in advance to vote for this candidate or for that is the only security the country has against corruption . If the electors were free to vote for whom they pleased , the patronage of a President is large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to reach the masses of the people in all the States ; they can not be corrupted by reason of their great number ; but a small body of electors , of less than four hundred , are within the reach of the patronage of the President ; and if these men were free to vote for whom they pleased , there would be the greatest opportunities for corruption and fraud . The only purpose the electoral ccillege could possibly subserve is gone , but the dangers connected with it are left ; and we have made our escape within the last six months from that very source . True democracy consists in a government of the people and by the people , in which every man shall be allowed to vote for that candidate who meets his approbation . Experience has shown us that there is more safety in a large electoral body than in a small one . The amendment proposed is , to abolish the electoral college , to brush away rubbish , and bring the election of President to the people , and let every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter now stands he can not do that ; we are obliged to vote for electors ; and , to do that , we must have a convention to put in nomination a certain number of men , who , it is known , will act together . One man can not do that ; there must be a convention , or " caucus , ** if you choose to call it by that name , and they must // ascertain that the men whom they select will carry out their views . *Where that is not done you can not vote for a President at alL Before the war in a number of States men could not vote for President unless they voted for candidates of a particular character ; because those who agreed with them were not allowed to meet in convention and nominate electoral tickets ; hence , under our present system , a convention or caucus is an absolute necessity . As the matter now stands , we have an election by the States ; our present form denies our nationality ; it is a vote by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We vote by general ticket , running through the State at large . If in the State of New York , with a population of forty-five hundred thousand , the electors on one side have a majority of one hundred , they get the whole vote of the State , just as if the people were unanimous , and the voice of more than two millions of people is silenced . The minority is utterly subjected . Where parties are nearly equally divided , a successful fraud in one precinct may determine the result in the whole State . In New York , in 1868 , there was a successful fraud perpetrated in the election in the city , repeaters marching from poll to poll and voting through the day , and this fraudulent vote carried the State for a particular candidate ; whereas , if the people had voted by districts , the fraud would only have operated in the district where it occurred . The effect of the fraud was that a particular candidate got the vote of the State of New York for President , while eighteen representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite party . This is one of the great dangers of our politics . Frauds committed in the great cities control the States in which they are situated ; whereas , if the people voted by districts , they would affect the vote only in those particular districts , and there would be less inducement to defraud . The electoral college has , as we said in a former article , never represented the will of the people ; it has never come within ten per cent of it , while it has varied from it as much as forty per cent . As it stands now it is an election by the States . But if the voting was by districts , if the people voted directly for the man of their choice , and if the man who received the largest number of votes in any Congressional district should count one , then the election would be national . Instead of New York going solidly for a particular candidate by reason of a small majority , it is divided very evenly . In // 1844 Birney took from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the vote of the State to Polk ; whereas one half I believe , of the members of Congress elected were Whigs . A like thing has been done from time to time in other States . II would prefer to elect a President by a direct vote of the people , as one great community , instead of being separated by State lines . I would prefer that they should vote as one people , and that the man who received the greatest number of votes in the United States should be the President . I would not require him to have a majority of all the votes cast , but would do , in regard to the elec .. tion of President , as we do in the election of Governors of States ; the man who gets the most votes to be President . Now the President must get a majority of the votes of the electors appointed , or the election goes to the House of Representatives . The principle itself is essentially false . But we can not amend the Constitution so as to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . The smaller States will never consent to it . Ten States can prevent the adoption of a constitutional amendment . Therefore we should do the best we can . I propose such an amendment as can receive the support of the smaller States . To prove how nearly voting by districts brings the election home to the people , the following extract from a report I made to the Senate three years ago will show : *To illustrate the operation of the district system , we will consider the comparative results of the elections for President and for members of Congress , in the four States of Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , from 1860 to 1872 . " These States voted solidly for Mr. Lincoln in 1860 , casting 74 electoral votes . At the same election they returned 66 members of Congress , of whom 24 were Democrats . " In 1864 the same States cast 76 electoral votes for Mr. Lincoln again , and elected the same year 68 members of Congress , of whom 16 were Democrats . " In 1868 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and elected 68 members of Congress , of whom 22 were Democrats . " In 1872 the same States again voted solidly , giving 85 electoral votes to General Grant , and elected 77 members of Congress , of whom 25 were Democrats . " In these four States the Democratic strength , as compared with the // 1877 . Republican , has been about as 9 to 10 , but under the operation of the general-ticket system they had been wholly unrepresented in the electoral college ; but in the House of Representatives , under the district system , they have had an average of nearly one third of the members . " Take the State of New York alone for the same period . In 1860 New York cast her 35 electoral votes solidly for Mr. Lincoln . At the same time she elected 33 members of Congress , of whom 9 were Democrats . In 1864 she again cast her 33 electoral votes solidly for Mr. Lincoln , and at the same time elected 31 members of Congress , of whom 11 were Democrats . In 1868 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State was carried for Mr. Seymour by his overwhelming majority in the city of New York , about the character of which grave charges were made , but of which the committee expresses no opinion ; but the rest of the State , unaffected in their districts by this large majority in the city , returned 18 out of the 31 members of Congress , who were opposed to Mr. Seymour , thus showing conclusively how the voice of the people of New York outside of the city had been stifled in the Presidential election by the city majority , operating through the general-ticket system . In 1872 New York cast her 35 electoral votes solidly for General Grant , at the same time electing 33 members of Congress , of whom 9 were Democrats . " And I wish to show how far short the electoral system falls of representing the sentiment and views of the people . In 1872 General Grant received 55 per cent of the votes of the people ; in the electoral college he received 81 per cent of the votes of the electors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the popular vote , and 73 per cent of the electoral vote . In 1864 Mr. Lincoln received 55 per cent of the popular vote , and 91 per cent of the electoral vote . In 1856 James Buchanan received 45 per cent of the popular vote , and 59 per cent of the electoral vote . In this election Mr. Fillmore received 25 per cent of the popular vote , and only 2 per cent of the electoral vote . In 1852 Pierce received 51 per cent of the popular vote , and 85 per cent of the electoral vote . In 1848 General Taylor received 46 per cent of the popular vote , and 56 per cent of the electoral vote . At this election Mr. Van Buren received about 10 per cent of the popular vote and no electoral vote . In 1848 James K. Polk received 50 per cent of the popular vote , and 62 per cent of the electoral vote . So that , while the electoral college has differed forty-two per cent from the popular vote , it has never come nearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts does not represent precisely the voice of the people , as a nation , yet it makes a very close approach to it , - much nearer than that which we now have . As I said before , a small majority now carries the vote of an entire State . It is entirely possible for a man to get enough electoral votes to elect him President , by receiving small majorities in a number of States ; while his antagonist may get overwhelming majorities in the other States , and have a majority of half a million or a million of the popular vote . This is not true Democracy ; it is not true Republicanism ; it is complex and complicated machinery , by which a minority may thus control a majority . Small majorities received in a number of States control overwhelming majorities received in the others . I call attention very briefly to that provision of the Constitution for electing a President by the House of Representatives in case there is no election by the electors ; that is , in case no candidate receives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Representatives is to proceed at once to choose a President , and it votes by States . Each State has one vote . New York has one vote , with forty-five hundred thousand people ; Nevada , with forty thousand people , has one vote . New York , with one hundred and fourteen times the population of *evada , has simply the same vote that Nevada has , in the election of the President . This is monstrous injustice . It can not be defended for a single moment . We can hardly understand now how such a provision could have found its way into the Constitution of the United States . We have had two elections by the House of Representatives , one in 1801 and the other in 1825 . This method of election presents the strongest possible opportunities for fraud , where a single member of Congress has it in his power , by changing his vote , to determine the result of a presidential election , and may make it to the interest of parties and of men to pay him vast sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of Congress , and danger in the path of our government , it could not be done in a more effectual way than this . In 1801 the House of Representatives balloted for a number of days without making choice of a President . The fourth of March was ere was dan approachino and th ger of its coming without a Presi dent being elected , - danger of an interregnum . On the night of // the day before the election , a member of the House , who represented a State that had but one member , went to a friend of Mr. Jefferson , and said to him : " If Mr. Jefferson will give assurance that he will retain the Collector of the port of Wilmington , in Delaware , and at Philadelphia , and will give two bills ( which were named ) his approval , I will change my vote to-morrow , and know of two other members from two different States who will change their votes . The effect of it will be to change the votes of those States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will elect him . " The message was carried to Mr. Jefferson , so said his friends , and on the next morning the assurance was given that the two collectors should be retained and the laws approved . The three members that day did change their votes , and Mr. Jefferson was elected . I know it is a common thing to say that public virtue has degenerated , and that public men have a lower grade of morals than they had fifty years ago ; but such a thing as that would now destroy any public man . In 1825 Mr. Adams was elected President by the House of Representatives . General Jackson had received the largest proportional majority that has been received by any candidate for the Presidency since that time , and he had a large plurality of the electors , - fifty per cent , - but lacked two or three of having a majority . The election was thrown into the House . There Mr. Clay of Kentucky ( who , I believe , was a pure man , nevertheless ) voted for Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his Secretary of State . This created an impression of corruption from which Mr. Clay never recovered . I have never believed there was a bargain in the case , but it presented a strong temptation and the opportunity . I denounce this clause in the Constitution , first , because of its gross injustice . There can be no excuse made for it . It is simply trampling upon rights , when forty thousand people in the State of Nevada have the same power with forty-five hundred thousand in the State of New York . There is no justice , no sense , in it . But , to take this matter still farther from the people , when the election goes to the House of Representatives , it is to be made by members of Congress who were elected nearly two years before . If the last election had gone to the House , the President would have been elected by members chosen in 1874 ,  --  chosen upon // wholly different issues and not with a view to their selection of a President . We now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of this provision , forty-six members out of that number can elect a President . If each member of Congress had one vote , that would be much more fair - that would bring the election of our chief magistrate somewhat nearer to the people . But under the provisions of the Constitution forty-six members can elect a President , as follows : Delaware , Nebraska , Nevada , and Oregon have each one member , and four members would cast the votes of those four States ; Rhode Island and Florida have each two , and four members would cast the votes of those States ; Minnesota , New Hampshire , West Virginia , Vermont , and Kansas have each three members , and two votes in each , or ten members in all the five , would cast the votes of those five States ; Arkansas , California , and Connecticut have four members each , and three in each , or nine in all , may cast their votes ; Maine and South Carolina have each five members , three of whom in each , or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mississippi , and Texas have each six members , and four in each , or twelve in all , may cast the vote of those three States . Colorado has one member and would cast one vote , and added to the other States enumerated would make twenty and elect a President . Thus forty-six members can elect him against the wishes of the other two hundred and forty-seven . OLIVER P. MORTON .
