txt The Street-cleaning Commission met yesterday , and at last gave some reason for the hope that the end of the present disgraceful reign of BROWN is at band . Mr. GREEN offered a resolution , which was adopted , authorizing him to submit to counsel the question whether the present contract to clean the streets had been carried out . This question will be submitted to the Commission next Thursday , and there can be no reasonable doubt as to what the answer will be . Never was a contract more openly and flagrantly violated than that by which BROWN undertook to clean the streets . It will undoubtedly be the opinion of the counsel consulted that this broken contract is at an end . Mr. GREEN will then have no farther excuse for paying BROWN the money of - which taxpayers are robbed , and the Street Commission can make a new contract with some decent and responsible person . A further resolution embodying the suggestion of the Timm , that the Board of Health at once proceed to remove the accumulated . filth of the Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Had it been passed , as it should have been , we should have been saved . the prolongation of our discomfort and danger , which is inevitable if we have to wait for the slow relief to be afforded by the new contractor . whom the Street Commission may authorize to do the work that BROWN has neglected . There should be no delay in this matter . Every day that the filth of the streets lies festering under the warm sun of this sudden Spring increases the danger of an epidemic . It must not be forgotten that the cholera was marching straight upon us last Summer , and that its advanced skirmishers , so to speak , actually reached this City . The cold weather fortunately saved . us for the time , but it is well known that the cholera-germs are simply dormant in Winter , and will revive with the approach of hot weather . It is probable that the seeds of cholera are with us now , and all that is needed to bring them into terrible vitality is the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . Should . this City be promptly cleaned and kept clean . the pestilence would probably be arrested . Should the work of cleaning be delayed too long , there is every reason to believe that the Summer would bring us the scourge that has more than once already devastated this City . Putting aside the question of an impending epidemic , the enormous discomfort which we have latterly suffered from the mud and dust is a sufficient reason for prompt action . Mr. GREEN has at last decided that something must be done in behalf of the victims of BROWN , and it is to his energy and perseverance that we look to insure action on the part of that Commission . The matter is now postponed until Thursday . When that day comes let there be no further delay . On Thursday the Commission can kick BROWN out of his office , and adopt immediate measures for the cleansing of the streets . A contract can be signed on Saturday , and this work begun on Monday . Every day 's delay after that time will be laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will earn a share of the indignation now so freely lavished upon contractor BROWN .
