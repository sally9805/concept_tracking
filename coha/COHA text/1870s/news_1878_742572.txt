txt A very unseemly demonstration was made in the House of Representatives when the Speaker presented a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury . Tho communication was in itself , so far as appears , a perfectly proper , and certainly a harmless , one . It referred to a statement submitted by the Commissioner of . Internal Revenue , to the effect thatthe receipts in his department of the service had fallen off some five millions of dollars since the opening of the fiscal year , and attributing this fact largely to the un certainty arising from the agitation of the proposition to reduce the tax on whisky and tobacco . The Secretary urged Congress to take cognizance of these facts , and to either reduce expenses or increase the revenues from taxation , or both . At these suggestions Mr. Noon took umbrage . Ho does not seem to have been getting on very well with his revenue measures lately , and his temper has suffered accordingly . With a snappishness which was wholly misdirected , the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and declared that the work of his committee was constantly interfered with by the independent steps taken by tho House . Another gentleman , Mr. HARRISON , of Illinois , wanted the Secretary 's communication laid on the table as impertinent and unwarranted , and he raised a point of order based on that view . The Speaker was obliged to try to suppress Mr. HARRISON with the remark that communications from the Treasury Department are not only in order , but have always been received with proper attention . Mr. HARRISON , however , was not to be suppressed , and declared that it was time the precedents were changed and the encroachments of the Executive checked . Mr. STEPHENS , of Georgia , pointed out that the Secretary 's letter was in the direct lino of his duty , and Mr. GARFIELD mildly inquired if the right of petition was to be abolished in respect of the Secretary of the Treasury . Finally , the communication was allowed to go to the Committee of Ways and Means , where Mr. WOOD will have it under his own paw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growl over it to his heart 's content . Meantime , the Senate has passed the House resolution , to the effect that it is inexpedient to reduce the tax on spirits , and the purpose of the Secretary is. in part secured . There is probably no Government on the face of the earth in Which representative institutions are supposed to exist , in which the Legislature , and especially the popular branch of it , would consent to such a scene as the one to which we have just referred . There is certainly no other Goyernment which would go on legislating year after year for interests so vast as those with which Congress deals , in such - a haphazard , blind , and clumsy way as our National Legislature adopts . It Would seem ' to be one of the first essentials of sound legislation that the legislative body should have ready , detailed , and , comprehensive information at all times , and in the most intelligible form , from its financial agent , who , in this case , is the Secretary of , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is furnished in person , under due restrictions to prevent waste of time or partisan abuses , by the Chancellor of the Exchequer . ' Under our , system , the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means comes nearest to filling the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer . To him is intrusted , with his committee , the task of devising the means of obtaining the revenue , and primarily of distributing taxation  --  and determining its . general limit . He has also the presentation of his scheme before the House , and the duty of such explanation as it may be necessary to make . ' But his position differs from that of the English fiscal , chief in several important regards . In the first place , he has nothing to do with the disbursements ; the duty Of making these correspondent , with the revenue being placed in entirely independent hands . In the next place , he has no distinct responsibility to the House . If he ' mismanages his bill after he has got it up , it ' tells against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has no power to give more than general facts . He may be ever so sharp an observer of the Treasury Department , its methods and its purposes , but he must always be an outside observer ; ho can , never have the intimate practical knowledge which a responsible head of the Treasury would have . Realizing that he has not this knowledge , he does not try , and the House does not ask him , to treat fiscal questions as he would if he did have it . And so the business of regulating the revenues and expenditures of the Government ? goes on in the most unsatisfactory manner , no one having , or being required to have , a real and efficient responsibility in regard to the matter . The scene in the House yesterday was an illustration of the confusion and misunderstanding which surround the entire question . A communication of the most business-like character , convoying important information , and making practical suggestions , was received with indignation by the man who ought to be most eager to be well7 informed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time in the Senate showed still more clearly some of the consequences to which our loose methods of revenue legislation expose the country and its representatives . Mr. MCCREERY , of Kentucky , . when the resolution regarding the whisky tax came up , remarked that he had intended to submit a substitute for it , and to make some obServations regarding it , but that it was the opinion of certain gentlemen largely interested in the subject-matter of the resolution that he had better keep quiet , and in deference to that opinion ' he would do so . The frankness of the avowal and Mr. McCREERy 's personal standing make it impossible to attribute any sinister motives to the Senator ; but it remains true that it was not the needs of the Government or the justice of the measure , or any consideration of legislative expediency , which controlled his action . It was the opinion of interested persons . What this might and does lead to in such matters our readers know only too well .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
