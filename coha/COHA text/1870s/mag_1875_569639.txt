ARTICLE VJ. - DR . BACON 'S " GENESIS OF THE NEW ENGLAND CHURCHES . " The Genesis of the New England Ohurches . By LEONARD BACON : with illustrations . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers , Publishers , Franklin square . 1874 . No one would be likely to open a volume from the pen of Dr. Leonard Bacon , bearing the above title , and not anticipate a rich , entertaining , and instructive book . With his general ability as a writer , on whatever subject engages his attention , and with his special love of every thing pertaining to the history of the early New England fathers , one could be sure beforehand that the work would not only repay perusal , but a careful and critical study . Many students in Yale College , over a range of forty years past , will bear free and hearty testimony to the profitable instructions they have received , in this department , from the lips of Dr. Bacon : not as a teacher in the University , but in his larger capacity , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights , in the old Center Church meeting-house , when to full audiences and to attentive listeners he was wont to unfold , from time to time , in varied series of discourses , some section of local or general New England history . Through a life which has now reached a vigorous old age , hardly any man among us has done more to make known unto the children the sacred memorials of the fathers . He has wrought long and patiently , in the spirit of the old Hebrew song : " Walk about Zion , and go round about her : tell the towers thereof Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following . " If one were to open the volume before us with no knowledge whatever as to its authorship , he would speedily discover that it was not the work of a young man , rushing into print , with his newly-gathered facts . Even if it were possible for a youthful author to have possessed himself of every historical fact and incident here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this . The richest part of the volume is that // which is between and behind the printed lines . All recently acquired knowledge is , at the best , only partial and half-way knowledge . When one listens , for the first time , to some grand musical overture , he has not really heard it , however much he may have thought himself delighted . Those subtle influences of sound must play about the soul again and again , with long intervals between , before the power to hear is fully awake . And it is much the same in the general action of the mind . When one first traverses a particular field of history , he sees only the dry bones of this history , the skeleton forms , without the grace of life and motion . The delicate interlockings of part with part  --  the flesh that clothes and the sinews that move , - these belong to a later stage of knowledge . History , in this its more perfected form , becomes almost a transcript of life itself where not a moment lies idle-where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-where a thousand busy forces are forever working off their results and passing them on to the future . In the work before us we clearly trace the effects of a longcontinued process of thought , analysis , assimilation . It is the ripe fruit of a long life-  --  a life that yet shows no decay , but has all its functions in full exercise . The field of history here traversed has been held under such close and thoughtful contemplation for so many years , that the agencies at work in it have been comprehended in something like their manifold relations . And yet many readers , as they notice the title and open the book , may be disappointed at finding it so largely occupied with persons and events on the other side of the water , and in remoter generations . They may have anticipated that the narrative would begin with the settlements on our own shores , and cover the early periods of our own colonial history , perhaps for a century . But it must be remembered that this is the " Genesis " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called the " Exodus , " which we trust may be completed , and which will doubtless cover the essential ground above indicated . Indeed , the present volume brings the Pilgrims to their abode at Plymouth , and follows them on through ten years of their settlement at that place . It then pauses to take // a hasty glance at the first planters in the Massachusetts Bay , and the founding of the Church at Salem , and there the narrative stops . But the author is true to his title . His aim was , first of all , to search out the causes and courses of events in the old world , by which these New England churches were brought into being . As to the facts of the book , Dr. Bacon lays no claim to be a discoverer . The materials which he has used lie open to all . His own statement , in the preface , on this point is frank and modest . He says of the volume , " It makes no profession of bringing to light new facts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It simply tells an old story , giving perhaps here and there a new interpretation or a new emphasis to some undisputed fact . My purpose has been to tell this story clearly and fairly , not for the instruction or delight of antiquarians , nor merely for those with whom church history is a professional study , but for all sorts of intelligent and thoughtful readers . He who writes only for scholars , or for the men of some learned profession , can say , Fit audience let me find , though few ; ' but my labor has been thrown away if the story which I have written is not so told as to invite the attention and to stir the sympathies of the many . . . - The story which I tell is the story of an idea slowly making its way against prejudices , interests , and passions  --  a story of faith and martyrdom , of heroic endeavor and heroic constancy . It includes only so much of secular history as is involved in the history of the idea , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it a reality in the world of fact . " The first and second chapters of the book are occupied with the elemental facts of New ripestament history , and with the corrupting changes and departures from the simple apostolic idea of doctrine and polity . The third chapter opens to us the age of Luther and the Reformation , with its protest against false and corrupt doctrines-with its reconstruction of theology , but with little regard to the forms of ecclesiastical polity . It points out distinctly the political and secular elements which mingled with the religions in the years following the Reformation , and which led to the construction of the great national // Churches of Protestant Europe . It then passes , in the fourth chapter , to the English reformation , and the gradual growth , from generation to generation , of the Puritan idea and the Puritan party in the kingdom . Here the narrative reaches the chief field of its action and becomes more slow and careful in its movement , unfolding , step by step , the progress of thought and incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , under Wycliffe and the Lollards , a hundred and fifty years before Luther opened his fierce and daring controversy . It shows how this pure stream of spiritual thought and holy feeling , flowing downward from Wycliffe , met and mingled with the turbid waters of political strife and ambition , when king and nobles , not for Christ 's sake , but their own , broke away from the galling yoke of papal supremacy . This last was a reformation not worthy of the name-  --  a thing of outward form , without spiritual reality  --  a compound of earthly aims and wicked passions , where the sovereign was merely put in the place of the Pope , and one tyrant was exchanged for another . And so began that long and heroic struggle for religious truth and purity , in which individual men , here and there over all England , still keeping themselves within the pale of the English Church , dared in many things to refuse obedience to the ruling powers , and patiently suffered the cruel consequences . In the reign of Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . In secret places , good men had been saying to themselves and to each other , " How long , 0 Lord , how long ! * There began to be a sense of profitless , unrewarded toil , in the attempt to infuse a true spiritual life into the corrupt body of the English Church . Here and there was a man , who seemed to hear a voice from heaven saying , " Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues . " The origin and growth of this idea begins to be traced in the fifth chapter , which bears the suggestive title , taken from the language of the more advanced minds of that day , " Reformation without tarrying for any . " In this , and in several chapters following , covering the reign of Elizabeth , the progress of this thought , and what it cost to those who held it , are graphically depicted . We have the story , // tenderly told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Greenwood , of Francis Johnson and John Penry , who with their associates of lesser name " counted not their lives dear unto themselves , " if they might establish the truth of God , and the purity of Christian worship in the England which they loved . Robert Browne , who seemed to rise at first like a guiding star to this little company , and who gave his name to this select companionship , afterwards set ingloriously in shame and darkness . That name hung like a dead weight upon the Separatists for a century afterwards . Even a man like Cotton Mather , from his more easy and comfortable surroundings , in the Massachusetts Bay , was not above flinging this name at the Pilgrims , down at Plymouth , seventy years and more after the landing . Had he set himself , instead , upon the work of imitating their hunible virtues , and their clear discernment of Christian realities , his own name , honored as it is , would have been still more bright and shining . But Robert Browne became a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their toilsome journey . To quote from the volume before us , " Robert Browne was not a martyr . He was not of the stuff that martyrs are made of . The passion that impelled him was the love of agitation . When that passion had partly spent itselg he did what mere agitators often do as they grow olderhe turned conservative and betrayed the cause for which he had contended . " This man not only was not a martyr , but after boasting how many prisons he had been in for conscience sake , became scandalous in his life , and at last was ready to " crouch " before the English Church " for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , " and say , " Put me , I pray thee , into one of the priests ' offices , that I may eat a piece of bread : " and the English Church , that could not bear a Puritan or a Separatist , however meek and holy in life , and orderly in all moral conduct , could bear him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put him into a comfortable living . It was a curious combination of ideas , that after he had written so much to prove that the Church of England was no church , he should at last come to occupy one of her parishes , bearing the odd name of " Achurch . " This wretched old man was alive when the Pilgrims came to Plymouth , and lived on ten years longer , // dying in 1630 , and his name was a most convenient weapon , wherewith their enemies could taunt and tax them . But though Browne became a renegade , a crown of glory rests upon the heads of his early associates , and their names shall be kept in everlasting remembrance . iDr . Bacon has told the story of the sufferings and heroic faith of Copping , Thacker , Penry and the rest , in a way to make a deep impression upon his readers . The eyes moisten , as we follow them through their painful fortunes . Not in a fit of momentary passion and impulse , but in their calmest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forgiveness which Christ exercised towards his murderers , they " died in faith , not having received the promises , but haviug seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them . " In the tenth chapter of the volume , we reach the formation of the Scrooby Church in the north of England , far away from London and the scenes described in the preceding chapters . The waves of persecution had rolled so fiercely over the first Separatists around the central city of the kingdom , as to baffle their attempts at organization . They could die , one by one , for their faith , but they could not combine and maintain public ordinances in the face of this overwhelming power . And so it is to the Scrooby Church that we have to look for the first compacted organization which was able to bear the brunt of those times , and maintain a continued existence to after generations . It is true , the old L9ndon or Southwark Church , with which the above named martyrs had been associated , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asunder and scattered to the four winds , to be afterwards , in some sense , gathered and reformed in Amsterdam . But the Scrooby Church , after its formation , and amid all its strange vicissitudes , appears to us in the form of unbroken and continued life . This was near the time when the long and persecuting reign of Elizabeth was drawing to a close . She died soon after , in 1603 , and James L came from Scotland to take her place . The hopes that had been formed from his Presbyterian education and the general atmosphere in which he had before lived , were speedily dissipated . He took the earliest opportunity to throw himself into the arms of the persecuting party of the // Church of England , and to further all its violent measures . And there was this additional burden to be borne under his reign , that he could not play the part of a simple , straightforward tryant , and there end the matter . He must needs show himself all the while , such an unreasoning , self-conceited dotard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the land was governed by a fool . If with the same essential qualities of mind and character , he had been one of the common people , he might , by a rigid course of daily discipline , have been trained into some feeble measure of common sense . But he was a king , on the throne of a great and powerful nation , and there were sycophants enough about him to keep him under the impression , all the while , that he was the very Solomon of the age . It was under such general conditions as these that the Scrooby Church came into existence and entered upon its course of eventful history . Happily it was so far apart from the great central thoroughfares of the kingdom , that , in its early days , it escaped , in some measure , the close and rigid scrutiny which might otherwise have been exercised over it . In that distant and lonely corner of the land , where the county lines of Lincolnshire , Nottinghamshire , and Yorkshire draw near together , and in an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of Christ 's true and sincere followers were left for a time very much to themselves . From the point where the narrative reaches this Scrooby Church , and onward , we have the elements of a continuous story , and the interest gathers and deepens to the end . It is a story too , which , for healthy and intelligent minds , will have more than the fascination of a novel ; for truth like that here embodied is not only " stranger than fiction , " but it is far more profoundly interesting . This story has been often told , and well told ; sometimes in a fragmentary way and sometimes more continuously . Our Pilgrim literature is already rich in its memorial volumes . But we are quite sure , on the whole , that the story has never been so well told before . And this , as has been already intimated , is not due to the discovery of new facts , but to the skillful way in which the old facts have been coilocated and arranged . Facts can be so stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // operation ; or they can be so exhibited as to charm the dullest ear to listen . " Hold the light for me so that you can see plainly yourself ; and then I can see , " is a wise old piece of advice in which many a boy has been indoctrinated . In this case , it is the clear vision of the author that gives a clear vision to us . He sees the path he is traveling so distinctly , that he makes us see it . All objects stand out in graphic fullness and detaiL We look in upon the quiet little assemblies gathered in the house of William Brewster  --  the old manor-house of Scrooby . We follow them through those early years of peace , before the storm of persecution began to break about them , while yet they " took sweet counsel together and walked to the house of God in company , " under the pastoral guidance of Richard Clyfton and John Robinson . There was also another little assembly of like-minded Christian people , whose place of meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this was under the spiritual direction of John Smyth , a man of high culture and standing in the English Church , but he had chosen to cast in his lot with these despised and simple-hearted people . These two congregations , the one meeting at Scrooby and the other at Gainsborough , were only as parts of one whole , gathering in this manner because of the distance that must be traversed to bring them together in one place . " Their fears , their hopes , their aims were one , " and there was also a large fellowship , counsel , companionship between them . But these days of quiet , undisturbed Christian enjoyment were few . The officers of government and the keen-eyed defenders of ecclesiastical supremacy were on their track . The trick of the tryant is old and familiar . It was Elijah that " troubled Israel " in the days of Ahab . It was Daniel and his companions that threatened the overthrow of all law and order in Babylon . The few Christians in the days of Nero were plotting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense , the tyrant j udges rightly . He sees where his danger lies . And so it was a thing not to be endured in England , in the days of King James I. , that a few Christian people should meet , to sing and pray together and study the word of God , outside the supervision and manipulation of the English Church . This was an offense so great that all ordinary crimes sank into significance beside it . // King James , on his first coming from Scotland to take the English throne , had declared in respect to all such people that he would " harry them out of the land . " But now , when these people could no longer meet together in a quiet way , all that they asked for was , that they might be permitted to leave their native land in peace . Much as it would cost them to separate themselves from their old homes and the England which they loved , for Christ 's sake they were ready to do this , and set up their simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " harrying them out of the land , " all cruel and wicked devices , on the part of government officers , were resorted to in order to prevent them from leaving the English shores . The simple story of what these men and women suffered that they might reach their place of voluntary exile in Holland  --  the haughty disregard of all their private rights  --  the shameful liberties taken and the insults offered  --  the treachery and deception practiced upon them- this story can not be read in this day , by American freemen , without a boiling indignation . Nor can it be read without a recognition also of the fact , that the liberty we enjoy has been a thing of slow growth , and many by-gone generations have travailed in toil and suffering to give it to us . But we can not follow this story , step by step , through the lift in Holland , and the emigration to the new world . Our limits forbid , and we desire to suggest some general thoughts awakened by the reading of this graphic narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that from this point onward to the end of the volume , there is a steady growth of interest . Sometimes we read a book which gains our general respect , and having begun it , a certain sense of duty constrains us to finish it . We notice the whole number of pages , and feel a kind of relief when we have reached the midway point in our passage . Our joy increases as we watch the diminishing bulk of the closing leaves , and we are happiest when we have fairly reached the end . An important duty is done . But the law of this book , in its effect upon the mind of the reader , is exactly the opposite of this . We linger amid the closing chapters , and do not wish to contemplate the fact that the narrative is , by and by , to stop . We would cherish and prolong the pleasure of the reading . Especially , after the Pilgrims // have reached Plymouth , we sit and watch the changing pictures of their hard and simple life-their toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things earthly and things heavenly-their strength to do , and their patience to endure-their keen-eyed diplomacy by which they baffled alike the selfish policy of their friends and the hatred of their enemies-their confidence in God and their uplifting courage in the days of sorest danger and distress-their kind and friendly intercourse with their Indian neighbors , until these swarthy dwellers in the forest were taught practically to know what good faith and the Christian law of love meanthese and a thousand little unnamed things which belong to real life every where , make up a narrative exceedingly instructive and charming . The story at last becomes like the sacred confidences of friend with friend . After the formal calls are over , and the ceremonial guests have departed , when the night deepens and the doors are shut , we gather closer around the warm and genial hearthstone , and we talk , with no sense of the flow of time , while our hearts burn within us ; so does this story become to us , as it winds in and out , arid lingers amid the old memorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the general impressions left upon the mind by the reading of this book , this one stands out very clearly , viz : that not for worldly and temporal ends , but for Christ 's sake and His Gospel , did these persecuted Pilgrims sit down upon these wild shores . This truth , the Christian men and women of New England have never doubted , but the fact is so emphasized and corroborated in this narrative , that it will be hard for the sceptic to stand against it . It is a sad fact in this world that no Christian civilization has ever yet been high and perfect enough , so that it did not breed many men , who have found their most delightful occupation in sitting upon the gravestones of their pious ancestors and trying to discover what sharp and funny things can be said against them . And so we have always had among us many individuals , sons of New England , who were bound to believe , and make others believe so far as they could , that it was only for purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritans // of the Bay , first sought this New England wilderness . Not conscious themselves of any motive above the selfish and earthborn , they have been stout in their belief and declaration , that no one has ever acted from any higher consideration . But he who can read these records of the men and women at Plymouth , and not see that the earthly was subordinated to the heavenly , must have a strange way of studying history . What these people passed through , in their first year , would have annihilated any scheme resting upon a purely earthly basis . Evils less than theirs did annihilate many an earthly scheme for planting colonies here . Trading and commercial enterprises were tried here before the Pilgrims settled at Plymouth . Enterprises of this kind were going on around them during the early years of their abode on these shores , but these plans and combinations for money went utterly to nought ,  --  were dissolved and scattered before the fierce blasts of adversity , which fell upon them-no fiercer certainly than those with which those poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand firm in battle array when half the number with which it went into the battle is lying dead upon the plain , and a majority of its living members are wounded and disabled ? Long before such a crisis is reached , the trumpet sounds a retreat . But this was just the condition of that Pilgrim band as the weary months of that first winter drew to a close , and not a suggestion do we hear of failure and discomfiture . When the spring days came , and the harbor was unlocked , the May Flower spread its white sails and passed out of their sight on its return to England , but the Pilgrims stayed fast by the graves of their dead . Here was an underlying motive mightier than the earthly , and nothing bat the enduring strength of this motive gave them the victory . Most people are not aware that there ever was any other attempt at colonizing New England , except this at Plymouth , until the Puritans began to gather in Salem and Charlestown and Boston in 1629 . The great majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Englishmen that ever set foot on the New England shores ; the only white men that the Indians ever saw , up to the time when the Massachusetts Colony began to break ground in the Bay . But the // Indians all along this eastern shore had been acquainted with Englishmen , and that too to their cost before the Pilgrims came hither . The Plymouth people had not merely to show themselves just and true and friendly in their relations with the Indians . They had also to efface the impressions of fraud and cruelty and wrong which had been left among these children of the forest by earlier visitors from England , who came here for other ends . It would be instructive , were there time , to point out and dwell upon the particulars of the chief trading expeditions which ante-dated or were nearly cotemporary with the settlement at Plymouth , just to show how incoherent and short-lived they were , and how speedily they went to pieces under the weight of earthly disaster . So small is the place they fill in the records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general mind takes no note of them . It stands out before the fair-minded historical student as a demonstration , that nothing but vital religious principle could have been strong enough to secure the succession in this Plymouth settlement and to pass it on to its magnificent inheritance of the future . In this volume we watch this interest , when it seems outwardly only a little flickering flame , which one strong breath would forever extinguish . But it was the bush that " burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed , " because the oil of divine grace and strength was ministered through secret channels which no wordly eye could see . And all this stands out in the book before us with wonderful fullness and clearness , not so much because it is made the subject of special argument , but it reveals itself in the surrounding facts and in the progress of events . Again , this volume helps to make clearer , what was plain enough perhaps before to many minds , viz : that the leading men among the Pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles-men who , without once stopping to recognize the fact , or taking to themselves any glory for it , had really thought farther into the future than any other men of their generation . Joined with these far-reaching and revolutionary ideas , they had also , what we do not always find in bold reformers , a tolerance and forbearance , patience , meekness , gentleness , such as make their // characters truly admirable and worthy of our closest study . We can safely challenge all the world to come and exercise the sharpest scrutiny . All we ask is , that men shall study till they see and understand the case as it is , and there need be no fear as to the result . Yet these people-these Pilgrim men and women , had been treated in England as though they were but the offscouring of the earth . As the hunter points out the wild game in the woods , and lets loose his hungry dogs upon it , so they had been pointed out for sport and abuse , to coarseminded , vulgar officials-minions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress and suffering . But time works out its grand compensations . " He hath cast down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree . " As the case stands to-day , compare the life , the character , the manhood of such men as William Brewster and William Bradford , with that of the mean and contemptible monarch who then occupied the throne of England , and with many of the leading men in Church and State , who fawned and bent the knee before him . And in respect to this symmetry of moral character and breadth of understanding , it is not to be denied that the leading men of Plymouth were superior to the leading men in the Bay . It was not the fashion in the early New England generations to think so . Life rolled in fuller , stronger tides about the Bay , and it was a matter of small consequence what those poor people down at Plymouth might be thinking or doing . No great good was expected to come from that little Nazareth . And yet , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was credited for , in shaping the institutions , civil and religious , in the Massachusetts Bay . As Dr. Bacon has very clearly pointed out , the first Puritan Church , founded in Salem , was not shaped after any pre-conceived model , brought out with the Puritan emigrants from England . It took its mould partly from nature and the snrrounding circumstances , and partly from the wise suggestions of good old Dr. Fuller ( deacon and doctor ) , of the Plymouth Church , in his conversations with Gov . Endicott . And this result too was the fulfillment of a kind of prophecy uttered by John IRobinson , in his farewell ad. dress to the departing Pilgrims . " For , said he , there will be no difference between the unconformable ministers and you , when // they come to the practice of the ordinances out of the kingdorn . " That Robinson should have uttered those words nine years before the organization of the first Puritan Church " out of the kingdom , " shows us not only his own deep sagacity as a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also what we are now endeavoring to illustrate , that the thinking habit , on the religious and ecclesiastical questions of that day , among these leading men of the Pilgrims , was more profound and exhaustive than anywhere else . The " unconformable ministers " were those who were not Separatists , men who still kept themselves within the fold of the English Church ,  --  - Puritans , as they are known in history ; who , in respect to their opposition to many of the rites and usages of that Church , were also called non - conformists . Robinson foresaw , that when those men should come to organize a church , away from England , in the shadows of the wilderness , it would have to take shape according to the Pilgrim idea of a church . But these " conformable ministers " had had no such revelation at that time . They were groping their way in ecclesiastical darkness . When those first large companies of Puritans came over in 1629 and 30 , they brought no church model with them , and were really in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions should take . We admire that touching little address of iliggiason , which he uttered from the stern of the ship , as the shores of their loved England were receding from the view : " We will not say , as the Separatists were wont to say , " etc . It is not to be denied that his words have in them an exceeding tenderness and beauty . But they show us also that , ecclesiastically speaking , he was " going out , not knowing whither he went . " They show us , that for him the umbilical cord had not yet been cut . He was still held within the confines of his infantile existence , a ndhad not entered upon a self-thinking , individual , independent life . But Robinson and his leading associates had pondered these problems-had thought them out to the end . Robinson saw ( for the pattern had been shown him in the mount ) what essential shape that first church at Salem would take , years before its existence ; while to the very men that organized it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wilderness soil . // Did the limits of our Article allow , it would be an agreeable and instructive exercise to pass these leading men of Plymouth before us one by one , William Brewster , William Bradford , Edward Winslow , Isaac Allerton , John Carver , Myles Standish , Samuel Fuller , John Alden , John lowland , and others-to dwell for a little time upon their previous personal histories and their individual characters  --  to point out their several experiences and the way in which the hand of God had led them , one by one , to prepare them for their work . It was a strange outward culture through which they had individually passed , but this culture meeting with and being shaped by the grace of God in their hearts , had wrought a wonderful ripeness of understanding and Christian character . Even plucky Myles Standish , who was not of the church , and who seems at first view a little out of place in this sacred companionship , was ; after all , a very important member of the little confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shape of untutored savages lurking in the woods , and more rascally white men , who were coming to these shores as fugitives from law , or as mere hap-hazard adventurers , there was a natural place in this Plymouth commonwealth for the bold and fiery little captain . We have heard of an honest-hearted young fellow , who without much experience , undertook to do the shopping in the meat , vegetable , and grocery line , for a small family . Being perfectly fair and unsophisticated in all his transactions , he found himself so often cheated and abused , that he came home one day in the full conviction that in these times there must be one person in every Christian family to lie , cheat , and steal for the family . We sometimes think of Myles Standish , down among the Plymouth Pilgrims , a little in this same way . Inevitably there was some rough work to be done , and he was the man to do it promptly and thoroughly . It was a small army that he led , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , had they seen him marshal his little company and lead them out upon some important military expedition . But few or many , it is sufficient to say , that he executed his orders with so little delay , that the standing army did not become a heavy tax upon the resources of the State , and was a most important balance-wheel in those early days of Pilgrim history . // But there was another side in the character of Myles Standish , in which he appears before us with all the sympathy and gentleness of a woman , tending the sick in that first terrible winter and performing for them the most humble and lowly offices . And , in spite of his seeming roughness , he must have been a man of the Pilgrim way of thinking , else he would never have linked his fortunes so closely to theirs , and cast in his lot with them through all those years of toil , hardship , and adversity . The present volume of IDr . Bacon does not reach downward in time far enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the different influences and tendencies , political and ecclesiastical , which have flowed out from Plymouth on the one hand , and the Massachusetts Bay on the other , into the shapings of general society and the direction of our national life . This is a large and intensely interesting question , and one which the present generation is much better able to discuss intelligently than former generations have been . But while we do not propose to enter upon this question in an extended way , it may be proper to say , in general , that if Plymouth could have had a larger share , a more ruling voice in the first fifty years of New England history , we should have been saved from some of the grand mistakes which society has had to endure and outlive . Plymouth , if left alone , would never have been likely to perpetrate the I1a*f-way Covenant scheme of 1662 , which trailed its weary and disastrous way among us for more than a century afterwards . At Plymouth the elements were not present for the construction or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being out of the conditions of society in the Bay . Nor , if Plymouth had been left to herself , should we ever have had the Cambridge l*latform or the Saybrook Plat* form in some of their most arbitrary and objectionable features . The draft of the Cambridge Platform , which , in general , was accepted and adopted by the Synod of 1648 , came from the pen of IRichard Mather . There were associated with him , on the committee to prepare plans or drafts for the action of the Synod , John Cotton of Boston , and Ralph Partridge of IDuxbury , in the old colony . Mr. Cotton , busy with his important charge in Boston , and with his many public cares , does not appear to have // made any draft by himself , but knowing that his more retired neighbor . Mr. Richard Mather of Dorchester , was of the same essential way of thinking on ecclesiastical matters with hirnselg he entrusted the work to him . Both these men were already public writers on Church government , and their views were well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able man , and it has always been understood that he prepared a scheme of his own to be presented to the Synod , but as might naturally be expected , in a body constituted as that was , his plan did not prevail What ever became of the manuscript draft from the pen of Mr. Partridge , has been a puzzling question with New England antiquarians . But recently some light has been shed upon the subject . There has long been slumbering in the Antiquarian Library of Worcester an old man uscript which had come down from the early days , but which bore no name , and its history and design were not apparent upon a hasty glance . Recently , Rev. H. M. Dexter , D.D. , has identified this manuscript as the one presented by Mr. Partridge to the Synod of 1648 , and in due time it is to be published , with historical and explanatory notes . If Mr. Partridge , in preparing it , really embodied the Plymouth ideas , as they were current in the old Colony at the time the Synod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His attempt might possibly have been , knowing how the currents were then running , to prepare what he supposed might be acceptable to the majority of the Synod , in which case the document would be less valuable . But if we find the Plymouth ideas in it , we shall be likely to find something quite different from the ideas embodied *n the Cambridge Platform . But little Plymouth was mostly ignored in that day . The wisdom which was then abroad and popular was not her wisdom . But after long and patient waiting , her day has come at length , and it is not difficult now to see that she thought deeper , purer , better thoughts on matters of Church and State , than those which were then uppermost . " The conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their homes in the rocks . " It is a most interesting and suggestive exercise to open , side by side , the first volume of the Plymouth Colonial Records and the first volume of the Massachusetts Colonial Records  --  to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparative view , and see what was going on in the two places at one and the same time . Here were English-born people , only recently transferred to these shores , but so separated by the wilderness that intervened and by their diverse ecclesiastical origin , that they were almost as much apart practically as if they bad had their habitations on distant continents . Each Colony went on very much in its own way , with small regard to the other . By virtue of their common humanity , their kinship of race , and their exposure to the same general outward conditions , their common earthly wants and occupations were much the same . But there is a nice and subtle difference between the two records . Take the year 1633 , ( for in that year the Plymouth published records begin , ) when Boston and Charlestown are only four years old , and it is easy to see that life is much more full , noisy , tumultuous in the Bay than at Plymouth . There is more of rough and coarse crime , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which require adj udication are rather of a civil order , such as arise from misunderstandings between man and man . Not that real crime is wholly absent from Plymouth , but it is less violent and less in amount . It is a significent fact , and , according to our present habits , not a little amusing , that the first entry in the Plymouth volume should be the following : " It was enacted by publick consent of the freemen of this society of New Ply mouth , that if now or heereafter , any were elected to the office of Governour , and would not stand to the election , nor hold and execute the office for his yeare , that then he be amerced in twenty pounds sterling fine ; and in case refused to be paid upon the lawfiil demand of the ensuing Governour then to be levied out of the goods or chattels of the said pson so refusing . " And it was further ordered and decreed , that if any were elected to the office of Councell and refused to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling fine ; and in case refused to be paid , to be forthwith levied . " It would seem from this record that the present rage for officeholding could not have come down to us from Plymouth . In this year 1633 , there appear by these records to have been in Plymouth sixty-eight men who were freemen and who were // entitled to vote and hold office . By another list furnished for the same year , we have the names of those who were subject to taxation . A public tax was laid , and ninety individuals , of whom two were widows , were the tax-payers . This shows no large disparity between the freemen and the tax-payers ; and several who were not freemen at the time the tax was levied became so very soon afterwards . It was very different in the Massachusetts Bay , where none but Church members were admitted freemen . Tn 1640 , Thomas Lechford , writing upon this point , tells ns : " Now the most of the persons at New England , ( meaning especially Massachusetts Bay ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freemen . " " The most " may be interpi-eted as a majority merely , but is probably used in a much larger sense . This restriction as to Church membership did not prevail at Plymouth , and though regard was there had to character and standing in those who were to share in the duties and privileges of government , yet the system was in general large and liberal . But we must bring our Article to a close . This volume of Dr. Bacon was written for the people , and we trust it will be widely read by the people . And if it is so read it will be of great service in diffusing a larger information and a more lifelike knowledge of the Pilgrim Fathers-what kind of men they were in their private characters and what were their public ends and aims Ancestral pride may grow into repulsive forms , but it is a good thing for any man to have an ancestry of which he has no occasion to be ashamed . We did not all spring from the Pilgrim Fathers , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old New England population can trace its origin to this source . But it is a case where we ought to be permitted to choose our own ancestry , for it is a spiritual and ecclesiastical ancestry that we are after , " For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly , . . . but he is a Jew which is one in - wardly . " And more and more , every year , as we read the signs of the times , the Plymouth stock , so to speak , is rising in the market of the world . The value of those men , not as actors only , but as thinkers-as men who founded institutions and gave a new direction to civilization itself is , and will be more and more appreciated as the generations pass by , and the years of the race accumulate .
