txt Every citizen going to the polls on Tuesday , should remember the distress which has come upon Memphis from the yellow-fever plague . One-twelfth of the entire population has died in the few weeks the pestilence has raged ; a like mortality in this City would have destroyed 80,000 people . There is no one who can not imagine what would have been the effect of such a calamity in the widespread desolation , the abject misery , it would have caused . In proportion to its population , that disaster has actually fallen upon Memphis . There are thousands of orphans who must be cared for , and thousands of convalescents who must be nursed back to health and strength . There are thousands of widows suddenly deprived of all means of support . While the fever prevailed business was suspended , and weeks must elapse before Memphis can depend upon her own resources . Meantime the stricken city must be aided from abroad .

ROSCOE CONKLING , and Hon. HORATIO SEYMOUR , both of whom live in Utica , will consent to become Trustees of whatever funds may be raised in New-York in this way . Now that a beginning has been made in this laudable enterprise , it is necessary for the credit of the State that measures shall be adopted to make it yield a respectable sum . All that is required to that end is that the box shall be provided in each election district , and the matter called to the attention of citizens when they appear to vote . Each locality can name a committee of responsible citizens to take charge of the contributions at the close of the polls , and forward them at once to the distinguished Trustees at Utica . In the City , admirable arrangements have been made by the Police Commissioners to carry out the project . An extra box properly labeled will be placed at the pollingplace in each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , without being unlocked , will be taken by the policeman on duty at the polls to the station-house , and from thence sent immediately to Police Head-quarters by the Captain . When all have been collected they will be opened , and . the contents counted under the supervision of a committee of citizens having the full confidence of the community . . The amount will be transmitted to Memphis as soon as ascertained through Senator CONKLING and Gov . SEYMOUR . By the means adopted , the Memphis sufferers will be receiving the benefit of this charity before the close of the week . All that is now required to make that charity of great service to the recipients , and creditable to the City , is for the matter to be called to the attention of the voters . There . is no limit to the contributions , each citizen being at liberty to deposit what he pleases . There will be few who will not give something , and the aggregate will be a gratifying proof of the benevolence of New-York . Let each citizen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his means to help the distressed . It is one way of making an election servo a beneficent purpose .
