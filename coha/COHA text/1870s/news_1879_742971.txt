txt The castes , nobilities , and thrones of the Old World do not show themselves here except in rare visits , yet there is one sovereign who holds his court everywhere in our America , and who insists upon everywhere establishing his caste . nobility . and throne . Nowhere on earth is fashion so powerful as among us , since here it has no rivals in its exclusiveness and no tribes or classes outside of its sway . In Europe , where fashion has its head-quarters , there are districts and people who have nothing to do with it , es in the mountains of the Tyrol , where the women dress now as their greatgrandmothers did a hundred years ago , and among many of the working and rustic classes who jog on in the old style , without having time or thought or money for the changing mode . With us , and especially among our women , regard for fashion is universal , and our servant-girls , instead of wearing a set dress of their own caste , as in Europe , spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , than do their mistresses , This is a great matter in our American life , and it has much to do with the expense and ambition , the success and the suffering of our families . It is important to look it in the face , and try to see what it amounts to and what can be done with it . It is of no use to make war upon it , or to try to keep wholly clear of it , for it is a fact of civilization , and we can no more get out of it than we can get out of history or society . It has hold of us before we know it , for it is born into us with our blood , and it grows with our breeding , and it speaks and acts in the very measures that we take to resist its power . It is not only a certain dress or manner that we can put on or off at pleasure , but it is a certain atmosphere we breathe , a certain magnetism or electricity that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they imply it , and are formed by it more than they form it , and if they who issue them in Paris or Berlin or Vienna or London should choose to act from their own will or caprice , in defiance of the leaders of society and the dominant taste , their plates would fall as dead upon the elegant world as the Pope 's Syllabus fell dead upon the courts and people of Germany , Italy , and England . As bad as these patterns sometimes are , we make them worse by indiscriminate copying , as in the recent costumes that fitted the form so tightly as to suggest the nude figure , and which never in Europe were worn by modest girls in the street , as they were worn here . To make a good definition is the hardest thing to do , and the best definition does little more than turn the word defined upon its other side . So we may safely say that fashion is style , the style that passes as the best in high life . It is the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always existed , since there always has been such a circle , with its peculiar ways . Yet modern fashion is peculiar on account of the undoubted fact that high life has essentially changed its character , and taken unto itself the new elements of our civilization . The sceptre , the crosier , and the sword no longer make or dominate society , but business , education , genius , and all the democratic and humane forces of the nineteenth century have made their way into the saloons of elegance and tho circles of nobility . Kings and Queens are still made much of , whether on the throne or in exile ; yet , in the nation that has been arbiter of fashion , royalty is done with . and a lawyer , with no family prestige and no military renown , holds high court there , and calls the gentlest blood of Sm . Louts to accept his hospitality . The modern gentleman , in the conventional sense of the term , is not all that be should be , but he is a decided advance upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new ages of monarchical rule , since a certain culture and humanity are always understood now to go with the name . At itsbest , fashion , as EMERSON wisely says , is an attempt to organize beauty of behavior , yet he also allows that while it affects to be honor , it is often in all men 's experience only a ballroom code . Much may be gained by understanding what its essential power is , and by discriminating between its just influence and its usurped sway . It is evident that there is a best way to do things in every sphere , and that , of course , there is a best way for society to do its work and have its pleasure . It is equally clear that society has a continuous and combined life of its own , and that its manners , usages , and tastes must develop or evolve themselves in a certain historical order , whose very changes go with a certain constancy . Now , fashion stands for this social order , and speaks its creed and presents its ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but at heart it likes old things better ; and probably the most earnest sticklers for new modes are most in the interest of the old social caste , and most eager to shut new pretenders out of their charmed circle . In Europe , birth has tried hard to keep fashion in its pay , and it has been willing to vary its methods , not in order to surrender its throne to the new corners , but to bring them to its feet , and to make even the upstart Napoleons sue for the hand of its Princesses and the benediction of its pontiff . Here among ua the same game is going on , and what is called the old blood dies hard , and often makes a desperate fight to keep , by fashionable arts , the chief place for its frequently common- place sons and daughters in the incessant competition with the now wealth and talent , beauty and culture , that are struggling for the mastery . It is wall to recognize seriously the constituent elements in the composition of fashions certain constancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is surely an old root to this plant whose flowers so vary in their color and form and season , and all that is new comes out of ground long tilled under pertinacious owners . The very changes of the modes imply a kind of constancy , as the variations of a piece of music start from a prevailing melody and never fail to return to that old air at last . Undoubtedly , the changes of fashion follow in their seeming caprice a certain necessity , and what comes next depends very much upon what has gone before , as rest follows motion , night follows day , and the eye that shrinks from the glaring sunshine finds comfort in the refreshifig hue of the green fields and silver waters . There may be , and undoubtedly is , something of the trick of trade and the greed of modistes in the fitful changes of costume , but these have their limits , and whatever is against the prevailing taste and sentiment soon finds its limit . That there has been and can be progress in fashion , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and descriptions of manners that come to us from the records of European society since America has been peopled l The Puritans were themselves a protest against the fashion of the mother country , and the court of CHARLES II . was more offensive to them than his Church . There has certainly been a gain in our time in the recognition of the laws of health in the dress of men , and , to a certain extent , in that of women . A pinched waist is no longer regarded as a beauty , and science has put searching questions that fashion has not dared wholly to ignore . Art , too , has come to a certain extent into society , and made its mark on the form and color of costume and the style of entertaining . Humanity is by no means left out in the cold , and a powerful current of fashion sets toward our great charities from the charmed circles in which many of our best women shine . A great deal remains to be done to abate existing evils , to reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high society . Yet high society is not without hopeful elements of progress within itself , and the gentlest life is not wholly a stranger to the gentleness that comes from the supreme love . and which has been inheriting the earth since the Divine Master spoke on the mount . Better do our best to set fashion right than to make war upon it . In that fellowship , as in the Church , there are various schools and tendencies , and , without going out of it , we may choose the best method and strive for the most good . Not iconoclasm , but true art , with science and humanity and faith , must organize beauty of behavior here .
