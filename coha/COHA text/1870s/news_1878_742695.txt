txt Toward ladies riding in the horse ea ' s the courts , of late years , have shown their selves very courteous . In short , upon this subs ct the Law appears to be a gentleman , and speaks as such . A lady has a right to have the car stop for her , and can recover damages if the dri -- er refuses . We can recount a story upon this point from no further away than San Francisco . In that city , about ten years ago , MARY PLEA SANT5 hailed a street car , but the conductor refused to stop . The reason he gave was that she was a colored person , and , said he , " we don 's take colored in this car . " Those were days when their right to ride in the cars was much dispute ; and to test the question the lady brought an action . She recovered a verdict for $500 . The Supreme Court ssdcl. that was too much , but she ought to have fair damages , for the car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io colored people was no excuse . So they order ed the case tried over again , to settle the damages more moderately . As to standing upon the platform , t , lady never does that unless the car is crowded full inside and no one will move for her to en : or it : and then she has a right to stand on the platform , and the company ought to be grateful to her for riding so without complaining . ' T.'herefore , all the decisions of courts that it is negligence for a passenger to stand on the pia lorm , and that he will lose a suit for being hurt on a car , if he stood on the platform when he might have been inside , are unimportant to ! adios . They do not want to stand on the platform . We can cite on this point the dictum of Mr. Dick , when the London landlady assurer him the apartment selected for his use " w is not large enough to swing a cat in . " " You know , Trotwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tying a cat . I never do swing a cat . Therefore , what does that signify ' I " Getting a seat when one has entered a car . is a matter which passengers usually settle : nnong themselves , and their decisions are nc t published ; but what a lady must do about balding by the strap , if no seat is given her , hr 3 been the subject of a grave decision in Pennsylvania , Miss WHIPPLE , with an older lady and a . Child , entered a horse car where there was or ly one seat . The older lady took that , and held the child in her lap , and Mrs. Whipple stood up in deleted 2 lines lision which stopped it short , and Miss ' WHIPPLE was thrown down and her knee fractured . Lawsuit for damages . The company 's lawyer said that she ought to have held by the strap . " I could n't , " she answered , " the strap was too short for me to reach . I could touch it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents her holding the strap , " The Judge told the jury that if he lady could not hold the strap without extraordinary exertion , or damaging or deranging her dress , she was not bound to ; but might do " the next best thing , viz. , to hold by the hands of her friend . " We believe that if this learned jurist had spoken his full mind , he would have declared holding by a lady 's hands a much better thing than holding by a strap ; however , he discreetly left the whole question to the jury . And the full Bench said that he did just right . " He could not have told the jury more than he did . Are we to say , as matter of law , that women are to dress in a certain way , and that their ordinary habits , according to the usages of society , are to be cast aside when they enter a car , for fear they should find no seat I Possibly a woman may be so foolishly hooped , wired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to help herself ; " but the question whether she is so is one of fact for the jury . When the place is reached where the lady wishes to leave the car , she has a right to have it come to a full stop for her , long enough for her to alight . And the rule is she has a right to time and facilities for leaving the car according to the measure of her apparent strength , skill , and ability . As long as the old-fashioned idea prevails that women have not the same strength and agility as men possess , the courts will not allow it that lady psssengers should be bun . died off as men may be ; neither may children , for that matter , or lame or sick persons . Each passenger has a right to a fair opportunity to dismount , according to his individual needs , as far as the conductor can judge of them . If a weak person or a lame on8 is hurt through not having time , it is no answer to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off in that time . " Several cases have gone against the companies where conductors have neglected their duty in this matter . Mrs. COLT 'S case and Mrs. POULIN 'S case ware very much alike . In each of these , a lady passenger in a ' New-York horse car asked the conductor to stop the car , and he did so , and she stepped down , but the hoops of her hoop-skirt caught on a nail in the platform ; the conductor started the car without waiting to see that she was fairly off , and she was hurt by being dragged along the pavement . Mrs. POPLIN was additionally embarrassed by having a child of 2 years in her arms , while Mrs. Cour was 66 years old , and lame , obliging her to walk with a cane . The lawyers for the companies argued that hoop skirts were needless articles , and if ladies chose to wear them , they must run the risks and bear the consequences of their catching . But the courts said no , One of the rights of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . When a passenger desires to get off , and indicates this to the conducto ? at a proper stopping-place , it is his duty to stop the car long enough to allow the passenger to alight ; long enough according to the circumstances , such as the condition of the passenger , and of the street at that place . If sufficient time is not given , and the passenger is injured , the company is responsible . And if hoop-skirts. such as ladies generally wear , require more time and care for alighting , the companies are bound to provide for the safety of passengers so clothed . Mrs. MAvERIcK was injured in an Eighthavenue car through the conductor 's carelessness in stopping . She asked to get out , and he rang the bell to stop . The driver stopped ; but there was a hose-cart running violently up the street behind the car , with no chance for it to turn out . The conductor saw it coming and hurried the lady out , but there was not time for her to alight . The hose-truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car as the lady was crossing the platform , and her hand was crushed . She recovered aamages , for the court said that the conductor was bound to exercise the utmost care and diligence of a very cautious person in stopping the car and allowing her to leave it . But a lady ought to notify the conductor that she wishes to stop . In a Boston case , while the conductor was on the front platform , the lady pulled the bell ; the driver stopped the car ; but while she was stepping down upon the ground , the car suddenly started , and she was thrown down and hurt . The court held that if the lady undertook to stop the car herself , while the conductor was busy on the front platform , the driver could not have any accurate means of knowing when she was fairly off , and he was not in fault if he started a second or so too ' soon .                   @ @
