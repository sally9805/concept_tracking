ART . VIII . - THE SITUATION IN FRANCE . IT might perhaps be not unreasonably imagined that the general similarity of the political influences now at work throughout Europe must be beginning to produce some similarity of results , and that distinct affinities must be becoming perceptible between the political conceptions of different countries . But scarcely anything of the kind has yet happened . The distinctions between the political dispositions of races are still , as a general rule , almost as marked as the differences of language . No two nations hold the same view of their political situation or of their political duties ; no two nations have yet learned to apply the same precepts of guidance to their political working or the same remedies to their political difficulties . Here and there , it is true , the evolutions of the more advanced divisions of Liberalism do offer a certain appearance of international brotherhood ; but the Conservatism of each country remains rigidly and exclusively its own . Each country in Europe has shaped its Conservatism for itself alone ; and each national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone understands what it needs ; each one acts for itself without the slightest reference to the others . The diversity which exists between the many forms of Conservatism which have thus been developed has just been rendered remarkably apparent by the events which have occurred during* the last four months in France . An attempt at " Conservative reaction " was commenced by Marshal MacMahon on the 16th of May : he suddenly turned out a Ministry which was supported by the Chamber ; he dissolved the Chamber because it had supported the Ministry ; and then he changed all the prefects and other functionaries , and publicly took every possible measure to influence the results of the new elections . In England particularly , in the birthplace and home of the highest , most intelligent , and most practical Conservatism of the time , reprobation was expressed with curious unanimity . The English press discussed the policy of Marshal MacMahon with a calmness , fairness , and thoroughness // which bestowed special value on its judgment , and it wound up by the declaration that , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true designation for that policy . In order to clearly understand the considerations which have led English Conservatism to form this judgment , it is essential to remember that English Conservatism has assumed in our day a totally new character . It is therefore in reality , as events have now fashioned it , neither more nor less than an extremely prudent , slow-marching power of Liberalism . Consequently , when English Conservatives proceeded to measure " the Act of the 16th of May , " their first step was to inquire as to the precise object of that act ; their second was to ascertain whether the object was being preserved by Constitutional means . On neither point did they obtain a satisfactory answer . The movement of the 16th May was most certainly Conservative , in the true European sense of the word , in so far as it claimed to be a struggle against Radicalism . And , furthermore , if it could be proved that each nation has really a right to a Conservatism of its own , unlike that of its neighbor , we should then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise that right , and to frame and practise their Conservatism as they may themselves think best , according to what may appear to them to be the necessities of their situation , without any reference to what is thought or done elsewhere . This is forcibly the argument which the French themselves employ towards their foreign critics ; and , at first sight , there does appear to be some value in their reasoning . It seems to be just to urge that , as political tenets are evidently still generated everywhere by local forces , as the levelling impulses of the period have not succeeded thus far in unifying their shape , as their character still continues to be determined , in every land , by a collection of influences resulting from the history and temper of the people , and as those influences differ in every country in Europe , therefore those tenets themselves can not be and ought not to be universally identical . And if there be variety in the tenets , there must , of necessity , be even more variety in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of action almost as easily as in the formation of opinion . So far , and in these general terms , it may be owned that each nation is entitled to entire liberty of political fancy . // But does it not seem that this reasoning can be logically used by Liberals only ? Is there not in the very principle and sentiment of Conservatism , when in its present calmed-down English form , something which rebels against the notion of variety and self-assertion ? Can it not be argued that while modern Liberalism may justly be regarded as a product of accidents of time and place and things , and while , consequently , all Liberals may be thoroughly justified in claiming to form their creeds irrespective of each other , and to select their measures according to the special conditions in which they may personally find themselves placed , Conservatism , on the contrary , is a system which , by its essence and its mode of breathing , ought to rest everywhere on one gen*ral basis of unity and collectiveness , to present everywhere the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local transformations ? Liberalism may be compared to Protestantism , with its indefinite capacity of variation , but Conservatism should , it seems to me , resemble Catholicism , with its identity of universal character . The work that Conservatism has to do is fundamentally alike all over Europe . The ferments which it has to calm and the ambitions which it has to moderate have become identical in nature , though they remain different in power , in all the countries of the Old World . The system of its action should therefore be substantially the same in all lands . If these considerations can be regarded as valid , if Conservatism ought , by its own quality and in its own interest , to join hands all over Europe , it becomes difficult to allow that the French reasoning is sound and that there ought to be as many Conservatives as there are nations . Theoretically there should be only one European Conservatism . However large be the faculties of special action which may be conceded to local necessities , they should be limited to mere forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great outline as an international whole . Conservatism ought to be everywhere fighting the same battle in the same way ; it ought everywhere , without distinction of latitude , to be a system of check to the needlessly rapid development of Liberal aspirations , it ought to be everywhere , in its true sense , in its perfect meaning , a permanent obstacle to that development . But the Conservatism of France is very different from all this . It is a fierce scheme of defence against Liberalism in any form whatever ; it angrily repudiates concessions ; its nature is essentially // combative ; force , not reason , is its preferred weapon ; it rejects all idea of uniformity of interests with other Conservatisms ; it sets up special rules of its own ; it acts for itself . Let us see what are the explanations which it puts forward in support of this attitude . A preliminary observation must , however , be made here . The very first proposition which Frenchmen advance in discussions with foreigners is that the situation of France is so totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strangers are necessarily incapable , from the simple influence of their surroundings , of forming a dispassionate judgment on it . It is asserted that no one but a Frenchman can understand the exact bearings of French questions , and that foreigners inevitably approach them in a condition of ignorance and of mental habit and prejudice which takes away beforehand all value from their criticisms . It is true that when foreigners happen to have praise to offer , they are complimented on their intelligence , their breadth of view , and their capacity for solving French problems ; but if they blame , they are at once reminded that it is not possible for them to know anything whatever of the matters which they presume to examine . It is necessary to begin by recognizing this difficulty and by accepting it as it stands ; no one can change it , the French will never admit that anybody can be right who ventures to suggest that they may be wrong . This attitude of theirs need not , however , stop us . We can discuss their situation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Conservatives assert that the Act of the 16th of May , and the measures in support of it which have been successively adopted , have all been absolutely indispen*able for the safety of the country . It is declared , with earnest conviction , by persons of experience and character , by persons inviting co*ifldence and respect , that " society is in danger " ; and that if the late Chamber of Deputies had been permitted to live on , it would assuredly have voted away , one after . the other , all the props of " moral order , " and have gradually introduced legalized Radicalism as the principle and practice of government . It is affirmed that all sorts of risks are in the air , that another 93 is coming ; that the Radicals are rapidly becoming the masters of France ; and that , as soon as they are so , they will suppress religion , marriage , and the army , will enact that all taxes shall be payable by the rich alone , in proportion to their riches , and // will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . A cry of " Nous serons perdus " is in nearly all the drawing-rooms and in a good any of the newspapers . It must be owned that all this makes up a gloomy picture , and that , if it were true , France would cease , for the moment , to be pleasant to live in . But is it true ? And even if it is true , are the means which have been selected to combat the expected danger such as people who call themselves Conservatives ought to em-ploy ? In seeking to verify the truth of the assertion that " society is in danger , " it is necessary to take account not only of facts , but of apprehensions as well . We see a certain number of facts . We see that out of the five hundred and thirty-three deputies who coinposed the late French Chamber , three hundred and sixty-three were Republicans of various shades ; that the rest were Legitimists , Orleanists , or Bonapartists ; and that the Republicans had , consequently , a majority of about five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-three some forty or fifty weie violent Radicals ; that these Radicals proposed an amnesty for the Commune , and that they brought forward some few other measures of a distinctly " subversive " kind ; but we also see that both the amnesty and the other proposals were contemptuously rejected by the moderate Republicans as well as by the Conservatives . We see that on the 4th *f May the whole Republican party did adopt an order of the day against , " Clericalism , " but we also see that the very same men had previously voted an increase in the Church Budget . We see that the Republicans included in their ranks at least two hundred deputies who in any other assembly in the world would be counted amongst the ardent Conservatives , but who , because they have accepted the Republic , are indiscriminately called Radicals by the French Monarchists . We see that in all the elections which have taken place since 1871 France has manifested a constantly increasing desire to maintain the Republic ; we see that the chances of the various Monarchical parties have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is about all that we can see . But when we turn to apprehensions , the field of contemplation becomes vastly larger . Fear is so feverishly inventive , it takes such small account of facts , that its developments have no fixed // limits . Facts , indeed , are obstacles in its way . So it either thrusts them aside or travesties them in such fashion that they cease to be recognizable . It seems to us that this is precisely what is happening in France , for we have extreme difficulty in keeping facts in view at all when we listen to the apprehensions expressed by French Conservatives , and when we read about apprehensions in French Conservative newspapers . Apprehension has carried them so far that , with all sympathy for them in the terrible position in which they say they stand , we are altogether unable to follow them ; the speed at which they travel beats us . To correctly describe all their misgivings in detail would be to enumerate nearly all the known forms of social disturbance . A large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration , to be living in a state of permanent terror , in a cankering conviction that spoliation , ruin , and national convulsion are hanging over their heads . And in all this they are perfectly sincere ; no one who knows them can doubt that they feel what they say , and that they fully believe it to be true . Now , do the facts justify the apprehensions ? Was the presence of fifty Radicals in the late Chamber a sufficient motive for the fright from which so many of the French are suffering ? Is the prospect of a complete Radical triumph in the future so probable that all this terror must be regarded as natural ? Is the general attitude of the Republican party menacing to " moral order " ? To these questions an impartial foreign on-looker can but answer , No . The peril is not real ; it exists only in imagination . France is in no more danger of a Radical irruption than Germany or England is . The facts point to this conclusion , all the moderate organs of the Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to prove the contrary . Even if we quote no evidence whatever from the Liberal side , even if we neglect all the vigorous and logical denials with which every accusation put forward by the Conservatives has been encumbered by their opponents , we still shall find in the testimony supplied by the Conservatives themselves sufficient proof that they have had no valid motive for their recent action . During the debates which took place in June in the Chamber and the Senate , the Duc de Broglie and several members of his cabinet made speeches explanatory of the Act of the 16th of May , // and of the line of policy which they intended to pursue . We have read those speeches with care , with no preconceived intention , with full willingness to discover in them a demonstration that the Marshal has reason on his side , and , to our regret , we have been unable to unearth any proof whatever of the kind . Those speeches contain a good many general accusations , a good many vague assertions , a good many personal attacks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of varied prophecies about the spread of " subversive ideas " ; but in not one of them is there to be discovered a clear intelligible statement of incontrovertible facts , such as is indispensable - in our eyes at least - to justify the great party movement which has been made and to define its precise objects . The movement was declared by every speaker to be directed against Radicalism , but no speaker was able to inform his hearers where Radicalism was and what it was doing . Indeed , the IDuc de Brogue himself seemed to admit that the Radicalism against which he professes to be contending is not , at present , a tangible force , for , though he spoke of it as a danger so real and so terrible that it necessitated and justified all that has been done since the 16th of May , he admitted , at the same time , that its essential present characteristic is to be " latent . " In substance , he acknowledged that the Act of the 16th of May was directed against fatal contingencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cure immediate evils , but to prevent France from drifting into worse difficulties ; that it was an act of anticipation and prevision , based upon distrust of what might perhaps happen hereafter . Now , in trying to appreciate this attitude , let us remember that , though by its recent political history and by the action of universal suffrage France is a land in which advanced Democratic ideas find numerous supporters , it is equally true that , by the temperament of its rural population , and by the wide distribution of property , the majority of its inhabitants are strongly Conservative in their inclinations . Two conflicting popular tendencies find themselves , therefore , face to face : one of them , by its nature , asserts itself more noisily than the other ; but it by no means follows that greater noise means greater strength , and no error would be more complete than to suppose that , because French Democrats talk habitually more loudly than the Conservatives around them , they // therefore constitute a large party in the nation . The proportion of Radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of Radical Deputies in the Chamber , for the latter represent the former . We have just said that therq were fifty of the latter in the recently dissolved Assembly , or one tenth or one eleventh of the whole ; we may therefore argue , with every prospect of being right , that not more than one tenth of French electors hold Radical doctrines . Nine tenths are on the other side , - they are either moderate Liberals or Conservatives , either moderate Republicans or Monarchists , - and when we allow for the altogether special circumstance that the entire population votes , that any man above the age of twenty-one expresses his preferences at the poll , we can scarcely seriously consider that , in the present excited condition of opinion all over Europe , these proportions are remarkably bad . Here lies the whole question . Are the French Conservatives right in protesting that the tenth , if left unchecked , may one day become a majority , or are we right in asserting that there are no reasons whatever for expecting that the tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge the case we have , at all events , one advantage over the French , - an advantage which even they will not dispute , - we are not influenced by fear . We are keenly interested in the matter , but we have no fright about it , partly because it does not affect us personally , partly because we are convinced that there is no cause for fright . The situation is composed , as we have already said , of a mixture of facts and apprehensions ; there can be no dispute about the facts , for everybody can see them , and they have just been enumerated over again with precision and authority in the address to his electors which M. Thiers drew up before his death , and which was published here on the 24th instant ; the divergence is limited to the apprehensions on which , as we view the matter , the whole case of the French Conservatives is based . Our opinion is that the apprehensions are wildly exaggerated , and that , consequently , the case virtually collapses . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democratic claims ; but the Conservatives of all other countries have to do the same , and we can detect nothing sufficiently grave in the position of the French as a // 537 whole to entitle them to assert , as they do , that they are specially and particularly menaced by dangers which are proper to their own land alone . They have to contend against the same appetites , the same envies , and the same hates as we see at work everywhere else . We recognize that they are exceptionally powerful in France , - it is quite natural that they should be so , after all that has happened there ; but we recognize , at the same time , that France is in an equally exceptional position for struggling successfully against them , by ordinary means and without employing violence , for the good reason that the larger part of her population possesses property of some kind , and would therefore suffer in money by the adoption of revolutionary measures . The personal pocketinterest of the majority is a weapon of defence against Radicalism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It suffices by itself to protect the nation from all real danger , and it may be trusted to do its work completely . We therefore take the view that the attitude of the French Conservatives since the 16th of May has not been justified by either present facts or future prospects ; that it has been a purposeless outbreak ; and that under such conditions it can not be considered as a true product of Conservatism . But if its motive cause was not Conservatism , what was it ? Since 1871 the members of the various Monarchical parties have preserved the hope either that France would voluntarily reestablish a throne , or that , if it silently accepted a Republic , the Republicans would commit excesses which would drive the nation back to a sovereign . But it has grown gradually obvious that , according to the seeming probabilities of the situation , neither one nor the other of these eventualities is likely to be realized , at all events for the present . On the contrary , it has been becoming more and more evident , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even without a wish for change , by a majority of the people , but also that the Republican leaders fully perceive the risks of rough processes , and have taught themselves enough patience and enough self-control to be able to govern moderately and constitutionally . The Monarchists have therefore been obliged to recognize that their prospects are getting dull ; that the nation is slipping further and further from them ; and that their opponents are too prudent to supply , by their // own misconduct , arguments against themselves . It is then altogether natural that , under such circumstances , the Monarchists should incline to make an immediate effort to rouse the country in their favor and to profit by the Act of the 16th of May , in order to try to bring about an anti-Republican revulsion . But , true as this may be within certain limits , we are unable to attribute either to the Marshal or to the Duc de Broglie any original intention of utilizing the movement , if it happened to succeed , in order to bring about a Restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming elections would instantly break up the so-called " Conservative Union " into hostile sections ; that the new majority would be destroyed by its own dissensions the instant it was created ; and that no majority at all would remain available for the choice of a sovereign . It is difficult enough as it is - we see that each day  --  to hold together the discordant elements of the *cUnion** ; even the urgent necessities of the common struggle against the Left are insufficient to prevent its members from quarrelling amongst themselves . What then would be their attitude towank each other after a success ? No , - Monarchy may perhaps be re-established in France by force , it may perhaps be hatched hereafter out of new circumstances which no one canfore see to-day ; but , assuredly , the 16th of May has no power of engendering it , and was not intended to engender it , even if there were but one pretender , or even if the elections were to produce a majority composed exclusively of the adherents of one party , even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it would have to obtain the approval of the Senate in favor of its candidate to the throne . But as there are two pretenders , and a Constitutional group besides , representing the defunct Orleanists ; as the majority would necessarily be composed , in varying proportions , of supporters of each of the three ambitions ; and as , finally , it is eminently unlikely that the Conservatives will obtain a majority at all , - it can not reasonably he anticipated that the new Chamber will be able to vote away the Republic . Even if the Monarchical theory were a pure abstract idea in France , without any preference for a dynasty , a name , a flag , a press , a person , or a principle , even then it is most improbable , in the present state of opinion , that the united advocates of the idea would be able to upset the // Republic . But to suppose that any one of the temporarily associated though inherently hostile components of the " Conservative Union " can carry its claimant to power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monarchical parties and of the Republicans as well , is to imagine more than the frequent realization in France of the improbable and the difficult justifies us in conceiving . Under such conditions as these it can not be seriously urged that the Marshal , when he took his first step in the matter , indulged the dream of placing a crown on the head of either Henry V. or Napoleon IV . Other people have , perhaps , formed hopes of that sort since , but the Marshal and his ministers can not be supposed to have been foolish enough to look forward to such an impossibility . Our belief is that , so far as its original objects and intentions were concerned , the Act of the 16th May was no more Monarchical than it was Conservative . We conceive it to have been simply an outbreak of unreasoned duty on the part of the Marshal . Consequently , as we view the question , the movement of the 16th May was , in its origin , nothing more than a personal outburst against an imaginary danger ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extract the most they can out of it for themselves , we see no reason for accusing the Marshal of having wished to serve their purposes , or to destroy the Republic over which he presides . But directly we turn our eyes from the supposed intention of the Marshal to the means which he has allowed to be employed for carrying out those intentions , the whole question changes its aspect , for nothing can be more regrettable and more blamable , as regards 1 ) 0th policy and honesty , than the acts of the ministers to whom the Marshal has confided the direction of his attack against Radicalism . Instead of acting on the doctrine which is now accepted everywhere outside France , that public discussion constitutes the surest , the safest , and the most effective obstacle that can be thrown in the way of political follies , and that it supplies the natural form of appeal from the exaggerations of a minority to the common-sense of the people at large , these ministers have endeavored to stop discussion and to put force into its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // 540 The Situation in France . France , that though discussion may suffice in other lands , it affords no protection whatever here ; the reason being , according to them , that neither universal suffrage nor French character is amenable to reason . They insist that French electors must be " guided " to the poll , that they must be told how to vote , and that all the forms of administrative pressure must be utilized in order to induce them to follow the advice which is offered to them by the government . This was the system employed by Napoleon III . This is the system which the Ministry of the 16th May is applying , with far more violence than ever the Empire dared to use , and which , worse than all , it is applying for the exclusive benefit of Royalist and Imperialist candidates . Even if the system of governmental pressure on electors were directed solely against Radicalism , even if it were utilized in favor of moderate Republican candidates only , it would even then be an indefensible and unconstitutional abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous when it is employed by the government of a Republic against Republicans and in favor of Monarchical candidates alone . Yet that is what the government of Marshal MacMahon is doing at this moment . After publicly protesting that its whole efforts were to be set going against Radicalism , it is now concentrating them with the bitterest animosity against the election of Republican deputies of any kind whatever . The result is , that though we are convinced the Marshal really intended at first to maintain the Republic , and that he fully recognized the hopelessness of any attempt at Monarchical restoration by parliamentary means , he stands now before the world as the supporter of an electoral policy of which the declared object is to prevent Republicans from being elected . And really , according to our view of the whole affair , it is quite natural , and even inevitable , that he should have arrived at this strange position . He began by an undefined onslaught against an enemy which his own ministers declared to be almost invisible and intangible , but he has been led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a defined attack against a totally different foe . In order to make war on Radicalism , he called the Conservatives to his aid ; but , as the Conservatives are all Monarchists , they only joined him on condition of trying to utilize the opportunity for upsetting the Republic . And as French Conserva // tism is in reality absolutism ; as it is made up of retrograde class prejudices ; as it is a remnant of the old spirit of the noblesse , which hates innovation ; as it can not bring itself to accept controversy or publicity ; as , in its eyes , publicity means a still further spreading of " detestable ideas , " - it of course proclaims that the only way to deal with its opponents is to silence them by force . In its terror of revolution from below , it shouts out for revolution from above , and it has done so this time in a fashion which has exposed Marshal MacMahon to the accusation of seeking to destroy the Republic of which he is the President . Now it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France itself , of the effects of the use of force in questions of this kind . During the Second Empire , which was certainly a government of force , we heard constantly of the growth of Socialism in France ; we were told that the desire of seizing the properties of the rich for division amongst the poor was becoming general there , and that if it were not compressed with energy it would burst out destructively . Well , the Empire has disappeared , and , wonderful to relate , Socialism has disappeared with it ! No more Socialism is to be found in France . It could not support the examination which free institutions turned upon it , so it vanished . It may be answered of course by French Conservatives that its place has been taken by Radicalism , and that France has gained nothing by the change . But that reply does not affect the fact that directly force ceased to be the principle of government , directly discussion became possible , the particular form of danger presented by Socialism at once died out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if its natural disposition were to place itself in opposition to governments of force , wherever it can find them . Now surely it may be argued that if the admission of free discussion has thus already choked Socialism , it would in all probability produce in time an analogous effect on the other political extravagances which ardent imaginations may successively invent . Surely there ought to be an encouraging symptom for French Conservatives in the melting away of Socialism ; surely there ought to be in this experience an evidence of the corroding action which is exercised on all utopias by simply turning strong illumination on them . Like other speculative exaggerations , the follies of Radicalism thrive best when they are left unexamined ; light is // always dangerous to them , and is not unfrequently fataL But the use of light as a defensive arm necessarily implies confidence and courage in those who employ it ; it indicates entire trust in their own position , their own strength , their own capacity ; tremblers shrink from it lest it should do more harm to themselves than to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt light as their weapon ; they are all faint-hearted ; they show us distinctly by their acts that they have no faith either in themselves or in their cause or in the true armory of Conservatism . They have always cried out for the aid of force , and they are doing it again now . This time , indeed , they are surpassing the arbitrariness of the Second Empire . The whole administration of the country ( and we know what an all-absorbing , all - controlling maclime the French administration is ) has been converted into an electoral agency . The French newspapers are full each day of new tales of violent action on the part of niinisters , prefects , and their subordinates , and of government inventions for influencing the choice of the voters . It is the imperial system applied again , but without its purpose . And if Napoleon III. , with his name , his prestige , and his power , was unable to maintain a government by force , is it to be expected that the present temporary organization , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France has become a laboratory in which new experiments are tried , but it is not just to apply to her a second time a series of old experiments , which have failed already . The system of compression produced Sedan , and was followed by the Commune . What can France expect gain by setting it to work aouin 2 to b That system sets the example of contempt for the very , rules whose observance constitutes the essence of true Conservatism , and yet it claims to be Conservative ! This strange contradiction makes us wonder if really there are any Conservatives in France at all . There are Tories in abundance , hut where are the Conservatives ? There is no reason whatever why they should not be found in France , as they are elsewhere , for Conservatism is , by its nature , as universal as , by its uses , it is universally necessary . Modern government could no more proceed in safety without it than a ship could navigate without a rudder , or a coach go down a hill without a drag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rudder or a drag , and a " revolution from above , * is clearly not one of them . Is it , perchance , because real Conservatism is understood or practised by no one in France , because it acts there as a handcuff , and not as a rudder or a drag , that France has never yet been able to establish a well-balanced and durable government ? One is tempted to think so , and to attribute the constantly recurring political difficulties of the French to the insufficiencies of their Conservatism , even more than to the extravagances of their IRadicalism . Before this article is published the results of the elections will be known . But whatever be these results , they will provide no solution of the difficulties of the position . If the Conservatives obtain a majority , they will drag the country into new dynastic quarrels . If the Liberals retain their ascendency , they will assuredly employ it , not only to consolidate the IRepublic , but also to tie the hands of the Conservatives for the future . In both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of the damage done to France and to liberty will rest on the heads of the men who originated the folly of the 16th of May .
