txt The situation remains unchanged so far as the main differences between the two houses on the appropriation bills are concerned . An agreement was reached to-day on the Fortification , Deficiency , Sundry Civil , and Post Office hills , and they have been finally acted upon and will be laid before the President to-mouthy morning . The Fortification bill was passed before the Christmas holidays , and the differences , which were trifling , might have been reconciled at any time within the past two months , had the conferees held a meeting . The Senate receded from the amendments made to this bill . Mutual concessions were made in regard to the Sundry Civil bill , a majority of the Senate amendments being retained . The provision in reference to the national surveys of the Territories was retained as passed by the House , except that the Senate added a clause making an appropriation for the publication of the results of the surveys . These sections of the bill simply provide for the completion of the surveys now in progress . There was a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonded debt of the District of Columbia and the establishment of a sinking fund , and this struggle was transferred to the House when the conferees made their report . Mr. Blackburn , Chairman of Om District Committee , charged that the effect of the Senate amendment would be to require the United States ultimately to pay one-half or the bonded debt of the District , amounting to $22,000,000 , $8,000,000 of which , in the form of 3.65 bonds , were issued without authority and in defiance of law . , Mr. Hewitt said that by the law authorizing the issue of 3.65 bonds , the Government guaranteed the payment ' of the interest and the same law required the establishment . of a sinking fund for the payment of the principal upon maturity . He quoted from a speech made in the House by Mr. Blackburn last session , in which that gentleman advocated a provision similar to the one now proposed , and concluded by saying that he would never cast a vote which would call in question the plighted faith of the Government . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . The sinking fund provided for is to be established by setting apart annually a certain proportion of the receipts from District taxes . When the report on the Sundry Civil bill was read iu the Senate this evening Mr. Edmunds took exceptions to a provision " added by the Conference Committee giving the Secretary ofWar authority to turn over the water power at Rock Island to the Moline Water Power Company , which claimed a partial title thereto , upon their assurance that water power should be furnished the arsenal at that place . Mr. Edmunds claimed that the conference had exceeded its authority in adding this new legislation . He claimed it would give away all the Government rights without conditions , and he would rather See the bill fail than that the Senate should consent to ' this wrong . He said the arsenal had cost $7,000 , - 000 , and it was now proposed to give the power it had created to a private corporation for its own use in violation of law . There was , he said ; no hour in a session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting a scheme of this kind . This attack provoked a spirited debate , during which it was strongly intimated that certain persons were seeking to break down all United States arsenals in order to further the interest of private manufacturing companies . Senators Windom and Allison defended the report , and it was finally adopted . The only serious point of difference in regard to the Deficiency bill was on the Senate item , appropriating $250,000 for the courts , of which sum $125,000 was to defray the expenses of the current year for Supervisors and Deputy Marshals . This amount was reduced to $50,000 by the Conference Committee . The Democrats claim that this is a victory for them , as no money is provided for the payment of Deputy Marshals . The dispute over the Post Office bill was settled by the Senate receding from the Brazilian subsidy amendment , and some alterations being made in the sections providing for the classification of mail matter . Before the recess this afternoon , the House rook up the conference report on the River and Harbor bill , and concurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Executive and Judicial , and Army bills are now the only regular appropriation measures unfinished , and at this hour , ( 10 o'clock , ) the prospects for their final passage are no better than they were last night . The great difficulty in the way of an agreement upon these bills is the political legislation inserted by the House . It is known that all other points of difference can be readily harmonized . The Republicans are willing to agree to the repeal of the Jurors ' test oath , but ' will not consent to the repeal of the Federal Election laws . Both of these provisions are contained in the Legislative bill . The reorganization sections of the Army bill have been practically disposed of by the conference committee , and in lieu of those sections a paragraph has been agreed upon , providing that no promotions shall take place until the Army has been reorganized . A conference committee can not , however , dispose of a part of a bill in dispute , and should they fail to . harmonize all the differences their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army bill are contained in the two following paragraphs , inserted by the House : " No military or naval officer , or any person engaged in tne.civIl , military , or naval service of the United States , shall order , bring , keep , or have under his authority or control any troops or armed men at the place where any general or special election is held , in any State unless it be necessary to repel the armed enemies of the United States . " Every officer of the Army or Navy , or other person in the civil . military , or naval service of the United States , who orders , brings , keeps , or has under his authority or control any troops or armed men at any place where a general or-special election is held in any State , unless such force be necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States , shallbe fined not more than $5,000 and suffer ' imprisonment at hard labor not  --  ess than three months nor more than five years . " The Democrats seem determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their programme appears to , be to hold the Army bill back until the Republicans yield that point on the Legislative bill . This is now the real and only ground of contest . Neither side cares much , about the test oath clause , and the Democrats , it is believed , would yield that and the two disputed sections in the Army bill to secure the repeal of the Election laws . Upon the latter point they are determined , and unless the Republicans yield they say both bills . must fail . Before this political legislation was formulated by the House many Democratic Senators openly expressed their disapprobation of the method adopted to secure the repeal of the laws in question , and indicated a purpose to oppose it in the Senate . Senator Bayard was notably outspoken in this respect , but thus far he has given no indication that he will not follow his party friends in the House . Indeed , all - the indications now are that the Democratic Senators are determined to follow the House and insist upon the passage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Revised Statutes , MARCH ** o'clock A. ' M. ? The Conference Committees on the Legislative and Army bills held sessions last evening . which continued until midnight , and at that hour agreed to report to their respective houses that they could not agree . It seems that ' no progress whatever has been made indicating that the differences can be satisfactorily arranged . The Democrats insist upon retaining all the obnoxious features of both bills , ' and annear4t. to - be . even more unyield-. ing to-night than at airy previous time . No ground of compromise seems to be left to the Republicans , as the Democrats insist that they will consider no preposition having for its object the modification of the clause in the Legislative bill repealing the Electionslaw , and the clause in the Army bill forbidding the presence of troops at the polls . ? All the other differences in these two bills have been arranged , and , in anticipation of their final passage , both bills , except the paragraphs in dispute , have already been engrossed . The Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in which to arrange the difficulties , are striving to intimidate the Republicans into yielding all the disputed points , and that there is a possibility that they will meet the Republicans in an effort to compromise some time ' tomorrow morning . It must be admitted . however , that there is no tangible evidence that this belief Els well founded . The sentiment among Democratic Senators and members is decidedly against yielding the Election law clause , and their conversation indicates that , should their conferees yield on this point , they would resist the report in the House and filibuster until noon to-morrow in order to defeat the ' Legislative bill . Two 0 ' Clock A. M. ? Mr. Hewitt has just reported to the House the disagreement of the Conference Committee on the Army bill . He explained that the committee could have agreed upon the reorganization sections and all other points of difference except that forbidding the presence of troops at the polls . Mr. Hewitt made a long speech , explaining and defending the attitude of the House conferees in refusing to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All he had in the world was invested in his business , which would suffer by an extra session . The businessinterests of the country would suffer by an extra session ; but there was something more valuable than money , and that was the rights and liberties of the people . He believed that if the Army was ever again used to control Can election , there would be an end to republican institutions , and believing this , the conferees on the part of the House had refused to yield . He closed by expressing the hope that the Democrats would unanimously sustain the conferees , and was loudly applauded on the Democratic side . Mr. Foster followed . Ho said the Democrats informed them that they would agree upon nothing . He Foster had proposed , being a member of both conferences , that if the Democrats would yield on the Election laws the Republican ? would yield on all other points . Had that proposition . been accepted there would have been an agreement upon both bills . The only propositions looking to a compromise came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain no offers whatever looking to an agreement . He reminded the Democrats that they would have control of both Houses next year , and could pass these bills in such form as they pleased . No elections would occur during the period covered by the pending bill except in California , and they were ready to put a clause in the bill excepting California from the fancied danger of being , overrun by the Army upon the day of election . In view of the e facts he thought it unwise for the Democrats to insist upon their amendments at the imminent risk of an extra session . Mr. Garfield said that during the 13 years these laws have been on the statute-books no man has been prevented from fully and freely exercising his rights by military interference . If a single case could be cited where such interference had taken place , he would join in asking for their repeal . He was willing to abandon the army and jury clauses , which are in dispute , but would not consent to the repeal of the Election laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , addressed the House . During his remarks he was greeted with cries of , " Louder " from the Democratic side , and cat-calls from the Republicans . He was followed by Mr. Southard , who said the extra session , which would follow the resistance of these amendments by the Republicans , would not cost as much as would be required to pay Supervisors and Marshals , The motion of Mr. Hewitt , that the House insist upon its ' disaeTeement in the Senate amendments without further conference , was adopted , which practically amounts to the House saying it will not recede . At 2 o'clock Senator Windom announced in the Senate the disagreement of the Conference Committee on the Legislative bill , and stated the points of difference to bo solely upon the political legislation . He said the Democrats insisted that all the obnoxious legislation proposed by the House should be enacted , and peremptorily refused even to discuss the points of difference unless this surrender . swiss made . This the Senate conferees did not feel authorized to do without directions from the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no difference of opinion . Senator Blaine submitted an almost identical report in reference to the Army bill . These reports gave rise to a debate , during which Mr. Beck said that his party would , not yield a point . Senator Conkling took Mr. Beck 's remarks as a text and administered a scathing rebuke to the Democrats . He showed that on Dec. 20. 1878 , the Republican Senate repealed the jurors ' ? test oath and that ' a Democratic House failed to act upon it , and now made it a basis for forcing an extra session . Senator Thurman followed in reply to Mr. Conkling . The debate promises to last several hours . Half Past Three o'clock A. ** debate in both houses on the disagreeing reports of the Conference Committees indicates that neither side will surrender , and that the Army and Legislative bills will fail . Both houses seem to have eettled dewn in the determination to ? kill time till the hour for adjourning sine die . Mr. Thurman is now addressing the Senate , and the roll is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Springer , to go on with the Seward impeachment.
