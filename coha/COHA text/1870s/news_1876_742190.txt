txt We believe that there are few people who have not discovered that there is a peculiar charm in getting something for nothing . The sentiment may be an ungracious one , but we think this is one of the main advantages of a gift . A very slight article which has been given us is in some way , to our eyes , more important ? than a much greater one that has been purchased . The conventional and decent notion is that the value of a slight gift is because of our affection for the giver . This is so in sonic cases , no doubt ; but still the peculiar fascination of a gift consists in not having paid for it . If we strike a good bargain , or if a largo sum comes to us by way of recompense , we are pleased , of course ; but ally possession so gained has a value very much more prosaic than the trinket which we get of a Christmas or on a birthday . The fact that a gift is usually a luxury also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally of the opinion of the young man who preferred . the luxuries to the comforts of life . A gift should often be something which we want , but which it would be either extravagant or frivolous for us to buy . There are quantities of pretty things which a man , or even a woman , would hesitate to buy for themselves , but which when once given them they can use with a perfectly good conscience . We know that the rude remark that " gift is something which we do n't want , to be paid for by something which we ca n't afford , " is not without some truth . There are perfunctory gifts which must be made . But whether gifts are to be a source of pleasure depends altogether upon the persons who make and receive them . There are certain classes of persons who are naturally givers or receivers . To the latter class belong pre-eminently children . A grown person may or may not be pleased with a gift , but anything given is nearly sure to produce a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gifts vary in their success like the experiments of chemical lecturers . The experiment may fail with a grown person , owing to the condition of the atmosphere and the intractable nature of the material ; but it never fails with a child . The old find out that the mind can not be controlled by the will  --  that it is easier to make money than to be happy . But delight in the mind of a child , and the keenest delight , may be produced by means of a gift as surely as one may make bread with flour or candy with sugar . Thus , in the ranks of children we find a vast quantity of soul as plastic to the hand as the simplest conditions of matter . Among grown persons the devisers of gifts no doubt get the most pleasure from them . A person who piques himself upon the possession of some taste and some discernment  --  for character can got a great deal of amusement out of the business of contriving gifts . He has an instinct which tells him when the gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to keep his own counsels , or at any rate will only communicate his thought to some sympathetic friend from a true artist 's wish to have it applauded . There are others who delight in consultations , who , on the cold and crisp afternoons preceding the holidays , may be seen in groups of twos and threes running in and out the shops of Broadway and Union square . It is these persons who give to the streets , at this time of the year , their charming aspect ; the bright days and the gay air of the town and the thronged sidewalk incite the looker-on to the pretty business of present-buying . Gift-seekers , it may be added , have one fault to find with the shops , or perhaps with the public taste to which the shops are compelled to cater . The things offered run so entirely to new modes . The things which are not upon every side are not to be found at all . It never rains but it pours . A few years ago a brass , plated , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a very short while there was scarcely an umbrella to be found in New-York without this contrivance . When satin scarfs are in style , it is very hard to find silk , and when silk ones are in style , it is hard to find satin . The same is true of colors . The jewelry to be found is only of the latest . The consequence is that the wares in the shops are much too modish . The modish is apt to be ugly . Things must , of course , bo of some style or other , but the prettiest things are not extreme , are well within the limits of the styles they belong to . When the public taste has altered in this respect the buyers of gifts will have a wider variety of objects to select from , there will be more opportunity for the discovery of those gifts which are " exactly right , " and the receivers of them will have things which they will like better and longer .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
