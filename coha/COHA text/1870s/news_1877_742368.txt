txt As a striking illustration of the confused condition of mind which is responsible for the Cincinnati movement against resumption , we ask the attention of our readers to the following resolution . It is the one which gave rise to the discussion in the local Chamber of Commerce , and was proposed by Mr. RienAun SMITH , the editor of the Oazetle : Raolred , That while the Government should keep the resumption of specie payments steadily in view , and take no steps backward in that connection , the Resumption act , which it is proposed to enforce on the lot of January , 1579 , being an impracticable measure , and serving only the purposes of a measure calculated to depress the industrial interests of the people , it ought to be modified so as to provide for gradual and practical resumption , to the end that the convertibility of paper into coin may be secured without unnecessary hardship to the agricultural , mer ? motile , and manufacturing interests of the country . The exquisite absurdity of this statement of doctrine is in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resumption of specie payments steadily ill view , " while deliberately turning its back on the one measure yet placed in the statute book for attaining resumption . He would have the Government take no steps backward from that end , while he asks it to dismiss the attainment of the end to the limbo of indefinite postponement . Finally , he sets up as the goal for Congressional action the securing of " convertibility into coin without unnecessary hardship to the agricultural , mercantile , and manufacturing interests of the country . " Exactly what is meant by this we do not know , and we do not believe that any one can tell us . As a matter of fact , it is our conviction that resumption at the time it has been promised would not only produce no unnecessary hardship to the interests of the country , but that it is a necessary step to the progress of those interests . If Ivo can not take the steps required for resumption when the discount on paper is less than five per cent. , and when money is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not well see when it can be done . It is evident that there must be some hardship attending the completion of the task . Wo know of no absolutely gratuitous method of paying debts ; the obligations of a nation can not , any more than those of an individual , be paid unconsciously , and the consciousness which goes with the process is , of coarse , one of hardship . The only question is what is " unnecessary hardship " 7 When tho country has seen the discount on its paper wiped out , until a dollar note has advanced from a gold value of 35 cents to a gold value of over 95 cents , who shall say that the hardship necessary to bring the notes to par is unnecessary ? If wo are to wait instil every one who believes that inflation will make the paying of debts an easy thing is ready to consent to resumption , we shall have to wait indefinitely . Mr. SMITH , we are happy to believe , does not belong to this class of imbeciles . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumption according to law will produce unnecessary hardship except in the grumblings and ravings of this class . The resolution , which was finally adopted by the Cinncinnati Chamber , was accompanied by the following preamble , which is more definite , although scarcely more sound , than Mr. SMITH 'S vagaries : whercag , The effect of the Resumption act is , in the opinion of this Chamber , working unnecessary hardship to the industrial and financial interests of the country , creating apprehensions of depression and disaster ; and , believing that the Government can make no adequate preparation for the resumption and maintenance of specie payment at so early a date as fixed by said act , and that with silver remonetized , the public debt properly funded , and the exercise of a rigid public and private economy ; we may safely await the time when natural causes and healthful conditions shall indicate a date when resumption should lie enforced by law . This reduces the views of the opponents of resumption to some tolerably distinct propositions : 1 . That the approach of the date fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of no evidence in support of this statement . That there is apprehension to a greater or less extent in the minds of the business public is true , but in the case of capitalists , whose unwillingness to make ventures is. the only kind of apprehension that can affect the future , it does not rest on any view of the Resumption act . On the contrary , the burden of their opinion is strongly in favor of resumption at the time pledged , and against evasion or repudiation of the pledge . That the Government can not resume in 1879 . This depends on whether the Government wishes in earnest to do so . Nothing is required but a restoration of the funding privilege to the note-holders , and the legal-tender notes will go to par before the close of next year and remain there. , 3 . The opponents of resumption favor the remonetization of silver . That was to be expected . They are twin forms of the same hallucination . 4 . The Cincinnati movement is in the direction of indefinite postponement . It proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural causes and healthful conditions . " This is the essence of Micawberism . We are to wait to Re ep our promises until " something turns up " to make it possible to pay our debts without trouble , and discharge our pledges by a sort of involuntary act . It is the " growing-up " theory which has prevailed so widely in the West , according to which the debt of the country will , if we only give it time enough , pay itself . In all these propositions there is nothing but mischief . The act of 1875 was not in all regards what we should have desired . It did not include as peremptory measures of preparation As it ought to have contained . alit the one thing of unquestioned value which it did contain was the provision fixing the date for resumption . That provision on the statute book is the only ray of light on the situation , otherwise so gloomy , of the business affairs of our country . To blot it out would be to invite incalculable confusion , prolonged depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
