txt Among various other official connnerulations printed with a , late work on practice in the District Courts , wo find the following : " The position of Justice in one of these Courts is , I assure you , no sin ecure , and any work that tends to simplify their duties is a benefit to them , and consequently to the public , as it promotes the speedy administration , of justice , which is the great aim , in. the formation of these Courts . " The italics are ours , and the officer who bears this shining testimony to the excellent purpose of these tribunals , and to the fidelity and arduousness of his own official labors , is Justice JOSEPH MCGUIRE , of the Seventh District Court . This declaration was made in June last year . Since then his notions on the subject appear to have changed a little , or the work he praises has had less than the anticipated benefit . At least so we infer from a communication printed in our issue of Saturday , from one who signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of his brought before this same Justice ; after being postponed by successive adjournments , duo in some instances to the absence of the dedefendant , in others to the absence of the Justice , was finally abandoned in despair , when the ' hard-working Justice informed him that his " case being thirteen on the calendar he could n't possibly reach it today . " And this exacting correspondent has the temerity to think that this is anything but the " speedy administration of justice , " and that When a case " has been on the calendar for five weeks it should be nearer the head than thirteen . " And not a few thoughtless and ignorant people will be disposed to agree with him , because they do not know how very hard some of these Justices have to work for their miserable pittance of nearly $10,000 a year , and . that it is only by conscientiously reposing about five days in the week they can manage to sit for two or three hours on the c. , her two . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor do le doubt that among his colleagues there may be conscientious and hard-working officers . It was simply impossible even for Tammany to get bad rnen always . But we think Justice will agree with us that the aim of his Court is not fulfilled when a twopenny case which ought to be settled in five minutes is suffered to drag on for as many weeks , and then again postponed because it is number thirteen on the calendar . If Justice had to sit till midnight every day in the week instead of from 9 to 3 , let us say on four or five days of the week , he ought not to have such a reproach brought against his tribunal . He is paid expressly not to have such things happen , and . paid extremely well  --  as well as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States . The aim of the formation of the tribunal over which he presides is just what he says it is  --  the speedy administration of justice . The District Courts are intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheaper , mode of redress than is obtainable in the higher Courts . But when a man is made to lose days and days of valuable time , besides the accumulation of costs and . fees , by repeated vexatious adjournments on every frivolous pretext , these tribunals , meant for the assistance of the poor , become converted into instruments for their impoverishment and oppression . It is quite possible that our correspondent has overstated his own case in this particular instance , and even admitting his correctness , it is not incredible that he himself or his attorney , - and not the Justice or the system , may be to blame . But that the evil here complained of does exist ; that cases in these Courts , by the negligence of the Justice or the trickery of attorneys , are constantly and needlessly protracted to a wearisome degree ; and that in many respects the Courts fail to meet the object of their creation , are notorious facts which every lawyer who has had experience in them will vouch for . It would be well if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfort and welfare of the poorer class of the community , were held to a stricter accountability . If it can be said that few of them degrade , still fewer , we fear , magnify their high office , and the best of them will bear a little watching .
