txt It has latterly become the fashion to sneer at the " arm-chair geographer " and his theories of African geography . In the popular mind he figures as a selfish and unprincipled fellow , who robs the hungry , homeless , orphaned African traveler of his facts , and perverts them to his personal and corrupt purposes . Why a geographer who uses an arm-chair should be more obtrusively wicked than one who sits in a straightbacked chair , or on a three-legged stool , is not very obvious ; but it is probable that the arm-chair is meant to be a symbol of luxury , used as such to emphasize the contrast between the poor but honest traveler , and the rich and vicious geographer . Now , the truth is that the geographer who does not go to Africa is often much better able to interpret the discoveries made by travelers than are the latter themselves . There is nothing which so thoroughly prejudices a man as his personal discovery of a new African lake or river . He instantly devotes the remainder of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or river is the only trite source of the Nile , and he loses the power of perceiving the force of any facts which make against his theory . Occasionally , it is true , we find an explorer like BAKER , who can reason as clearly concerning African geography as though he had never seen the Nile ; but , as a rule , the curious incapacity to read the meaning of his own discoveries , which so eminently characterized the boldest and most indomitable of all explorers  --  Dr. LivINGSION  --  is found to a greater or less degree in most other African travelers . It was Sir RODERICK MURCIIISON who , from his arm-chair , first described , and with surprising accuracy , the topographical conformation of Central Africa . It was PETERMANN , another arm-chair geographer , who demonstrated that LIVINGSTON was wrong in his belief as to the identity of the Lualaba and the Nile ; and it was another arm-chair theorist who , long before the English explorers had found the mouth of the Niger , asserted that the river would be found to empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , the first of all arm-chair geographers , and the one who really deserves to be heartily abused , is just at present particularly popular . When HERODOTCS , that prince of newspaper correspondents , born out of time , and compelled to waste his piquant gossip in the service of history instead of the columns of a Halicarnassian journal , was in Egypt , he met a practical joker in the person of the Register of Minerva 's treasury , who tried to impose on the garrulous old gentleman by telling him au absurd story as to the source of the Nile . He said that it rose between two mountains near Syene , and that half of its waters flowed north and the other half south . Undoubtedly lie merely intended to construct a lie which Ilettopores would reproduce in his forthcoming volume of Egyptian travels , and thereby expose himself to the ridicule of Egyptian critics . But the reckless Register builded better than he knew . His story , which HEramfres not only regarded as essentially incredible , but which he disproved by a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heltonorrs was ifs author , and has survived to this day to muddle and confound the counsels of travelers and geographers . That unhappy Register actually slew DAVID LIVINGSTUN . Had the latter , when STANLEY left him , pursued , as he should have done , his explorations north-west of Tanganyika , he might have been yet alive . lie preferred to return  --  to the deadly marshes of Lake Bangweolo , where there was not the least reasop fir further explorations , merely because lie hoped to find somewhere between the lake and the west coast the mythical fountains of the mendacious Register . And now , although STANLEY has found the true source of the Nile in the River Shimeeyu , and has shown that the latter stream rises far to the south-west of the two mountains Kiliznanitiaro awl Kenia , it has suddenly become fashionable to insist that these two mountains are the ones mentioned by the Register of Minerva , and that his veracity is now established beyond contradiction . To point out that the Shimeeyn does not receive the drainage of Kilimandjaro and Xenia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of STANLEY 'S careful explorations , to enter the Victoria Lake , and that the melted snows of the mountains flood rivers that empty into the Indian Ocean ? . all of which facts have been abundantly proved  --  does not in the least shako the faith of the believers in the first arm-chair geographer . And the most extraordinary feature of this popular delusion is the unanimity with which the story which HERODOTES proved to be false is calmly laid on the shoulders of that ill-used and helpless historian . It is safe to say that when HERODOTUB returned from his trip to Syene , he expressed to the unprincipled Register a very decided opinion as to persons who try to impose upon respectable travelers. if he could way have foreseen the ultimate nonsequences of the Register 's joke , he might perhaps have refrained from assaultieg him with his umbrella , but he most certainly would have mentioned him in the preface to his History of Egypt in terms which would have left no doubt in the minds of future generations as to the mendacity and folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
