Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : In Vain is the Verdure of Spring . from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. Restrained from the sight of my dear , No object with pleasure I see ; Though thousands around me appear , The world 's but a desert to me . II . In vain is the verdure of spring , The trees look so blooming and gay ; The birds as they whistle and sing Delight not when William 's away . III . Reclined by a soft murmuring stream , I weeping disburthen my care ; I tell to the rocks my sad theme Whose echo soothes not my despair . IV . Ye streams that soft murmuring flow , Convey to my love every tear ; Ye rocks that resound with my woe , Repeat my complaints in his ear .

His mistress gone , poor little Bill , His wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still , Unless these mournful notes he sung . II . " Ah , mistress mine , where art thou gone ? Return , return , " he plaintive cried ; Thus many an hour he made his moan Till sick of hope deferred , he died . III . Poor bird , with thee I sympathize ; Such pangs the feeling bosom proves , That wrung with anguish hourly dies When absent from the friend it loves . Footnote : 1Kb Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Home . from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. While round the globe the wanderer With wearied steps may roam ; Through every stage , in every clime Each thought still points to home . II . Each dear domestic scene is still , By partial fancy drest , And e'en the Greenland savage thinks His barren soil the best . III . So wheresoe'er henceforth by fate , This frame of mine may be , Each thought , each wish will fondly dwell , America , with thee . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) Have you not seen the eastern sky Adorned with streaks of burnished gold , Now breaking gorgeous to the eye , Now with a sable cloud enrolled . And ere the sun could dart his burning ray , How vapors dank , obscured the face of day ? So joy oft gilds life 's early scene , When , ere fair reason 's sun has power , A sombre cloud will intervene , Nor pleasure gild the prospect more . Dear Hannah , may your morn as brightly shine , And your meridian be From those dank vapors free Which overshadowed mine . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Fair as the lily of the vale from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. Fair as the lily of the vale , As sweet , as fragrant and as frail , The unoffending maid Just oped her beauties to the day , But ere ' t was noon she drooped away , Born just to bloom and fade . II . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Her 's surely found the road . On seraph 's wings pursued its way , Left its frail tenement of clay , And sought its parent God , Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Be wreaths of glory for the hero 's name from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) Recitative . Be wreaths of glory for the hero 's name ; August his deeds and sacred be his fame ; But flowers of rich perfume shall deck the grave Of him who lived to succor and to save . And Cassia 's blossoms twine with Sharon 's rose Where our dear brother 's relics now repose . Air . I. Thy Memory , O Warren , will ever be dear , Whilst any the sense of thy virtue retains , Fraternal affection with gratitude 's tear , Shall blend on the marble that shrouds thy remains . For bright as the arch that through heaven extends , Was the genius that flashed from thy luminous mind , And soft as the dew on the dry earth descends , Was the pity that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice that instructed our youth ! What wisdom , what science that voice could impart , How bright was that face where the radiance of truth , Beamed over each feature , direct from the heart ! Let sorrow each ensign of glory enshroud , When Sol is eclipsed we his presence deplore For sad is the hour , dark , sombre the cloud ,  --  Warren 's voice will be heard and his face seen no more . III . Then build the fair cenotaph , true to each block , That raises the column his fame to record , And O ! may that column of time bear the shock ; Upright as his actions , and firm as his word . But where is the man on this sublunar ball , The jewels of honor so worthy to wear ? Since our brother obeyed the Great Architect 's call , And the bright gem of Hope is bedimmed with a tear . Chorus . Who shall , sweet Hope , on thee rely , Who lift the full confiding eye , Who , resting on thy promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of care and pain , His body shall in rest remain , Till the Great Master 's voice again , Shall animate his dust . Full Chorus . See Religion 's sacred ray Chase the cloud of grief away , While welcomed by the eternal eye Our Warren 's spirit mounts the sky . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : The Wedding Supper . Matt. 22. from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. The marriage supper was prepared ; The king invited many a guest ; Nor Jew , nor Pagan was forbade To enter and partake the feast . II . The king provided wedding robes Which all who asked , might have to wear . The hour arrived ; the supper served , But no invited guest was there . III . " Go , " said the king , " through streets and lanes , And see who wants refreshment most . Bid them come in ; I should be grieved If this my wedding feast were lost . IV . " Press them to come ; they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall for all who willing come A spotless wedding robe prepare . " V. Now from all parts , the sick , the lame , Dressed in new garments thronged the board , Bounteous their fare and light their hearts ; Gracious their condescending Lord . VI . But one there was who full of self , Too proud the Prince 's robe to wear , Thought his own garments good enough : " Friend , " said the prince , " how camest thou here ? VII . " Didst thou not know that every guest Should in a wedding garment shine ? Thou mightst have had one hadst thou asked Without the least expense of thine . " VIII . Aghast he stood , for he had thought By outward garments decked with pride From the king 's penetrating eye , His inward filth and rags to hide . IX . " Go , bear him forth ! " O ! gracious Lord , Thy sentence dare I not repeat , I feel like him I want the robe When at the board I take my seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave admission to thy feast ; Clothe me in thy own righteousness And I shall be a welcome guest . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : The Mighty Lord . from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. Who that beholds the billows rise In foaming mountains to the skies , Or marks the ship in safety brave Their fury and surmount the wave , Or views them late in terrors drest , Sinking in murmurs soft to rest , And doubts but there 's a mighty Lord Who rules the ocean by his word ! II . Ah ! who can see the glorious sun His daily race of splendor run ; Or trace the planets in their spheres , In which they 've rolled for thousand years ; See man , chief wonder of the whole With power of speech and reasoning soul ; And doubt but there 's a mighty Lord Who rules creation by his word ! III . Who that observeth genial spring , Its yearly wreaths and blossoms bring , Or summer bland with tempered heat , Laden with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spoil Of corn and fruit and wine and oil , And doubt but there 's a mighty Lord Who feeds his creatures by his word ! IV . Yes ! mighty Lord , thou God alone , Who in the person of thy son , ' Twixt wrath divine in mercy stood , And ransomed sinners with thy blood , Ah ! who can know such boundless love , And not thy faithful servant prove , Or feel they want such wondrous grace But in the dust must hide their face ? Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Strike , strike the chord , raise , raise the strain from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. Strike , strike the chord , raise , raise the strain , Let joy reecho round each plain , Your banners be unfurled ; Hail , hail the day , when deathless fame Gave to Columbia rank and name Amid the astonished world . The muses match their lyres sublime , To publish Jove 's decree , Columbia to the end of time , Shall flourish great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when hand in hand , Patriots and heroes , glorious band , Breathed forth a solemn vow , Freedom to purchase , or to die , While Jove 's own bird with flaming eye Perched on their chieftain 's brow . Bellona 's martial clarions sound , To publish Jove 's decree , Columbia shall to-day be crowned , A nation great and free . III . Hark , hark , the woodlands catch the strain , Pan and his sylvans beat the plain , In wild , fantastic round , While from the rustic grots and bowers , The virgin train fling odorous flowers , And cheerful rebecks sound . Chaste Dian 's nymphs with tuneful horn , Reecho Jove 's decree . A nation has this day been born : Columbia , great and free . IV . O'er her primeval martyrs ' grave Let freedom 's banners proudly wave : Immortal be their names . Sound , sound the charge , let cannon roar From hill to hill , from shore to shore , To celebrate their fame . Old Neptune bids his tritons sound Jove 's mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorious , great and free . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Charity . from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) Recitative . Touch the soft chord , the tuneful notes prolong , To Heaven-born Charity we raise the song . Oh ! white-robed seraph , quit the realms above , Led by thy sisters , Faith and Heavenly Love . Teach us such aid and comfort to impart , As soothes the suffering , heals the broken heart ; And may our souls in grateful thanks arise Like incense at the hour of sacrifice . Air . I. The brightest of gems is humanity 's tear , The heart 's purest offering is brotherly love , And the hand which dispenses its benefits here , Lays up a rich treasure in mansions above . II . Sarepta 's lorn widow , though famine was near , Yet shared with the prophet her last poor regale , For she trusted the voice of the heaven-taught seer , That her oil should not waste , that her meal should not fail . III . The poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than high gifts from the Pharisee 's hoard , She cast it in cheerfully , though ' t was her last , And obtained , blessed meed , the applause of her Lord . Recitative . For he hath said whose word unchanged remains , Who for my sake shall set the prisoner free , Who clothes the naked , soothes the sufferer 's pains , At my right hand eternal life obtains ; For what was done for them was done for me . Air . I. Ye daughters of affluence open your stores , ' T is the widow entreats ; ' t is the orphan implores . The husband , the father lies cold in the grave ; But your pity may comfort , your charity save . II . And when the storm rages , the piercing wind blows ; And when on your pillows you seek for repose ; The angel of mercy that reigns in your breast With sweet recollection shall lull you to rest . Trio . Hail ! hail ! sweet cherub Charity , Thou first of virtues , hail ! For thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering cordial , Hope , When other comforts fail . And thou , meek-eyed Humility Instruct us all to own Our noblest efforts weak must be , And we 're deficient when the best is done . Full Chorus . Great God of love and light and day We humbly here our offering lay , Before the footstool of thy throne . All that we have , O Lord is thine , And should we all to thee resign We only render back thy own . To soothe and mitigate distress O make us ever free . And may our hearts in holiness , The glory give to thee . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : When the cloud has passed away from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. When the cloud has passed away The sacred bow adorns the sky ; And rich on every flower and spray , Hang sparkling gems of varied dye . II . Then gazing on the blue serene , The soul elated soars above , Beholds the Author in the scene , Soothed into peace and holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lost is the sun 's declining beam ; While from the east in splendor drest , The moon pours radiance on the stream . IV . And gentle zephyrs , sportive , light , Just sighing , whisp'ring , through the grove , Put each unhallowed thought to flight , And soothe to peace and holy love . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : Child of Mortality . from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) By Susanna Rowson . Set to music by John Bray . I. Child of mortality , whence dost thou come ? From the dark womb of earth I first derived my birth , And when the word goes forth , That is my home . II . Child of a transient day , there shalt thou rest ? No ! when this dream is o'er , Then the freed soul will soar To where sorrow comes no more ; Realms of the blest . III . Heir of eternity , teach me the road . Trust a Redeemer 's love ; Faith by obedience prove ; And share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in etherial plains , Join the angelic strains ; Jesus forever reigns ; Glory to God . Rowson , Mrs. , 1762-1824 : To Miss Rebecca Cordis Haswell. from Poems , in A memoir of Mrs. Susanna Rowson ( 1870 ) I. Rebecca , my loved one , the last of thy race , Thy father still lives in his sister 's fond heart ; Though long past the time , yet can memory trace The hour when necessity urged us to part . II . He sobbed as he rested his head on my shoulder , And said : " To thy heart be my infant babes dear ; And my wife , if I never again should behold her , Transfer thy affection , dear Susan , to her . " III . I ne'er have forgotten the vow I then gave thee , My first , dearest brother , protector and friend ; And though ' t was thy fate that no power could save thee ; My love for thy orphans can ne'er know an end . IV . Though my life 's feeble taper , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gleams fitfully round , My heart 's latest beat its kind wishes bestowing , On them and on theirs , shall expend its last bound . V. My dear loved Rebecca , when looking around me , I see desolation extending its wing ; Nor father , nor mother , nor brothers surround me , Time seems to have taken from death its last sting . VI . For even the son I adopted and cherished , Whose grateful affection was balm to my breast , In the bloom and the beauty of manhood has perished , And lies on the margin of waters at rest . VII . But thou art still spared ; my dear Mary remains ; And a long valued friend to my heart is restored , And Hope 's buoyant pinion its vigor retains ; Whilst I look on my treasure ; exult in the hoard . VIII . O grant , gracious Heaven , I may not be left Forsaken and lonely and useless to lie ; Of friend and connections and daughters bereft ; Unpitied to suffer , unheeded to die . IX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May one gentle eye shed a tear on my shrine ; Rebecca , I feel when my soul shall be flying , Perhaps the kind tear ; the last care may be thine . "
