MOSE EVANS . PART I. V. GENERAL THEODORE THROOP differed from me as , I suppose , the South has differed , since the world was created , from the North ; he was too slow , as I was possibly too fast . I dare say the General 's established position for half a century in the highest social circle of Charleston , had been the molding influence in virtue of which the 01 ( 1 gentleman was such a Louis Le Grand in tones and bearing , and stately but gracious inertia , even . He rarely alluded to the subject , but , for him , there was no Future ; why should he hurry himself ? My wife says I can not live except when in motion , and am happiest when most driven , and it did try me sorely to wait for General Throop ; or would have tried me had not my Southern wife accustomed me so long to waiting for her , never up to the instant , I regret to record it of her , since the ceremony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes behind time . As we journeyed together , did business to large amounts together , I knew all along his determinations in matters , days before he had reached them himself ; had said over and over to myself all he was slowly going to say upon a subject a dozen times before he had spoken . Yet I enjoyed the venerable gentleman even while I inwardly fussed at his ponderous propriety , and outran exceedingly his cultured slowness . There are as true gentlemen in Boston as the General , but he was of another variety altogether : a huge watermelon ripening asleep in the sun , as compared with a seckel pear , small but closely buttoned up to the chin in its perfect-fitting suit of brown and red : say , rather , and be done with it , a pineapple contrasted with a pippin . What I wanted to say , when I began all this , was , that we two found it impossible to make our trip between Dick - Frazier 's tavern in Brownstown , and the General 's proposed place down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether too deliberate for that in waking , dressing , breakfasting , riding , looking over the land , conversing about its varied localities for corn and cotton , house and gin ; and this explains how we came to ride one afternoon up to the cabin of Mose Evans , whose lands " joined on " ours , to stay , as Mose had assured us we could , all night . Now ten million people of our population , far from the worst of said population , live in just such cabins . We ride up to a rough paling fence , well whitewashed , as are the cabin and the hen-coops , and the trunk of every forest and fruit tree in the inclosure , the spotless geese wearing the same livery , as they string out of the front gate in the morning , and back in the evening , from the river flowing immediately before the house . Mrs. Evans had been described to us as being a devoted mother , a model housewife in point of neatness , but , alas , a woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last feature of her character . I 1874. 205 // called General Throop 's attention , as we hallooed from our saddles and waited for a reply , before dismounting , to the row of reddened bricks from the gate on either side of the pebbled walk to the porch ; to the brilliant tin pans sunning upon thoroughly scrubbed shelves around the well in the yard , the long pole thereof , as also oaken bucket , seeming just from the same process . At this moment Mrs. Evans appeared , knitting in hand , upon the porch , and , with eyes shaded from the , setting sun by the stocking held in her hand , bade us " light . " It was so very easy , the way in which General Throop conquered our dreaded hostess upon her outpost and on the instant ! Before he was half-way up the walk he had taken off his hat . It was natural to him ; it was not natural to me following him , and I did not do it . Had she been the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer nature , more respectful . " Mrs. Evans , I presume ? " hat in hand and with a grave inclination of his white head . And when , in manner adapted to his own , she had bidden us cuter - " I am ashamed , madam , to step with such boots upon your porch ! " For steps of stone , pine floor , rude posts and railing of the porch , doors opening upon it from the cabin , the very pegs in the whitewashed logs from which bags of dried seeds were hung , all were of almost painful cleanness , the hide-bottom chairs pure and white from incessant soap and sand . After our weeks upon the road and at Dick Frazier 's , the snowy towels and tablecloth , especially the coarse but very clean sheets and pillow-cases at night , were luxuries to General Throop I was glad of . To me Mrs. Evans was simply a tall , well-looking , neatly dressed female who had worried her husband to death , and who might , unless Odd Archer and Brownstown had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment by her termagant tongue . People had told the General the same , but , like all Southern gentlemen , he instinctively invested every white woman with certain chivalric attributes of sister , daughter , wife , mother , elevating her into an ideal being whom they call Woman , a creation , like Dulcinen del Toboso , having no existence outside imagination . In the most natural manner , all the time of our acquaintance , General Throop idealized Mrs. Evans , and she was idealized ; that is , he assumed and she accepted and acted upon the assumption , that she was Woman . Mose Evans observed it , at table , for I can read men , though he was merely a big and very handsome and bearded boy . Had General Throop said much about her admirable cookery , it would have ruined all ; only a sincere word or two , his manner , his evident enjoyment of his meals , did everything . " lie makes more work than all the rest of the housekeeping , " the mother said of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields with the hands , hunting and the like , he can not help muddying and tearing his things , I know . But he does not haunt the town , never enters a doggery , does n't know a card , thank Heaven ! and , then , I will not have any woman to help me ! " This last for reasons with reference to her son , too , as I well knew . I wonder if people like General Throop do really stop at and sleep upon the surface of things as they seem to . " In these days of the overthrow of everything , " the General remarked , amazingly brightened up after a very substantial supper upon coffee , venison , and the perfection of corn bread and butter , " my intention , Mrs. Evans , is to adopt the very life you are now leading . That is , if I close with Mr. Anderson here . " The General and myself bad really and finally reached certainty about that , only his outer person , so to speak , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the General added . " There are , in fact , no politics to talk . Victorious force has destroyed all I hold worth living for . We have entered , as did Greece and Rome , upon the era of miJitary despotism and all corruption . The only glory is of gold , and that is evanescent ! Excuse me . We may , in case I should close with Mr. Anderson , be neighbors . Mrs. Throop and my daughter Agnes . My // only son , Theodore Throop , gave his life , at Sumter , for his country , but I did not desire to speak of that . We bury ourselves in these primeval woods purposely , the world forgetting , by the world forgot . I like your son , madam , " for that individual bad gone to look to our horses . " I pride myself , Mrs. Evans , upon being a judge of character , and I am free to say , he seems to me to be a thoroughly manly and sensible person , as he certainly is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubtless are , very proud of him , madam ! " Now , I knew Evans to be all of this and more , but I could not have kept it from seeming flattery if I had said it . The bearing of the stately old soul gave such weight to all his remarks . " He is all I have ! " was her only reply , and she was halted , I saw , at the mention of that daughter ! - with reference to any possible results concerning her son , halted , like a female panther guarding her cub . And I began to understand this Xantippe , by help of what I had heard , through and through ! - But I could have laughed aloud . Miss Agnes Throop ! The flower and perfection of Charleston culture ; the belle of all its beauties by their own confession . Agnes Throop and this handsome boor ; Beauty and the Beast ; heaven and earth are not more removed . " You seem to be pleased at something , sir ? " It was the panther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , a gleam of danger in her eyes , and quicker knittino ! How people do have to steer in the rapids of life , barely grazing the rocks ! And the steering is sometimes very like lying . " Ah , General , " I readily exclaimed , " Mrs. Evans has her household duties . Were you to seclude yourself from all the outer world , as you threaten , you would have to take to books as some persons take to drinkin* , ! " And , to make my blunder worse , I glanced around as I said it . " iNot one ! Except an old Bible , not one book or paper in the house ! " Mrs. Evani said it out , and I to myself in the same instant . I began to take deeper interest in her ! It was not at all to me , it was in subjection to the inquiring yet perfectly respectful " Ah ? " of General Throop , that Mrs. Evans gave us her version of their family history . Not at once . Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forced its way out by a sort of fermentation during our after acquaintance . But it was to my companion she always addressed herself , and to him exclusively . He seemed , in some way , to have brought back a former life , as of ages ago , to her mind . One day , during our many calls at her cabin , she showed us her husband 's daguerreotype . I had a suspicion that it had lain unopened in the bottom of some trunk until very lately . " He was evidently , madam , a gentleman and a scholar , " the General said , after long and crave inspection of the faded and old-fashioned picture . " And he seems , " he added as he returned to its inspection , " to have been somewhat broken down . Ill health , I presume ? " The woman did not reply . I saw that she refrained by an effort from looking at me . Odd Archer explained it all to me afterward , as we shall see . Yet I must say here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as chief witness with one of his manifold disgraces . I made allowance for its being from him in all I learned from his very unreliable lips . Yet Brown County agreed the woman had worried and scolded the miserable husband to death . Somehow she had embroiled and broken him up along a series of downward removals . What books remained to him were his only ref%e . To give value to these pages , I would like greatly to know whether they were sold for bread , lost in their many moves , burned accidentally . It would be dramatic if Brown County was right , but I do not certainly know , and therefore can not say , whether or no Mrs. Evans in her storms of temper did really , as Brown County asserted , rend to fra*ments and burn the poor fellow 's volumes to the very last leaf . From 1874. 207 // what Chaucer makes his Wife of Bath confess of her tempestuous course in reference to the volumes of her bookish husband , I think this quite likely . I had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , as well as listened to some of what Ruskin has to say , enough to enjoy a little grouping of trees , cows , children - any light and shade and life . Therefore I remember the morning after our first night at Mrs. Evans ' double log cabin . As we afterward learned , Mose had got up about midnight , watched from a tree a certain worn ravine down which the deer came to drink in the river at dawn , and returned by breakfast with the antlered result . I could have painted it if I could have painted anything , th t morning scene . lie had hung the buck to a limb of a live-oak off to one side in the yard . From respect for his mother 's ideas of neatness , I suppose , he had disemboweled the beast before we appeared , so that no reminder even remained , and was slowly flaying the animal as it hung , replying , as he did so , to the General standing by greatly interested ; for there is an occult connection between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white hair uncovered to the air , and aglow with the bright morning , a sound sleep and hearty breakfast , was admiring the young Esau more than his prey . No wonder . I would n't have given the man a hundred a year as entry clerk in our office ; but he was worth thousands as a picture . He was in leather from head to foot , the fringe along hunting frock and cape , and general neatness throughout , telling of his mother . His old cap lay at the stock of his rifle , which was leaning against the weli near by , and his uncovered head with its abundant hair was as glorious as that of a god , the sun striking upon its gold . He seemed a model , in all his vigorous frame , of absolute youth , health , strength . It was the sneer of Brown County , the watch Mrs. Evans kept upon Mose , and his consequent purity in ali regards ; and the complexion of the man , the childlike unconsciousness of his manner , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes in yours - you see , I can no more paint with pen than with brush ! " I never met a nobler youth in my life , " the General said , as we rode off about our lands . " He seems to me to be of the very chivalry of nature . Good blood , rest assured . Possibly his fatber may have come of some Carolina or Virginia family . Good material for a man if fallen into the right hands . I intend to have him supply us with game , mf we close our matter , Mr. Anderson . I think he would interest Agnes ; you know we will not bring even our negroes - former slaves , I should say - or our dogs , if we remove . " " I have puzzled myself , " I replied , " as to why his mother has allowed him to grow up untaught . Jealous even of books , because she never opens one ? Hating them as the preference of her husband to her , his last resort from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect the woman ever had has run into temper ; . vixen , virago , termagant , they tell me . " " I never allow myself , Mr. Anderson , " General Throop makes grave reply , " to speak disrespectfully of others . Therefore no one speaks , I believe , disrespectfully of me . Or , it is to their face , when I must speak . Excuse me , as so much the elder , but I never express myself with other than respect of the aged , of the helpless , especially of woman . You need not always speak , you know . As I said before , yes , sir , her son is noble material . But for what ? If there is a future for this most miserable country , I do not know it ! " VI . In one point we were unanimous at the post-office , that day I first met the worthies assembled therein , and this was that we would all go and hear the Rev. Mr. Parkinson preach next Sunday . He had come in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin , long-haired , exceedingly shy youth , fresh from the institution which prepared // him for the pulpit . So very long had Brownstown been without the services of any minister , of his denomination , at least , that he was accepted as a novelty , an experiment , a mild sensation , even . The members of his church were the richest men around , having been the first settlers of Brown County . Doubtless no stricter members existed when in the North Carolina from which they removed ; but " things had got awfully torn up , " as the patriarch among them himself told me , during the absence of a pastor - very much so indeed if I was to accept the unanimous statement of all I met . Now , my host , Mr. Robinson , was a member and officer of the church of which Mr. Parkinson was the very youthful minister . He was a very tall man , exceedingly stooped in his old age , arid answered to the title of Squire , Judge , Colonel , General , Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although not quite so bad as Odd Archer , yet even he had fallen , unless greatly slandered , into singular courses in reference to cardplaying and horse-racin* . Sabbath having conic , there was quite a congregation of us at church . And a tumble-down old " cathedral " it was ; for an Irishinan , in excess of native politeness , alluded to it as such . in my hearing the week after . A miserable old disused dwelling it was , that Sabbath , and has fulfilled before this , I do hope , what was then its fixed intention of tumbling down . " The entire Robinson connection are on the ground , " Odd Archer informed me before we entered the house . " North Carolina ! See it ? Stamped in strong family likeness : tall , redhaired , sandy-complexioned , gaunt as their hogs , long armed and legged , inflexible . As strong a family likeness among them as there is in a boat-load of clams - their very noses long and insisting like those of the animals mentioned ! In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of emigration . Sir , " Odd Archer adds , " my father is to-day one of their most eminent divines , He was out here once , preached to them and to me . But it was too much for him , these people and myself . " Yet this disreputable limb of the law is evidently arrayed in the best suit of his shabby black , to do honor to the day and place ; and in certain curious aspects , tones , bearing , is as thorough a gentleman as General Throop ; and with a mutual bow , these two excban0ed the civilities of the hour before the General passed on into the place of worship . " A religious man , the General , I see , " the lawyer added . " A gentleman always is . Wnshington was . I am a hopeless case myself , but I can and do respect relic , ion in others ! If they are not actually bringing my pet to church ! How are you , Dob ? " For Dick Frazier , hotel keeper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance at this moment , with a man heavily ironed . " Dob Butler , " my informant explains , " the worst desperado in all Brown County . You see , he would n't stny in the jail , breaks out . It is a good idea havin* him at church ; it rests Dick Frazier and may do Dob some good . his case is on at court next week . Oh , I will clear him ! No doubt about his guilt , murdered a teamster , but he kept money enough to put him through ! How are you , Harry ! Now , Harry , be a gentleman . No fun here ! Dr. Jones , excuse me ! Pardon the liberty , but seeing it is Sunday and church , you ought to have dressed up a little , Doe . " " Only what I wore every day in Philadelphia , " Dr. Alexis Jones makes cool reply , for he is dressed in the extremity of fashion . " Is there not , excuse me , something offensive in the air ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose ; " pity it should be under the church - polecat , I 'm afraid ! " The youthful physician . can not but color a little at this reference to his perfumery , and hastens to turn the topic . " But how singular , * e ntlemen ! here in this nineteenth century attending church ; so far as I am concerned , as well be at a pagoda in Japan ! " In fact Dr. Jones prided himself upon his 1874. 209 // unbelief , as being the one precious possession which specially distinguished him from and elevated him above the common herd , and made it prominent accordingly , very much as he did his broadclot.h and jewelry . As the young man passes in , Odd Archer , Esq. , says , in a plaintive manner , " I can stand a scoundrel , like Dob Butler in there , or myself , but a consummate fool " - At this juncture we are swept alone with a number of people , male and female , into the long , low , dingy room used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best preachers labor every Sabbath under like circumstances , along the line of the nation 's advance westward , let me review , for my gratification if not for yours , dear reader , this Sabbath service with Mose Evans , Mr. Robinson , and the rest , Mr. Parkinson preaching . Because there is a heroism in such service . Planks have been so disposed upon hide-bottom chairs as to make seats sufficient to accommodate the two or three hundred persons present , while the youthful clergyman has his special chair beside a little well inked and whittled school desk by the huge fire-place , at one end of the apartment ; to which now this , now that member of the congregation comes during sermon and stands beside the preacher , warming first one , then the other of his or her feet , listening , somewhat in the attitude of a critic , to the discourse in progress . There was a punciieon plank , a foot or so off to the left from the fire-place , which I heard Mr. Robinson warn the young minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellar below , if he should step upon it . There were never less than seven children running about the room all through and through the sermon ; the number of smaller members of the congregation crying at once I attempted but failed to count , owing to inadequacy of brains for labor so multiform . Besides , in order to see his sermon , Mr. Parkinson had piled two brickbats from the old hearth under each 1e0 of the little table before him , and was in evident terror all along lest a touch of his hand should topple the pulpit , and , with it , the entire service and Sabbath , over , as actually did occur some weeks after ! And the poor young fellow is as thorosi*hly unfitted for his ministry of such a flock as a man can possibly be . Yet I do not know ! He is as fair and frail as a flower , and his congregation are robust , sunburned , hardened to work , and , a good many of them , to wickedness . He knows nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thin : , s they are accustomed to as matter of course are repulsive and impossible to him ! The exceeding contrast may have done the people good , like that of a woman to a man ! But , oh , that sermon ! A plea for the personality of the devil , I remember , making Satan very nebulous , however , from excess of drapery . Perfectly true in general and utterly false in particular , merest moonshine as to practical effect upon the people , who waited with waning patience for him to get through . Mr. Robinson was in a hide-bottom chair to the left , tilted against the wall upon its hind legs , solemnly and soundly asleep . To do the preacher justice , he and his subject both became more practical toward the close . And it was Mose Evans , listening with large , earnest eyes , like a big boy who really wanted to know all about the matters concerning which the minister spoke , who steadied him until unconsciously he stopped preaching and began to tell him , in reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about it . " For God 's sake , lVIIr . Parkinson , * ' I said to him afterward , when we had become thoroughly acquainted with each other , " do n't talk in abstract essays to these folks . Your discourse is so elaborate that , so to speak , it chills and chances you into a sort of ecclesiastical automaton the moment you begin to deliver it . Why clothe yoursclf ( for I want you to do good here ) in such a mannerism of starch and silk ? You are not a medicine-man among savages , relying upon your feathers and paint to conjure them out of their evil case ! These are common-sense , sinning , suffering men and women . God has given you a suf // ficient gospel to save them with . Use it , man ! Speak it out plainly , squarely , to the sin and need of the congregation . Do n't speak of your Creator as the Deity . ' And Satan is not the ethereal effluence of essential evil ; ' call him the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of ? They will respect you and listen to you and be benefited by you as you fear no one but your Master . Be as practical , Bible in hand , as if you were driving a trade ! Odd Archer before a jury , liar , rogue , lewd dog that he is , has a thousand times your sense in his way of pleading his cause - But never mind . To go back to the congregation , - the second object of interest at church was old New Hampshire . Burdett , Seth Burdett , is his name ; I should have recorded it before . To the amazement of Brownstown he came out , the old , hard , tough postmaster , in a new light altogether that day . After giving out a familiar hymn the young minister sat blushing and paling in the silence which followed , broken as it soon was by certain titterings among the young ladies present . " li any friend can raise the tune " - the preacher said , at last . I had not been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit upon Ortonville as the orthodox tune for the hymn announced . But the postmaster was from New England , also , and , to the profound astonishment of all there , raised that very tune and in full voice himself ! Like the others he was carefully attired in his best , and was as practical , persistent , and undaunted in leading the singing as in all else . It was music from a stone Memnon indeed ! . His voice was somewhat shrill , but not without a certain quaint and old-fashioned sweetness too , and we all joined in when a verse or two had given the world assurance of a tune ! I can see at this instant the horsethief and murderer - Dob Butler - sitting in his chains beside the county sheriff , Dick Frazier , in the farthest right-hand corner , the jail being too frail to be relied upon for an hour , even ; how the clink , now and then , of the fetters still sounds upon my ear as during the sermon then , through all the manifold noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister were the rest of the Robinsons , male and female , who all seemed to me like a party of school children caught in a melon patch , stealing , and who had made solemn promise to do so no more . I found General Throop talking with Mose Evans out of doors after service that day . He was as carefully arrayed as his saddle-bags allowed , but in coarsest jeans he would have been General Theodore Throop and - Charleston - still . It made a vast difference to Mose Evans , the being dressed in his Sunday best , a modest suit of gray stuff . He was twenty-three years old , as I was told , of stalwart yet perfect proportions , with abundant hair and beard , silken and of that peculiar shade of gold called , Helen tells me , by painters , " lion 's eye , " - as handsome a man as I ever saw in my life , his glory lying in his large , frank eyes , sincerity , simplicity , absolute independence , supreme health , cordial willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was the more interested in him as his home joined the General 's estate , and he was being , employed to oversee certain improvements towards the removal of the family from Charleston - the lands being yet exactly as they were left after Creation and Deluge . I think it was the day after that Sunday 's service that Odd Archer remarked to me , in continuation , " Mose Evans is , sir , a child of nature ! As you will pay me no fee for lying in the matter , I will add that the man is , from sheer ignorance , I suppose , and lack of opportunity , considered to be as immaculate as King Arthur of the Round Table , - for I read a book occasionally as variety to steady wickedness . " " Is he very poor ? " I began . " Land ! " My informant 's only reply , but with an emphasis . " We spent a night at his cabin ; his mother seemed to be " - I venture . 1874. 211 // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ducked to death as a notorious scold years ago . Sir , " my companion gravely added , " it could be legally done in the river to-morrow - statute law of old England never repealed . She killed her husband . This way . He was a professor in some Georgia college , years ago . Like those dry old pedants , fell desperately in love with his wife when a blooming girl , because , I suppose , she was so pretty and so ignorant . Mold her , you observe . Very soon she broke him up in Georgia . They had to move and move and keep moving , until they wound up here , where he died . Sir , that poor fellow was scientifically scolded to death ! I tell you , Mr. Anderson , if Mrs. Evans had been a Madame Brinvilliers or La Farge , and made daily use of the lesser poisons of herb and crucible , it could not have been accomplished more systematically . I knew him . About his land titles . We lawyers have to know everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dazed insanity long before he died . His poor body held out longest , being only the secondary object of her assault .. The son does not know how to read , sir ! " " Mose Evans ? " " Mose Evans ! Splendid specimen of a man as I ever saw in a jury box , or on trial for murder , yet can not read . Owing to the peculiar unsettledness of their life and to his remarkable mother , as they say of Cornelia and Martha Washington ! I do not know if there ever were other children , but Mose is now her only child . She may love him , for what I know , but he never learned to read . I doubt whether she has ever opened a book since she was a schoolgirl . Fact , sir . " All of which made me look with more interest upon Mose Evans , meeting him next day down the river by appointment in company with General Throop . Although I did not know of it until long afterward , I will mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read in those days . It was the old postmaster who taught him , very secretly , in the little back room of the old man 's store , and at night . I am certain his mother knew nothing of it . " This queer thing about it , sir , the lawyer had told me in the conversation just mentioned ; " it is the poor fellow 's mother has kept him clear of the women , virtuous and otherwise . I suppose he dreads them all as he dreads her , knowing his father 's experience and his own . All the women about admire him , but they are too much afraid of his mother to speak to him , hardly ! " Aside from the mere gossip of Brown County , all this interested me to a singular degree . Foolish as it may seem to you at this stage of my narrative , I regarded Mose Evans as a species of nugget I had most unexpectedly stumbled upon ; and I propose to be rigidly statistical and accurate in regard to the man , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I write he rises before me , illumined by all the wonders which followed ; yet , had any lunatic imagined them all , and asked me if such things were possible of him , I would have said , even before those remarkable events took place , " Such things never entered my mind , sir , but now that you have raised the question as to their possibility , why , yes , sir , yes ! " And I would have made the reply even with enthusiasm ! Looking back over the whole affair , I do decla*re , as upon oath , before a notary public , that I regard Mose Evans as being the most remarkable man I ever knew . What is more , dear reader , I trust you will heartily agree with me before we part . VII . At the time of which I would now speak , General Throop and family had arrived in Brown County from Charleston , and were settled down in their new home upon the bank of the river , a few miles below Brownstown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . I am satisfied that the General entertained some vague idea of being the Romulus of a new Rome , or rather , and far better , // the founder of a new Carolina , if not of a second Charleston , though ages must roll away before his purpose could be consummated . The glory of the place was in the baronial old live-oaks , bearded with sweeping gray moss , and extending their arms abroad over the roof below , in perpetual benediction . There were plenty of magnolia-trees scattered around the cottage , as up and down the river for hundreds , of miles , laden in season with their yellow-white flowers , and intoxicating the air with perfume . A paradise of a place , with its greensward , the broad verandah having a swingin* hammock for the old General , in* which he smoked the day through and the year round ; smoked with set purpose , as if he would puff his soul and body , all his disastrous past , blasted present , and hopeless future away , to be lost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white-mustached lips did in the air ! No syllable of complaint about his personal fortunes ; a vast deal , I confess , about the Federal government , and the era of " ism and rapid ruin over all the world ! " " The very prosperity , sir , " he often said to me , " of your country , - your country , for it is not mine , - like that of Rome when it had fallen under the despotism of its Ca*sars , is but the flush of the fever which is destroying it ! " and much more to the same effect . Whenever I happened for the night at the General 's , in my many land excursions here and there over Brown County , I could not but dbserve the Mary Martha Washington , their slave of whom I have already spoken , - their slave on religious principle , as sublimate ( l by her delusion as was Mrs. General Throop by hers . I was to the old " girl " a specimen of the terrible variety of my race known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her life , only in dark and shuddering whispers , as at once the vilest and most venomous of mankind , and endured by her now only under protest ! But I am speaking of the home of the Throops . I had secured the services of Mose Evans as a kind of overseer , while the building was being erected . It was nothing but a pile of hewn logs , the cracks between carefully " chinked and daubed , " that is , filled in with blocks of wood sawed for the purpose , and coated with mortar outside and inside alike . My " overseer " had given his heart to the work during the months it was in course of being constructed , before the arrival of the family , and Brown County in general came to see , and congratulated him upon the result . There were a good number of rooms carpeted with India matting , a comfortably furnished library , the parlor arranged as much like the one in Charleston as Mose Evans could manage it , from plans furnished by me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend a week of romance in , and then to weary to death of , unless alive with some deeper interest to you . The family were there simply as in exile , confident of living and dying in banishment . There was no possible reversal of their sentence ; you would learn that much soon after your acquaintance ! Knowing this , the household did all that human beings in their case could do to feel at home , and to be neighborly with all ; their culture , however , marking them off as distinctly from the families and persons around as if they had arrived from another planet . I had ventured this last assertion to my venerable host , Mr. Robinson , one day during my sojourn with him , in the emergency of having no one else to say it to , only to be misunderstood , my friend being deaf of outer and inner hearing . " From another plantation ? so they are ; sea-island cotton place somewhere there in Carolina . Twenty cents , I m told , when our best upland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! Gin it with rollers instead of saws like us . Stuff it in a long bag hung through a hole in the gin floor , with a nigger and a crowbar , instead of a screw and press like us . Sing'lar , is n't it ? " Now I re*ret all the time I am writing , that , being merely an overworked business man , I can not put upon papei 1874. 218 // the people inhabiting this , their new home , at the time I would speak of , all of whom I came to like almost beyond any persons I had ever known before . Certainly , they were to me a new and remarkable variation upon all my previous experiences . There was , for instance , the wife and mother . You have met invalids - I select the gentlest term - like Mrs. Throop , or my effort to place her before you is utter failure . Dickens would have run off with the comic side of her singular character , Thackeray with the tragic ; torn to atoms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I close my eyes and see her now ! Nothing but a matron in deep black , with the simple manners of a lady , but with eyes which , with abnormal insight , arraign you on the instant , read your soul ; condemn you , endure you merely for the present ! " I myself used to sin like the rest of you , " I have actually heard her say in conversation , " but I have got beyond all that . You are to me as I myself once was , therefore I know your very soul so well ! I used all the forms and ceremonies ; there in Charleston , not for myself , but for their influence on others . I do not regret being deprived of them all here , " for it was after her removal to the West I heard her that evening , many evenings , " sinc* I had long done with them . Nothing in Sabbath or Scripture , prayer or praise , of service to me any longer . And how sorry , sorry I am for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so like and so utterly unlike her mother , could do on such occasions was to say , occasionally , " Oh , mother ! " " Now , mothcr ! " as to an invalid , or simply to hang her head in shame . The old General always gravely arose , when the topic came up , and walked sadly from the room . " Our Theodore is , you know , Mr. Anderson , in heaven , - killed in Sumter ! and I have so much , oh , so very much more actual companionship every day with him than I have with the General or with Agnes here ! we two understand each other ! You , poor creatures , how I do know and pity you ! " And there was Mr. Clammeigh ! Once or twice he came out from Charleston to see them . I wish I could photograph him upon this page . Of course , his connection with Helen - I refer to my wife - prejudiced me . And why should I be so drawn toward and repelled from that cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am from New England , not from the tropics , yet there is some profound antipathy of our natures ; my fault of excess , possibly , or his of deficiency . Lift a cabbage leaf and , in recoiling from the toad squatted beneath , you recoil from Mr. Clammeigh ! smite asunder a primeval rock to find a living frog seated in its centre from the creation of the world , as indifferent to light as to darkness , to motion as to rest " Now , I like Mr. Clammeigh ! " Why should it always be said as in defense of the man ? Hawthorne would analyze the inmost ice of this heart ; I do not pretend to . About the only thing I know is , if Mr. Clammeigh dwells , we will say , as at the North Pole , then Mose Evans has his home at the South Pole ; never two men more exactly the opposite the one of the other ! I have a sense of relief as I cease in despair from saying anything more upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans I do understand , as I do , may I say , a section of land , or a summer morning ? The philosophy of it all , I suppose , is that Mose Evans is simply and purely nature , human nature ! Although it seems absurd to name Miss Agnes Throop in the same breath with the untutored backwoodsman in question , yet , if I was to say that I never knew a manlier man than Mose Evans , I could add , and in the same sense , that I never met a womanlier woman than Miss Throop . Draped as she was from birth in the linens , silks , ribbons of conventionalism , thoroughly enveloped , as to her very soul , so to speak , in the subtler valenciennes of her peculiar breeding , she was , as if in virtue of her very refinement , so much the more woman , simply woman ! Heaven knows what it was in her that reminded one of Eden and Eve . Small figure , dark yet // ever variable eyes , , hair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of tone and bearing , natural grace and sweetness , - it is useless for me to attempt description , though all the army of nouns and adjectives marched to my assistance ! I admire an ( l love my wife a well as husband ever did , or could , yet next to her , I swear allegiance to this lady , because you can no moire deny her being a queen , than you can deny her existence . " I do thank , you so sincerely , Mr. Anderson ! " she said to inc the day I dropped in upon them for the first time after their arrival ; and , somehow , in giving me her cordial eyes and hand she gave me , if I dared to say it without being misunderstood , her heart and soul . " You and that Mr. Evans have done so much more for us than we could have hoped , and in such a short time , too . It is a paradise of a place ! There is so much in our taking a strong liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' * But I can not record the conversation . As much in tone and manner as in words , she let me know that she perfectly understood her new position and intended to fill it . To make up to her parents for wealth , slaves , health , lost son and brother , Charleston , the whole world they had forever lost , - this was the task she had taken upon her . Task is not the word , nor duty ; nor even pleasure ; this was to be her glad life thenceforth I Fascination ? And consisting as much in my weakness as in her peculiar power ? Perhaps so . Yet I insist upon the fact that all persons coming under her influence were affected , more or less , in the same way . Not my own sex only , the other also , which makes it the more wonderful . VIII . I was much occupied , after I had seen the Throops fairly fixed in their new home , with the affairs of our company . I had to examine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County but over the entire State . My wife has likened me to a sparrow-hawk . Certainly no fowl of the air could come and go upon the wing more irregularly , hardly more swiftly than myself . The fact is , money was to be made , just there and then , and a good deal of it . In consequence , I often lost sight of the Throops , and for long periods at a time , for I had to come and go , too , between Charleston and Browustowa more than once at this juncture . I made a rapid call upon the General whenever I possibly could , but my headquarters were chiefly , for land reasons , with Mr. Robinson , patriarch as he was both in church and state . On one of my rapid returns for the moment to Browastown , Odd Archer , Esq. , had laid hands upon me as I alighted in front of Dick Frazier 's hotel , from my mustang . " Look here , Major Anderson , " he said , " I ye tre-men-dous news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tough to astonishment as I 11 acknowledge you are ! " " That you have given up drinking , and the like , Mr. Archer ? Yes , " I replied , " I am astonished . If it will only hold out . " But I decline to narrate what followed upon the part of the reprobate lawyer . The fact is , I halted him in mid-volley , so to speak , mounted my weary animal , and , caked in mud , as well as ravenously hungry and dead tired as I was , rode through the swamp and the darkness to Mr. Robinson 's plantation , miles out of town . Upon some topics I " had to stand Odd Archer , " as the county phrase ran ; upon the subject of his remarks just then , " I could n't and would n't and did n't ! " to use the same county dialect . Even when comfortably seated with Mr. Robinson , after a particularly hearty supper beneath his roof , I shrank from asking questions . No questions were needed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment of all Brown County ; it was impossible for my host not to speak of it . But I allowed bun to approach it in his own way . " Oh yes , " he said , " we all know Mose Evans . Everybody likes Mose , takes a fancy to him 1874. 215 // from the first , like you . And it is nigh impossible to stir him up . But when he is roused ! You never heard , Mr. Anderson , of the thrashing he gave Job Peters ? Oh , well , hardly worth telling , at least not to-day , Sunday . Job did not know , I suppose , about Miss Agnes Throop . Not then ! He does now ! We all do now , of course ! Job whispered something about her to Mose ; he will never say what it was , and no man dares ask Mose . Only one blow ! Nary another ! I tell you they were so long bringing Job to , with their buckets of water dashed on him , that they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the place where the bad Jobs go , I say to myself ; for we all know Job Peters , too , as well as we do Mose Evans . Job is the only brother of Harry Peters , the nativ*i Joe Miller of Brown County , but " all the cussedness , " Mr. Robinson remarked , " of the family was in Job . " Harry 's fun was enjoyed by the passing object of it , most of any ; somehow Job 's fun was very apt to draw a blow in return , - a curse , at least . " There is one thing about Mose Evans will astonish you , " Mr. Robinson proceeds ; " I never think of Mose , but as a great big promising lad . Why , Mr. Anderson , that man " " Pardon me , I ye been told of it five hundred times , - cannot read , " I reply . " And no better rider in Brown County , " says Mr. Robinson , " no better neighbor in a bear fight , no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easy with his black ones . " " They told me , as I came through town I interrupt , with considerable reluctance , too . For so old a man , my host snatches the topic from my lips with singular eagerness . " It was the first day Father Hailstorm preached after her people moved here , " he said , filling his cob-pipe full again as for a hood talk . " You see , she came for the first time to our meeting that day " - strong pull at his pipe - " with her old father , the General there . What a powerful gentleman he is to look at ; high-toned , too ! But , fact is , sir , I never saw anything so wonderful in her : a nice lady , a very nice lady , cf course , but more like a whiff of smoke ! lily taste is something solid , substantial , healthy , stout , you see ! " my informant added frankly , his wife quite overflowing two hundred pounds , and every freckled daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " That day there at church , it was Father Ransom preached ; I disremember what month , but it was Ransom , sure ; Hailstorm , they call him . That is the way I come to remember . She took her seat upon the front plank , - lit on it like you see a chip-bird on a twig , her father with her ; so crowded you see , no other place . I always set on one side the stand , - keeps the folks in order when they know I see every soul of them , - and I thought of it the moment she came in . And so you are that old General Theodore Throop and his daughter , I said to myself , come out to get better and better acquainted ? Glad to see you , and not so glad either . Hailstorm ! I know you wo n't believe it , sir , but I tell you the fact . One day years ago when the folks started for church , r stayed at home . I 11 bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the horse-block , - we had run down a little in our ways then , so long without a preacher of our own denomination , - a bale , I said , if I do not tell you , sitting here upon my front porch , just as much of the sermon , a mile away it was , as you do . See if I do n't ! such a tremendous voice he has , Father Ransom . " " I hope you lost your bale , Judge , " I remarked , Judge being the phase of Mr. Robinson 's character when spoken to just then . " I do not approve of betting ! " as from the bench , my friend gravely replied , in contradiction to statements I had heard of him , or they would have had to pay ! You know wife and the girls claim a bale each , of the crop when it goes to the port . In county sales , " by which my host meant account of sales , " the price is given of their bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things , you know ! Of course I could n't hear until the old man , a most an excellent man he is , got warmed up . After that ? I managed even to guess out the text ! " " But about Miss Agnes Throop , Squire ? " What I 'm talking about ! " my friend Mr. Robinson added . " It will kill you , I said ' to myself very first thing when I saw her take that seat in reach of his very hand so close I was afraid he would strike her that way , too , when he got a-going . You see , the old man forgets everything but the sinners and their danger . And " - my friend continued after considerable pause we do have some hard cases among us for sure ! And he knows exactly how case-hardened they are ! I tell you he mauls them ! And not one bit of use their pretending to slip out to look after their animals ! One good mile all around ! Unless them fellows actually mount and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - after the old man gets roused , I mean ! A most an excellent man ; does his duty , yes , sir ! And I ye noticed this , " my friend proceeds after a serious pause , " this , " - lon0er pause ,  --  ' ' oh , well , this he tells them just what and who they are , and , very plainly , precisely where they are going ! Makes that awful plain ! hair stand on an end , you see . Not to say he ever shook us of the Robinson connection much ; not of our denomination , you know . If Brother Parkinson nor no other of our own church had never come , we never would have joined any church but our own . That is n't our way , in politics or religion ! But before he closes , - Hailstorm , I mean ,  --  he always speaks of the Sayiour for every one of them that will repent , and always in the lowest tones ! May be he is worn out , no voice left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - powerful plain upon that *f ; weeping , too , and everybody else , for that matter ! It may be because of what goes before , but this last part of his sermon always brings them ! I mean , does them most good ! " 217 " But , Miss Agnes Throop ? " I have to add , for my friend is gravely thinking of something else . " Oh , her ! That day ? Well , I watched her as he got a-going . She was actually frightened for a while . His voice is tremendous ! And he never preaches less than an hour and a half . She ? Like a prairie flower in a whirlwind , sitting almost in the whirl of his arms , most of his voice over her head , somehow . Fact is , I forgot all about her as he drew toward the close ; the old man was speaking of amazing love to the worst case there , tears running down his white beard , worse than the perspii-ation before ; we were all weeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I happened to notice her as the old man fell back in his hide-bottom chair , sermon done . She was crying , too , more like a flower you have seen all beaten down and drenched after a heavy shower . Not that I think her what you would call pretty , mind . Too fraillike , swinging on a stern a breath would break . Now , I like solid , well , fleshy ' *  --  " 1 wonder when Mose Evans first saw her , " I said at this point . " When was it , General ? That is what I m coming to , if you 11 only give me time , " my friend makes eager reply . " That very day it was ! You see I always sit on the right of the stand - a loose puncheon plank there , and ever so many children coming about during preaching , to drink from the preacher 's water there on the stand . That day Mose Evans lie got crowded on to the end of a plank seat , farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by gripping into a crack between the logs behind him some way . Oh , I noticed Mose ! The instant that Miss Agnes Throop came crowded along after the old General , her head down , I noticed Mose looking at her as any man would ; she a new-coiner , somehow not like our other girls , you see . It was only that after she sat down ! " and the narrator illustrated his meaning by a snap of finger and thumb . " Oh , I saw it all ! She lifted up her head and looked modMiose Evans . // estly about . The instant her eyes fell that , only stealing a look out of the . upon Mose Evans " - corners of his eyes , his face toward the " Well ? " I demanded , after some preacher all the time , and no more hearsilence. ing that preacher " - qwq 219 on the joist over the door . " I do believe it is actually killing Mose .

But , supper ; come ! " In the course of conversation at ta ble , Mrs. Robhison tells me , at length , of the black woman of the Throops , who persists in considering herself their property , because the Bible says she is . " I tell you , Judy , " my host breaks in with energy , " it is not that negro 's religion at all . It s that Miss Agnes has bewitched her ! Slave ? Look at that poor Mose Evans ! " William M.
