Slight pause of embarrassment . Cilli . Sits R. of table , L. I suppose you really wanted to see my papa  --  ? Leo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court Counsellor , but  --  I  --  my name is Leopold von Mittersteig . Cilli . Oh , yes ! You are our Cousin Leopold ? Papa told us about you . He got you the position here . Leo . Leopold Embarrassed . He was so kind , and I wanted to make my call of acknowledgment  --  and to take the opportunity , and to have the good fortune to meet you personally , cousin . Cilli . Rises , crosses to C. Extending her hand to him . I am delighted  --  Shakes his hand.  --  heartily . Leo . Leopold During the hand-shaking repeats confused.  --  Heartily . Slight pause of embarrassment . Rises , crosses to C. This is the first time you 've come to Carlsbad , is it not ? Cilli . Oh , yes  --  and it 's my first trip from home . But now I have got used to it  --  and this place is so pretty . Goes to window . We have been here a week . Leo . Leopold Yes , I know  --  and I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rising and modestly but proudly presenting himself . This is my full dress . Down R. Cilli . With genuine admiration . It 's very fine . But pray , be seated . Leo . Leopold Sitting again , R. And then I had so much to do in my new place . This year there is such a crowd . Carlsbad never had anything like it ; more than two thousand guests this season . Cilli . Astonished , sits , L. Two thousand  --  is it possible ? Leo . Leopold Yes , indeed . Carlsbad is taking a great step ! We are going to have the streets lighted . Cilli . I was very much surprised to hear that . Leo . Leopold Forty-four lamps  --  distributed through the city . They are to burn until half-past ten  --  some of them . And such fine people coming ! From all quarters of the world ! The great composer von Beethoven is going to give a concert in August ! Day before yesterday Catalani came , and you know , of course , that Privy Counsellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! The great Goethe . I saw him yesterday myself  --  for the first time in my life ! In the theatre . He sat just opposite us in the box . I kept looking at him the whole evening . Leo . Leopold Smiling . I noticed it . Cilli . Were you there too ? Leo . Leopold Yes , down in the parquet . I was going to take the liberty of coming up and paying my respects  --  Cilli . Why did n't you ? Leo . Leopold I did n't know whether I ought . You were sitting there with an elegant young lady ; people said it was a Countess Trachau . Cilli . Yes , my friend , Manni Trachau . But she would have been only too pleased . You know you are related to her too . Leo . Leopold Am I ? Cilli . Certainly , her father was a Mittersteig , of Vienna . She married my father 's elder brother  --  but her husband only lived a year . And just think , rises she knows Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , she met him in Weimar . She was there six weeks , when her mother was living . And Goethe recognized her at once last night . When we were coming out of the theatre , he came up and spoke to her . You can just imagine the sensation among the crowd . My heart was beating clear up to here . Touching her throat . But Manni chattered away just as if it was nothing at all ; and what do you think she was talking about with Goethe ? Leo . Leopold What ? Cilli . About a recipe for apple dumplings he made her copy out for him in Weimar  --  Leo . Leopold Apple dumplings ? Goethe ? Cilli . And about the Punch and Judy show they saw together in Vienna  --  and he was so amused , and laughed so much over her Viennese expressions ; and as he was going away , he shook hands with her over and over again , and said quite loud , so that all the people heard it , that she was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosses , L. Well , when Goethe says THAT  --  Music pp . Cilli . It must be so , must n't it ? Crosses , R. If I had been in Manni 's place , I should n't have known myself for pride . HERMANCE behind the scene , calling CILLI , half singing , after the manner of children playing . Hermance . Cilli , Cil  --  li ! Cilli . Springing up . There she is . She lives with us  --  she has our three front rooms . Hurries , R. , front . LEOPOLD goes up to background . Music , ff . Her . Hermance Hurriedly from C. forward with a tied up pasteboard box in her hand . Well , well , well . Here you are ! I 've been looking for you all over the house . Cilli . What is it , Manni ? Her . Hermance Holding the box behind her back . Crosses to table , R. I 've got a surprise for you . The mercer has just sent the things I ordered from Vienna . Showing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That box ? What 's in it ? Tries to take it . Her . Hermance Tantalizing . Hands off the pie ! Deliberately . It 's something for you ! My ! That makes you prick up your ears ! Cilli . Oh , Manni  --  let me see , please ! Her . Hermance And how your eyes shine . No matter , you ca n't see it , not until afternoon  --  just before we go out for the four o'clock parade . About to set the box away , reconsiders and taking it again in her hand , hastily untying the string . On second thoughts perhaps I 'd better show it to you now ; or we might both burst with suppressed emotion . Lifts out of the box a large hat . There , little girl , what do you say to that ? Cilli . Staring at the hat . What is it ? Her . Hermance What is it , Goosey ? It 's a hat . The very latest style from Vienna . Cilli Taking the hat from her and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her . Hermance It 's stunning , that 's what it is . Takes the hat away from her and sets it on her head . It becomes you splendidly . Really , Cilli , you look sweet enough to eat . Look at yourself  --  where 's the glass ? Looks around and observes LEOPOLD . Who are you ? Going C. Cilli . I beg pardon , he 's your cousin , too , I quite forgot him . Presenting . Our cousin , Mr. Leopold von Mittersteig . Her . Hermance What , are you the Leopold ? Leo . Leopold Bowing . Yes , Countess . Her . Hermance Well , well , I thought you were quite different . Leo . Leopold But , how ? Her . Hermance Well , more of a desperate looking character  --  more like the brigand stories I heard about you . Cilli . Eagerly . Brigand stories ? Manni ? Her . Hermance Sh ! Softly . You must n't breathe them in this house . You know he ran away and joined the Black Hussars in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war ? Leo . Leopold Modestly . Yes , but fortunately there was n't any fighting . It was when everybody in Germany was up in arms against Napoleon . I was in Vienna , where uncle had put me as attach in the embassy . Of course we young fellows had our meetings , and sang all the war songs of Koerner ! Even the boys ran away from school . Then Koerner himself read us his poem , " The people wake , the war storm breaks , Why idly stand with empty hand ? " You see , the inspiration took hold of me  --  I said , " Every man is needed by his country . " Crosses to C. Song . Cilli . Eagerly interrupting . That 's right ; I would have gone , too , if I had been a man . Her . Hermance And so you sneaked away from Vienna , without telling your uncle ? Leo . Leopold I did ; on foot ; ran away to Breslau ! They accepted me and drilled me , and sent me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it was all over  --  peace was concluded . I had to take off my uniform  --  and walk back . Crosses , L. Her . Hermance Crosses , C. And you got a fine reception from your high old royal , official , Austrian , family ! Leo . Leopold I did ; I was in disgrace until the Court Counsellor got me a position in the Custom House at Linz . Cilli . Pityingly . Poor fellow ! A Custom House ? Her . Hermance And you could n't get that without a solemn promise never to go to war again ? Leo . Leopold Yes , indeed . Then the Court Counsellor interested himself again , and so did my aunt , and now I 'm promoted to Commissioner of Inspection here at Carlsbad . Her . Hermance Then I congratulate you , I am really and truly glad . Leo . Leopold You are very kind . Her . Hermance Not a bit , I mean it honestly ; do n't I , Cilli ? Crosses , L. C. Cilli . Nods . Yes . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him so to his face . But you please me . There , give me your hand . Offering him her hand . Leo . Leopold Shakes her hand . I 'm so glad you like me , and , Countess , I must ask permission to call on you within the next few days . I have something important to communicate . Her . Hermance Something important ? Well , I am curious . Come as soon as you can . Let 's say to-morrow , or , seeing you are here now , you 'd better tell me at once . Leo . Leopold Aside to her . Willingly  --  With side glance to CILLI.  --  but I ca n't now . Her . Hermance Understanding . So . To CILLI , motioning to her to leave . Sorry you must go , Cilli . Cilli . Go ? But I must n't ! Her . Hermance Goodness , girl , do n't be so stupid , pack the trumpery thing up pointing to box  --  make your courtesy and vanish . Cilli . Oh , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has before put back the hat . to LEOPOLD . We shall see you oftener now , I hope , cousin  --  Leo . Leopold If you permit  --  Cilli . Somewhat embarrassed , crosses to LEOPOLD . Certainly , we shall be very glad offering her hand , with slight emphasis really very glad  --  I 'm honest , too , ai n't I , Manni ? Exits quickly , R. U. E. Her . Hermance Has meantime seated herself , R. of table , R. Now , then , please begin . Motioning him to seat . Leo . Leopold Sitting near her , L. of table . I came here with the intention of taking Miss Cilli into my confidence , and perhaps her mother , but since I have made your acquaintance , Countess , and know your position in the house , I think it better to speak to you . Her . Hermance Drawing nearer to him with childish curiosity . Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes  --  and what is it ? Leo . Leopold When I was in Ellbogen last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I heard something about uncle . Her . Hermance Eagerly . The Court Counsellor ? Cilli 's father ? Leo . Leopold Yes , he is no longer in favor . They want to retire him . Her . Hermance With good-hearted sympathy . Oh , Lord ! That is a misfortune . Leo . Leopold Is n't it ? To turn him out of his splendid position . Her . Hermance It is n't so much the position . He has had nothing to do for forty years but lean against the stove and twiddle his thumb . And if somebody else leans against the same stove , it wo n't stop the dough from rising . But there 's another consideration . With thumb and fore finger making the gesture of counting out money . There 's where the rub is ! It 's the salary , though it is small ! Too much for a dead man , and too little for a live one . Leo . Leopold But there 's the estate his wife brought him  --  the old ancestral castle  --  Her . Hermance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family in stone  --  the Bohemian lion , with the long tongue , and the two short tails . Unfortunately the gate is the best part of the castle . The roof leaks  --  where the mortgage lies . Leo . Leopold Uncle always said if he left the service , he intended to farm the estate himself . Her . Hermance That 's what makes me so anxious . You see , for his mistakes as Court Counsellor the State treasury has to pay  --  they are Imperial-royal mistakes . But his private mistakes on the farm , he must pay for them himself  --  and that will be expensive . Rises . Leo . Leopold Solicitously . Rises . That 's why I wanted to ' tell you of the danger . Perhaps it would be wise to warn aunt . Her . Hermance Crosses , L. C. Perhaps ; but she gets palpitation of the heart at the least fright . Poor woman , she still imagines she can make her husband minister . She 's going this very day to Eger , because Metternich is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her . Hermance Not a bit ; but she has a school friend from Prague , the Baroness Lippski , whose brother is private secretary to Metternich . Leo . Leopold Aha ! I see . Her . Hermance And Baron Lippski 's son has set his eye on Cilli . Leo . Leopold With mastered excitement . And you think her mother encourages ?  --  Her . Hermance Of course ! That secures the Lippskis and through them the Prince , and through the Prince the cabinet place for the Counsellor . Leo . Leopold With sigh . Yes , of course , of course . Her . Hermance Meditatively . Crosses , R. But I do begrudge the girl to that fool Lippski  --  Leo . Leopold Eagerly . Crosses , L. C. He is n't worthy of her  --  indeed , he is n't . Her . Hermance I must try to manage it another way . And I think I know how . Points to the bell rope , L. C. Please ring the bell . LEOPOLD goes and rings bell , C. I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Countess Lori . She knows Metternich and is worth a dozen private secretaries . WENZEL enters , C. Her . Hermance Gives him money . Wenzel , book me a seat in the coach at once . I am going to Eger this afternoon . Wenzel . I 'll see if I can get the seat next to my Lady . She is going to Eger this afternoon , and I have got her a place in the coach . Her . Hermance That would be quite nice , but I prefer to travel in a small carriage . Be particular and get me a seat in the extra post . Crosses to LEOPOLD . WENZEL exits , C. You must know , entre nous , we are loving relations and all that , the Court Counsellor 's wife and I , but I simply ca n't endure her ; she is so full of her Bohemian old-family blood and rank and stuff . I could n't live with these people if I was n't so fond of Cilli . Crosses , R. Leo . Leopold Miss Cilli would reconcile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back to C. O ! You do n't know anything about it . She is a treasure , and for her sake I shall take upon myself the whole affair . The poor girl would suffer most if the family come to want . Back to R. Leo . Leopold Eagerly . Crosses to COUNTESS . If that should happen , I am only a poor devil myself , but  --  Her . Hermance Well , well , it wo n't be so bad , as long as I 'm alive . I 'm the sworn foe of every sort of misery , particularly when it threatens people that I have once taken into my heart , as I have her . Crosses , L. COURT COUNSELLOR , entering from R. U. E. back , with newspaper in his hand , excited . Court Counsellor . The world is going upside down . Here , Leopold , is this correct , that I have just been reading in the " Kreis Blatt " ? Leo . Leopold R. What is it , Uncle ? Coun. Court Counsellor A proposition to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coun. Court Counsellor C. Then , all I have to say is , I do n't understand it . I am no enemy of innovations , when there 's a necessity for them  --  then , in Heaven 's name , yes ! But where is the necessity here ? Leo . Leopold Look at all the accidents that happen at night . Coun. Court Counsellor Hotly . Accidents to whom ? To the dissolute rabble who gad about the streets at all hours ? Let them stay at home , then nothing would happen to them . Am I not right , sister ? Her . Hermance Ironically conceding . Of course . Good citizens can always enjoy themselves rationally by going to bed as soon as it is dark . Coun. Court Counsellor Eagerly agreeing . Yes  --  Then doubting if she really means it . Hum !  --  Breaking off a little angry . One never knows whether you are in earnest or poking fun . At all events , the only man who has any business in the streets at night is the watchman . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . And we do n't need any other lighting . Her . Hermance That settles it . Sits , L. Coun. Court Counsellor Going to LEOPOLD . I trust , Leopold , that you will use your influence with the Magistrate to discourage these pernicious innovations . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Enters , R. U. E. , down C. What innovations ? Coun. Court Counsellor R. C. Contemptuously . Lighting the streets . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor C. Reserved . Ahem ! My dear , I would be guarded in my criticism , if I were you . The Magistrate did not suggest the lighting , it came from a higher quarter . Coun. Court Counsellor Surprised . A higher quarter ! Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Important . And was doubtless due to the fact that His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince Joseph came near meeting with a serious mishap on his last visit . Her . Hermance L. C. Yes , he stepped into a puddle . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor At all events , instructions were given to the governor by the highest authority . Coun. Court Counsellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as we know it in time . I have , thank Heaven , said nothing against it . On the contrary , when the matter is considered from all sides , it is an eminently judicious arrangement . Growing into a passion . The night-watchmen sit in the ale-houses and the public oil is sold for rum . What kind of lighting is that ? Going to LEOPOLD , R. I trust , Leopold , that you will use your influe  --  Stops and breaks off . Well , you understand ? Sits R of table , R. Leo . Leopold On his R. Certainly , Uncle  --  and I wish to take this opportunity of thanking you Crosses to MRS . C. and Aunt for my position as inspector . Coun. Court Counsellor It was quite difficult to get . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor With your unfortunate early career , we had to be very diplomatic . Her . Hermance Yes , you had to pull more strings than usual . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Politely . I beg your pardon , sister-in-law  --  pull strings ! Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? Parrying an objection of MRS . C. Crosses to R. C. To LEOPOLD . Here 's the whole story . Your appointment had to come from the Burggraf , Col. von Ellbogen . With that gentleman your aunt had no personal acquaintance . But she did know Mrs. General Koglovich , for whose seven children she had stood godmother . Mrs. Koglovich did n't know the Graf either , but she did know a Mrs. von Hawlaczck , and Mrs. von Hawlaczck has a sister . Unfortunately the sister was not directly acquainted with the Burggraf , but it appears she had just made a present of an exquisitely illuminated missal to the Bishop of Zaym . The Bishop , when a boy , went to school with the Burggraf , and still sends him every year at Michaelmas a keg of gherkins . Well  --  With the last keg of gherkins went a letter of recommendation in your behalf , in consequence of which you have become Spa-Inspector in Carlsbad . All of which proves that you owe the place , not to anybody 's influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and the Hawlaczcks , the Kogloviches , the sister , the Bishop , the missal and the gherkins , and the Burggraf , Col. von Ellbogen . Courtsies and exits , R. I. E. Coun. Court Counsellor Who has been amused at HERMANCE 'S talk , smiling . Rises and crosses to C. She 's capital , is n't she ? Great fun ! Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor I 'm surprised , Aloys , that you smile at her frivolity . We are loving relations , but I must say I do n't fancy her Vienna spring-chicken way of treating serious subjects ! Coun. Court Counsellor Resuming . Yes , she does go a little far . Especially when she went on the merry-go-round in the Park . Actually perched herself up on a white horse , and went around with a stick full of rings to the music of the hand-organ . Crosses , L. With disapproving shrug of shoulders . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Interrupting . Crosses to R. C. In Prague that would have been simply impossible . Coun. Court Counsellor Changes subject . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Mrs. Counsellor Crosses to LEOPOLD . Oh , yes , Leopold , we have three beautifully furnished rooms on our hands , and we want a lodger . Leo . Leopold Crosses to C. I wish I had known yesterday . A Mr. von Neuhoff , that I knew in Breslau , has just gone to the White Horse Inn , across the way . But there are many people looking for lodgings just now . Coun. Court Counsellor L. C. To MRS . C. By the way , did n't you give Mr. von Radler the refusal last winter ? Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Yes , and he paid a hundred gulden in advance . But then his uncle was living , and a great friend of Lobkowitz , and Radler was likely to become Section-Chief . But they say now that Radler is out with the Governor  --  so it would be extremely imprudent to have anything more to do with him . Coun. Court Counsellor Crosses to C. Sighs . LEOPOLD crosses , C. Lord , Lord , one does n't know which way to turn so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor R. That 's why I wish to rent the rooms as quickly as possible , so we can say to Mr. von Radler : " You did n't come , and we had to let them go . " Coun. Court Counsellor Yes , you can say : " We thought you had made other arrangements  --  awfully sorry , " and so on . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor If he ever gets to be Section-Chief , we can let them to him for next year  --  and get another hundred gulden down . Coun. Court Counsellor And if he does not become Section-Chief , the whole Radler set may be sausage meat , for all we care . Crosses , R. Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor You had better hang a slate on the gate-post as soon as possible . Mercy on me ! I 'm forgetting my journey to Eger . Turns to go up C. Reflecting at the door . Standing still . Perhaps I can learn something about Radler from Baron Lippski . Again doubting . But it may be risky even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd better not say anything . When you suspect that a man is out of favor , you must not even know he exists . Exits quickly back , R. U. E. Coun. Court Counsellor I think I 'll advertise the rooms in the newspaper . Leo . Leopold I 'm going to the printing office ; can I take what you want ? Coun. Court Counsellor You are very good ; just wait a little ; I 'll write it out at once . Turns to go back , R. Considering , speaking to himself . " Three rooms  --  three furnished rooms  --  three elegantly furnished  --  Undecided . Well  --  you wait . I 'll write it out directly . Exits back , R. U. E. WENZEL looks in at C. , then speaking back while he opens the C. door for NEUHOFF . Wenzel . Yes , sir ; he is still here . After NEUHOFF 'S entrance , exits through C. HORST enters . Horst . What ? Is that you ? And in full uniform ! Leo . Leopold Astonished . Neuhoff ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very simple . I was at the government office ; heard you were making a visit at Court Counsellor von Mittersteig 's , and followed . Clapping him on the back . I 'm in great luck . Leo . Leopold How so ? Horst . Because you can introduce me to the family . I hear you are related to the ladies ? Leo . Leopold Already somewhat reserved . Yes  --  that is , related to the wife of the Court Counsellor . Horst . Not believing . His wife ? I 've seen her  --  a young charming creature , with brown hair and grey eyes ? Leo . Leopold Nothing of the sort  --  over fifty  --  she is my aunt . Horst . I do n't mean your aunt , that 's certain . But come , do n't roast me over a slow fire ; out with it at once . Who is the girl with brown hair and grey eyes ? Leo . Leopold Hesitating a little . You probably mean my cousin Cilli . Horst . Cilli ? That sounds better . Cilli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as possible . Leo . Leopold Confused . I ca n't say whether  --  Horst . Oh , I know everything must be regular  --  I must make the acquaintance of the aunt . But there 's no hurry about that  --  I know a whole lot of aunts , but with such a niece as Miss Cilli , every moment 's delay is an irreparable loss , so do n't stand upon ceremony . Leo . Leopold Evading , R. C. But if I tell you , I  --  besides , I do n't know how I can introduce you . Horst . L. C. Do n't know how ? You simply say : " This is my friend , von Neuhoff ; my former Lieutenant in the Prussian service , but now in the Russian ; Major in the Alexander Lancers ; nephew and aide-de-camp of General Suwatscheff . " The rest is my business . Crosses , L. Leo . Leopold It is n't as easy as you think . Crosses to C. Horst . Why not ? Leo . Leopold Trying to get out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horst . My dear fellow , let your aunt alone . Crosses to L. C. Leo . Leopold Then my uncle  --  he 's worse . You see he is Court Counsellor . And these Court officials form a sort of clique . They associate only with themselves , and the military families associate with themselves  --  there is a regular gulf between them . Horst . We 'll get over the gulf . You simply say nothing about my being an officer . Here in Carlsbad I go about as a civilian just in this pikesche . Leo . Leopold Shakes his hand . Embarrassed . I 'm afraid  --  Crosses , L. Horst . Severely . The fact is you do n't want to  --  you are cock of the walk here yourself , I suppose ? Leo . Leopold Neuhoff , I swear to you  --  Horst . Interrupting . Do n't trouble yourself . Under such circumstances , I would n't believe my own oath , much less anybody else 's . The main thing is  --  I ca n't count on you ? Leo . Leopold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , I shall only have to think out a little scheme for myself . Leo . Leopold Irritated . What do you want , anyhow ? Horst . I want to get into this house . And I shall . You can tell all the stones you like about me  --  say I am no end of a rascal . Do n't restrain yourself . At school I was always a dunce , I admit . Never did anything except idle while the war lasted . Been idle ever since . But , as regards lovely woman , my boy , I do n't let the grass grow under my feet when one of them pleases me , and you know it . Becoming more and more ardent . I ca n't rest till I have told her : " By all the stars above us ! "  --  and so forth . " And may I never speak , if it is n't true ! "  --  and so on for ten minutes at a time without stopping to take breath . Then dryly . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly . Right about , face ! I say to myself : " You have done your duty by HER  --  now for the next one ! " Goes to door , turns around again . That 's the way I do it , and that 's the way I 'll do it here . Remember  --  I 'm to think out a little scheme for myself , so much the worse for you . Exits C. Leo . Leopold Crosses , R. After he has stood for a moment , he braces himself up . Then I must think out a little scheme for myself ? CILLI , entering from R. back , sits R. of table , L. Cilli . Cousin , papa is asking for you . Leo . Leopold Remembering . Ah , yes  --  yes , I 'm coming . Crosses up C. About to go back R. , stands hesitating and then turns again to CILLI . I wanted to ask you  --  do you go out much here in Carlsbad ? I mean  --  to concerts , and balls , and so on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me with her  --  and papa and mamma prefer to remain at home in the evenings . Leo . Leopold Eagerly . That is right  --  you remain at home with them . Cilli . But , it 's nicest in the evenings , especially on the Promenade . Leo . Leopold Yes , but when one is as young as you , cousin , and so very charming  --  Frightened , correcting himself quickly . I mean such charming festivities are given here that it 's really dangerous . Cilli . Incredulous . Nonsense ! Leo . Leopold Eagerly . Oh , yes , it is , especially this year , there are so many officers about , and they are very destructive  --  even in a pikesche . Cilli . Nave , anxiously Are they ? Leo . Leopold Yes ; their profession gives them a certain boldness  --  I know some of them ; there is one in particular  --  what 's his name ? Emphasis . Oh , yes , Neuhoff . Nothing is sacred to that fellow . Cilli . Why not ? Rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he swears : " By all the stars , " and so forth and so on , for ten minutes together without stopping to take breath  --  and then runs after another . Crosses , R. Cilli . Somewhat intimidated . I shall be afraid to trust myself away from the door . Leo . Leopold Back to CILLI . Yes , do n't stir out  --  at least not without a protector . Cilli . Reflecting . Oh , papa is no good  --  Sits . Hesitating.  --  It must be a relative , must n't it ? Leo . Leopold Eagerly . Of course , that 's indispensable . Cilli . Unfortunately , you have n't any time , I suppose , cousin ? Leo . Leopold Eagerly . CILLI rises . On the contrary , I 'll find all the time you want , for you will be safe with me . Cilli . Frankly . Oh , I believe that . Leo . Leopold I should consider it a sacred duty . Cilli . And I should feel so much confidence . Offers her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both his own and growing more and more ardent . And you may , my dear  --  my  --  From expression of reverence gradually going over to a tone of affection . My darling cousin . Cilli . Leaving her hand in his , looking into his eyes , true-hearted , softly . Dear cousin ! Both remain hand in hand during a slight pause , until they separate quickly on hearing the steps of the COUNSELLOR . COUNSELLOR , sticking his head in the door , R. , back . Counsellor . Well , Leopold , are you coming ? Withdraws again . Leo . Leopold Right away , uncle . Exits quickly , R. U. E. , back . WENZEL enters C. , leaving the door open  --  HORST appears behind him . Wenzel . Has your Grace lost anything ? There is a gentleman here has found it . Cilli . Surprised . Something of mine ? HORST , C. , steps forward quickly before WENZEL with a package wrapped up in tissue paper . Horst . Yes , gracious lady , I was so fortunate ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to continue an acquaintance commenced at such a distance . Cilli . Astonished . Acquaintance ? Horst . I had the pleasure of seeing you last night in the theatre , and of being noticed by you . Cilli . Surprised . I was not aware of it . Horst . Oh , oh , mademoiselle , that is hard ! I do n't wish to be indiscreet and assert that I enjoyed your preference the whole evening , but you surely looked over at me now and then ? Cilli . More and more astonished . I looked over at you  --  where ? Horst . In the box  --  just opposite yours  --  at the theatre . Cilli . Comprehending ; laughing . Crosses , R. Oh , I understand ! Well , I admit that I did stare at that box all the evening . Horst . Now , you see ? Crosses to CILLI . Cilli . But , pardon me , that had nothing to do with you . Horst . With whom , then ? There was nobody in it with me except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming toward HORST . Ah , yes , but that very old gentleman was Goethe ! Horst . Struck . Oh , was it ? Goethe ? Well , now , it did seem queer that the whole audience flattered me with their attention . I remember thinking I had grown mighty interesting all of a sudden . Going , L. But I fancied it might be one of my good days , you know . Back to C. Cilli . I am very sorry to undeceive you in this manner  --  Horst . Back to CILLI . Yes , it is bitter . But , it was n't all deception . If you did n't look at me , I was looking at you the whole evening  --  no mistake about that . Cilli . Simply , without coquetry . I am riot so sure  --  I was not alone , either . Horst . That 's a fact ! The lady with you was charming , too . But I beg you to believe that you and you alone  --  Cilli . Cutting him off . I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Horst . Yes : I tried to get near you after the performance , but the crowd was so great , and when I got over , your box was empty , and I found this little trifle by the door . Has , with that , taken from the paper a lace handkerchief , and now offers it to her . I got your address from the box-keeper , and now I take the liberty  --  Cilli . Has meantime examined the handkerchief . But this does n't belong to me  --  nor to Manni , either . Horst . Why , what a pity ! It would have been such a pleasure to be able to render this slight service  --  Cilli . Gives him back the handkerchief . Yes , I am very sorry that you have had all the trouble for nothing . Both holding handkerchief . Horst . Not for nothing  --  that litttle handkerchief has gained me an introduction to your charming presence . My name is Neuhoff . Cilli . Startled . Crosses , R. Neuhoff ? Horst . Horst von Neuhoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my Cousin Leopold ? Horst . Why , of course , my old friend Leopold  --  is he your cousin ? Then we are friends already . Makes a step towards her and tries to take her hand . Cilli . Anxiously drawing back . Oh , no , Mr. von Neuhoff , I beg  --  you must not imagine  --  as I said , the handkerchief does n't belong to me  --  and I did n't look over at you . And besides , my parents live so retired . Going up , R. Horst . So I heard  --  but you ? Cilli . As above . And I live  --  retired , too  --  and I would n't like to make any new acquaintances , so you must  --  excuse me . Has during her last words withdrawn toward the door , back , R. , and now exits quickly , R. U. E. Horst . Going , R. Looks after her for a moment astonished , then with comic resignation . No surrender ? Very well . Making military turn . Right about , face ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listens as he hears the first words of HERMANCE , who is coming in . HERMANCE , in entering down R. 1 E. , to ROSA , who follows her . Hermance . Tell the postilion he must take care of the boxes for me ; there are some very precious things in them . ROSA enters from R. 1 . E. , front , with boxes and hand luggage . Horst . Peeping at the COUNTESS . By Jove ! The other one ! Her . Hermance Holds ROSA , who is about to pass before her , for a moment , and attentively glances over the different packages , her face in HORST 'S direction without seeing him . Wait a little . Have we got everything ? Examining each separate package , and murmuring half aloud to herself . The bag , the hat , the umbrella , the pompadour  --  Feeling it from outside . Are the sugar-plums in it ? Yes  --  Horst . Has meantime observed HERMANCE attentively , during her murmurs aside . She is charming . Has half turned away and hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still holds in his hand  --  during this , aside . Far more charming than the other . Her . Hermance As she finishes her examination , to ROSA . Now , then , go along . ROSA exits , C. Taking a step toward back , sees HORST with slight astonishment . Horst . Going to her . Gracious lady , I humbly beg your pardon : I was just about to ask the honor of being announced  --  Mr. von Neuhoff . Introducing himself . I had the good fortune to find a trifle that you lost yesterday . Her . Hermance Have I lost something again ? But that 's not astonishing  --  I lose all my things . Horst . Pray , believe me , it is a special happiness to be able to render you  --  you particularly , this slight service . Offers her package . Her . Hermance That is very kind , indeed , of you , Mr. von Neuhoff . I have to thank you many , many times . But what is it ? Crosses , L. C. Unwraps package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't belong to me . Horst . Pretending to be astonished . Is it possible ? I would have taken an oath  --  not if it was lying directly under your seat in the box  --  ? I had the pleasure of seeing you in the theatre last night . I do n't know whether I dare flatter myself that YOU observed me . Her . Hermance Smiling . No , I did n't . Horst . We were sitting directly opposite  --  Goethe and myself . Her . Hermance Yes , but if you will sit beside GOETHE you must n't be surprised if nobody sees you . Crosses , R. You could n't have chosen a more disadvantageous position . Horst . Crosses , L. And I 'll never do it again . Once beside Goethe is enough for me . Her . Hermance Has meantime looked at handkerchief again . Perhaps this handkerchief belongs to Cilli . I 'll go at once and ask . Turns to go up R. C. Horst . Frightened . Going toward her . No , I beg  --  do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hermance With slight suspicion . Oh ! Horst . At all events , I am grateful for the chance that permits me to present myself , especially if I dare hope that this meeting will not be the last . Her . Hermance Seeing through him , aside . Aha  --  the rogue ! That 's the corner the wind blows from . Well  --  just wait . Crosses , L. Very friendly . Wo n't you be seated , Mr. von Neuhoff ? Sits , and motions him to chair . Horst . Crosses , R. Thanks ! As he is going to chair , R. , aside , delighted . She surrenders , and I camp on the field of battle ! Her . Hermance Leaning back comfortably in arm-chair , L. , in one hand the handkerchief and in the other the paper , glancing over roguishly to HORST . Do you know , this is quite a coincidence ? Sits . As I said , I am always losing something  --  and there are people again intentional emphasis who have quite a special luck in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never lost . Horst . Unsuspecting . Yes , just so ; you mean pickpockets and other rogues ? Her . Hermance Double-meaning , very friendly . Yes , especially other rogues . Now , as regards this handkerchief , we will do a little detective work and find the real owner . Horst . Cheerfully . Yes , do . Her . Hermance It does not belong to me  --  that 's positive . And you say it does n't belong to Cilli . With peculiar inflection . Horst . Becoming confused . Yes , but then how did it come in your box ? Her . Hermance Artfully . That I do n't know . With changed tone . Rises , goes C. But I can tell you quite positively how it came into your hands . Horst . Can you ? Coolly . Rises . I am really curious . Her . Hermance Aside , observing him with laughing nods of the head . The rascal ! He puts a bold face on it , though he knows he is trapped . I like that . Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . Come here . You see that drygoods shop across yonder ? You bought the handkerchief there yourself . Horst . You surely do n't believe  --  Her . Hermance With droll force . Stop ! Do n't go in any deeper . Crosses , C. Holding the tissue paper up before his eyes . Going , C. Look there , do you see that fine print ? Reading . " Thomas Brothers &; Thomas , dry goods , Branch from Vienna , No. 17 , Old Meadow , Carlsbad . " Horst . With comic despair . Oh , well , when a person has eyes for fine print like that , there is nothing more to be done . Crosses , R. Her . Hermance Smiling at him triumphantly . No , there is absolutely nothing more to be done . Here ! Gives it up , laughing . Horst . Plucking up . Well , I am glad anyway you think it funny . Crosses , L. Her . Hermance With lightly marked double meaning . It 's not worth the trouble to take seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete absolution ? Her . Hermance As far as Horst . Believe me , I  --  Her . Hermance But you do n't get off without penance . Wraps the handkerchief in paper and gives him the package again . There , take your handkerchief , carry it carefully across the street again , and say , " Please , Thomas Brothers , it was no good ; give me back my two gulden eighteen kreutzer . " Pointing to package . That 's the price marked in plain figures . It was a cheap scheme . Horst . Comically abashed . And what am I to do after that ? Her . Hermance Continuing . You must present the two gulden eighteen kreutzer to the first beggar you see , and be sure that it 's a woman . The men , even when they are beggars , are the same deceivers ever . Crosses , R. Horst . L. C. Sticking the package in his breast pocket , but with genuine ardor . I do n't give back this handkerchief for a million gulden . Hastily . But every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermance That 's right . Good-bye ! Horst . Of course , I shall have to report to you to-morrow and the day after ? Her . Hermance Laughing . No , no , you need n't give yourself the trouble . Crosses , L. Amiable , but somewhat decided . I believe , Mr. von Neuhoff , that everything is settled between us and we can bid each other adieu ! Horst . Countess , my lips would n't permit anything stronger than an au revoir to pass them . Her . Hermance With comic astonishment . What ? You have the courage to try again  --  after the way things have gone with you to-day ? Horst . Again frivolous . After the way things have gone with me ? Well , yes , you caught me , and I got a bit of a set-back . But that does n't last long with me  --  all I have to do is to think out another little scheme , that 's all . Her . Hermance Laughing . Another scheme ? You wish to pique my curiosity  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave-taking gesture . At all events , what do you say now ? Enter , WENZEL . Horst . With bow I say , au revoir ! She bows . Up , C. Goes to chair , R. , back , where he has laid his hat and gloves . Wenzel . Enters , C. Your Grace  --  Notices that the Countess is not alone , is about to retire , excusing himself . I beg pardon  --  Her . Hermance Come in , Wenzel  --  what do you want ? Wen . Wenzel I only wanted to say that all the seats in the Extra Post were booked before I got there . Her . Hermance Then I ca n't go until to-morrow . Wen . Wenzel Oh , yes , your Grace can still go to-day . HORST becomes attentive at this cue , loiters intentionally over his hat and gloves , and listens to the further conversation . Her . Hermance Indeed , how so ? Wen . Wenzel The Post-keeper has ordered a two-seated carriage . Here is the ticket for one seat in it . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he listens to report of WENZEL , intentionally loud . Crosses , L. C. Then there is a second seat in the carriage not yet taken ? Wen . Wenzel Yes , Countess . Her Hermance That 's all right . Will exit , R. , comes thereby near NEUHOFF and acts as if she had just noticed that he was still there . Ah , Mr. von Neuhoff , you are still here . Horst . Playing the ingenuous . Down , C. Yes , I could n't find my gloves  --  but now I really take my leave  --  Her . Hermance Teasing . Are you still thinking out another little scheme ? Horst . Oh , yes , another and a better , as you will see very shortly . With bow , exits quickly , C. WENZEL , who has also intended to go , but could n't , because HORST was standing in the door , will now follow him . Her . Hermance Crosses , L. Takes step quickly and holds WENZEL back by the coat-tails , calling to him softly . Wenzel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen  --  when you go out that gentleman will be waiting for you . He 'll press a few gulden into your hand and tell you to run over to the Post and secure the other seat in my carriage . Wen . Wenzel Shall I do it ? Her . Hermance Of course  --  You would n't rob the poor man of that comfort . Crosses , L. COUNSELLOR enters from R. , back , with a small paper slate in his hand , which he gives to WENZEL , who is going out . Counsellor . Eagerly . Wenzel , hang this slate on the gate at once . Down , C. WENZEL exits , C. To HERMANCE . Leopold has already gone with the advertisement , so if luck is good I can rent the rooms before my wife gets back from Eger . I want to do it while she 's away , she does pick out such insipid people . Her . Hermance Looking at for watch . Is she ready for the journey ? Coun. Court Counsellor I do n't know  --  this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fancy one of her fellow-passengers . Her . Hermance Which one ? Coun. Court Counsellor I do n't know . I only heard her say , " I 'd like to know what she 's going to Eger for just when I am , " Crosses up L. C. Her . Hermance Laughing out . Oh , that 's it . Cilli . Quickly back from R. U. E. Manni , are you ready ? The coach goes at twelve . Her . Hermance All right ; get my things , quick . I 'm coming at once . Crosses , R. CILLI exits , R. 1 . E. , forward . Coun. Court Counsellor Startled . Goes , C. What , are you going to Eger , too ? Her . Hermance Of course  --  I 'm the objectionable fellow-passenger . Back to C. Coun. Court Counsellor Helplessly . What a blunderer I am ! I beg a thousand pardons . Her . Hermance Laughing . Oh , it 's of no consequence , I assure you . ROSA enters , C. Rosa . Please , Mr. Counsellor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asking about the rooms . Coun. Court Counsellor Let him come right up . Where is Wenzel ? Rosa . I believe he was sent to the Post . Exits , C. Countess . Aside . So ? The bait took . Coun. Court Counsellor Pleased . We 've hooked a fish already . Her . Hermance I do hope it is a suitable party . Turns to door , R. Now , I 'm going to ease your wife 's mind about her fellow-passenger . Coun. Court Counsellor Anxiously . Do n't say anything to her about what I blurted out , will you ? Her . Hermance Back to COUNSELLOR . Have no fear  --  entrenous . I object to travelling with her as much as she does with me . Coun. Court Counsellor Involuntarily laughing out . Ha-ha-ha ! Controlling himself quickly . How is it that with the profoundest desire to stand well with everybody and twisting extremes all the while , one does make such infernal faux pas at times ? Her . Hermance Interrupting , lightly copying him . It is because gymnastic diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist and turn so much  --  try to walk straight . I know it 's not politics , but it 's honesty , and honesty always pays best in the end . Exits , R. 1 . E. Rosa . Appearing in C. door . Here 's the gentleman , sir . Lets HORST pass by her and enter C. , then exits . Coun. Court Counsellor Going to meet HORST . Walk in . Horst . Quick through C. If you will pardon the liberty . Coun. Court Counsellor Certainly . With whom have I the honor ? Horst . About to introduce himself , coming down , C. I am . Stops , searching more cautiously . First , let me ask , have you ever heard the name of Neuhoff ? No ? Coun. Court Counsellor Meditating . Neuhoff ? Horst . Has nobody ever said anything  --  here  --  in your house about a Mr. von Neuhoff ? Coun. Court Counsellor No . Horst . Breathing relieved . My reason for asking is  --  I am Mr. von Neuhoff . Coun. Court Counsellor Very good  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The situation suits me exactly . They sit , R. Coun. Court Counsellor There are three . L. Horst . Three ? Just what I was looking for . Coun. Court Counsellor Not in the front  --  they are in the rear , over the garden . Horst . Rapturously . The garden ! The very thing  --  over the garden ! Coun. Court Counsellor Perhaps you would like to look at them . Horst . No , it is perfectly immaterial  --  Correcting himself . I mean the rooms are not the most important thing in a residence . To me the people count for much more . Coun. Court Counsellor Very proper . Horst . And in that respect , I must say , that the first impression With bow to COUNSELLOR . Rises. is extremely encouraging . Coun. Court Counsellor Thanks , thanks , it 's mutual . Rises . Horst . Sits . Drawing near , C. You see , to be perfectly frank , I have no taste for excitement , for carousal , for the mad fever of the gaming table , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giddy throng . What I am looking for is a home with a quiet family . Coun. Court Counsellor We are as quiet as mice . My wife and I , of course , are not entirely alone . Horst . Oh , well , if there are merely a few younger members of the family  --  sons or daughters or relations , I do n't care which  --  I should probably soon become attached to them . I hope I 'm not too effusive , but to tell you the truth , I 'm a regular tame cat for a family fireside . Coun. Court Counsellor Rises . Mr. von Neuhoff , such sentiments do you honor . A young man like you is a treat nowadays . Horst . Turning away with assumed modesty . You are too good . Rises , R. C. Coun. Court Counsellor Confidingly . Rises to L. C. I tell you what it is , if you take the rooms I should gain a little private advantage . You see , very often in the evenings I like to go for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't leave my family all alone at home . Now , if you were in the house  --  with your domestic habits  --  Horst . You could go out every evening and stay as late as you please . I should simply sit up with the wife and the children . If the wife wished to retire early I would n't mind sitting up with the children as late as they wished . Coun. Court Counsellor Young man , you were made for our home . I can only say we have missed you . Horst . Then I can have the rooms ? Your hand on it . Offers him his hand . Coun. Court Counsellor Shaking hands . With hand and word and open arms . Opening his arms to him . Horst . Embrace . I feel already that you are more than a parent . HERMANCE , ready for journey , enters , R. 1 . E. , forward , at sight of group , astonished . Hermance . What 's all this ? Coun. Court Counsellor Crosses , R. , loosening himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to present Mr. von Neuhoff . NEUHOFF crosses , L. Her . Hermance Aside . Back already .

Points to L. Her . Hermance To HORST . What ? You going to live here ? Coun. Court Counsellor Continuing . I tell you he fits into our home as if the angels had brought him . Her . Hermance What kind of angels ! Coun. Court Counsellor Oh , everything is settled . I 'll draw the papers . Goes in background and takes from an tagre writing materials , pen and paper , going up R. Horst . Do . Her . Hermance Going to NEUHOFF . So this is your little scheme ? Horst . Nodding with self-satisfaction . Yes . Clever , is n't it ? Her . Hermance Likewise smiling ironically . Very clever . With changed tone , loud . Only it 's a pity that nothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coun. Court Counsellor Crossing at same time forward with writing materials . What 's that  --  nothing come of it ? Her . Hermance You forget what your wife said . Horst . Eagerly . Am I too late ? Has she let the rooms already ? Her . Hermance No , the rooms are not let  --  and you have not come too late  --  but too soon , much too soon  --  several years too soon , in fact . The trouble is that you are too young just at present . Drop in when you are sixty . Horst . But , my dear madame  --  Her . Hermance Decidedly . To COUNSELLOR . Your wife said expressly old gentlemen or nobody . Horst . But I am not so young . Her . Hermance Yes , but you are not old . Turns to COUNSELLOR . Frankly , I am surprised that you overlooked  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Abashed . Well , yes , it 's true , I did forget  --  yes , you are a little young yet . Crosses to NEUHOFF . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Mr. von Neuhoff , but you see , there are others to consult . Shrugs his shoulders and goes up back with writing things to tagre , then exits , R. U. E. Horst . Comically resigned , crosses L , then to C. It 's too bad . I had the thing arranged so beautifully . Well , all right , I 'll have to think of another little scheme . Her . Hermance Significantly . I 've thought of something . Horst . Astonished . You ? Her . Hermance Yes , a surprise  --  you will be delighted . WENZEL enters C. with ticket in his hand . Wenzel . To HORST . Here is the ticket for the se  --  Down C. , crosses L. Horst . Snatches the ticket from him and cuts off his word . Sh ! Her .

Crosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WENZEL exits R. , forward . Horst . Playing the astonished . You 're not going away , Countess ? Her . Hermance Playing him . Yes , I 'm going to Eger by the Post . Horst . Same . To Eger  --  what a coincidence ! I am going there too . Her . Hermance Just look at that now  --  what a thing chance is ! How are you going ? in the coach or by " Extra Post ? " Horst . Acting as if it were perfectly indifferent to him . The fact is I do n't know . Feels in the different pockets for the ticket . Where did I put it ? Drawing out ticket . Ah , here is the ticket . Reading out . By " Extra Post "  --  only two seats , and I 've got one . Down L. Her . Hermance Indeed ! And do you know who has got the other ? Horst . Apparently unconcerned . No , who ? Her . Hermance My sister-in-law . Horst . Innocently . Mrs. Counsellor  --  why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hermance Oh , no , I ride in the coach . Horst . Eagerly . Why , then , I 'm going in the coach . Her . Hermance Sorry , the seats are all taken . Horst . Comically crestfallen . Going to her . But consider  --  I ca n't  --  six hours to Eger with an old lady  --  I  --  I 'm too young  --  you said so yourself  --  an old gentleman or nobody . Her . Hermance Oh , that is in furnished rooms , not in Post coaches . She rather likes a young man there . Going to MRS . COUNSELLOR , who enters R. U. E. Is n't it so , dear ? Presenting . This is Mr. von Neuhoff , your travelling companion . Crosses , R. MRS . COUNSELLOR has entered from R. , back , in travelling dress , pompadour in hand , in act of putting on her gloves . Following her appears the COUNSELLOR with two pillows and all sorts of hand luggage . Mrs. Counsellor . With somewhat affected friendliness . Ah , my travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gives him her pompadour while she puts on her gloves . Will you be so kind  --  Horst . With sour face taking the pompadour . Why , certainly  --  Mrs. Counsellor . Flattered . My sister told me how much trouble you gave yourself to get the seat next mine . You even sent Wenzel to the Post . Turns to COUNSELLOR to call his attention to some of the packages . Horst . Crosses to R. To HERMANCE , softly , full of reproach . And you knew about that ? Her . Hermance Nodding . Yes , and so I changed with her at the last moment . Horst . Will fly into passion . Well , I call that  --  Her . Hermance Putting in the word for him . A surprise  --  eh ? You see that 's the little scheme I thought out , and my scheme worked . Bye-bye ! MRS . COUNSELLOR takes pillows and hand luggage from COUNSELLOR and piles them in HORST 'S arms and goes to door as curtain falls . WENZEL and ROSA appear in the door with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn .

DISCOVERED .  --  CILLI stands at window , dreamily looking down into the street , suddenly makes joyous movement as if she sees some one ; hurries away from the window ; in passing throws a glance at herself in the mirror , then sits , R. , and begins zealously to stitch her embroidery . After a short pause , a knock is heard at C. door . CILLI crosses R. , sits R. of table . Cilli Quickly . Come in . Another knock , somewhat impatient . Come in . Leopold . Appears at C. door . May I venture ? Cilli . Acting quite ingenuously . Oh , is that you , cousin ? Leo . Leopold Still at the door . Yes , but I 'm afraid of disturbing  --  Cilli . No , no ; come in . Leo . Leopold Coming forward , sits L. of table , R. I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carlsbad . Cilli . Who will it be ? Leo .

Cilli . Ah , if I could only see something of it . Leo . Leopold You shall see it all . I will get a seat for you on the Johannes bridge  --  that 's where the official reception is to take place . And Prince Metternich may come over from Eger . And in the evenings the whole town is to be illuminated and we are to have fireworks and a grand ball , and you are going to the ball . Cilli . That will be lovely . And will you be there , too ? Leo . Leopold Of course , I always go where there 's dancing . Cilli . Navely . Oh , how fortunate we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo . Leopold Taking her hand cordially . It was the happiest day of my life . Cilli . I hope mamma will be back from Eger , and Manni . Otherwise , papa wo n't let me go . Leo .

Yes , that was the regimental ball and do n't count . Rises . I had a young baron for partner and he spoilt my whole evening . Oh , he was so tiresome . Crosses , L. C. Precociously . Now , DO you think it right , when you meet a young lady for the first time to begin to talk about love at once ? Leo . Leopold Jealously . He did that ? Rises . With sudden passion , crosses to C.

Leopold Oh , she must manage some way to let him see she cares for him . Cilli . Astonished . Before she knows whether he cares for her ? Leo . Leopold Becoming somewhat nervous . Well , he ca n't let her know that till she lets him know  --  Cilli . Likewise somewhat excited . But that would make her have to speak first . Leo . Leopold Oh , I do n't ask that  --  far from it ! Crosses , R. Cilli . Working herself up . Then , what do you ask ?

Well , there 's no need to be violent about it . Leo . Leopold I 'm only distressed because you wo n't understand how a man ca n't run around after girls and have them laughing in his face . Cilli . Angry . Walking up and down C. Oh , nonsense ! Leo . Leopold Likewise . He 'd rather drown himself before he 'd open his mouth . Cilli . Crossing , L. Then let him , and serve him right .

Perhaps you 've found another party for the rooms . Since day before yesterday you have come here with a cock-and-bull story about half a dozen parties , and not one of them has come yet . Leo . Leopold Crosses to COUNSELLOR . I am very sorry , uncle ; I have really taken all possible pains . Frankly . Besides , I do assure you that my whole future happiness depends upon proving my gratitude and esteem to you . Coun. Court Counsellor Quickly changed over . Yes , yes , I know that . You have your faults , and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , you are a thoroughly good fellow . I am very fond of you . With sudden upswelling anger . I do n't understand , Cilli , why you are always quarrelling with him  --  Leo . Leopold Pacifying . But , uncle  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Again pacified . Between relations such a thing ought never to happen . There , give him your hand  --  Puts their hands together  --  and make up again . It 's all right now , is n't it ? Looking from one to the other . Cilli . Holding LEOPOLD 'S hand . Yes , papa . Leo . Leopold Likewise . Certainly , uncle . Coun. Court Counsellor And now I am going back to my coffee . Goes to bell and rings . To CILLI . Have you had your buttermilk ? Cilli . No , papa , not yet . Crosses , R. Coun. Court Counsellor Crosses to door , R. Why have n't you ? The doctor ordered it every day punctually . Banging open the door , front R. , and calling within . Rosa ! To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it regularly , it wo n't do you a bit of good . ROSA appears in door , R. I. E. , front . Rosa , why has n't my daughter had her buttermilk ? WENZEL appears , C. Rosa . I thought Wenzel  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Scolding . C. You thought ! You thought ! Always the way . " Wenzel . " Nonsense ! One shoves it on to the other . Turning up his coat collar and shivering . Gracious , why do n't you shut the doors ? ROSA and WENZEL enter and close the door . There 's a diabolical draught in this house and I simply ca n't stand it , with my rheumatism . As to the buttermilk , I hold you both responsible . Bring it punctually and stand there till she has drunk it  --  whether she wants it or not . ROSA exits , and WENZEL through C. Cilli . Smiling . Why , papa  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Yes , yes , I know you . You do n't want to take anything . As for you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms  --  they are let already and occupied now . Leo . Leopold By whom ? Coun. Court Counsellor By a Russian general ; probably come to Carlsbad to pay his court to the Empress . After a pause . Suwatscheff , that 's his name . Leo . Leopold Anxiously . General Suwatscheff ! That 's the uncle of Mr. von Neuhoff ? Coun. Court Counsellor Yes ; Mr. Neuhoff brought him this morning . Leo . Leopold But I thought Mr. von Neuhoff went to Eger with aunt ? Coun. Court Counsellor Scratches his chin . No , he only went as far as the first stop . There it suddenly occurred to him that he expected his uncle . So he came back hot foot and engaged our rooms for him . Leo . Leopold Indeed ! Suspiciously . That is quite remarkable . Cilli . With a glance of understanding at LEOPOLD . Yes , I think so , too . Coun. Court Counsellor I am mighty glad that I found a lodger before mamma 's return  --  and such a charming man as this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce you at once as a member of the family . Knocks at L. , front . Leo Leopold Holding back . Perhaps he is not in ? Or not up ? Coun. Court Counsellor Oh , yes , he must be . Exits , L. , front . Leo . Leopold Hurriedly whispering to CILLI as he goes . I must speak with you about that Mr. Neuhoff again . Exits , L. , front . Cilli . Crosses , R. , calling after him . Yes , we must speak about that . HORST enters , C. , a rose in his hand . Horst . Miss Cilli , I have the honor to wish you good evening ! Cilli . Cool , pointing to L. Good evening ! Your uncle is in his room . Horst . May I ask how you are , and how is your papa ? Cilli . As before . Thanks ! Papa is also in there , with your uncle . Horst . Crosses , L. , back to CILLI . Then the two gentlemen can entertain each other  --  and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the liberty ? Offers her the rose . Cilli . Stiffly leaning back . Crosses , L. C. I must thank you , Mr. Neuhoff ; I told you this morning and this afternoon not to bring me any more flowers . Horst . Going to CILLI . Good heavens , Miss Cilli ! Why treat me in this way ? I confess , the manner of my first approach was displeasing , but you can at least forgive a little thing like that  --  Cilli . I do n't know that my forgiveness can matter much to you . Horst . Pardon me , it matters very much ; now that my uncle lives here I must go in and out . Cilli . Yes , you do go in and out very much . Horst . Then , of course , I must stand well with all the members of the household , for we shall be continually meeting one another . Cilli . These meetings can be avoided . Takes from a drawer quite a large key . There is another entrance to your uncle 's rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , L. , by which HORST is standing . Here is the key to the garden gate . Crosses , R. Horst . Crosses , L. , sits at table . Oh , no ; that would spoil all my plans . I have n't brought my uncle here and got in with your papa , heart and soul , to be told all of a sudden to get out . No , Miss Cilli , I ca n't submit to that . Sits , front . I really can not . Cilli . You surely will not force me to tell papa my reasons , will you ? Horst . With droll affability . Your reasons ? You allude to that stupid affair about the handkerchief ? That is no reason . The real reason is something very different . Rises , to L. C. I 've seen that for some time . Somebody else is at the bottom of it and wants to put me out  --  I do n't know why . Perhaps out of envy  --  or is it jealousy ? CILLI at the word jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to her gently . Yes , I 'm afraid it 's jealousy . I might have guessed it at once . A young girl is never seriously annoyed with one person unless she is seriously fond of another . Cilli . Trying to speak again . Mr. von Neuhoff  --  Horst . Interrupting superiorly . And if I only knew who the other one was you should not turn poor Neuhoff out of the house so easily . LEOPOLD enters , L. , forward , as he sees NEUHOFF going to him quickly . Leopold . My dear Neuhoff  --  let me be frank and explicit with you  --  your continual coming to this house is impossible  --  Horst . Astonished . What 's that ? Leo . Leopold Quickly continuing . If you must go in and out on your uncle 's account be good enough to use the garden door . Going to the drawer from which CILLI has taken the key . Here is the key . Crosses to table . Horst . Thank you . Holding up the key . I 've got it already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is  --  the other ? Going to CILLI and putting key on table . Miss Cilli , here is your key . I prefer the front door . Cilli . Turns away , vexed . Oh , dear ! Going toward door , R. Horst . Crosses to LEOPOLD . Let me be frank and explicit with you , my boy  --  it is not at all nice of you to treat an old comrade like this . Leo . Leopold What else can you expect ? Horst . Interrupting . Where is your gratitude ? What did I do for you that time in Breslau ? Leo . Leopold Yes , that is true . Horst . Did n't I take care of you like a good Samaritan ? Cilli . Crosses to HORST . Sympathetic , to LEOPOLD . Why , cousin , were you ill ? Horst . To CILLI . Not exactly that  --  but he sprained his hand . For three days he carried his arm in a sling and I made the bandages , buttered his bread and wrote his letters . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the dear soul , whose heart was yearning for you , should n't go a day without news . Leo . Leopold Heartily . Yes , and she often told me how much your letters consoled her . Horst . And did n't I picture your love and tenderness  --  how you longed for her and sent her thousands of kisses , blotted with tears . To CILLI . I 've never written more beautiful letters for myself . Cilli . R. Piqued , trying to struggle with her jealousy , sits L. of table . Well , I do n't see anything so strange in one friend writing love letters for another  --  Leo . Leopold Crosses to CILLI . Interrupting . Why , it was n't  --  Cilli . Repulsing him . Rises . Of course , it 's none of my business . But I do n't think much of your patriotic enthusiasm , when you only went to Breslau to carry on a love affair . Leo . Leopold Noticing her jealousy with joyous excitement . And would that make you angry ? Cilli . Struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry you would n't have sprained your hand , crosses , C. , and you could have written to your sweetheart from there just as well . Up C. Horst . Sweetheart ! Why , the innocent never had a sweetheart . Leo . Leopold Interrupting , assenting . Never . Cilli . Astonished . But the letters ? Horst . They were to his mother . Cilli . Glad . Down to LEOPOLD . Your mother ? Leo . Leopold Of course , to my mother . Horst . Superiorly . Yes . Going to CILLI , who has turned away . A load has fallen from somebody 's heart  --  eh ? Cilli . Confused . Mr. von Neuhoff , you certainly do n't imagine  --  Horst . Crosses up C. to R. I imagine nothing at all . But just peep there once  --  Turns her with light touch towards the mirror that is on the wall , L.  --  in the mirror . With humor . Have you ever seen a prettier color than those blushes ? Cilli . Breaking away from him , putting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down R. Oh , you ! Horst . Going to LEOPOLD , poking him in side . Well , old boy , am I a friend or not ? Leo . Leopold Seizing both his hands and shaking them softly . You are . But please  --  entreating  --  go away now . Horst . Confidentially . I 'll keep the old gentlemen in there . Goes quickly to door , R. , forward , then with a glance at the two , with a sigh of comic envy and singing softly . " There 's nothing half so sweet in life As love 's young dream ! " Exits quickly . Leo . Leopold Going to CILLI , in voice trembling from emotion , half loud . Miss Cilli  --  dear Cilli  --  now I can speak . Cilli . Rises . Has turned full to him , navely . But I have n't given any indications , have I ? Sits , L. of table . Leo . Leopold Taking her hands , overjoyed . No , no , but I guessed it . Drawing her gently to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face on his breast . I knew it yesterday . Leo . Leopold Presses her head on his breast tenderly . My darling ! Kisses her forehead , smooths her hair and hand , and then tries to embrace her . Cilli . After a slight pause , raising her face to him , disheartened . Well , you are not speaking , even now  --  Leo . Leopold Letting her loose and stepping back a bit . That 's because my heart is so full  --  so full of happiness  --  I ca n't tell one-half of what 's in it . Cilli . It 's just the same with me . With both hands clasping her throat . I feel it beating up here . ROSA , enters from forward with a salver on which is a glass of buttermilk , down L. C. to table . Rosa . Here 's the buttermilk , Miss Cilli . Cilli . Rises . In the midst of her excitement . What is it , Rosa ? Rosa . Master ordered it , you know . Cilli . Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it later . Rosa . Will not be sent away . But I must stay till it 's been drunk . Cilli . But I ca n't now ; do n't you hear ? I can not . Leo . Leopold Going quickly between , as ROSA will not leave , excited . Why do you worry the young lady ? You heard her say she ca n't . Rosa . Crosses , C. It 's the doctor 's orders  --  it must be drunk . Leo . Leopold Fiercely . Well , then , give it here . Seizing the glass , gulps down the milk . Rosa . But that is n't the same thing . Leo . Leopold Putting glass on salver . There , you were only to stay here till you saw it drunk  --  now clear out ! Shoves her out of door , C. , and turns back again to CILLI . And now , my darling , tell me again  --  you love me . Cilll . Ardently . Yes , for ever and ever . Leo . Leopold Crosses , L. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you for the first time in the theatre  --  Cilli . And all this in two days  --  it seems like a dream . WENZEL enters , C. , with a salver , on which is the milk . Wenzel . The buttermilk , please ! Leo . Leopold Goes to him quickly , taking the glass from salver . Yes , that 's all right ; give it to me . Wen . Wenzel Perplexed . But it 's for Miss Cilli . Leo . Leopold Has swallowed it . Puts glass back again , breathless from drinking so fast . Yes , yes , I know . Now get out . Shoves him out and turns again to CILLI . We do n't know the future , darling . But I swear to you  --  ROSA again enters with glass of buttermilk , from C. , going to CILLI , who is turned away . Rosa . Here 's your  --  Leo . Leopold Crosses , L. In despair . What , are you back again ? CILLI crosses , R. , turns to ROSA and makes gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cilli ! Enters . Cilli . And when is mamma coming ? Her . Hermance After ROSA 'S kiss , gives her hand to LEOPOLD in greeting . To CILLI . Probably not before to-morro We intended coming together , but with light irony unfortunately we missed each other . Cilli . With sudden outburst of happiness . I can not tell you , Manni , how happy I am that you are back again . And just to-day  --  just now  --  just when I am so  --  so happy  --  so  --  I 'll tell you everything by-and-by . Exits quickly , R. , front . Her . Hermance Do ! How hot it was ! And the clouds of dust I swallowed  --  I must have something to drink at once . Leo . Leopold Hands milk to her . May I have the pleasure ? Her . Hermance Looking at it . Thanks . Pouring out some water from carafe near by . Our buttermilk is very good , but somehow I prefer water . Drinks a few swallows  --  refreshed . Ah ! To LEOPOLD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wo n't you have the milk ? Drinks rest of water . Leo . Leopold With involuntary gesture of comic disgust , hurriedly sets glass away , puts glass on table , L. Oh , Lord , no , not any more to-day  --  no more . Thanks ! Her . Hermance Seriously , with glance at door , L. , front . Well , the rumor about the Counsellor is unfortunately true . Leo . Leopold Sympathetically . He is to be retired ? Her . Hermance Nodding assent . And Lori ca n't help us ! Leo . Leopold As above . Why , that is really  --  Her . Hermance Your aunt may be able to accomplish something . She seems to be on very good terms with Baron Lippski , and it fortunately happens  --  Stops suddenly as she sees CILLI enter , silencing LEOPOLD , with finger on lip . Sh ! Cilli . Enters , R. I. E. , forward , with her hand full of freshly plucked roses . Look , Manni , the first from our garden . They bloomed to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking roses . You are beaming yourself like a new-blown rose . What 's the matter with you ? Going to table . Cilli . Oh , Manni , I 've got so much to tell you . LEOPOLD , behind HERMANCE 'S back , motions her to be still . Her . Hermance Waiting for her to go on . Well ? Cilli . Crosses to C. , then to L. C. , has noticed LEOPOLD 'S signs  --  stutters . While you were away we rented our rooms . Leo . Leopold Crosses to C. Coming to CILLI 'S help . Yes , they are rented . Her . Hermance Crosses , C. Well , is that the cause of all this rejoicing ? Who has taken them ? Leo . Leopold Crosses , C. Here is his registry . Hands slip of paper . With glance of understanding to CILLI , significantly . I 'll be by here to-morrow morning , and then I 'll take the liberty of asking for it . Exits , C. Her . Hermance Crosses L. , sits on sofa . Meantime has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is this ? General Suwatscheff lodging here ? Cilli . Yes ; do you know him ? Her . Hermance Do I know him ? Such an adventure ! Do you know who this Suwatscheff is ? Why , dear  --  he was my first romance . Cilli . Astonished . Crosses to Manni . What ? During following it grows dark . Her . Hermance That is to say , the first of a serious nature . Cilli . Why , Manni , he has grey hair . Sits at Manni 's feet . Her . Hermance Grey ? Well  --  Recollecting . He was a little grey , even at that time , and that was ten years ago . Reckoning in her mind . When Marie Louise was married to the Emperor . He came to Vienna with the Grand Duke . It was on my sixteenth birthday I saw him for the first time  --  and eight days after he came to papa to propose for my hand . Cilli . And you did n't accept him ? Her . Hermance With a light sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself some hard , hard years . Cilli . Sympathetically . Poor Manni ! Her . Hermance Forcefully breaking away from the remembrance , merry again . Well , do n't let 's talk about that . Rises . Crosses to R. C. It is buried and grass is grown over it , thank goodness ! Cilli . Rises . Wo n't this meeting be painful ? Her . Hermance I really do n't know . Why ? Because I gave him the mitten ten years ago ? He has n't been dragging it after him to the present day , surely . COUNSELLOR enters , R. I. E. , front . Counsellor . Shivers , crosses , C. Cilli , you must have something done to the window in his room  --  there 's a fearful draught from it . The General did n't say anything , but he sat away from it . He ca n't bear a draught any more than I can . His nephew has already confided to me that he is a martyr to rheumatism . Cilli . Yes , papa , I 'll send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Councellor Tell Wenzel to get him early to-morrow morning . And he must look at this window too . Points to front . It always blows infernally from there on anyone sitting near it . Points to chair , R. , forward . MANNI sits , R. You 've heard about our new lodger ? The General is a charming man . Winks . Her . Hermance Is he ? Coun. Court Councellor A little impatient if anybody contradicts him . But , then , one need n't contradict him . Her . Hermance How did he happen to come to us ? Coun. Court Councellor The luckiest chance  --  his nephew brought him . Her . Hermance Ah ! he has a nephew ? Coun. Court Councellor Yes . Her . Hermance Does he live here too ? Coun. Court Councellor No , he lives over in the " White Horse . " But he is very attentive to his uncle ; I suppose he comes over twenty times a day to see how he is . He 's just in there again now . I never saw such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who enters . You 'll see  --  here he is . HORST enters from L. , forward , beaming with happiness . Her . Hermance Looking up , astonished . Who is this ? Coun. Court Councellor The General 's nephew . Her . Hermance Much astonished . Crosses to C. Mr. von Neuhoff ? Coun. Court Councellor Of course . You met him ? Her . Hermance Yes , I had the pleasure . Horst . Bows with somewhat ironic formality . Highly flattered . Her . Hermance So you have quartered an uncle here ? Bravo ! Bravo ! Horst . And he is quite the proper age , too . So you will have nothing to object to in him . Her . Hermance Oh , not in the least . Horst . Hypocritically . Ah , and he is so comfortable here ! Her . Hermance Ironically friendly . You visit him a great deal , I suppose . Horst . Naturally . In a certain way I owe him the duty of a son . And I take such obligations very seriously . Coun. Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . Her . Hermance It is touching . Then you really spend more time here than at the " White Horse ? " Horst . Yes ; he must n't be left alone  --  old gentleman , you know . Her . Hermance In that case do n't let us keep you if you wish to go back  --  Horst . No , no  --  he sometimes takes a little nap . Coun. Court Councellor Politely , down R. And at those times Mr. von Neuhoft will give us a little of his company . Her . Hermance How nice of him ! Crosses to L. Horst . Crosses to C. Do you know I feel a sort of natural inclination to the members of this family ? We shall make up little picnic parties occasionally  --  take breakfast in the wood , go in the evening to the theatre , and do lots of things . Her . Hermance You have got that all nicely arranged , have n't you ? Horst . Then on festal occasions  --  this evening , for instance , we all gather round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festal occasion this evening ? Horst . Why , it 's my uncle 's first night under this friendly roof . Coun. Court Councellor Yes , that must really be celebrated . Horst . To both . My uncle cordially invites you to join him . Her . Hermance Ironically . That is very kind . Horst . I have given Wenzel the materials for the punch  --  according to my recipe , of course . Fresh berries , a light moselle , champagne , well frapp . Coun. Court Councellor As far as I am concerned , I will go at once and personally inform the General that I accept his kind invitation with pleasure . Goes to door , L. HERMANCE crosses to R. Horst . Crosses , L. , to COUNSELLOR . That 's very good of you , Mr. Counsellor . Coun. Court Councellor And , besides , what you said just now about those little rural excursions , do you know that 's a good idea ! Horst . Inciting him . You see ? Coun. Court Councellor Continuing . Yes , indeed ; people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember when I last went to a picnic , and I never breakfasted in the woods . That 's something to look forward to . I declare , we do n't know how insipidly we live until someone comes along and wakes us up . Horst . And " someone " is here now to stir you all up . Coun. Court Councellor Taking his hands . That 's right . I said the very first time I saw you , " You belong to us , " you dear boy ! Embraces him and exits , L. I. E. Horst . With merry triumph , going to HERMANCE . Well , what do you say now , Countess ? Her . Hermance I say you have managed to make a nice warm nest for yourself during my absence , and it was done quickly , too . Horst . Was n't it ? Here I am like a son of the house , and now , Countess , do what you will , I remain . Crosses , L. No matter how badly you treat me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hermance Roguishly . Will you ? Do n't be too sure , Perhaps I may think out another little scheme . Horst . Imploringly . Going to her . No , no , you really must n't do that any more . Even if you have no feeling for me , think of that poor old man in there  --  my dear , good old uncle . Her . Hermance With laughing menace . Deceiver ! Crosses , R. Horst . Crosses , R. Honestly  --  he 's overjoyed at his quarters here . You know , he 's quite alone in the world . Her . Hermance With finesse . Did he never marry ? Horst . Fortunately , no  --  Her . Hermance How " fortunately " ? Horst . Just imagine the shock to my creditors if my uncle should suddenly present me with an aunt . Her . Hermance But he may . Horst . No , there 's no danger of that . Her . Hermance How so ? Sits R. of table , R. Horst . Taps Ms breast . Sits L. of table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Her . Hermance Acting curiously . How interesting ! Horst . The affair was ten years ago . He fell over head and ears in love , dancing a Lannerschen waltz . I have no wish to slander the lady , whom I never saw , but with respect to female beauty uncle always had a peculiar taste . Her . Hermance Amused . Ah ! and she did n't accept him ? Horst . No , I do n't understand it . She gave the old Croesus the mitten . Her . Hermance How could anyone he so stupid ? Horst . It was my jolly luck , and his , too , really . He was always enthusing over her beauty , but I imagine there is n't much of that left to rave over by this time . Her . Hermance Agreeing . Of course not . Horst . He swears that he has never got over his passion  --  that his sweetheart still floats before him as the fairy creature of his dreams . I tell him the fairy has got up to his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , pray  --  however , it is very nice of him to think of her still , is n't it ? Horst . Agreeing . Oh , yes , and I 've always helped it on a little bit . I have never allowed her memory to die out altogether . Her . Hermance Why not ? Horst . Slyly . Do n't you see ? So that he wo n't fall in love with anybody else . Her . Hermance How clever ! Horst . Self-satisfied Ye-e-es . I rather flatter myself on that . Her . Hermance And does the plan succeed ? Horst . Every time . Whenever I notice anything suspicious I begin at once about beautiful Viennese women , and then I hint about a certain Lannerschen waltz , and away he is . It works on him like the sound of a cow-horn upon a Switzer in exile . Her . Hermance Then you use his former sweetheart as a sort of bugbear to fright other females from his path . Horst . Lauqhing . Rises . Yes , she 's the bugbear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNTESS and speaking back into the room of the GENERAL . Counsellor . Yes , General , she is here . Leaving door open and going hurriedly to HERMANCE . We were just talking of you , and it came out that you and the General are old acquaintances . Her . Hermance Embarrassed . Rises , goes to him . Why , of course ! Taking few steps to meet GENERAL as he comes out , offering him her hand cordially . And so you have not forgotten me ? GENERAL enters L. , goes to C. GENERAL . Who has meantime entered quickly from L. , seizes HERMANCE 'S hand , and looks at her with joyous agitation . Forgotten you ? Kissing her hand . How can you ask suck a thing ? How glad I am to see you again . Horst . Somewhat anxiously . You are acquainted with the Countess , uncle ? Gen. General Acquainted ! Why , this is the lady we talked about so often  --  the lovely Viennese  --  my charming Countess Hermance . Horst . Disconcerted . To HERMANCE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the bugbear . Horst . Oh , Lord , it 's a boomerang . Sits . COUNSELLOR has meantime gone out L. , back , at a slight movement of the GENERAL . Gen. General Who during the preceding has gone a step back with the COUNSELLOR , comes forward again , standing before HERMANCE , looking at her with delighted gaze . I can hardly believe it even now . Do you know how long it is since we saw each other ? Her . Hermance Merrily parrying . Do n't let 's talk of that ; it 's a whole age . Gen. General Oh , you can count back calmly . What was only a bud then is now a rose  --  beautiful then and beautiful to-day . Gallantly kissing her hand . In reality even more beautiful . Horst . Disquieted , coughing , comes forward . Ahem ! Her . Hermance Ah ! That is only your gallantry ! With a roguish side glance at HORST . I know that I am no longer the fairy creature that floats in your dreams  --  even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipping the scales at two hundred , but there 's not much beauty left to rave over by this time . Crosses , R. Horst . Crosses to C. , anxiously tries to interrupt the conversation . I beg pardon , Uncle . Looking at watch . But you wanted to go to headquarters this evening . Gen. General Annoyed . Headquarters ? What for ? What about ? Horst . To meet Count Maeischkin . Gen. General Good-naturedly , patting his cheeks . All right , my dear boy . Pushing him gently aside and going to COUNTESS . There 's plenty of time for that . The Count does n't come till half-past nine . Goes to table , R. Her . Hermance Who has meantime seated herself in the arm-chair , L. , next to small table forward . And I ca n't give the General up this evening . With quiet movement of hand motioning GENERAL to arm-chair near her , very amiable . We have n't seen each other for such a long time . Gen. General Sitting , eagerly , L. of table , R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed for an hour like this . Seizing her hand . You can believe me , Countess , I have longed for it . Horst . Who , in anxiety to prevent a tte -- tte between the two , wedges himself in the narrow space between the two chairs , bends over the table . Allow me  --  but the vase . Seizes the vase on the table with assumed cautiousness . It may fall . Her . Hermance Noticing his intention and thwarting it . You are quite right , and now go and put it yonder on the spinnet . Horst . Hesitates , as he do n't want to give up his place . Over yonder ? Her . Hermance Nodding friendly . If you please . Horst . Hesitatingly takes vase , crosses to spinnet . All right  --  Her . Hermance Calling after him . And do pray sit down yourself  --  when HORST has reached the spinnet just where you are  --  on the stool . Horst . Forced . As you command , Countess . Sits on spinnet stool . Gen. General It has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joys come unexpectedly , and how grateful I am this time to Chance ! Her . Hermance Do n't let 's be unjust , General , we must thank your nephew a little bit . Gen. General How so ? Her . Hermance You know it was his idea , your coming here . That was his little scheme . Bows . Honor to whom honor belongs . Gen. General Turns to HORST . Yes , yes , that is true , my boy . You did better than you knew . Turns back . Her . Hermance Yes , much better . Horst . Rises , with grim humor . Oh , well , so long as you are both satisfied , I ought to be happy . Goes in despair up stage and stares at the pictures on the wall . Her . Hermance And now , first of all , my heartiest congratulations on your brilliant career . Gen. General So you followed it ? Her . Hermance Yes , yes , I have read everything . How you gained the Cross and how you were made General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Such words make me inexpressibly happy . Drawing nearer . Her . Hermance To evade his somewhat too warm advances . Oh , do tell me all about the battle ! It must be thrilling . Gen. General Of course , much depends upon luck ! You see Bonaparte came with 123,000 men from Smolensk lightly striking the table as if he would thereby mark the location of Smolensk marching upon us . General Kutusow and I took our position between three rivers . With the left hand on arm-chair pointing down . Kalatsche with right hand crossing between his and Manni 's chair , Moyne and with right hand on her chair , Stonetz , and there we were crowded together . His chair quite near HERMANCE 'S chair . As we are now . With his right hand slightly pointing back . Our reserves stood northeast , near Utizi  --  Horst . Who has during the last few sentences in background made signs of growing jealous of the intimacy of the two , takes with quick grasp the map from the wall and comes forward with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with left hand shoves the map between their two heads from the map . Then even more vigorously , making signs with right hand on the map . You see , here is Smolensk . Gen. General Leans forward over the frame of the map to see HERMANCE 'S face . Yes , and Marshal Ney was posted there . Horst . Shifting the map about again , so the GENERAL can not see HERMANCE . And here was uncle with his regiment of the Guards . Gen. General Half way up from his chair , looks over the upper frame of the map . Between Utizi and Borodino . Horst . Lifting the map again a little higher so as to cut off the GENERAL , and with his right hand pointing . Borodino is right over here  --  Gen. General Rises . Impatiently . But , my boy . Takes map in his hand and carries to L. The Countess is n't so anxious to know the particular spot . Horst . Taking his opportunity ; sits quickly in the arm-chair of the GENERAL . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. General Looking at map as he lays it on the table . Astonished , without noticing the others . Why , this is not the map at all . Looks further at map . There 's no Smolensk , nor Borodino  --  nor  --  you got the wrong location . Turning , now notices that HORST has taken his chair and is much engaged with the COUNTESS , so he comes forward to them . Here ! And as HORST does n't take any notice , touches him on the shoulder . Here , I say , you 've got the wrong location again . Horst . Assuming innocence . What 's the matter , sir ? Gen. General The map you want is in my room . Horst . Yes , sir , I know ; I put it there myself . Gen. General Intending to send him away . Well , then , be so good as to go and get it . Horst . Hesitating . Oh , not now , when we are so comfortable . Her . Hermance But , if it is your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for an excuse . I meant I ca n't find it in the dark . Gen. General Sits immediately on chair . Well , then , take a candle . Turns around to COUNTESS again and begins to talk . Horst . Still hesitating , looks anxiously back at group . Takes candelabra , which stands on C. table . Oh , all right . As he still goes back , L. I sha n't be long  --  I 'll be back right away . Goes up quick , R. , back . As HORST has taken the only light in the room with him , the room , by shutting the door , is in darkness . Gen. General Jumping up , interrupting conversation by the darkness . Why , why , what 's this ? Her . Hermance Laughing . He has taken away the light . Gen. General Never mind . A chat in the dark is just what I like  --  especially with you , Countess . Horst . Calling out behind scenes . I 've got it . Enters with folio map quickly from R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say  --  who put out the light ? Gen. General You took it away yourself . Horst . In consternation . By Jove ! Exits hurriedly , R. , leaving the door open ; as before , the door being half open , the light shines in from inner room onto stage . Gen. General Turning to Countess . Our meeting again so romantically  --  so  --  so  --  Horst . Enters hurriedly from L. , with candelabra , which he puts on table . Here 's the light . You might have told me , uncle , that I left you in the dark . Pray excuse me , Countess . Her . Hermance Oh , we were n't at all frightened . Horst . Yes , but an accident might so easily have happened  --  stammering  --  with uncle  --  and the vases  --  Her . Hermance Why are you so concerned about the vases ? Goes to spinnet and takes down vase , putting her face among the flowers , then crosses R. It would be a pity , though , for my lovely flowers . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when I returned from Eger . It 's a beautiful custom when one comes home to be met with such fragrant greetings , is n't it ? Gen. General Hesitating . I did n't get such a greeting when I came to-day . Her . Hermance But you shall . Handing him the finest rose out of the vase . Gen. General At same time that he takes rose from her , kisses her hand . Oh , Countess , how charmingly you do everything ! color=redPage 55 Horst . From the other side . I 've been coming several times , too  --  Her . Hermance Laughing , motioning him away and putting vase on spinnet . No , no , I wo n't have all my roses taken away . Standing before spinnet , plays few chords . Gen. General Sits by spinnet . Oh , yes , do play something for me ! Her . Hermance Sitting down on spinnet stool . Shall I play a Lannerschen waltz ? Horst . Sits R. of table , R. Aside , in despair . That 's the cow-horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how long it is since I heard that , how long ! Sinks into arm-chair , which stands near spinnet by window . Horst . Losing patience , rises , crosses to General . Why , uncle , I 've played that waltz for you a hundred times . Gen. General Looking at Countess in ecstasy . Not as she plays it , my boy . That 's something quite different . Horst . In despair . Aside . I brought it on myself . Up C. to door . GENERAL , without taking his gaze from the Countess , turns up collar of his coat on one side as if to protect himself from the draught . Her . Hermance As she is playing . Do you feel a draught , General ? Gen. General As above . It 's nothing ; go on playing . Horst . Taking opportunity , energetically . Business with door . Excuse me , uncle , do you remember what the doctor told you about draughts ? You must n't sit here any longer . Gen. General Rises . Do you think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at once . Rheumatism be da  --  hanged  --  I am not an invalid . I 've got no rheumatism . Energetically , turning down coat collar . You may open all the doors and windows if it does n't inconvenience the Countess . Her . Hermance Ceasing to play , goes to window and opening it . I do n't think it would do any harm  --  it 's a little close in here . Horst . Energetically . All right , if you will have it  --  Hurries to C. door . We 'll give you air . Pushes both doors open and remains in the background next to door , with a triumphant laugh . A thorough gust of wind blows through the room , the curtains blow out and then flap like flags in the room . A small flower basket , which hangs by chain in the window , begins to swing ; small work-basket which stood on window-ledge is blown into room , the contents being strewn upon the floor ; different sheets of music are blown off the piano , and the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candles flickers ; the chandelier begins to swing also , making the crystals strike together . In corridor , which is to be seen through the C. , the cover of a small table is blown off , and the map which hangs on the wall is blown up and down by the wind . Door , L. , front , is torn open , and a few papers which were lying on desk in background are blown into the room . WENZEL enters , C. , carrying the punch , appears as if walking against a strong wind , while the napkin which he carries over his arm is blown off . After his entrance , a door in the distance is heard to bang , then a second door , and then with a loud bang the C. door shuts . Her . Hermance As she was standing at the window , she was also caught in the wind , runs across stage quickly as L. door is blown open and closes it again . Laughing . Why , this is a perfect hurricane ! Gen. General Flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stand this . It 's frightful . Her . Hermance Leaning against door , L. , to keep it closed . For goodness ' sake , Wenzel , shut the window . Wen . Wenzel Puts punch quickly on C. table . This is an awful draught ! Goes to window and shuts it , picks up sheets of music , contents of basket from the floor , and puts vase with roses on C. table and brings everything into order . Her . Hermance Leaving door and goes to mirror to put her deranged hair straight . GENERAL comes from corner , turns down collar and struts up and down angrily . Everything is tossed to pieces . Crosses , R. Horst . Has witnessed the whole scene with a grim pleasure . Air a bit fresh for you , uncle ? Down C. Gen. General Growling under his breath , crosses to C. You are altogether too careful of me . You need n't trouble yourself so much  --  you need n't call again unless you are sent for . You understand , sir ? Horst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came this evening to remind you of Count Maeischkin , sir . Gen. General Very well ; I need n't go in person ; you can represent me . Horst . Making an excuse . But , uncle , he 'll think  --  Gen. General With slight emphasis , in military position . Attention ! Go at once and report that General Suwatscheff has arrived in Carlsbad to greet the Empress . Crosses , R. Horst . At cue " attention " assumes military attitude and says : At your command , General . To HERMANCE , turning , bows formally . Your Ladyship . Exits , C. WENZEL , who meantime has put the room to rights , opens C. door for HORST and exits also . Her . Hermance Laughing , sympathizingly . Poor fellow . Is your Excellency really angry with him ? Gen. General Oh , by no means . I like him too much for that , and to-day especially . He 's really a good fellow at heart . You 'll find him so . What do you think ? Her . Hermance With silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one thing , besides , he 's a true hand that holds fast . I do n't mean money . That seems to slip through his fingers somehow . But in friendship and love , there you can depend upon him . Her . Hermance Cautiously . But just a little gay , eh ? Gen. General Ah , that 's all right . You know what the Russians say : " April in the head , May in the heart . " Up here , Pointing to head. everything uncertain  --  now a heavy shower  --  now a hot sun  --  but here  --  puts hand on his heart  --  constant as the blue skies of May . Her . Hermance Hiding her joy behind redoubled friendliness . That must be a family characteristic , General , for you have the two best things in the world  --  a warm heart and true friendship . Gen. General Seizes her hands , which she lets lie in his . Passionately . Then you understand us both . Crosses , R. Do you know I never had such an enjoyable evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her . Hermance Why , then , we will spend it together . I feel  --  I do n't know how . In Vienna we call it a " wurlert mood . " Gen. General What sort of a mood is that ? Her . Hermance Naively . " Wurlert . " I do n't know what you call it in Russian , but it means one is in such a flutter that one does n't know what to do with one 's self for joy . Leans her head back in a reverie and only listens halfway to what the GENERAL is saying . Gen. General Cautiously beginning and then becoming warmer and warmer . That 's the way with me , too  --  when I sit near you with the tea table between us  --  and when I think that perhaps it might always be so ! You know you sent me away that time because you were not free  --  but now you are free . Her . Hermance Starting . What are you saying ? Gen. General Continuing . And if I dared to ask again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and promptly rising . Why , General ! Then relenting in pity and half smiling . Now , what kind of an answer am I to make to such a declaration from you ? Crosses to C. Gen. General Up , who likewise has risen , disappointed . Of course , if you do n't know what to say , Countess , you have already said enough . Up R. and down C. Turns away . Her . Hermance As above , and crosses , L. C. It 's too bad . Just as I was thinking that we might spend so many pleasant days together  --  as friends . Gen. General Going up and down , grumbling with himself . And so we might  --  but I had to go and spoil it all . Well , it 's all over , and I suppose it wo n't do now for me to keep on living here  --  Her . Hermance Well , it would hardly  --  COUNSELLOR enters , R. U. E. , back , in full dress . Counsellor . With a certain formality . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punch , this evening . Gen. General Who recollected . Eh ? Oh ! Yes , yes . Shaking his hand . You are very kind . We will have a bowl together , too , in the " White Horse "  --  Coun. Court Counsellor But why not here ? Gen. General By the way , I wish to give notice that I intend to take up my quarters across the way , in the hotel . Coun. Court Counsellor So suddenly ? What is the matter ? Gen. General Pray , do n't ask me . Of course , you shall be at no loss . Coun. Court Counsellor The loss of your Excellency is irreparable . Crosses , R. Gen. General Shaking his hand , with side glance at COUNTESS . I assure you , it will not be easy for me , but I must return to Russia . Her . Hermance Attentive . No , no . Gen. General When the festivities are over I shall go to my estate at Wilma , with my nephew . Coun. Court Counsellor You are going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her . Hermance Going to him , R. I must not try to persuade you , but though you change your quarters you need n't fly the country . Why , if you run off to Russia we shall never see each other at all . Gen. General And I could n't stand that ; I  --  Pshaw ! Scolding himself . I 'm a fool . I 'll move  --  that 's settled . Tenderly . But I wo n't quit Carlsbad . Her . Hermance That 's right . Crosses , L. Gen. General To COUNSELLOR . And I shall run over sometimes to see then suddenly my nephew . Her . Hermance Mr. von Neuhoff ? Gen. General To COUNSELLOR . Yes , let him come in my place . Crosses , R. C. Coun. Court Counsellor With the greatest pleasure . HORST enters through C. door , leaving it open , keeping on his cap , without greeting others , walks with military air to the GENERAL . Horst . General , I respectfully report  --  Gen. General In good humor , presses down his saluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in his hand . Stuff with your " General . " I 'm your own old uncle . And now , you must do me a favor , my boy . I am going to leave here . Horst Shocked . Uncle ! Gen. General You must give up your quarters at the " White Horse " to me  --  at once . Horst . And where am I to go ? Gen. General You come here . Horst . Here ! Gen. General Right into my place . Horst . Hardly able to control his joyous excitement . Why , that is  --  Gen. General No hesitation . It 's all settled . Good-bye , you rascal  --  you young rascal  --  my boy . Exits hastily with COUNSELLOR through C. Horst . Frank and over-happy . Is it possible , Countess ? Did you arrange it for me ? Her . Hermance Laughing , turns away . I assure you , nothing was further from my thoughts  --  Horst . Naively . Well , everything is exactly as I wanted it . With Uncle , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comically affected  --  with the punch even ! COUNTESS crosses , R. May I have some to celebrate the occasion  --  wo n't you ? Her . Hermance Retiring somewhat to L. , front . What , we two alone ? That would be highly improper . Horst . Comically misunderstanding . We do n't have to drink it all if we do n't like . Taking off the cover of the bowl and bending over it . My , what a flavor ! Sniffing the fragrance . Just like the woods in summer ! Just come and take a sniff . Her . Hermance Who has approached near and bows lightly over the tureen , sniffing the fragrance . Delicious ! Yes , just like springtime . Laying her hands on the outside of the bowl . And is n't it nice and cool ? Somewhat longingly . You know , I am very fond of champagne . Horst . Pouring out a very small glass for HERMANCE , boldly . Well , do n't stand shivering on the brink and " letting I dare not wait upon I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermance Laughing , sits . That is the first evidence of literary taste I 've heard from you . Horst . Pouring out a larger glass for himself . You know I never was given to thinking very much . Frank and simply . I have always taken life just as it hit me , full in the face . No complaint when it went rough with me , and only too happy when it was good to me  --  as it is to-night . Raising his glass to touch hers , rises . Here 's to life with all its blessings ! Hold his glass to hers . HERMANCE stands on the other side of the table opposite him , has during the whole of the last speech looked him fully and unembarrassed in the face , not taking her eyes from him , while she has reached for the glass and holds it out to him . As he is about to touch glasses with her he looks into her face , stops suddenly , puts down his glass , and says , with frank tones : Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's your eyes . Her . Hermance What about my eyes ? Rises , takes C. Horst . Crosses to COUNTESS . I have been racking my brain and asking what is there about this woman so strange , so unlike all I 've known before ? Now I know  --  it 's your glance . Others look at me , but none so honestly , none so purely , none so deeply ! Your eyes make one feel that they sound the depths of the soul . Her . Hermance Interrupting him , smilingly . Stop ! stop ! that 's an old story  --  my eyes and my glance . When I was a mere child I used to peer into people 's faces so pertly  --  with such a spirit of mischief  --  that even now they call me  --  do you know the word  --  my nickname  --  Countess Gucki . It does n't mean to stare , nor to peek , nor to pry , but it 's all of them together  --  and something besides . Crosses , R. Horst . Countess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make a note of it . Here 's to Countess Gucki ! Clinks glasses with her and drinks the whole glass in one draught . Her . Hermance Still holds her glass in her hand while he drinks . Why , you 've taken the whole glass at once . Horst . Holding high his glass , turned upside down . To the last drop . The toast was in bumpers . Her . Hermance Crosses to table , L. Then here 's better manners to " Gucki " than to stare at people . Sits . Horst . Oh , bumpers ! It is n't a bit strong , is it ? Sits . She shakes her head as she drains her small glass , then holds it upside down . Her . Hermance That 's better than tea . Horst . Taking her empty glass . Is n't it ? Tea for tattle , wine for wit . Will fill her glass again . Her . Hermance You are fairly blazing to-night ! Perceives that he is going to fill her glass . No , no , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goes hastily to door , R. , front , and takes from table there the light . Horst . But , Countess ? Her . Hermance What is it ? Horst . Calling after her . Crosses back of table . Surely , you wo n't leave me  --  yet . Her . Hermance Standing close by her door , turns to him . Yes , yes . Good-night ! Good-night ! Will turn again at door . Horst . Still standing by the bowl , urgently , starts toward her . But , Countess , you have forgotten something  --  Her . Hermance Turning again toward him . I ? Horst . Going to her . Yes , what this evening signifies to me . Just think  --  under the same roof with you for the first time  --  it 's my home  --  while you let me stay  --  my home . Looking over at vase and roses that stand on C. table under the bowl . Where is my greeting  --  where is my flower ? Her . Hermance Still at door , loitering , half loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it , to refuse you so little ? Horst . Ardently . You see  --  Her . Hermance Raising her eyes to him . So  --  Places the light again on the table near the door and goes to C. table . I can do my part . Taking up the bunch of roses in a grasp and offering him one rose . There . Horst . Thanks ! But one !  --  only one  --  Her . Hermance Why should you have more ? We give all strangers one . Horst . Am I still a stranger ? Her . Hermance A stranger  --  no  --  not a stranger  --  there  --  there  --  Pressing all into his hand . Good friend , and now Good-night ! Good-night ! Horst . Good-night ! Good-night ! Countess Gucki . Her . Hermance Good-night ! Horst . Calling after her tenderly . Countess Gucki ! Backs to table and takes glass . Her . Hermance In the open doorway . Good-night ! Good-night !

Crosses , L. , still looking out of the door , friendly . Good morning , Rosy ! Is the Countess up yet ? Rosa . Oh , yes , sir ; she 's been up and off long ago . Horst . Startled . Enters quickly . Off ? Off where ? Not gone away ? Rosa . Oh , no ; only climbing the mountains ; off for a morning walk . Horst . Reflectively . That 's a good sign . To ROSA . She was in pretty good humor ? Rosa . Oh , splendid ! Mysteriously . Both coming down , C. And she had such a lovely dream last night . Horst . A dream ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Rosa . I looked it up in my dream book , to buy the number in the lottery . You know there 's a number in the book for everything you can possibly dream . Horst . Taking a piece of money from his vest pocket and laying it on the salver . Buy it for me , too . What did she dream ? Rosa . Two splendid numbers  --  47 and 73. 47 for potato pancakes , and 73 for currant jelly . She dreamed of them both . Horst . You humbug ! I do n't believe a word of it  --  I wo n't abet such profanation . Takes money and puts in pocket . Pancakes ! Currant jelly ! Rosa . Shall I bring you your breakfast ? Horst . Takes hold of the salver . No , I 'll take it myself . Rosa . But this is only what the Countess left . Horst . Eyeing the service fondly . Indeed ? That was her breakfast ? Happy breakfast ! Hesitating Why , she did n't take half her tea . Takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archly . Still standing before him with a salver in her hand , smiling . Is it sweet enough , sir ? Horst . Just suits me . Takes a little swallow . Delicious ! Drinks again . How nice cold tea is . Drinks . Tastes much better than hot . Drinks the rest , smacking his lips , satisfied , while he puts cup back on salver . And she did n't eat half her roll . Rosa . No , she only bit a piece out of it , as you see . Horst . Eating roll . Did n't she leave any word for me ? Just good morning or something ? Rosa . No , sir ; nothing at all . Horst . Try and remember . Rosa . No , nothing whatever . Horst . Then she forgot it . Going , L. Rosa . Who has gone to C. door , turns around again . Oh , I was told to ask you how you slept , sir . Horst . Warmly , starting towards ROSA . By the Countess ? Rosa . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coldly . Thank you ! Rosa . She got home at midnight last night , and when she heard you were living here now , she specially told me to  --  Horst . Ironically cutting off . Yes , that 's all right . Say I particularly inquired after her health . Rosa . Yes , but she is asleep now . Horst . Quickly interrupting . Do n't wake her . I shall have the pleasure later on  --  when I come back . By Jove ! I must be off . Going to door , L. If the Counsellor asks for me say I 've gone across the way to see my uncle . I 'll just go through the garden . Opens the door to go . Rosa . Calling after him . The Counsellor went out early , too . He said he 's going to take breakfast in the woods . Horst . Laughing out , going to ROSA . Oho ! Well , Rosa , here 's your money . Lays the money on the salver again . You may play those numbers for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and currant jelly . Horst . No , I mean the numbers . Rosa . 47 and 73 . Horst . Well , then , play them for me . I never have any luck at gambling . Pinching her cheeks . So some time I shall be fortunate in love , eh ? Exits , L. I. E. Rosa . Looking after HORST , then enjoying the remaining drops in the cup . Such a nice gentleman ! Finishes the cup , going to the table . HERMANCE enters C. quickly , a bunch of field flowers in her hand , first calling behind the scenes . Hermance . Rosa ! Calling . Rosa ! Enters excitedly , then giving ROSA the flowers in both hands . Put those in water for me at once . Rosa . Setting down salver on table , R. , and taking flowers . Oh , what lovely flowers ! Puts flowers in water pitcher . Her . Hermance Oh , my shoes ! With foot tapping . I believe I could swim in one of them . Such a dew on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair . But it was lovely up there . Half to herself . Dear , dear ! All the world is beautiful to me now . Goes to window and opens it to let in fresh air . Rosa . Arranging the bouquet . Why , there are some ripe strawberries among them . Her . Hermance Lots ! And I have eaten some , too . Apparently thinking of the preceding evening . I believe strawberries are really my favorite fruit . During preceding stands by the spinnet , where she heedlessly has struck one or two airs , and now plays the melody , " My Lover 's a Trooper . " Rosa . Has listened , swaying with the melody . I know that song , too , your Grace . Her . Hermance Somewhat confused . What song ? Rosa . Half singing . " My Lover 's a Trooper , A trooper is he  --  The Horse to the Emp'ror But the rider to me . " Her . Hermance Comically piqued . I know the song with quite different words . Rosa . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine are the best . Her . Hermance Calling her back . Rosa ! Then hesitating and particularly friendly . Rosy , has anybody asked for me this morning ? Rosa . Nobody but Major Neuhoff . Her . Hermance Playing the indifferent . Oh ! Nobody but he . Rosa . He has just gone out . Could n't even wait till I got him some fresh tea from the kitchen . Her . Hermance Crosses , L. Gone without his breakfast ? Rosa . Well , he drank the little drop your Grace left in the cup  --  and he ate some of your roll , too . Goes into corridor through C. door , which she leaves open . Her . Hermance Understanding and confused . Well , smiling you know soldiers have to forage and they ca n't break themselves crosses , R. of the habit . Aside , as if indignant . Before the girl , too . BAUMANN has meantime appeared in corridor and spoken a few words to ROSA , softly . Rosa . Speaking in C. door . Your Grace , here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Passing ROSA quickly , enters C. , down C. I beg your pardon  --  it is an important letter . Gives HERMANCE a letter that he takes out of the portfolio he carries under his arm . BAUMANN is a man of fifty , smooth face , well preserved , very clean and correctly dressed , not in livery , but in a dark coat with white binding . ROSA closes the C. door behind BAUMANN . Bau . Baumann Continuing . My name is Baumann  --  I am Baron Lippski 's valet . Her . Hermance Indifferent , going up to BAUMANN . I remember  --  I saw you in Eger . Are you to wait for an answer ? Bau . Baumann I did n't ask . I had to come away so hurriedly . Her . Hermance Mrs. Counsellor is still asleep . Can you come back again later ? Bau . Baumann Yes , on my return from Ellbogen . I have to go there with important dispatches . Pointing to portfolio . Her . Hermance With gesture , dismisses him . Well , until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sha n't be long . I have the Baron 's horses  --  I shall be back by eleven . Exits , C. Her . Hermance Looking at letter , with glance toward door , L. , back . She came back at midnight and here 's a letter already . That 's rushing it . ROSA enters with C. pitcher of water , goes down to COUNTESS , then to table , R. As soon as Mrs. Counsellor gets up , Rosa , give her this letter . Gives her the letter . Just say it 's from the Baron von Lippski . Sneezing . That 's my wet shoes . Going down to door , R. , front . If I get a cold and a red nose  --  just at this time of all others  --  I 'll drown myself . Exits , R. , front , leaves the door open . ROSA has put letter in her apron pocket and fills , during the following , the vase in which she has placed the flowers , out of the pitcher of water that she brings with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Yes , she 's in there  --  but I believe she 's taking off her shoes . Exits , C. Her . Hermance Calling from her room without becoming visible . Mr. Leopold , is that you ? Leo . Leopold Speaking loud , toward door . Yes , Countess , if you 'll allow me a moment  --  Her . Hermance Anxiously , as above . Yes , but do n't come in here  --  what is it ? Leo .

Hermance Ironically . How glad the Empress will be . But why do you bother yourself about it ? Leo . Leopold Is n't he coming for Miss Cilli , and wo n't he settle it with her mother ? Her . Hermance Understanding . Ah , that 's what you mean by all this flurry ! You have set your eye on Cilli  --  Leo . Leopold Embarrassed . Well  --  Her . Hermance Well , do n't try to deceive me . I like people to speak right out on such things . I do n't begrudge her to YOU . Gives him her hand . Leo . Leopold Kissing her hand . You are so good . If I only knew whether she  --  Her . Hermance Then you do n't know ? Are you afraid to speak ? Would you like me to sound her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into corridor to ROSA , who enters C. and exits R. Counsellor . No , no , let her sleep on  --  the longer the better . Entering C. Good-morning , sister ! Between us I 'll never take another breakfast in the woods . The bugs fell into my coffee , the white ants crept down my back , and when I dropped my roll the dog ran off with it . It was all woods and no breakfast . Want to see me , Leopold ? Goes in background , where he lays off his hat and dusts his knees with his handkerchief . Leo . Leopold Timidly . No , I only wanted  --  Her . Hermance Holding him back . He came to me on official business . Going to LEOPOLD significantly , with slight show of official tone . I will make the necessary enquiries  --  and if you return in about an hour  --  Goes past him , softly . Go now . To COUNSELLOR . Have you seen the General this morning ? LEOPOLD bows and exits , C. Coun. Court Counsellor Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreadful night . Her . Hermance Regretfully . Oh , dear , what was it ? Coun. Court Counsellor Down R. C. He must have got in a draught somewhere yesterday . Had another touch of rheumatism like the one in Felfzug . Her . Hermance I hope he 's better . Coun. Court Counsellor Very much . Fortunately Wali was there  --  you know Wali , the old nurse . Her . Hermance Yes , with her horse liniment . Coun. Court Counsellor Yes . She took him in hand at once and really helped him . He swears he 'll take her back to Russia and pay her whatever she asks . Her . Hermance She 'll agree to that . Coun. Court Counsellor No , she 's afraid of the trip  --  too far . Her . Hermance Decisively . I 'll talk to her myself . Coun. Court Counsellor I wish you would . You are the only person that can . To the GENERAL , who enters , C. , shaking hands . General , you can thank the Countess in advance . GENERAL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes hands with COUNSELLOR , then goes at once to COUNTESS , likewise extending his hand in greeting . General . For what then ? But you are always doing good . Kisses her hand . Her . Hermance What praise ! I do n't deserve it . Gen. General Lost in her gaze , becoming warmer . Perhaps not ; for it comes so easy to you to be good to people ! You have only to smile , as you are doing now  --  and a fellow is happy . My , how you do look to-day ! And so you were just speaking of me ? Her . Hermance With slight embarrassment . Yes . Coun. Court Counsellor Interrupting . About your rheumatism . Gen. General Embarrassed . Hum ! Coun. Court Counsellor And how Wali nursed you  --  Gen. General Cross . It must have been very interesting . Crosses , R. Coun. Court Counsellor Crosses , C. Navely . Very . I never tire of telling how she coddles people with her liniments and  --  To COUNTESS . When I went over , the General was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot stove lid to his feet . Again to GENERAL . But it did you good . You are quite fine again , are n't you ? Gen. General Hiding his anger , going up stage growling . Yes  --  thanks . Up R. , down to table , sits . Coun. Court Counsellor Still innocently . It really is n't fair to laugh , but how funny you did look  --  blankets and a hot stove lid . Her . Hermance With light warning to stop him . ' Sh ! Coun. Court Counsellor Persisting . And he let out that he had just been thinking of getting married . Ha-ha-ha ! Good-naturedly to GENERAL . Oh , no . Old fellows , like you and me , do n't want a wife  --  it 's a nurse we want . Rosa . Sticking her head in the door , C. Mrs. Counsellor is getting up . Vanishes again . Coun. Court Counsellor Eagerly . I 'm coming . Somewhat confused . What was it I was just going to say ? Breaking off . Never mind  --  I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I only had the nurse . Exits R. U. E. Gen. General Aside . Stands , out of humor , at window . Infernal old  --  Her . Hermance Crosses , R. After a short pause goes slowly quite dose behind the GENERAL , softly and tenderly . General , you caught the rheumatism on the battle-field  --  and if you are proud of your decoration and your rank , we are not ashamed of your rheumatism . Gen. General Moved , turns to her , and seizing both her hands , kisses them repeatedly . Oh , you  --  you are the dearest woman . And I  --  I was an old  --  Her . Hermance Roguishly stopping him . Do n't call names . I never let anyone abuse my friends . Heartily . And it 's settled that we are friends , is it not ? Gen. General Frankly and cordially . You will never find a better one . Her . Hermance Crossing from L. to R. , has taken his arm and goes with him , up and down . Then between friends one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wali . You take her with you ? Gen. General I want to , but she ca n't decide  --  Her . Hermance I am going to talk to her . Shall we go over at once ? Gen. General Right away ? Looking at his watch . No , I ca n't . My things are still in there , and  --  Points to R.  --  I must put on my uniform and report at headquarters . Crosses , L. Her . Hermance Giving him her hand . Then , by-and-by , when you come back . Gen. General At door . And that will be as soon as I possibly can . Opens door , C. , stops a moment on the threshold . Why , what 's this ? Goes out and returns . Look what somebody has sent that rascally boy . Carrying before him with both hands the wine bowl used as a vase and filled with flowers . Why , this is a whole flower bed . Stands bowl on C. table . Her . Hermance Crosses , L. Joyously astonished . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck the flowers in the punch bowl . Her . Hermance Standing at other side of table and innocently . Yes , how did he ever get such an idea ? Notices that on the handle of the bowl , tied with a red silk ribbon , hangs the large key of preceding act ; points to key , half to audience , amused . The key of the garden door . Gen. General Who meantime has looked further under the roses . There 's something else sticking in there . Draws out the handkerchief of First Act  --  which is tied to stalk of rose as flagstaff . Waves it . Looks at handkerchief . Doubtless a trophy from some fair lady . Her . Hermance Laughing . Perhaps he picked it up  --  in the theatre , or somewhere  --  Gen. General Do you know anything about it  --  can you tell what it all means ? Her . Hermance I have n't the remotest idea . Gen. General Crosses to C. Mysteriously . Then I 'll tell you . The boy is in love . Her . Hermance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it yesterday . He had his arm around my shoulder continuously , and that 's a sure sign a man is in love . Yesterday afternoon he hugged me  --  that means he is madly in love . Her . Hermance Is n't it only his affection for his uncle ? Gen. General Resenting it , laughingly . Affection for his grandmother ! Crosses to table . And these roses  --  are they for his uncle ? Discovers card among flowers . Ah , now we 've got it , here 's a card  --  with writing . Looks at card , reading . " Good-morning , Countess Gucki ! " Her . Hermance Rejoiced . Who ? Tries to get it . Gen. General Giving her card . Do you know the lady ? Her . Hermance In her enjoyment betrays herself . Yes  --  but correcting herself  --  that is , no . Crosses , R. Puts face in roses to hide her confusion . Gen. General Reflectively . Gucki ! Gucki ! I never heard that name before  --  probably an Italian family . HORST , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military style , without removing his helmet . Horst . General , I report . The Archduke expects you at eleven o'clock . Turns around to COUNTESS , takes off helmet and bows . Countess , good-morning ! Her . Hermance With little flag , waves over her face like a fan . Laughingly . Good-morning , Mr. von Neuhoff ! Horst . Following movement of flag with his head . What 's that ? Recognizing flag , at same time noticing punch bowl on table , with comic fright . Oh , Lord ! Turns embarrassed away . Gen. General Inquiringly . Well , sir , what 's the meaning of this ? Horst . Acts as if nothing was the matter . This ? Oh , that ? That 's a bouquet . Gen. General A very novel arrangement . A punch bowl , a key and a flag of truce . Horst . Yes , sir . I 've surrendered  --  a  --  a  --  I mean  --  it 's a decoration for the festivities . I intend to put it in the window and light it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , giving HORST a note . Wenzel . Major , this note has just been returned from headquarters . The clerks ca n't make out that part . Shows note and reads it . " I beg to report that I am detained by particular business  --  the Countess  --  Countess Gucki . " Horst . Faintly smiling . Embarrassed . Crosses up R. Oh , that 's a mistake  --  we 'll fix that  --  a little absent-minded , that 's all . There  --  I 've scratched it out . Takes piece of paper to his desk in background , writes a few words , gives note , helmet and sword to servant . Gen. General Approaching her , half aloud . Did n't I tell you there was something in the wind about that Gucki woman ? Her . Hermance Looks at him laughingly . Do you think so ? Gen. General As above . In love  --  in love  --  drowned in it . Exits back , L. I. E. WENZEL exits after GENERAL with sword , note and helmet . HORST is undecided how HERMANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foreground , L. , looks at him laughingly . Her . Hermance Between seriousness and joking . Well , I wo n't get angry so early in the morning . Crosses , L. Especially since you " scratched out " the Countess Gucki . Horst . Again bold , going to table . And now I 'm detained by her again . I am sorry that uncle found my bouquet  --  it was n't quite finished . Her . Hermance Laughingly . No ? Horst . Crosses , L. If I had had time I should have added a lot more things . Her . Hermance Sits . Your invention is wonderful ! Did you finish all that punch last night ? Horst . Well , we had a few toasts in my room at the open window  --  where the moon was shining in . It was a beautiful night  --  and we had toast after toast . First , your health , then mine and then ours ! Her . Hermance Alarmed . Rises , crosses , C. Ours  --  what ours ! Who  --  Horst . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last glass I leaned out of the window and proposed the whole universe ! I always thought it required lots of company and noise to enjoy punch , but I did n't know before what good company it was to be all alone with one 's happiness . I am not superstitious , Countess , but as sure as cock crow , last night the moon came and sat just in front of me and looked into my eyes until I felt here hand to heart the assurance of that happiness . Going , L. CILLI , in light summer dress , straw hat on her arm and flowers in her hand , rushes in , C. Cilli . Manni , just see what I have brought you . Her . Hermance During the last conversation , without looking at HORST , much agitated , turns and embraces CILLI very passionately . Cilli , my darling ! Cilli . Ardently . Was n't it lovely out on the meadows ? The springtime and flowers  --  and both made me think of you . Noticing HORST , offers him her hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. I thought of you too . Her . Hermance A little astonished . Thought of him ! Cilli . Innocently , heartily , C. Yes , he deserves it . I have to ask his pardon for so many things . Her . Hermance As above . His pardon ? For what ? Cilli . Because at first I wronged him . When I think how I treated you the first time we met  --  Horst . Alarmed . Pray , do n't mention it . Her . Hermance With increasing suspicion . The first time you met ? What happened the first time you met ? Cilli . Oh , it was very funny . He came with such an innocent air and told me I had lost a handkerchief at the theatre . Crosses , R. Her . Hermance Intently . What ? Crosses , C. Cilli . Continuing . And he was so fortunate as to find it . Horst . Tries to interrupt , with increasing embarrassment . I beg  --  Cilli . Goes on without noticing him , still amused . And it was every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances . To HORST , nervously . Of course , of course  --  Cilli . As above . It was only an excuse to get acquainted with me , you know . Her . Hermance As above . I understand . Horst . Tries to make excuse . Crosses to COUNTESS . Countess  --  it was  --  that is it 's really  --  I had  --  As he can not fine a way out , turns away in comic despair . Oh , Lord , what shall I say ? Crosses , L. Her . Hermance Nervously strumming on table . Sits . Oh , pray , pray , Mr. von Neuhoff , speak out . This is the time to invent something . Horst . Starts towards her . It is all a mistake  --  Her . Hermance Oh , no , I understand it perfectly . To CILLI , with increasing jealousy . But you , Cilli  --  I do n't understand you . Such a secret from your best friend  --  perhaps you were afraid that I would be in your way ? With scornful laugh . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you think that your happiness lies in that direction  --  I can only wish you joy  --  though I ca n't see where the happiness comes in . Waving back HORST . Oh , yes , yes , the outside is all right  --  such a nicely dressed soldier !  --  but I saw a much nicer one the other day in a toy shop , and it only cost a florin . Unfortunately , it was only tin  --  but what matter if neither has a heart ? Crosses , R. Horst . Tries to interrupt . I insist  --  Her . Hermance With severe look at HORST , continuing . I said " no heart ! " Disguising . Nobody with a heart would give his old uncle the rheumatism by opening all the doors and windows  --  and then sit up half the night drinking . Anyway , when a man is so far gone as to drink with the moon  --  that 's the last ! Crosses , R. Cilli . Pacifying . But Manni  --  Her . Hermance Crying , tenderly embracing . Cilli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  I deserved better from you . Going to LEOPOLD , who enters , C. Look here , this would have been the right one for you . Cilli . Not understanding . Leopold ? Her . Hermance Yes , the poor fellow could n't trust himself to speak , but he meant good and honestly . You did mean it good and honest , did n't you ? Leo . Leopold I swear it . Her . Hermance Crosses to HORST . You hear  --  and he 's a person one can depend upon . He does n't look much in that uniform  --  but he would have made you happy  --  because he loves you . He confided it to me . Pleading . Cilli , dear  --  Going to Cilli ca n't you be fond of him a little bit ? Cilli . Heartily . Why , with my whole heart . Her . Hermance Beside herself with joy . Really ? Well , then , come here . Let me see you give each other the first kiss . Horst . Me too ? Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly . Now , sir , you see what it is to be plain and straightforward . Points to couple . I did that . Horst . Boldly . No , Countess , I did that . Crosses to C. Her . Hermance Astonished . You ? Cilli . Of course , yesterday . Leo . Leopold Shaking hands with him . He brought us together . Crosses R. of HORST . Cilli . Shaking her other hand . That 's why he smuggled himself in here . Crosses L. of HORST . Horst . Nodding to her and taking both their hands . Yes , Countess , that 's the kind of a tin heart I have . Her . Hermance Looking at group , quite astonished , sees through the situation threatens HORST with her finger . Crosses , L. C. Oh , you impostor ! Peremptorily . Come here directly . HORST comes out of group to HERMANCE . LEOPOLD and CILLI go when HORST leaves down R. I. E. Roguishly . Answer me one thing  --  whose handkerchief did you find first  --  mine or Cilli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to that now ? Her . Hermance Looking into his face a moment , then convinced of his honesty , shaking her head , softly . No , I know I shall believe anything . Horst . And are you angry with me ? Her . Hermance Laughing . I find its impossible . Horst . Seizing her hand and repeatedly kissing it . You are truth itself  --  and I acknowledge I am a guilty sinner . Her . Hermance Turning , laughing . That will do  --  Horst . Further kissing . No , no , that is only in token of repentance  --  kissing  --  fervent repentance  --  Her . Hermance As above . Yes , yes , but that is enough repentance . Horst . Boldly . You are right . Now comes the thanks . Kissing . The hearfelt thanks . Kissing . And resolutions for the future . Kissing . Her . Herman ce Getting behind the C. table and pushing away the outstretched arm . No , no ; simply swear off . Crosses , L. , sits on sofa . GENERAL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , my boy , forward  --  we must report . Horst . Recollecting . True . Excuse me , Countess  --  the service  --  Goes through C. door that he leaves open into corridor , takes from chair there his helmet and sword , and enters during the following into room again . Gen. General Continuing , not interrupted by HORST 'S leaving To-day will probably be your last as my aid-de-camp . Horst . Has entered , and putting on his sword . How so , sir ? Gen. General Crosses , R. Well , last night I concluded to tender my resignation and retire to my estate . Horst . Startled . And what shall I do ? Gen. General You need n't go and bury yourself with me  --  Horst . But you ca n't go alone without any one to take care of you . Gen. General Oh , you need n't trouble yourself . I am going to take a nurse with me . Smiles and winks at COUNTESS , who nods acquiescence to HORST . Horst . Thinking that the GENERAL means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gen. General Same . Sits . Yes , sir ; one I can trust  --  she 's a genuine treasure . Horst . An inquiring glance at HERMANCE . And has she given her consent ? Gen. General Well  --  she is deliberating . Horst . Regaining his former boldness with comic triumph . I thought so . Going up , R. C. Gen. General Continuing . But I shall persuade her . I 'll promise her her weight in gold . Horst . Taking his helmet , stands at C. door . Do n't waste your time , uncle . If I know that woman , neither rank or money will buy her . Going towards GENERAL , half turning to HERMANCE , gaily , but with genuine feeling . I ca n't tell yet for whom she will decide , but I do know this  --  she will only follow the man to whom she gives her whole love and her whole heart , and it 's not a tin heart either . Exits quickly , C. Gen. General Stupefied , breaking out . The boy is mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences trying to suppress her laughter , sits and laughs out loud on arm-chair . He is ! He is ! Crosses up , R. C. Gen. General Heart and love ! Old Wali ? I only want her rheumatism liniment . Continuing . He is certainly out of his mind . Crosses , L. C. Her . Hermance Can not speak for laughter . It is odd ! Such expressions ! Slightly copying his tone and position . " I do n't know for whom she will decide ! And she has n't a tin heart either . " Interrupted through laughter . Poor old Wali ! With renewed laughter goes up stage . Gen. General I noticed something yesterday . Makes signs with his hand to his forehead . He worried me about wanting to exchange into an Austrian regiment in this place ; and asked me to speak to the Archduke about it . Her . Hermance Listening with joyous expression . And will you ? Gen. General Oh , if he has set his heart on it ; it will only cost a word . Turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration goes to the GENERAL . One moment , please . Are you on good terms with the Archduke ? Gen. General Standing at C. door , assents . He is always very kind to me . Her . Hermance Then you can do us the greatest service . They mean to retire our Counsellor ; if they do , it would give his wife palpitation of the heart . Gen. General But all women have that , have n't they ? Her . Hermance Not her kind . But this is for the sake of our good old Counsellor himself . Gen. General Taking both her hands warmly . I shall ask it as a special favor  --  even if I have to go down on my knees for it . Her . Hermance Archly . Not on your knees  --  with your rheumatism . Gen. General Good-naturedly laughing . True , true . But you know making signs the going down is all right  --  it 's the getting up ! Laughs and exits , C. HERMANCE follows the open door . MRS . COUNSELLOR enters R. U. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear sister , here you are . We have just been talking about you , have n't we , Aloysius ? COUNSELLOR stands just behind his wife and nods dubiously . Her . Hermance The C. door closing , and coming down , reserved . And I was just speaking of you . Mrs C. Mrs. Counsellor Shaking both her hands . How beautiful you look to-day  --  simply blooming  --  Her . Hermance Aside , to COUNSELLOR . She wants something . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor You could render us a great service . Her . Hermance As before . I thought so . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor It 's only a matter of a few days  --  we are in need of more room  --  and we thought if you could spare us a sitting room from your apartment  --  Her . Hermance Oh , is that all ? Take them all . I 'll sleep with Cilli . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Flattering . Aloysius , is n't that real Viennese good nature ? Now we can take in the whole family . Her . Hermance What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coun. Court Counsellor Points to letter . We had each a pleasant letter  --  the Baron will probably be here for dinner . Her . Hermance Hum ! The Lippskis ? Well , if I had known that I should have considered about the rooms . Crosses , L. Coun. Court Counsellor But why ? A man like the Baron  --  Crosses to COUNTESS . Her . Hermance But you do n't know him . You do n't even know whether you 'll like him . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Crosses , R. Well , but when you need the assistance of such people  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Especially at this moment , when it 's a question of my being retired . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor I hope we 'll hear no more of that . Coun. Court Counsellor Of course , if our Cilli marries young Lippski  --  Her . Hermance Starting . Oh , that 's it ? And what does the Baron say ? Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor The Baroness has settled it . In such matters the head of the family is the wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hermance Excitedly . Crosses to C. Well , in this matter I mean to have something to say . I never interfere with your affairs , but with regard to Cilli I must speak . I am her godmother , and when I put my hand on her baby head I took a vow which I mean to keep  --  and that was to save her from harm  --  if I could . Coun. Court Counsellor Moved . Quite right , of course . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor But if the girl can marry into such a family  --  Her . Hermance Do n't bother me about families . People do n't marry families ! They marry happiness or unhappiness . I had my experience and I 'm resolved that Cilli shall marry neither a Baron , nor a Count , nor a Duke Lippski ! She shall marry only the man she loves . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Love comes with marriage . Her . Hermance Not in this case  --  her love has gone to somebody else already . Coun. Court Counsellor Moved . My Cilli ! Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hermance Her cousin , Leopold , if you wish to know particularly . Coun. Court Counsellor Leopold ? Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor It 's out of the question . A young man who threw up his career to go into the army  --  enlist as a private just to fight Napoleon  --  out of patriotism and stuff ! Coun. Court Counsellor Contemptuously . Enlisting as a private ! Her . Hermance Ironically . Well , you ca n't enlist as an officer . To MRS . COUNSELLOR . And he did n't fight  --  Napoleon ran away as soon as he heard that Leopold was coming . Coun. Court Counsellor Good-humored and amused , laughs . He 'd better . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Severely reprimanding . Aloysius ! It is no time for laughter . Turns warmly to COUNTESS . I hope that Cilli will understand that she must make a sacrifice for her family as I have done  --  often . We need protectors  --  and powerful ones . Her . Hermance Yes ; I have noticed your sacrifices for that  --  how you were treated the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to swallow , and all with a sweet smile , as if they were sugar plums . You were snubbed for everybody , even the fancy cook . You had to take the poodles out for exercise , while the others went to receptions  --  and all for protection ! People can shove you about and crowd you out  --  Lippskis to-day and Loppskis to-morrow  --  and you lead a dog 's life . Worse , in fact , for if you kick a dog he can bark , and you do n't dare to ! And now you want to drag Cilli into this slavery , to save a little title and a little rank . Which is most to be respected , you or old Wali over at the hotel , who has been washing dishes for the last thirty years ? A withered-up little creature , who stoops to nobody and has no protection , except her two busy old hands . From the scrapings of her wages which she saved , kreutzer by kreutzer , she sends her son to college . She would n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lippskis out of her pantry first . If you come to rank and titles , that old woman stands first and highest  --  for nobody dares to snub her ! Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Has during the preceding stood near the door on L. , and exits with passion , R. U. E. , back . It 's intolerable ! Her . Hermance To COUNSELLOR . After MRS . COUNSELLOR has gone , breathing relieved . Well , she got it for once anyhow . Sits , R. Coun. Court Counsellor Crosses , R. During preceding has stood motionless , moves suddenly . Do you know  --  all you have just said I intended telling her long ago . Her . Hermance Rejoiced . Indeed ! Then you see it as I do . Coun. Court Counsellor Mounting . You spoke right out of my heart in every word . Her . Hermance I am glad to hear it . Coun. Court Counsellor Admiringly . When you get roused up it 's a treat to listen to you . Going back toward door mumbling . Other people get roused up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning to HERMANCE . Oh , what a wife you 'd make . Her . Hermance Would I ? Well , I think I 'd have made a man of my husband . Coun. Court Counsellor And what a mother you 'd be , too ! Her . Hermance I would n't barter my child for patronage . Coun. Court Counsellor And she is our child . We wo n't be outdone by Wali . Crosses , L. C. WENZEL , opening C. door . Wenzel . Baron Lippski . Exit into ante-room and leaves C. door open . Coun. Court Counsellor Bracing up . Just in time . BAUMANN appears with portfolio under his arm , C. Coun. Court Counsellor Sternly . To BAUMANN . See here , Lippski , if you are looking for lodgings I may as well tell you at once all the rooms are engaged . Baumann . Still at C. door , startled . I beg  --  Coun. Court Counsellor Even more energetically . If you are looking for my daughter  --  she is also engaged . Her . Hermance Intending to rectify COUNSELLOR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crosses , L. Allow me to speak , will you ? Looks at BAUMANN meaningly . I do n't put on gloves with people who snub my wife . Energetically . Lippskis or Loppskis , we wo n't be kicked about any longer . We bark now  --  you understand me , Lippski . We bark . Her . Hermance Turns away laughing . Bow-wow ! Bau . Baumann Intimidated . I only wish to remark  --  Coun. Court Counsellor You go home and tell your wife what I say . If you have n't got the courage I 'll call and do it . She may marry her son to whom she likes  --  if she wants anybody to snub , let her snub her cook  --  if she dare . And as to her poodle , she can take him out herself . We beg leave to drop out of the procession . Good day ! Striding up and down triumphantly . Bau . Baumann Exits , C. , shrugging his shoulders and elevating his hands and closes door after him . I ca n't get in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to C. You 've made a slight mistake , Counsellor  --  that was n't Baron Lippski . Coun. Court Counsellor Astonished . Who then ? Her . Hermance It was his valet . Coun. Court Counsellor In harness again . His valet ! Crosses up C. , runs through C. into ante-room , and calls to R. , back . I say , you , tell old Lippski all I said . Do n't forget . Enters again , C. After first step into room follows a sudden inclination , going to window and opening it , leaning out half way and calls out into the street . We do n't want his protection . We protect ourselves . Comes back into room with great inhalations . By the Great Frederick ! I 'm roused up now . LEOPOLD and CILLI have entered from L. , changed a few words with HERMANCE , and run in great joy to COUNSELLOR , take him between them with his hands . Cilli . Dearest papa  --  Leopold . Uncle , is it really true ? Coun. Court Counsellor Shaking their hands and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ? Cilli . Nods with her head and her father following her . Oh , ever so much ! Coun. Court Counsellor Well , then , embrace . Taking them to his heart , much moved . And , Leopold , make her very happy . Leo . Leopold Kissing him warmly . Oh , I will . Cilli . Doing same from other side . The best papa in the world . Coun. Court Counsellor Between the two , who kiss him alternately . Affected . If you keep on kissing me like that I wo n't know where to turn my head . Her . Hermance Starting in gladly . Just turn it to me and you will get the sweetest kiss I ever gave to anybody . Has taken his cheeks with both hands and kisses him on his mouth , LEOPOLD and CILLI embrace each other . HORST enters , C. , with General . Horst . At sight of group with comic fright . What 's all this ? General . With letter in his hand , C. , suddenly stops . Another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into L. corner . HORST goes to GENERAL quickly , likewise turns up his collar , stammers a few words of excuse to the GENERAL , who exits L. , back . LEOPOLD and CILLI at cue " draught " run from their corner to C. door to close it , but at same time rush out of room . Her . Hermance At cue " draught " runs to window , L. , and closes one part , while going there saying laughingly : Poor General ! As she closes one part , intending to close the other , she listens out into the street . Do n't you hear anything ? Is n't there a band coming ? HORST , who followed HERMANCE to window , stands next to her . During the preceding a wind similar to that of Act II. , but not so strong , flapping curtains and table covers , swinging of basket and chandelier , but all noises much less . Draught begins when HORST enters with GENERAL and opens the door , C. , partly ceases when LEOPOLD closes it , and ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERMANCE to window . Yes , it 's the Coburg Lancers going to the bridge  --  my future regiment . Her . Hermance Going down , R. Really ? Then your uncle managed it ? Horst . With the first word . I can hardly say , Countess , how happy I am . Her . Hermance With disclosing warmth . And I  --  Suddenly correcting her imprudence . But that is a Bohemian regiment . How will you manage to make yourself understood ? Horst . We 'll find a way , somehow . At Borodino I had a Polish squadron . I said , " Boys , there come the parlez-vous . If we do n't finish them they 'll finish us . Down with the lance and go like the devil ! " And they all understood . Her . Hermance Oh , that 's because there are moments when the heart speaks and words are not needed . Horst . You believe there are such moments , do n't you ? One came to me last night while I was sitting at the open window  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you sitting here . I could not hear a whisper , but I understood everything . It cried into my heart , " Not understand ! Did your squadron understand ? " Goes on his knees , seizes her hand . " Down on your knees , seize her hand , and do n't let go until she says , ' Yes  --  yes  --  yes ! ' " He remains before her on his knees , his face pressed down onto her hands . Her . Hermance Has at cue " and seize her hand " risen and stands before the kneeling HORST , letting her hands lie in his , with happy expression of countenance . The band of the regiment is heard in the distance playing " My Lover 's a Trooper , " very soft and muffled , and she speaks with the accompaniment of the music , beginning at first soft and increasing till the last line is spoken with full joyousness of love . " My Lover 's a Trooper , A Trooper is he , The Horse to the Emp'ror  --  Throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to him But the Rider to me ! " Horst . Springing up and outstretching his arms . Gucki ! Darling Gucki ! COUNSELLOR enters in joyous excitement , C. , and hurries to MANNI . Counsellor . Sister , a letter from the Archduke  --  and we have to thank you for it . Now , I want to give you a kiss . Mrs. Counsellor . Entering with GENERAL just after COUNSELLOR , hurries down to other side of HERMANCE . And I , too . Her . Hermance Standing between the two , copying the COUNSELLOR 'S tone and movements slightly . Now I do n't know which way to turn my head . CILLI and LEOPOLD have entered with others , and as HERMANCE leaves the group of COUNSELLOR and MRS . COUNSELLOR , they go to MRS . COUNSELLOR , one on either side of her ; the COUNSELLOR goes up with the GENERAL , shaking hands with him . At the cue " Countess Gucki " music is heard again behind the scenes and " My Lover 's a Trooper " is played till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coun. Court Counsellor Well , I do believe that everybody is happy and contented . Ah , trust diplomacy for bringing everything right about at last . Leo . Leopold It was n't all diplomacy this time , uncle . Cilli . No , indeed . Love did most . Did n't it , Manni ? Her . Hermance Yes  --  Love 's Diplomacy . Mrs. C. Mrs. Counsellor Please give some credit to my wise , prudent and sagacious foresight . Eh , General ? Gen. General Well , I am gratified by discovering that my nephew inherits his uncle 's good taste . Coun. Court Counsellor Well , he does look particularly happy . Horst . Yes , sir ; and it 's the result of my wise , prudent and sagacious foresight . I knew that nothing could win the Countess but reckless audacity and I tried it . Was I right , Countess ? Her . Hermance Yes , your little scheme worked that time . ' T is ever true in Love and Life that courage wins the prize , Who strives for fortune or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old heads instruct us as they may , Young hearts will rule and Love will have its way . So if our friends approve this oft-told theme , Join hands once more  --  applaud our Little Scheme . Back matter CURTAIN .
