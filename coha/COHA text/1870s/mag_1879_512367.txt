MARY ANERLEY . CHAPTER X. ROBIN LYTH . HALF a league to the north of bold Flamborough Head the billows have carved for themselves a little cove among cliffs which are rugged , but not very high . This opening is something like the grain shoot of a mill , or a screen for riddling gravel , so steep is the pitch of the ground , and so narrow the shingly ledge at the bottom . And truly in bad weather and at high tides there is no shingle ledge at all , but the crest of the wave volleys up the incline , and the surf rushes on to the top of it . For the cove , though sheltered from other quarters , receives the full brunt of northeasterly gales , and offers no safe anchorage . But the hardy fishermen make the most of its scant convenience , and gratefully call it " North Landing , " albeit both wind and tide must be in good humor , or the only thing sure of any landing is the sea . The long desolation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray fog droops its fold of drizzle in the leadentinted troughs , the pent cliffs overhang the flapping of the sail , and a few yards of pebble and of weed are all that a boat may come home upon harmlessly . Yet here in the old time landed men who carved the shape of England ; and here even in these lesser days , are landed uncommonly fine cod . The difficulties of the feat are these : to get ashore soundly , and then to make it good ; and after that to clinch the exploit by getting on land , which is yet a harder step . Because the steep of the ground , like a staircase void of stairs , stands facing you , and the cliff upon either side juts up close , to forbid any flanking movement , and the scanty scarp denies fair start for a rush at the power of the hill front . Yet here must the heavy boats beach themselves , and wallow and yaw in the shingly roar , while their cargo and crew ge't out of them , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a porpoise rolling , and their stem and stern going up and down like a pair of lads at seesaw . But after these heavy boats have endured all that , they have not found their rest yet without a crowning effort . Up that gravelly and gliddery ascent , which changes every groove and run at every sudden shower , but never grows any the softer-up that the heavy boats must make clamber somehow , or not a single timber of their precious frames is safe . A big rope from the capstan at the summit is made fast as soon as the tails of the jackasses ( laden with three cwt. of fish apiece ) have wagged their last flick at the brow of the steep ; and then with " yo-heaveho " above and below , through the cliffs echoing over the dull sea , the groaning and grinding of the stubborn tug begins . Each boat has her own special course to travel up , and her own special berth of safety , and she knows every jag that will gore her on the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By dint of sheer sturdiness of arms , legs , and lungs , keeping true time with the pant and the shout , steadily goes it with hoist and haul , and cheerily undulates the melody of call that rallies them all with a strong will together , until the steep bluff and the burden of the bulk by masculine labor are conquered , and a long row of powerful pinnaces displayed , as a mounted battery , against the fishful sea . With a view to this clambering ruggedness of life , all of these boats receive from their cradle a certain limber rake and accommodating curve , instead of a straight pertinacity of keel , so that they may ride over all the scandals of this arduous world . And happen what may to them , when they are at home , and gallantly balanced on the brow line of the steep , they make a bright show upon the dreariness of coast-land , hanging as they do above the gullet of the deep . Painted outside with the brightest of scarlet , and inside with the purest white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preening their wings for a flight into the depth . Here it must have been , and in the middle of all these , that the very famous Robin Lyth-prophetically treating him , but free as yet of fame or name , and simply unable to tell himself-shone in the doubt of tbe early daylight ( as a tidysized cod , if forgotten , might have shone ) upon the morning of St. Swithin , A.D. 1782 . The day and the date were remembered long by all the good people of Flam // borough , from the coming of the turn of a long bad luck and a bitter time of starving . For the weather of the summer had been worse than usual-which is no little thing to say  --  and the fish had expressed their opinion of it by the eloquent silence of absence . Therefore , as the whole place lives on fish , whether in the fishy or the fiscal form , goodly apparel was becoming very rare , even upon high Sundays ; and stomachs that might have looked well beneath it , sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has no turning ; and turns are the essence of one very vital part . Suddenly over the village had flown the news of a noble arrival of fish . From the cross-roads , and the public-house , and the licensed head-quarters of pepper and snuff , and the loop-hole where a sheep had been known to hang , in times of better trade , but never could dream of hanging now ; also from the window of the man who had had a hundred heads ( superior to his own ) shaken at him because he set up for making breeches in opposition to the women , and showed a few patterns of what he could do if any man of legs would trade with him-from all these head-centres of intelligence , and others not so prominent but equally potent , into the very smallest hole it went ( like the thrill in a troublesome tooth ) that here was a chance come of feeding , a chance at last of feeding . For the man on the cliff , the despairing watchman , weary of fastening his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length had discovered the well-known flicker , the glassy flaw , and the hovering of gulls , and had run along Weighing Lane so fast , to tell his good news in the village , that down he fell and broke his leg , exactly opposite the tailor 's shop . And this was on St. Swithin 's Eve . There was nothing to be done that night , of course , for mackerel must be delicately worked ; but long before the sun arose , all Flamborough , able to put leg in front of leg , and some who could not yet do that , gathered together where the land-hold was , above the incline for the launching of the boats . Here was a medley , not of fisher-folk alone , and all their bodily belongings , but also of the thousand things that have no soul , and get kicked about and sworn at much because they can not answer . Rollers , buoys , nets , kegs , swabs , fenders , blocks , buckets , kedges , corks , buckie-pots , oars , poppies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gear ( more than Theocritus himself could tell ) lay about , and rolled about , and upset their own masters , here and there and everywhere , upon this half acre of slip and stumble , at the top of the boat channel down to the sea , and in the faint rivalry of three vague lights , all making darkiiess visible . For very ancient lanterns , with a gentle horny glimmer , and loop-holes of large exaggeration at the top , were casting upon anything quite within their reach a general idea of the crinkled tin that framed them , and a shuffle of inconstant shadows , but refused to shed any light on friend or stranger , or clear up suspicions , more than three yards off . In rivalry with these appeared the pale disk of the moon , just setting over the western highlands , and " drawing straws " through summer haze ; while away in the northeast over the sea , a slender irregular wisp of gray , so weak that it seemed as if it were being blown away , betokened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and of figure by-and-by . But little did anybody heed such things ; every one ran against everybody else , and all was eagerness , haste , and bustle for the first great launch of the Flainborough boats , all of which must be taken in order . But when they laid hold of the boat No. 7 , which used to be the Mercy Robin , and were jerking the timber shores out , one of the men stooping under her stern beheld something white and gleaming . He put his hand down to it , and , lo ! it was a child , in imminent peril of a deadly crush , as the boat came heeling over . " Hold hard ! " cried the man , not in time with his voice , but in time with his sturdy shoulder , to delay the descent of the counter . Then he stooped underneath , while they steadied the boat , and drew forth a child in a white linen dress , heartily asleep and happy . There was no time to think of any children now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boat was beginning much to chafe upon the rope , and thirty or forty fine fellows were all waiting , loath to hurry Captain Robin ( because of the many things he had dearly lost ) , yet straining upon their own hearts to stand still . And the captain could not find his wife , who had slipped aside of the noisy scene , to have her own little cry , because of the dance // her children would have made if they had lived to see it . There were plenty of other women running all about to help , and to talk , and to give the best advice to their husbands and to one another ; but most of them naturally had their own babies , and if words came to action , quite enough to do to nurse them . On this account , Cockscroft could do no better , bound as he was to rush forth upon the sea , than lay the child gently aside of the stir , and cover him with an old sail , and leave word with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy slept on calmly still , in spite of all the din and uproar , the song and the shout , the tramp of heavy feet , the creaking of capstans , and the thump of bulky oars , and the crush of ponderous rollers . Away went these upon their errand to the sea , and then came back the grating roar and plashy jerks of launching , the plunging , and the gurgling , and the quiet murmur of cleft waves . That child slept on , in the warm good luck of having no boat keel launched upon him , nor even a human heel of bulk as likely to prove fatal . And the ancient woman fell asleep beside him , because at her time of life it was unjust that she should be astir so early . And it happened that Mrs. Cockscroft followed her troubled husband down the steep , having something in her pocket for him , which she failed to fetch to hand . So everybody went about its own business ( according to the laws of nature ) , and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a corner of her scarlet shawl . But when the day was broad and brave , and the spirit of the air was vigorous , and every cliff had a color of its own , and a character to come out with ; and beautiful boats , upon a shining sea , flashed their oars , and went up waves which clearly were the stairs of heaven ; and never a woman , come to watch her husband , could be sure how far he had carried his obedience in the matter of keeping his hat and coat on ; neither could anybody say what next those very clever fishermen might be after-nobody having a spy-glass  --  but only this being understood all round , that hunger and salt were the victuals for the day , and the children must chew the mouse-trap baits until their dads came home again ; and yet in spite of all this , with lightsome hearts ( so hope outstrips the sun , and soars with him behind her ) and a strong will , up the hill they went , to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For mackerel are good fish that do not strive to live forever , but seem glad to support the human race . Flamburians speak a rich burr of their own , broadly and handsomely distinct from that of outer Yorkshire . The same sagacious contempt for all hot haste and hurry ( which people of impatient fibre are too apt to call " a drawl " ) may here be found , as in other Yorkshire , guiding and retarding well that headlong instrument the tongue . Yet even here there is advantage on the side of Flamborougha longer resonance , a larger breadth , a deeper power of melancholy , and a stronger turn up of the tail of discourse , by some called the end of a sentence . Over and above all these there dwell in " Little Denmark " many words foreign to the real Yorkshireman . But , alas these merits of their speech can not be embodied in print without sad trouble , and result ( if successful ) still more saddening . Therefore it is proposed to let them speak in our inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very long about it . For when they are left to themselves entirely , they have so much solid matter to express , and they ripen it in their minds and throats with a process so deliberate , that strangers might condemn them briefly , and be off without hearing half of it . Whenever this happens to a Flamborough man , he finishes what he proposed to say , and then says it all over again to the wind . When the " lavings " of the village ( as the weaker part , unfit for sea , and left behind , were politely called , being very old men , women , and small children ) , full of conversation , came , upon their way back from the tide , to the gravel brow now bare of boats , they could not help discovering there the poor old woman that fell asleep because she ought to have been in bed , and by her side a little boy , who seemed to have no bed at all . The child lay above her in a tump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had tossed the old sail off , perhaps in a dream , and he threatened to roll down upon the granny . The contrast between his young , beautiful face , white raiment , and readiness to roll , and the ancient // woman 's weary age ( which it would be ungracious to describe ) , and scarlet shawl which she could not spare , and satisfaction to lie still-as the best thing left her now to do-this difference between them was enough to take anybody 's notice , facing the well-established sun . " Nanny Pegler , get oop wi ' ye ! " cried a woman even older , but of tougher constitution . " Shame on ye to hg aboot so . Be ye browt to bed this toime o ' loife ? " " A wonderful foine babby for sich an owd moother , " another proceeded with the elegant joke ; " and foine swaddles too , wi ' solid gowd upon em ! " " Stan ' ivery one o ' ye oot o ' the way , " cried ancient Nanny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gie ma t ' bairn , an ' nawbody sall hey him but Joan Cockscroft . " Joan Cockscroft , with a heavy heart , was lingering far behind the rest , thinking of the many merry launches , when her smart young Robin would have been in the boat with his father , and her pretty little Mercy clinging to her hand upon the homeward road , and prattling of the fish to be caught that day ; and inasmuch as Joan had not been able to get face to face with her husband on the beach , she had not yet heard of the stranger child . But soon the women sent a little boy to fetch her , and she came among them , wondering what it could be . For now a debate of some vigor was arising upon a momentous and exciting point , though not so keen by a hundredth part as it would have been twenty years afterward . For the eldest old woman had pronounced her decision . " Tell ye wat , ah dea n't think bud wat yon bairn mud be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general retreat ; for though the immortal Napoleon had scarcely finished changing his teeth as yet , a chronic uneasiness about Crappos haunted that coast already , and they might have sent this little boy to pave the way , being capable of almost everything . " Frogman ! " cried the old woman next to her by birth , and believed to have higher parts , though not yet ripe . " Na na ; what Frogman here ? Frogmen ha ' skinny shanks , and larks ' heels , and holes down their bodies like lamperns . No sign of no frog aboot yon bairn . As fair as a wench , and as clean as a tyke . A ' mought a most been born to Flaambro ' . And what gowd ha ' Crappos got , poor divils ? " This opened the gate for a clamor of discourse ; for there surely could be no denial of her words . And yet while her elder was alive and out of bed , the habit of the village was to listen to her say , unless any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were thus divided , Mrs. Cockscroft came , and they stood aside . For she had been kind to everybody when her better chances were ; and now in her trouble all were grieved because she took it so to heart . Joan Cockscroft did not say a word , but glanced at the child with some contempt . In spite of white linen and yellow gold , what was he to her own dead Robin ? But suddenly this child , whatever he was , and vastly soever inferior , opened his eyes and sent home their first glance to the very heart of Joan Cockscroft . It was the exact look  --  or so she always said - of her dead angel , when she denied him something , for the sake of his poor dear stomach . With an outburst of tears , she flew straight to the little one , snatched him in her arms , and tried to cover him with kisses . The child , however , in a lordly manner , did not seem to like it . He drew away his red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew out of his beautiful eyes , higher passion than that of any Cockscroft . And he tried to say something which no one could make out . And women of high consideration , looking on , were wicked enough to be pleased at this , and say that he must be a young lord , and they had quite foreseen it . But Joan knew what children are , and soothed him down so with delicate hands , and a gentle look , and a subtle way of warming his cold places , that he very soon began to cuddle into her , and smile . Then she turned round to the other people , with both of his arms flung round her neck , and his cheek laid on her shoulder , and she only said , " The Lord hath sent him . " CHAPTER XI . Dn . IJPANDowN . THE practice of Flamborough was to listen fairly to anything that might be said by any one truly of the native breed , and to receive it well into the crust of the // mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , to sacrifice this nature even after that , it might not take root , to his stern position as pastor and master unless it were fixed in its settlement by of an up-hill parish , with many wrong their two great powers  --  the law , and the things to be kept under . But while he Lord . succeeded in the form now and then , he qwq sound it sounds-if divinity is a matter for Tom , Dick , or Harry , how can there be degrees in it ? He held a degree in it , and felt what it had cost ; and not the parish only , but even his own wife , was proud to have a doctor every Sunday . And his wife took care that his rich red hood , kerseymere small-clothes , and black silk stockings upon calves of dignity , were such that his congregation scorned the surgeons all the way to Beverley . Happy in a pleasant nature , kindly heart , and tranquil home , he was also happy in those awards of life in which men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three good children , doing well , and vigorous and hardy as the air and clime and cliffs . His wife was not quite of his own age , but old enough to understand and follow him faithfully down the slope of years . A wife with mind enough to know that a husband is not faultless , and with heart enough to feel that if he were , she would not love him so . And under her were comprised their children-two boys at school , and a baby-girl at home . So far , the rector of this parish was truly blessed and blessing . But in every man 's lot must be some crook , since this crooked world turned round . In Parson Upround 's lot the crook might seem a very small one ; but he found it almost too big for him . His dignity and peace of mind , large good-will of ministry and strong Christian sense of magistracy , all were sadly pricked and wounded by a very small thorn in the flesh of his spirit . Almost every honest man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy at school he could not do without one , and if the other boys valued him , perhaps he had a dozen . And afterward , when there is less perception of right and wrong and character , in the weaker time of manhood , he may earn another , if the spirit is within him . But woe is him if a nasty foe , or somebody trying to be one , annoyed for the moment with him , yet meaning no more harm than pepper , smite him to the quick , at venture , in his most retired and privyconscienced hole . And when this is done by a Nonconformist to a Doctor of Divinity , and the man who does it owes some money to the man he does it to , can the latter gentleman take a large and genial view of his critics : This gross wrong and ungrateful outVOL . LIX. - No. 353. - 49 rage was inflicted thus . A leading Methodist from Filey town , who owed the doctor half a guinea , came one summer and set up his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon fish for change of diet , and because he could get it for nothing . This was a man of some eloquence , and his calling in life was cobbling , and to encourage him therein , and keep him from theology , the rector not only forgot his half guinea , but sent him three or four pairs of riding-boots to mend , and let him charge his own price , which was strictly heterodox . As a part of the bargain , this fellow came to church , and behaved as well as could be hoped of a man who had received his money . He sat by a pillar , and no more than crossed his legs at the worst thing that disagreed with him . And it might have done him good , and made a decent cobbler of him if the parson had only held him when he got him on the hook . But this is the very thing which all great preachers are too benevolent to do . Dr. Upround looked at this sinner , who was getting into a fright upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford it ; and the cobbler could no more look up to the doctor than when he charged him a full crown beyond the contract . In his kindness for all who seemed convinced of sin , the good preacher halted , and looked at Mr. Jobbins with a soft , relaxing gaze . Jobbins appeared as if he would come to church forever , and never cheat any sound clergyman again ; whereupon the generous divine omitted a whole page of menaces prepared for him , and passed prematurely to the tender strain which always winds up a good sermon . Now what did Jobbins do in return for all this magnanimous mercy ? Invited to dine with the senior church-warden upon the strength of having been at church , and to encourage him for another visit , and being asked , as soon as ever decency permitted , what he thought of Parson Upround 's doctrine , between two crackles of young griskin ( come straight from the rectory pig-sty ) , he was grieved to express a stern opinion long remembered at Flam-borough : " Ca ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un Dr. Upandoon . " ' From that day forth the rector of the parish was known far and wide as " Dr. Upandown , " even among those who loved him best . For the name well described // his benevolent practice of undoing any harsh thing he might have said , sometimes by a smile , and very often with a shilling , or a basket of spring cabbages . So that Mrs. Upround , when buttoning up his coat-which he always forgot to do for himself-did it with the words , " My dear , now scold no one ; really it is becoming too expensive . " " Shall I abandon duty , " he would answer , with some dignity , " while a shilling is sufficient to enforce it ? " Dr. Upround 's people had now found out that their minister and magistrate discharged his duty toward his pillow , no less than to his pulpit . His parish had acquired , through the work of generations , a habit of getting up at night , and being all alive at cock-crow ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bow  --  or rather rise  --  to nightwatch . But a little of that exercise lasted him for long ; and he liked to talk of it afterward , but for the present was obliged to drop it . For he found himself pale , when his wife made him see himself ; and his hours of shaving were so dreadful ; and scarcely a bit of fair dinner could be got , with the whole of the day thrown out so . In short , he settled it wisely that the fishers of fish must yield to the habits of fish , which can not be corrected ; but the fishers of men ( who can live without catching them ) need not be up to all their hours , but may take them reasonably . His parishioners-who could do very well without him , as far as that goes , all the week , and by no means wanted him among their boats-joyfully left him to his own time of day , and no more worried him out of season than he worried them so . It became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big bell , which the rector had put up to challenge everybody 's spiritual need , until the stable clock behind the bell had struck ten and finished gurgling . For this reason on St. Swithin 's morn , in the said year 1782 , the grannies , wives , and babes of Flamborough , who had been to help the launch , but could not pull the laboring oar , nor even hold the tiller , spent the time till ten o'clock in seeing to their own affairs  --  the most laudable of all pursuits for almost any woman . And then , with some little dispute among them ( the offspring of the merest accident ) , they arrived in some force at the gate of Dr. Upround , and no woman liked to pull the bell , and still less to let another woman do it for her . But an old man came up who was quite deaf , and every one asked him to do it . In spite of the scarcity of all good things , Mrs. Cockscroft had thoroughly fed the little stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set him up in her own bed , and wrapped him in her woollen shawl , because he shivered sadly ; and there he stared about with wondering eyes , and gave great orders-so far as his new nurse could make out  --  but speaking gibberish , as she said , and flying into a rage because it was out of Christian knowledge . But he seemed to understand some English , although he could only pronounce two words , both short , and in such conjunction quite unlawful for any except the highest Spiritual Power . Mrs. Cockscroft , being a pious woman , hoped that her ears were wrong , or else that the words were foreign and meant no harm , though the child seemed to take in much of what was said , and when asked his name , answered , wrathfully , and as if everybody was bound to know , " Izunsabe ! Izunsabe 1 " But now , when brought before Dr. Upround , no child of the very best English stock could look more calm and peaceful . He could walk well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind woman who had so taken him up was only too proud to carry him . Whatever the rector and magistrate might say , her meaning was to keep this little one , with her husband 's good consent , which she was sure of getting . " Set him down , ma'am , " the doctor said , when he had heard from half a dozen good women all about him ; " Mistress Cockscroft , put him on his legs , and let me question him. ** But the child resisted this proceeding . With nature 's inborn and just loathing of examination , he spun upon his little heels , and swore with all his might , at the same time throwing up his hands and twirling his thumbs in a very odd and foreign way . " What a shocking child ! " cried Mrs. Upround , who was come to know all about it . " Jane , run away with Miss Janetta . " " The child is not to blame , " said the rector , " but only the people who have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head I have never seen in all my life ; and we studied such things at Cambridge . My fine little fellow , shake hands with me . The boy broke off his vicious little dance , and looked up at this tall gentleman with great surprise . His dark eyes dwelt upon the parson 's kindly face , with that power of inquiry which the very young possess , and then he put both little bands into the gentleman 's , and burst into a torrent of the most heart-broken tears . " Poor little man ! " said the rector , very gently , taking him up in his arms and patting the silky black curls , while great drops fell , and a nose was rubbed on his shoulder ; " it is early for you to begin bad times . Why , how old are you , if you please ? " The little boy sat up on the kind man 's arm , and poked a small investigating finger into the ear that was next to him , and the locks just beginning to be marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and tossed his chin up , evidently meaning , " Make your best of that . " And the women drew a long breath , and nudged at one another . " Well done ! Four years old , my dear . You see that he understands English well enough , " said the parson to his parishioners : " he will tell us all about himself by-and-by , if we do not hurry him . You think him a French child . I do not , though the name which he gives himself , Izunsabe , ' has a French aspect about it . Let me think . I will try him with a French interrogation : Parlez-vous Fran*ais , mon enfan ? " Dr. Upround watched the effect of his words with outward calm , but an inward flutter . For if this clever child should reply in French , the doctor could never go on with it , but must stand there before his congregation in a worse position than when he lost his place , as sometimes happened , in a sermon . With wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his knowledge ; and he determined to follow them up with Latin if the worst came to the worst . But luckily no harm came of this , but , contrariwise , a lasting good . For the child looked none the wiser , while the doctor 's influence was increased . " Aha ! " the good parson cried . " I was sure that he was no Frenchman . But we must hear something about him very soon , for what you tell me is impossible . If he had come from the sea , he must have been wet ; it could never be otherwise . Whereas , his linen clothes are dry , and even quite lately fulleredironed you might call it . " " Please your worship , " cried Mrs. Cockscroft , who was growing wild with jealousy , " I did up all his little things , hours and hours ere your hoose was up . " " Ah , you had night - work ! To be sure ! Were his clothes dry or wet when you took them off ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet not to say very wet . Betwixt and between , like my good master 's , when he cometh from a pour of rain , or a heavy spray . And the color of the land was upon them here and there . And the gold tags were sewn with something wonderful . My best pair of scissors would not touch it . I was frightened to put them to the tub , your worship ; but they up and shone lovely like a tailor 's buttons . My master hath found him , Sir ; and it lies with him to keep him . And the Lord hath taken away our Bob . " " It is true , " said Dr. Upround , gently , and placing the child in her arms again , " the Almighty has chastened you very sadly . This child is not mine to dispose of , nor yours ; but if he will comfort you , keep him till we hear of him . I will take down in writing the particulars of the case , when Captain Robin has come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later ; and then you will sign them , and they shall be published . For you know , Mrs. Cockscroft , however much you may be taken with him , you must not turn kidnapper . Moreover , it is needful , as there may have been some wreck ( though none of you seem to have heard of any ) , that this strange occurrence should be made known . Then , if nothing is heard of it , you can keep him , and may the Lord bless him to you ! " Without any more ado , she kissed the child , and wanted to carry him straight away , after courtesying to his worship ; but all the other women insisted on a smack of him , for pity 's sake , and the pleasure of the gold , and to confirm the settlement . And a settlement it was , for nothing came of any publication of the case , such as in those days could be made without great expense and exertion. // So the boy grew up , tall , brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as behooved a boy cast on the winds . So far as that goes , his foster - parents would rather have found him more steady and less comely , for if he was to step into their lost son 's shoes , he might do it without seeming to outshine him . But they got over that little jealousy in time , when the boy began to be useful , and , so far as was possible , they kept him under by quoting against him the character of Bob , bringing it back from heaven of a much higher quality than ever it was upon the earth . In vain did this living child aspire to such level ; how can an earthly boy compare with one who never did a wrong thing , as soon as he was dead ? Passing that difficult question , and forbearing to compare a boy with angels , be he what he will , his first need ( after that of victuals ) is a name whereby his fellow-boys may know him . Is he to be shouted at with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is he to be called ( as if in high rebuke ) , " Boy ? " And yet there are grown-up folk who do all this without hesitation , failing to remember their own predicament at a by-gone period . Boys are as useful , in their way , as any other order ; and if they can be said to do some mischief , they can not be said to do it negligently . It is their privilege and duty to be truly active ; and their Maker , having spread a dull world before them , has provided them with gifts of play while their joints are supple . The present boy , having been born without a father or a mother ( so far as could yet be discovered ) , was driven to do what our ancestors must have done when it was less needful . That is to say , to work his own name out by some distinctive process . When the parson had clearly shown him not to be a Frenchman a large contumely spread itself about , by reason of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which might be meant for Isaak ) , that he was sprung from a race more honored now than a hundred years ago . But the women declared that it could not be ; and the rector desiring to christen him , because it might never have been done before , refused point-blank to put any " Isaac " in , and was satisfied with " Robin " only , the name of the man who had saved him . The rector showed deep knowledge of his flock , which looked upon Jews as the goats of the Kingdom ; for any Jew must die for a world of generations ere ever a Christian thinks much of him . But finding him not to be a Jew , the other boys , instead of being satisfied , condemned him for a Dutchman . Whatever he was , the boy throve well , and being so flouted by his playmates , took to thoughts and habits and amusements of his own . In-door life never suited him at all , nor too much of hard learning , although his capacity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick heads of young Flamborough made in a whole leap-year of Sundays . For any Flamburian boy was considered a " Brain Scholar , " and a " Head-Languager , " when he could write down the parson 's text , and chalk up a fish on the weigh-board so that his father or mother could tell in three guesses what manner of fish it was . And very few indeed had ever passed this trial . For young Robin it was a very hard thing to be treated so by the other boys . He could run , or jump , or throw a stone , or climb a rock with the best of them ; but all these things he must do by himself , simply because he had no name . A feeble youth would have moped , but Robin only grew more resolute . Alone he did what the other boys would scarcely in competition dare . No crag was too steep for him , no cave too dangerous and wavebeaten , no race of the tide so strong and swirling as to scare him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having very little else to rejoice in ; and he won for himself by nimble ways and rapid turns on land and sea , the name of " Lithe , " or " Lyth , " and made it famous even far inland . For it may be supposed that his love of excitement , versatility , and daring demanded a livelier outlet than the slow toil of deep-sea fishing . To the most patient , persevering , and long-suffering of the arts , Robin Lyth did not take kindly , although he was so handy with a boat . Old Robin vainly strove to cast his angling mantle over him . The gifts of the youth were brighter and higher ; he showed an inborn fitness for the lofty development of free trade . Eminent powers must force their way , as now they were doing with Napoleon ; and they did the same with Robin Lyth , without exacting tithe in kind of all the foremost human race . // CHAPTER XII . IN A LANE , NOT ALONE . STEPHEN ANERLEY 'S daughter was by no means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , unless any one mistrusted her , and showed it by cross-questioning . When this was done , she resented it quickly by concealing the very things which she would have told of her own accord ; and it so happened that the person to whom of all she should have been most open , was the one most apt to check her by suspicious curiosity . And now her mother already began to do this , as concerned the smuggler , knowing from the revenue officer that Mary must have seen him . Mary , being a truthful damsel , told no lies about it ; but , on the other hand , she did not rush forth with all the history , as she probably would have done if left unexamined . And so she said nothing about the ear-ring , or the run that was to come off that week , or the riding-skirt , or a host of little things , including her promise to visit Bempton Lane . On the other hand , she had a mind to tell her father , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cross that evening , not with her , but with the world at large ; and that discouraged her ; and then she thought that being an officer of the king-as he liked to call himself sometimes-he might feel bound to give information about the impending process of free trade ; which to her would be a breach of honor , considering how she knew of it . Upon the whole , she heartily wished that she never had seen that Robin Lyth ; and then she became ashamed of herself for indulging such a selfish wish . For he might have been lying dead but for her ; and then what would become of the many poor people whose greatest comfort he was said to be ? And what good could arise from his destruction , if cruel people compassed it ? Free trade must be carried on . for the sake of everybody , including Captain Carroway himself ; and if an old and ugly man succeeded a young and generous one as leader of the free-trade movement , all the women in the country would put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a strong determination not to think twice of what any one might say who did not understand the subject , Mary was forced at last to the stern conclusion that she must keep her promise . Not only be- cause it was a promise-although that went a very long way with her  --  but also because there seemed no other chance of performing a positive duty . Simple honesty demanded that she should restore to the owner a valuable , and beyond all doubt important , piece of property . Two hours had she spent in looking for it , and deprived her dear father of his breakfast shrimps ; and was all this trouble to be thrown away , and herself , perhaps , accused of theft , because her mother was so short and sharp in wanting to know everything , and to turn it her own way ? The trinket , which she had found at last , seemed to be a very uncommon and precious piece of jewelry ; it was made of pure gold , minutely chased and threaded with curious workmanship , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be characters of some foreign language : there might be a spell , or even witchcraft , in it , and the sooner it was out of her keeping the better . Nevertheless she took very good care of it , wrapping it in lamb'swool , and peeping at it many times a day , to be sure that it was safe , until it made her think of the owner so much , and the many wonders she had heard about him , that she grew quite angry with herself and it , and locked it away , and then looked at it again . As luck would have it , on the very day when Mary was to stroll down Bempton Lane ( not to meet any one , of course , but simply for the merest chance of what might happen ) , her father had business at Driffield corn market , which would keep him from home nearly all the day . When his daughter heard of it she was much cast down ; for she hoped that he might have been looking about on the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon ; and although he could not see Bempton Lane at all , perhaps , without some newly acquired power of seeing round sharp corners , still it would have been a comfort and a strong resource for conscience to have felt that he was not so very far away . And this feeling of want made his daughter resolve to have some one at any rate near her . If Jack had only been at home , she need have sought no further , for he would have entered into all her thoughts about it , and obeyed her orders beautifully . But Willie was quite different , and hated any trouble , being spoiled so by his mother and the maidens all around them . // However , in such a strait , what was there to do but to trust in Willie , who was old enough , being five years in front of Mary , and then to try to make him sensible ? Willie Anerley had no idea that anybody-far less his own sistercould take such a view of him . He knew himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superior in his original gifts , and his manner of making use of them , to the rest of the family put together . He had spent a month in Glasgow , when the whole place was astir with the ferment of many great inventions , and another month in Edinburgh , when that noble city was aglow with the dawn of large ideas ; also , he had visited London , foremost of his family , and seen enough new things there to fill all Yorkshire with surprise ; and the result of such wide experience was that he did not like hard work at all . Neither could he even be content to accept and enjoy , without labor of his own , the many good things provided for him . He was always trying to discover something which never seemed to answer and continually , flying after something new , of which he never got fast hold . In a word , he was spoiled , by nature first , and then by circumstances , for the peaceful life of his ancestors , and the unacknowledged blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with me Mary said to him that day , catching him as he ran down stairs to air some inspiration . " Will you come with me for just one hour ? I wish you would ; and I would be so thankful . " " Child , it is quite impossible , " he an*wered , with a frown which set off his del*cate eyebrows and high but rather narrow forehead ; " you always want me at the very moment when I have the most important work in hand . Any childish whim of yours matters more than hours and hours of hard labor . " " Oh , Willie , but you know how I try to help you , and all the patterns I cut out last week ! Do come for once , Willie ; if you refuse , you will never , never forgive yourself . " Willie Anerley was as good-natured as any self-indulged youth can be ; he loved his sister in his way , and was indebted to her for getting out of a great many little scrapes . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some desire to know what it was about . Moreover-which settled the point-he was getting tired of sticking to one thing for a time unusually long with him . But he would not throw away the chance of scoring a huge debt of gratitude . " Well , do what you like with me , " he answered , with a smile ; " I never can have my own way five minutes . It serves me quite right for being so good-natured . " Mary gave bim a kiss , which must have been an object of ambition to anybody else ; but it only made him wipe his mouth ; and presently the two set forth upon the path toward Bempton . Robin Lyth had chosen well his place for meeting Mary . The lane ( of which he knew every yard as well as he knew the rocks themselves ) was deep and winding , and fringed with bushes , so that an active and keen-eyed man might leap into thicket almost before there was a fair chance of shooting him . He knew well enough that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bold " coastriders , " despairing by this time of catching him at sea , and longing for the weight of gold put upon his head , might not be setting privy snares to catch him in his walks abroad . They had done so when they pursued him up the Dike ; and though he was inclined to doubt the strict legality of that proceeding , he could not see his way to a fair discussion of it , in case of their putting a bullet through him . And this consideration made him careful . The brother and sister went on well by the foot-path over the uplands of the farm , and crossing the neck of the Flaniburn peninsula , tripped away merrily northward . The wheat looked healthy , and the barley also , and a four-acre patch of potatoes smelled sweetly ( for the breeze of them was pleasant in their wholesome days ) , and Willie , having overworked his brain , according to his own account of it , strode along loftily before his sister , casting over his shoulder an eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she interrupted him . But as nothing ever came of them , they need not here be stated . From a practical point of view , however , as they both had to live upon the profits of the farm , it pleased them to observe what a difference there was when they had surmounted the chine and began to descend toward the north upon other people 's land . Here all was damp and cold and slow ; and chalk looked slimy instead of being clean ; and shadowy places had an oozy cast ; and trees // ( wherever they could stand ) were facing the east with wrinkled visage , and the west with wiry beards . Willie ( who had , among other great inventions , a scheme for improvement of the climate ) was reminded at once of all the things he meant to do in that way ; and making , as he always did , a great point of getting observations first  --  a point whereon he stuck fast mainly-without any time for delay he applied himself to a rapid study of th' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had seen in Scotland , yet differing so as to prove , more clearly than even their resemblance did , the value of his discovery . " Look ! " he cried ; " can anything be clearer ? The cause of all these evils is not ( as an ignorant person might suppose ) the want of sunshine , or too much wet , but an inadequate movement of the air- " " Why , I thought it was always blowing up here . The very last time I came , my bonnet strings were split . " " You do not understand me ; you never do . When I say inadequate , I mean , of course , incorrect , inaccurate , unequable . Now the air is a fluid ; you may stare as you like , Mary , but the air has been proved to be a fluid . Very well ; no fluid in large bodies moves with an equal velocity throughout . Part of it is rapid and part quite stagnant . The stagnant places of the air produce this green scum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the overrapid motion causes this iron appearance , this hard surface , and general sterility . By the simplest of simple contrivances , I make this evil its own remedy . An equable impulse given to the air produces an adequate uniform flow , preventing stagnation in one place , and excessive vehemence in another . And the beauty of it is that by my new invention I make the air itself correct and regulate its own inequalities . " " How clever you are , to be sure I " exclaimed Mary , wondering that her father could not see it . " Oh , Willie , you will make your fortune by it ! However do you do it " The simplicity of it is such that even you can understand it . All great discoveries are simple . I fix in a prominent situation a large and vertically revolving fan , of a light and vibrating substance . The movement of the air causes this to rotate by the mere force of the impact . The rotation and the vibration of the fan convert an irregular impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elasticity of the fluid called , in popular language , the air , ' that for miles around the rotation of this fan regulates the circulation , modifies extremes , annihilates sterility , and makes it quite impossible for moss and green scum and all this sour growth to live . Even you can see , Mary , how beautiful it is . ' , " Yes , that I can , " she answered , simply , as they turned the corner upon a large windmill , with arms revolving merrily ; " but , Willie dear , would not Farmer Topping 's mill , perpetually going as it is , answer the same purpose ? And yet the moss seems to be as thick as ever here , and the ground as naked . " " Tush ! " cried Willie . " Stuff and nonsense ! When will you girls understand ? Good-by ! I will throw away no more time on you . " Without stopping to finish his sentence he was off and out of sight both of the mill and Mary , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offending him , could even beg his pardon , or say how much she wanted him ; for she had not dared as yet to tell him what was the purpose of her walk , his nature being such that no one , not even his own mother , could tell what conclusion he might come to upon any practical question . He might rush off at once to put the revenue men on the smuggler 's track , or he might stop his sister from going , or he might ( in the absence of his father ) order a feast to be prepared , and fetch the outlaw to be his guest . So Mary had resolved not to tell him until the last moment , when he could do none of these things . But now she must either go on all alone , or give up her purpose and break her promise . After some hesitation she determined to go on , for the place would scarcely seem so very lonely now with the windmill in view , which would always remind her henceforth of her dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyth , whose fame for chivalry was everywhere , and whose character was all in all to him with the ladies who bought his silks and lace , would see her through all danger caused by confidence in him ; and really it was too bad of her to admit any paltry misgivings . But reason as she might , her young conscience told her that this was // not the proper thing to do , and she made up her mind not to do it again . Then she laughed at the notion of being ever even asked , and told herself that she was too conceited ; and to cut the matter short , went very bravely down the hill . The lane , which came winding from the beach up to the windmill , was as pretty a lane as may anywhere be found in any other county than that of Devon . With a Devonshire lane it could not presume to vie , having little of the glorious garniture of fern , and nothing of the crystal brook that leaps at every corner ; no arches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honeysuckle , and a sight of other wants which people feel who have lived in the plenitude of everything . But in spite of all that , the lane was very fine for Yorkshire . On the other hand , Mary had prettier ankles , and a more graceful and lighter walk , than the Devonshire lanes , which like to echo something , for the most part seem accustomed to ; and the short dress of the time made good such favorable facts when found . Nor was this all that could be said , for the maiden ( while her mother was so busy pickling cabbage , from which she drove all intruders ) had managed to forget what the day of the week was , and had opened the drawer that should be locked up until Sunday . To walk with such a handsome tall fellow as Willie compelled her to look like something too , and without any thought of it she put her best hat on , and a very pretty thing with some French name , and made of a delicate peach-colored silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neatest of knots at the small of her back , which at that time of life was very small . All these were the gifts of her dear uncle Popplewell , upon the other side of Filey , who might have been married for forty years , *but nobody knew how long it was , because he had no children , and so he made Mary his darling . And this ancient gentleman had leanings toward free trade . Whether these goods were French or not-which no decent person could think of asking-no French damsel could have put them on better , or shown a more pleasing appearance in them ; for Mary 's desire was to please all people who meant no harm to her-as nobody could  --  and yet to let them know that her object was only to do what was right , and to never think *of asking whether she looked this , that , or the other . Her mother , as a matter of duty , told her how plain she was almost every day ; but the girl was not of that opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did nine times in ten ) by turning the glass to the wall , and declaring that beauty was a snare skin-deep , with a frown of warning instead of a smile of comfort , then Mary believed in her looking-glass again , and had the smile of com - fort on her own face . However , she never thought of that just now , but only of how she could do her duty , and have no trouble in her own mind with thinking , and satisfy her father when she told him all , as she meant to do , when there could be no harm done to any one ; and this , as she heartily hoped , would be to-morrow . And truly , if there did exist any vanity at all , it was not confined to the sex in which it is so much more natural and comely . For when a very active figure came to light suddenly , at a little elbow of the lane , and with quick steps advanced toward Mary , she was lost in surprise at the gayety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A broad hat , looped at the side , and having a pointed black crown , with a scarlet feather and a dove-colored brim , sat well upon the mass of crisp b*ack curls . A short blue jacket of the finest Flemish cloth , and set ( not too thickly ) with embossed silver buttons , left properly open the strong brown neck , while a shirt of pale blue silk , with a turned-down collar of fine needle-work , fitted , without a wrinkle or a pucker , the broad and amply rounded chest . Then a belt of brown leather , with an anchor clasp , and empty loops for either fire-arm or steel , supported true sailor 's trousers of the purest white and the noblest man-of-war cut ; and where these widened at the instep shone a lovely pair of pumps , with buckles radiant of best Bristol diamonds . The wearer of all these splendors smiled , and seemed to become them as they became him . " Well , " thought Mary , " how free trade must pay ! What a pity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual quickness , and the selfesteem which added such lustre to his character , the smuggler perceived what was passing in her mind , but he was not rude enough to say so . " Young lady , " he began  --  and Mary , with all her wisdom , could not help being // fond of that- " young lady , I was quite sure that you would keep your word . " " I never do anything else , " she answered , showing that she scarcely looked at him . " I have found this for you , and then good-by . " " Surely you will wait to hear my thanks , and to know what made me dare to ask you , after all you had done for me already , to begin again for me . But I am such an outcast that I never should have done it . " " I never saw any one look more thoroughly unlike an outcast , " Mary said ; and then she was angry with herself for speaking , and glancing , and , worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land can never understand what we go through , " Robin replied , in his softest voice , as rich as the murmur of the summer sea . " When we expect great honors , we try to look a little tidy , as any one but a common boor would do ; and we laugh at ourselves for trying to look well , after all the knocking about we get . Our time is short-we must make the most of it . " " Oh , please not to talk in such a dreadful way , " said Mary . " You remind me of my dear friend Dr. Upround  --  the very best man in the whole world , I believe . He always says to me , Robin , Robin- " ' " What ! is Dr. Upandown a friend of yours ? " Mary exclaimed , in amazement , and with a stoppage of the foot that was poised for quick departure . " Dr. Upandown , as many people call him , " said the smuggler , with a tone of condemnation , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain and Mistress Cockscroft , who may have been heard of at Anerley Manor . Dr. Upround is our magistrate and clergyman , and he lets people say what they like against me , while he honors me with his friendship . I must not stay long to thank you even , because I am going to the dear old doctor 's for supper at seven o'clock and a game of chess . " " Oh dear ! oh dear ! And he is such a Justice ! And yet they shot at you last week ! It makes me wonder when I hear such things . " " Young lady , it makes everybody wonder . In my opinion there never could be a more shameful murder than to shoot me ; and yet but for you it would surely have been done . " " You must not dwell upon suchthings , " said Mary ; " they may have a very bad effect upon your mind . But good-by , Captain Lyth ; I forgot that I was robbing Dr. Upround of your society . " " Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon your own land after all your trouble ? My road to Flamborough lies that way . Surely you will not refuse to hear what made me so anxious about this bauble , which now will be worth ten times as much . I never saw it look so bright before . " " It-it must be the sand has made it shine , " the maiden stammered , with a fine bright blush ; " it does the same to my shrimping net . " " Ah , shrimping is a very fine pursuit ! There is nothing I love better ; what pools I could show you , if I only might ; pools where you may fill a sack with large prawns in a single tide-pools known to nobody but myself . When do you think of going shrimping next ? " " Perhaps next summer I may try again , if Captain Carroway will come with me . " " That is too unkind of you . How very harsh you are to me ! I could hardly have believed it after all that you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of this relic ? " " If I could stop , I should like it very much . But my brother , who came with me , may perhaps be waiting for me . " Mary knew that this was not very likely ; still , it was just possible , for Willie 's ill tempers seldom lasted very long ; and she wanted to let the smuggler know that she had not come all alone to meet him . " I shall not be two minutes , " Robin Lyth replied ; " I have been forced to learn short talking . May I tell you about this trinket ? " " Yes , if you will only begin at once , and finish by the time we get to that corner . " That is very short measure for a tale , *7 said Robin , though he liked her all the better for such qualities ; " however , I will try ; only walk a little slower . Nobody knows where I was born , any more than they know how or why . Only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without knowing anything about it , they say that I had very wonderful buttons of gold upon a linen dress , adorned with gold-lace , which I used to wear on Sundays . Dr. Upround ordered them to keep those buttons , and was to have had // them in his own care ; but before that , all of them were lost save two . My parents , as I call them from their wonderful goodness , kinder than the ones who have turned me on the world ( unless themselves went out of it ) , resolved to have my white coat done up grandly , when I grew too big for it , and to lay it by in lavender ; and knowing of a great man in the goldlace trade , as far away as Scarborough , they sent it by a fishing-smack to him , with people whom they knew thoroughly . That was the last of it ever known here . The man swore a manifest that he never saw it , and threatened them with libel ; and the smack was condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle she happened to carry ; and nobody knows any more of it . But two of the buttons had fallen off , and good mother had put them by , to give a last finish to the coat herself ; and when I grew up , and had to go to sea at night , they were turned into a pair of ear-rings . There , now , Miss Anerley , I have not been long , and you know all about it . " " How very lonesome it must be for you ; " said Mary , with a gentle gaze , which , coming from such lovely eyes , went straight into his heart , " to have no one belonging to you by right , and to seem to belong to nobody ! I am sure I can not tell whatever I should do without any father , or mother , or uncle , or even a cousin to be certain of . " " All the ladies seem to think that it is rather hard upon me , " Robin answered , with an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very best to get on without them . And one thing that helps me most of all is when kind ladies , who have good hearts , allow me to talk to them as if I had a sister . This makes me forget what I am sometimes . " " You never should try to forget what you are . Everybody in the world speaks well of you . Even that cruel Lieutenant Carroway can not help admiring you . And if you have taken to free trade , what else could you do , when you had no friends , and even your coat was stolen ? " " High-minded people take that view of it , I know . But I do not pretend to any such excuse . I took to free trade for the sake of my friends  --  to support the old couple who have been so good to me . " " That is better still ; it shows such good principle . My uncle Popplewell has studied the subject of what they call political economy , ' and he says that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to go on so that the government must give way at last . However , I need not instruct you about that ; and you must not stop any longer . " " Miss Anerley , I will not encroach upon your kindness . You have said things that I never shall forget . On the Continent I meet very many ladies who tell me good things , and make me better ; but not at all as you have done . A minute of talk with you is worth an hour with anybody else . But I fear that you laugh at me all the while , and are only too glad to be rid of me . Good-by . May I kiss your hand ? God bless you ! " Mary had no time to say a single word , or even to express her ideas by a look , before Robin Lyth , with all his bright apparel , was " conspicuous by his absence . " As a diving bird disappears from a gun , or a trout from a shadow on his hover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great free-trader had vanished into lightsome air , and left emptiness behind him . The young maid , having been prepared to yield him a few yards more of good advice , if he held out for another corner , now could only say to herself that she never had met such a wonderful man . So active , strong , and astonishingly brave ; so thoroughly acquainted with foreign lands , yet superior to their ladies ; so able to see all the meaning of good words , and to value them when offered quietly ; so sweet in his manner , and voice , and looks ; and with all his fame so unpretending , and-much as it frightened her to think it-really seeming to be afraid of her . CHAPTER XIII . GRUMBLING AND GROWLING . WHILE these successful runs went on , and great authorities smiled at seeing the little authorities set at naught , and men of the revenue smote their breasts for not being born good smugglers , and the general public was well pleased , and congratulated them cordially upon their accomplishment of naught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew no comfort . He strode up and down at Coast-guard Point , and communed with himself , while Robin held sweet converse in the lane . // " Why was I born ? " the sad Carroway cried ; * why was I thoroughly educated and trained in both services of the king , expected to rise , and beginning to rise , till a vile bit of splinter stopped me , and then sent down to this hole of a place to starve , and be laughed at , and baffled by a boy ? Another lucky run , and the revenue bamboozled , and the whole of us sent upon a wild-goose chase ! Every gapper-mouth zany grinning at me , and scoundrels swearing that I get my share ! And the only time I have had my dinner with my knees crook 'd , for at least a fortnight , was at Anerley Farm on Sunday . I am not sure that even they would n't turn against me ; I am certain that pretty girl would . I 've a great mind to throw it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly the work for a gentleman born , and the grandson of a rear - admiral . Tinkers ' and tailors ' sons get the luck now ; and a man of good blood is put on the back shelf , behind the blacking-bottles . A man who has battled for his country- " " Charles , are you coming to your dinner , once more " No , I am not . There 's no dinner worth coming to . You and the children may eat the rat pie . A man who has battled for his country , and bled till all his veins were empty , and it took two men to hold him up , and yet waved his sword at the head of them-it is the downright contradiction of the world in everything for him to poke about with pots and tubs , like a pig in a brewery , grainhunting . " " Once more , Charles , there is next to nothing left . The children are eating for their very lives . If you stay out there another minute , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so much stomach , and so little to put into it ! My dear , put a little bit under a basin , if any of them has no appetite . I wanted just to think a little . " " Charles , they have all got tremendous appetites . It is the way the wind is . You may think by-and-by , but if you want to eat , you must do it now , or never . " " Never ' never suits me in that matter , " the brave lieutenant answered . " Matilda , put Geraldine to warm the pewter plate for me . Geraldine darling , you can do it with your mouth full . " The commander of the coast - guard turned abruptly from his long indignant stride , and entered the cottage provided for him , and which he had peopled so speedily . Small as it was , it looked beautifully clean and neat , and everybody used to wonder how Mrs. Carroway kept it so . But in spite of all her troubles and many complaints , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and beautiful outlook over the bay of Bridlington . It stood in a niche of the low soft cliff , where now the sea-parade extends from the northern pier of Bridlington Quay ; and when the roadstead between that and the point was filled with a fleet of every kind of craft , or , better still , when they all made sail at once-as happened when a trusty breeze arose  --  the view was lively , and very pleasant , and full of moving interest . Often one of his Majesty 's cutters , Swordfish , Kestrel , or Albatross , would swoop in with all sail set , and hover , while the skipper came ashore to see the " Ancient Carroway , " as this vigilant officer was called ; and sometimes even a sloop of war , armed brigantine , or light corvette , prowling for recruits , or cruising for their training , would run in under the Head , and overhaul every wind-bound ship with a very high hand . " Ancient Carroway " - as old friends called him , and even young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly three degrees of latitude . He had dwelled here long , and in highly good content , hospitably treated by his neighbors , and himself more hospitable than his wife could wish , until two troubles in his life arose , and from year to year grew worse and worse . One of these troubles was the growth of mouths in number and size , that required to be filled ; and the other trouble was the rampant growth of smuggling , and the glory of that upstart Robin Lyth . Now let it be lawful to take that subject first . Fair Robin , though not at all anxious for fame , but modestly willing to decline it , had not been successful - though he worked so much by night-in preserving sweet obscurity . His character was public , and set on high by fortune , to be gazed at from wholly different points of view . From their narrow and lime-eyed outlook the coast-guard beheld in him the latest incarnation of Old Nick ; yet they hated // him only in an abstract manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the large protective powers , were arrayed against him , yet happy to abstain from laying hands , when their hands were their own , upon him . And many of the farmers , who should have been his warmest friends and best customers , were now so attached to their king and country , by bellicose warmth and army contracts , that instead of a guinea for a four-gallon anker , they would offer three crowns , or the exciseman . And not only conscience , but short cash , after three bad harvests , constrained them . Yet the staple of public opinion was sound , as it must be where women predominate . The best of women could not see why they should not have anything they wanted for less than it cost the maker . To gaze at a sister woman better dressed at half the money was simply to abjure every lofty principle . And to go to church with a counterfeit on , when the genuine lace was in the next pew on a body of inferior standing , was a downright outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cold-blooded creature , with no pin-money , might reconcile it with her principles , if any she had , to stand up like a dowdy and allow a poor man to risk his life by shot and storm and starvation , and then to deny him a word or a look , because of his coming with the genuine thing at a quarter the price fat tradesmen asked , who never stirred out of their shops when it rained , for a thing that was a story and an imposition . Charity , duty , and common honesty to their good husbands in these bad times compelled them to make the very best of bargains ; of which they got really more and more , as those brave mariners themselves bore witness , because of the depression in the free trade now and the glorious victories of England . Were they bound to pay three times the genuine value , and then look a figure , and be laughed at ? And as for Captain Carroway , let him scold , and threaten , and stride about , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , poor creature-although there were two stories also about that , and the quantities of things that he got for nothing , whenever he was clever enough to catch them , which scarcely ever happened , thank goodness ! Let Captain Carroway attend to his own business ; unless he was much belied , he had a wife who would keep him to it . Who was Captain Carroway to come down here , without even being born in Yorkshire , and lay down the law , as if he owned the manor ? Lieutenant Carroway had heard such questions , but disdained to answer them . He knew who he was , and what his grandfather had been , and he never cared ashort word-what sort of stuff long tongues might prate of him . Barbarous broaddrawlers , murderers of his Majesty 's English , could they even pronounce the name of an officer highly distinguished for many years in both of the royal services ? That was his description , and the Yorkshire yokels might go and read it-if read they could-in the pages of authority . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn royal pay , though in very small drains , upon either element , beginning with a skeleton regiment , and then , when he became too hot for it , diving off into a frigate as a recommended volunteer . Here he was more at home , though he never ceased longing to be a general ; and having the credit of fighting well ashore , he was looked at with interest when he fought a fight at sea . He fought it uncommonly well , and it was good , and so many men fell that he picked up his commission , and got into a fifty-two-gun ship . After several years of service , without promotion-for his grandfather 's name was worn out now , and the wars were not properly constant - there came a very lively succession of fights , and Carroway got into all of them , or at least into all the best of them . And he ought to have gone up much faster than he did , and he must have done so but for his long lean jaws , the which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only because of their own consumption and slow length of leverage , but mainly on account of the sadness they impart , and the timid recollection of a hungry wolf , to the man who might have lifted up a fatter individual . But in Rodney*s great encounter with the Spanish fleet , Carroway showed such a dauntless spirit , and received such a wound , that it was impossible not to pay him some attention . His name was near the bottom of a very long list , but it made a mark on some one 's memory , depositing a chance of coming up some day , when he should be reported hit again . And so good was his luck that he soon was hit // again , and a very bad hit it was ; but still he got over it without promotion , because that enterprise was one in which nearly all our men ran away , and therefore required to be well pushed up for the sake of the national honor . When such things happen , the few who stay behind must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , seemed at first to go against him , but he bandaged it , and plastered it , and hoped for better luck . And his third wound truly was a blessed one , a slight one , and taken in the proper course of things , without a slur upon any of his comrades . This set him up again with advancement and appointment , and enabled him to marry and have children seven . The lieutenant was now about fifty years of age , gallant and lively as ever , and resolute to attend to his duty and himself as well . His duty was now along shore , in command of the Coast-guard of the East District ; for the loss of a good deal of one heel made it hard for him to step about as he should do when afloat . The place suited him , and he was fond of it , although he grumbled sometimes about his grandfather , and went on as if his office was beneath him . He abused all his men , and all the good ones liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he enjoyed this free exercise of language out-of-doors , because inside his threshold he was on his P 's and Q 's . To call him " ugly Carroway , " as coarse people did , because of a scar across his long bold nose , was petty and unjust , and directly contradicted by his own and his wife 's opinion . For nobody could have brighter eyes , or a kindlier smile , and more open aspect in the forepart of the week , while his Sunday shave retained its influence , so far as its limited area went , for he kept a long beard always . By Wednesday he certainly began to look grim , and on Saturday ferocious , pending the advent of the Bridlington barber , who shaved all the Quay every Sunday . But his mind was none the worse , and his daughters liked him better when he rasped their young cheeks with his beard , and paid a penny . For to his children he was a loving and tender-hearted father , puzzled at their number , and sometimes perplexed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them his last and go without , and even ready to welcome more , if Heaven should be pleased to send them . But Mrs. Carroway , most fidgety of women , and born of a well-shorn family , was unhappy from the middle to the end of the week that she could not scrub her husband 's beard off . The lady 's sense of human crime , and of everything hateful in creation , expressed itself mainly in the word " dirt . " Her rancor against that nobly tranquil and most natural of elements inured itself into a downright passion . From babyhood she had been notorious for kicking her little legs out at the least speck of dust upon a tiny red shoe . Her father  --  a clergyman-heard so much of this , and had so many children of a different stamp , that when he came to christen her , at six months of age ( which used to be considered quite an early time of life ) , he put upon her the name of " Lauta , " to which she thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he always meant " Matilda . " Such was her nature , and it grew upon her ; so that when a young and gallant officer , tall and fresh , and as clean as a frigate , was captured by her neat bright eyes , very clean run , and sharp cut-water , she began to like to look at him . Before very long , his spruce trim ducks , careful scrape of Brunswick-leather boots , clean pocket - handkerchiefs , and fine specklessness , were making and keeping a well-swept path to the thoroughly dusted store-room of her heart . How little she dreamed , in those virgin days , that the future could ever contain a week when her Charles would decline to shave more than once , and then have it done for him on a Sunday ! She hesitated , for she had her thoughts - doubts she disdained to call them-but still he forgot once to draw his boots sideways , after having purged the toe and heel , across the bristle of her father 's mat . With the quick eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he conquered her . His scheme was unworthy , as it substituted corporate for personal purity ; still it succeeded , as unworthy schemes will do . On the birthday of his sacred Majesty , Charles took Matilda to see his ship , the 48-gun frigate Immaculate , commanded by a well-known martinet . Her spirit fell within her , like the Queen of Sheba 's , as she gazed , but trembled to set down foot upon the trim order and the dazzling choring . She might have survived the strict purity of all // things , the deck lines whiter than Parian marble , the bulwarks brighter than the cheek-piece of a grate , the breeches of the guns like goodly gold , and not a whisker of a rope 's end curling the wrong way , if only she could have espied a swab , or a bucket , or a flake of holy-stone , or any indicament of labor done . " Artis est celare artem ; " this art was unfathomable . Matilda was fain to assure herself that the main part of this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and she lost her handkerchief on purpose to come back and try a little testwork of her own . This was a piece of unstopped knotting in the panel of a hatchway , a resinous hole that must catch and keep any speck of dust meandering on the wayward will of wind . Her cambric came out as white as it went in ! She surrendered at discretion , and became the prize of Carroway . Now people at Bridlington Quay declared that the lieutenant , though he might have carried off a prize , was certainly not the prize-master ; and they even went so far as to say that " he could scarcely call his soul his own . " The matter was no concern of theirs , neither were their conclusions true . In little things the gallant officer , for the sake of discipline and peace , submitted to due authority ; and being so much from home , he left all household matters to a firm control . In return for this , he was always thought of first , and the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to others as a wonder , though she may not have done so to himself . And so , upon the whole , they got on very well together . Now on this day , when the lieutenant had exhausted a grumble of unusual intensity , and the fair Geraldine ( his eldest child ) had obeyed him to the letter , by keeping her mouth full while she warmed a plate for him , it was not long before his usual luck befell the bold Carroway . Rap , rap , came a knQck at the side door of his cottage  --  a knock only too familiar ; and he heard the gruff voice of Cadman - " Can I see his honor immediately * " " No , you can not , " replied Mrs. Carroway . " One would think you were all in a league to starve him . No sooner does he get half a mouthful- " " Geraldine , put it on the hob , my dear , and a basin over it . Matilda , my love , you know my maxim- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come with you . " The revenue officer took up his hat ( which had less time now than his dinner to get cold ) and followed Cadman to the usual place for holding privy councils . This was under the heel of the pier ( which was then about half as long as now ) at a spot where the outer wall combed over , to break the crest of the surges in the height of a heavy eastern gale . At neap tides , and in moderate weather , this place was dry , with a fine salt smell ; and with nothing in front of it but the sea , and nothing behind it but solid stone wall , any one would think that here must be commune sacred , secret , and secluded from eavesdroppers . And yet it was not so , by reason of a very simple reason . Upon the roadway of the pier , and over against a mooring-post , where the parapet and the pier itself made a needful turn toward the south , there was an equally needful thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain that fell , or the spray that broke upon the fabric ; and the outlet of this gully was in the face of the masonry outside . Carroway , not being gifted with a crooked mind , had never dreamed that this little gut might conduct the pulses of the air , like the Tyrant 's Ear , and that the trap at the end might be a trap for him . Yet so it was ; and by gently raising the movable iron frame at the top , a well-disposed person might hear every word that was spoken in the snug recess below . Cadman was well aware of this little fact , but left his commander to find it out . The officer , always thinly clad ( both through the state of his wardrobe and his dread of effeminate comfort ) , settled his bony shoulders against the rough stonework , and his heels upon a groyne , and gave his subordinate a nod , which meant , " Make no fuss , but out with it . " Cadman , a short square fellow with crafty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have hit it off at last . Hackerbody put me wrong last time , through the wench he hath a hankering after . This time I got it , and no mistake , as right as if the villain lay asleep twixt you and me , and told us all about it with his tongue out ; and a good thing for men of large families like me . " " All that I have heard such a number of times , " his commander answered , crustily , // " that I whistle , as we used to do in a dead calm , Cadman . An old salt like you knows how little comes of that . " " There I do n't quite agree with your honor . I have known a hurricane come from whistling . But this time there is no woman about it , and the penny have come down straightforrard . New moon Tuesday next , and Monday we slips first into that snug little cave . He hath a ' had his last good run . " " How much is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three caves . It is all old woman 's talk of caves , while they are running south , upon the open beach . " " Captain , it is a big venture  --  the biggest of all the summer , I do believe . Two thousand pounds , if there is a penny , in it . The schooner , and the lugger , and the ketcb , all to once , of purpose to send us scattering . But your honor knows what we be after most . No woman in it this time , Sir . The murder has been of the women , all along . When there is no woman , I can see my way . We have got the right pig by the ear this time . " " John Cadman , your manner of speech is rude . You forget that your commanding officer has a wife and family , threequarters of which are female . You will give me your information without any rude observations as to sex , of which you , as a married man , should be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadman , and therefore you are a woman yourself , and must labor not to disgrace yourself . Now do n't look amazed , but consider these things . If you had not been in a flurry , like a woman , you would not have spoiled my dinner so . I will meet you at the outlook at six o'clock . I have business on hand of importance . " With these words Carroway hastened home , leaving Cadman to mutter his wrath , and then to growl it , when his officer was out of ear-shot . " Never a day , nor an hour a'most , without he insulteth of me . A woman , indeed ! Well , his wife may be a man , but what call hath he to speak of mine so ? John Cadman a woman , and one flesh with his wife ! Pretty news that would be for my missus ! "
