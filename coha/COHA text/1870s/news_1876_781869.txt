txt For various reasons we have avoided during the last week much further discussion about Mr. TILDEN 'S income-tax returns . One of these reasons was that it had been promised by several semi-official organs of Gov . TILDIIN that a reply to our charges would be forthcoming before the end of the week , and we had no desire to take advantage of a family affliction to reproach Mr. TILDEN , with the needless delay of his defense . Wo should have waited patiently for the promised answer , had not the World , without any obvious reason , plunged into the discussion . yesterday , and with some show of authority expressed a doubt whether any answer . would be vouchsafed at all . It would be absurd to affect any delicacy about continuing a controversy relating to the personal affairs of the Democratic candidate for the Presidency , which the World thinks perfectly open for comment . It may be well , however , to recall the fact that , about throe weeks ago , the World ex- , pressed the hope that " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . time , will think it , not unbecoming his position as the candidate of a great party for the first office in the laud to set his foot upon the charges . " The same paper added this very cautious expression of opinion : " In the meanwhile , it strikes us that no judicious friend of Mr. TILDEN , or of the Democratic Party , or of the repute of the United States , which is involved in the repute of , citizens so conspicuous and so highly trusted , will be overhasty in volunteering explanations of a matter entirely personal in its nature . " Mr. TILDEN has not yet thought it becoming his ' position to " set his foot upon the charges , " and . the World has , nearly four weeks after the publication of the original charge , forfeited its claim to be cor'idered a " judicious friend " of Mr. TILDEN , by " volunteering explanations of a matter entirely personal in its nature . " The " defense , " Cr rather the attempt " to clarify the case " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of novelty . It has been worn threadhare already , and has been ' made ridiculous by the attempts of . the " Literary Bureau " to sustain it by copious citations of a single ruling of a Commissioner of Internal Revenue . The World says that all the evidence which THE TIMES has produced to show that Mr. TILDEN committed perjury in 1862 , by swearing to a taxable income of $7,118 , is his statement under oath in 1876 that ho received in 1862 , for services rendered to the St. Louis , Alton and Terre Haute Railroad the sum of $20,000 . " Thereupon the World proceeds to rehash the worn-out argument about the distinction between income received and income earned , and puts forward as something new S the conclusion of every cross-roads Democratic sheet in the'country that because the services for whicb. the $20,000 was paid extended over three or more years , therefore its receipt in 1862 affords no presumption that Mr. TILDEN was in that year guilty of perjury in , swearing to a taxable income of only $7,118 . Without going over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us ask the World these ques-tions : 1 . Is it aware that the charges of THE TIMES extend over ten years and.do not relate exclusively to the income-tax returns of the'year 1862 44 ' . 2 . Can it explain why Mr. TILDEN should be worth from five to seven millions to-day and yet be able to escape the charge of swindling the Government by having paid on an average income between 1862 and 1872 of only $15,000 a year ? THE TIMES has charged and stands ready to prove that on the three occasions on which Mr. TILDEN made a sworn return of his income ho committed deliberate perjury . On the seven occasions when he refused to make a return and allowed the Assessor to tax him , THE Tnurs charges that he was guilty of ' swindling the Government . 3 . Has the World ever taken pains to find out how nauch.of the $20,000 fees received from the St. Louis , Alton , and Terre Haute Railroad was f ' earned ' " In 1862 ? Tnn TIMES has charged that at least half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refers the World for evidence of that fact to Exhibits 4 , 5 , and 6 , which are printed from page 61 to page 124 of the answer of Mr. TILDEN and . his co-defendants in the suit in question . . 4 . Has the World ever seen a publication called " A Compilation of the Laws , Deeds , Mortgages , Leases , and other Instruments and Minutes of Proceedings Affecting the Pittsburg , Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company , " printed last year ? We refer to that publication for ' evidence of the assertion that Mr. TILDEN " earned " at least $24.000 in 1862 for services in connection with:the Purchasing Committee of that railroad . 5 . Has the World neglected to take note of the statement of THE TIMES that it can produce au excerpt from the cash-book of the Cumberland Coal and Iron Company to show that Mr. ' TILDEN received from that corporation on June 14 , 1862 , $5,000 , at least half of which is chargeable as " earnings " of that year ? 6 . Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago and Alton Railroad , from No. 2,251 to No. 2,270 , inclusive 7 THE TIMES has asserted , that they were issued to StatuAL J. TILDEN on April 18 , 1863 , in paymeilit of services rendered between Sept. 27 and Nov. 1 , 1862 . Without going into further details , it is hardly . necessary to remind tiro World that whether Mr. Timms 's profes-mal income in 1862 was $60,000 , as above indicated , $80,000 , as heretofore detailed , out over $100 , - 000 , as Mr. S. L. M. BARLOW or any other well-informed Wall street authority would probably declare without any hesitation , it would need a very convincing statement to make the public believe that Mr. TILDEN did not swear falsely in declaring it to be only $7,118 . But , the World suggests , he might have had losses . Then why did lie not state them in the schedule provided for that purpose , and why did he , instead of adopting the honest course of making a statement of the various items of his income , take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his schedule eight months after the legal date of making a. return , and six months after the legal date of payment After the World has answered these queries in regard to Mr. TILDEN 'S income-tax return of 1862 , it may be better prepared to appreciate the difficulties of explaining the return made by him for the year 1863 , and will , not improbably , give up . in despair the attempt to defend his tax-grabbilig for the next eight years . By that time it will probably awaken to a fresh consciousness of the - wisdom of its own remark about being " overhasty in volunteering explanations of a matter entirely personal in its nature .
