ARTICLE V. - YALE COLLEGE . - SOME THOUGHTS RESPECTING ITS FUTURE . FIFTH ARTICLE . IN the series of Articles , which with the present one we bring to a close , it has not been our design to discuss all the subjects of interest or importance connected with the future of the College . We have desired only to refer to those points in which the distinctive and peculiar work of the opening era of the history of the institution must most clearly manifest itself . The steady growth of all things , the foundation of which has been wisely laid iii the past , will , of course , be cared for by those who are hereafter to be entrusted with the direction of affairs . But this duty belongs to all times-no more to the years just before us than to any other period . It need not , therefore , be urged with any special earnestness now . There are parts of the University , also , of which it will scarcely be necessary to speak at length . The University Library is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its present condition , it is , in almost every section of it , quite inadequate to the requirements of the body of scholars assembled here . Its funds are exceedingly limited in amount-so limited , in fact , that no considerable purchase of books can be made , without going beyond the annual income derived from them . Unless it is much enlarged , at an early day , there is great reason to fear that the whole institution may snifer an injury which can scarcely be over-estimated . The work , therefore , of increasing the Library fund is a work which the new administration can not neglect with safety . But it is not one of its peculiar duties . The enlargement now demanded is only similar to what has been called for in the past , and will be in the future . The necessity and the obligation are perpetually resting upon the guardians of the College interests . If there be anything in this department , which especially belongs to the coming era , it lies solely in the fact that , as the College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of its endowment , and consequently // of its means of usefulness , ought to correspond with *uch a change . We hope that this great interest  --  a common interest of all parts of the institution-will , by no means , be forgotten . If the collecting of one or two hundred thousand dollars for this purpose can be made an object of earnest thought and energetic effort , until the end is secured , one of the greatest possible services to the cause of learning here will be rendered . Important as this work is , however , and great as will be the advantages if the result is attained , it will not be necessary to our present line of thought to dwell upon it further in this place . There are other parts of the University , in which , as they have only just now been founded , the development is so entirely a thing of the future , that it may not yet become those who are not immediately connected with them to urge anything with confidence . Such are the Astronomical Observatory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in respect to the latter of these two , that , in our opinion , it ought to be made to bear in its teachings and influences , as far as by any means may be possible , upon the students of all the other departments . Beyond the special object of educating artists , the mission of such a school in a university , as it seems to us , is to elevate and refine that great company of young men who are to be engaged in the ordinary works of life . Our American education has been too exclusively in the line of the intellectual , and of mere mental discipline . It is in danger of becoming too exclusively practical . We need the power of aesthetic culture to give our students a more well-rounded and perfeci5 mental growth , and to awaken within them purer tastes and nobler aims . By the munificent gift which has established this school in connection with Yale College , the opportunity has been opened for the accomplishment of this end , and we earnestly hope that the officers of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case may be realized . Especially does it seem to us important , that the undergraduate students , whether of the Academical College or of the Scientific School , should receive such instruction from the teachers in Art as we have alluded to . They would , thus , be aroused to greater enthusiasm in all liberal studies , at the very time in their education when they // need it , for the more they come to know of the beauty of culture , the more will they be inspired to love and to seek it . The Art School must be , of course , like the other branches of the University , mainly a working school for its own pupils , but it may , in this way , do a great service outside of itself , and the generosity of its founder may be a blessing , in the years to come , to many who do not become immediately connected with it as its members . But , turning aside from these subjects , we find a great work connected with the outward life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , that it can not be passed over without consideration . The re-building and re-arrangement of the College edifices designed for various purposes has only been commenced within the past two years . The plan , therefore , of the whole undertaking and the carrying out of it , are left for the new administration . Of the vast importance of this work , both to the beauty and comfort of the buildings and , incidentally , to the intellectual and , even , the moral life of the institution , there can , scarcely , be any doubt in the minds of intelligent men . The plan , so far as it has been determined upon , is doubtless the wisest and best one ; - namely , the plan which removes the old buildings altogether and , erecting the new edifices around the side of the College square , leaves the interior an open campus . The beauty of this arrangement and open interior will readily be appreciated by any person , who will examine the grounds with this plan in his mind . It can hardly be questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings should be toward the interior . This is and must be the fundamental idea in the change which it is proposed to make . The great quadrangle must look inward , not outward , and the College life , so to speak , must find its center within its own borders . But it ought to be remembered , as we think , that the situation of the buildings is quite a peculiar one . They are not at a wide remove from the town , as is the case with many colleges in other parts of the country . Nor do they , as is sometimes the fact , constitute the chief feature of the whole landscape . In such cases , the arrangement best adapted for the institution itself might fitly be the only point of consideration in determining even the minuter details of // the plan . They are , on the other hand , in the central part of one of the most beautiful of our American cities . The ground on which they stand , also , is contiguous to and faces the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven . Under these circumstances , whatever is done in the matter of laying out and erecting the College buildings must have a most important bearing on the appearance of the city . The citizens , no less than the University authorities , there . fore , have a deep interest in all new plans , and their feelings deserve respectful attention whenever decisions are to be made . It ought , likewise , to be remembered that a very considerable proportion of the largest benefactors of the University have been residents of New Haven , who have bestowed their gifts upon it partly because it was the College belonging to their own home . As we think of these various points , we can not but regard it as a thing to be deeply regretted , that the new buildings , which have recently been erected on the College square , have no appearance of a front on the street side . Without interfering at all with the principal idea of the plannamely , the forming of a quadrangle opening upon the interior  --  and even without giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a frontage might have been presented . Instead of turning the back of the buildings so conspicuously and manifestly , as is now the case with the Farnam and Durfee Halls , to the streets and to the " Green , " with comparatively slight changes this aspect of things might have been wholly altered . In this way the public square might have been beautified , and compensation made for the loss of the view of the College Green from outside of it , which was rendered necessary by the plan of the quadrangle . It is fortunate that the work has gone no farther , when the new era commences ; and we believe we express a very general and widespread sentiment , both of the graduates of the College and of the citizens of New Haven , when we say that , as the plan is carried forward towards its completion , all new buildings , which shall hereafter be erected , ought to be designed with this double frontage or with the appearance of a handsome front toward the town . We urge this because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , while it will be no injury to // the College itself ; it will tend greatly to the adorning of New Haven , and because the location of the buildings is such as to demand of the authorities of the University what , under a different condition of things , might not be required . Moreover , we believe , that a due regard to public sentiment in this matter will meet , in the course of years , a rich reward . The readiness of the residents of the city to give to the College , according as its needs may arise , will be , in some measure , proportioned to the readiness which the College shows to beautify and honor the town where it is placed . If the permanent growth and welfare of the institution are to be secured , New Haven must not fail to cherish and support it . A feeling must be awakened which shall pervade the city , and which shall be stronger as well as more general than has ever been known before ,  --  a feeling of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall respond gladly to every call , and which shall prompt to generous benefactions on every occasion . This feeling may be awakened . The signs of it are beginning to be manifest already . It , certainly , ought not to be repressed by adopting a course , w*ich naturally may meet the disapprobation of those who feel a pride in the beauty of the city , and which , unquestionably , has occasioned regret in the minds of many most estimable persons . It seems to us unfortunate , also , that the first of the new buildings , and one which , by its situation , must be very prominent among them , should have been built of brick . The glory of architecture lies in stone , and the cherished hope of those who have looked forward to the coming age of architecture in the College has , we believe , been quite universal , that the old line of unsightly brick buildings might give way , not only to beautiful ones , but to those made of stone . In the case of the Theological Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That edifice , also , not standing on the College square , was not of so essential importance to the plan of the future . But , in the Academical Department , the matter is so vital , that it would seem better to make the utmost possible effort than to give up the erection of stone buildings . The small difference in the expense , provided the stone be with the rough edges found in the IDurfee Hall , shows // that the use of this material is altogether practicable , and the fine appearance of that building must , as it would seem , decide the question in all minds as to the desirableness of using it . We hope that the persons who may have in charge the carrying out of the remainder of the great plan will keep this idea before them . We speak of the plan as a great one . It is so because it has reference to nothing less than the rebuilding of the whole College . It is so , also , because it must extend over a period of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence the work of accomplishing it . For this reason , it appears to us that it should be most carefully studied , in all its parts , at the outset . Nothing should be done as by chance , or without reference to its bearing upon everything else . The committee , which has in charge the erection of one building , should not be different from that which takes the oversight of another . The location of all the edifices , the laying out and grading of the grounds , the general character of the architecture which is proposed , should be determined , so that every part of the plan , whenever it may be r*alized-whether now or fifty years hence-may naturally adapt itself to every other . The President of the University should possess himself thoroughly of everything which is designed to be done , and should be an energetic power to do all that will help forward the end , as well as to prevent all that can hinder it . No one else can be the center of the University action here , any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of his office , the head and the source of authority . Others may give him the benefit of their counsels and may coöperate with him . But he must be the executive . The responsibility rests upon him and can not be thrown off . The period of the administration which now begins , or even of that which shall follow it , may not witness the final result , but to this era , which is just before us , belongs the determination of xx hat that result , if ever attained , shall be . If accident or the vain notions of some chance benefactor are suffered to change the plans or to form them , the precious opportunity will be lost . No greater opportunity of this kind has ever been presented in any institution in the country , than the one which is now opened here . // We add , that , in our opinion , the University authorities , with the presiding officer at their head , should make it their earnest endeavor to realize the fulfillment of this plan within the era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to be impossible to remove all the old College buildings within the lifetime of the present generation , and to replace them by new and more suitable structures . But there is no such impossibility now manifest as to make any effort unreasonable . On the other hand , there is more groun I to anticipate the accoinplishment of the whole work before the next fifteen years shall have passed , if it be earnestly labored for , than there was , fifteen years ago , that a beginning would have already been made . To those who have witnessed the changes , which even the writer of these Articles has seen during his official life in connection with one of the departments of the University , the largest results in the early future will seem natural to be anticipated . As the wealth of the country rapidly increases , the number of those who make large benefactions to our literary institutions must , undoubtedly , multiply . To such persons the erection of new buildings is a matter of great interest They are , in general , more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . With a wise presentation of these wants of the University to men of this class , from time to time , and with corresponding effort to enlist their sympathies , it will not be surprising if the College square shall , at no distant day , have put on a new appearance , and the age of architectural beauty shall , indeed , have begun its progress . It should be remembered , that , in this matter as in some others already referred to in our former Articles , very little earnest effort has , as yet , been made . The guardians of Yale College have never , hitherto , been forward in the work of solicitation . But now is a most favorable time for a change in this regard . Nay , even the very duty which Providence lays upon us , at present , is to prepare for the greater and more glorious possibilities of the future , by gathering the means of accomplishing the results which shall then be opened to view . And , as is very often the case in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty makes itself manifest . Indeed , these encouragements constitute a part of the evidence , that the Divine call is into the line of progress where they lie . // It is the feeling on the part of some , that this matter of rebuilding the College edifices-being a thing of the mere outward life-should be deferred until other and more important ends are realized . We agree with such persons , so far as to hold that the provision of the means of instruction should have the first place in the minds of the University authorities , and that the raising of funds for buildings should be quite subordinate in their estimation . But in our view , there is no reason why the two things should not be carried forward together . The chief danger of the coming era , which dawns upon us with such great opportunities , is that our plans will not be large enough . They need to be very comprehensive  --  to have their several parts duly arranged , indeed , and the lower subordinated to the higher , but yet to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the very law of such enterprises , that the wider they are , and the more boldness and energy they require , the more sure are they to be successful . It will not only require five or ten times as much time to accomplish the parts successively , as to do the whole together , but the chances of failure will be almost equally multiplied . The fearful and unbelieving lose the kingdom here as truly as anywhere . Moreover , as it seems to us , no half-way course is permitted to us now . The wants of the University press upon our attention , at the present time , not one by one , but all alike . From every department , they utter their voice loudly , and in the line of outward things as well as of the more inward and intellectual . The College needs new recitation-rooms as truly as it needs new professors . It asks for a new Chapel quite as earnestly as for a new preacher . Let us hear both the calls and endeavor to supply both the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made known together , will fall favorably upon the ears of different men . The giver who would not care to endow a professorship may gladly build a Chapel , and he who thinks nothing of theological instruction may become to the Scientific School a large and , perhaps , a constant benefactor . How unwise , by pursuing only one of the ends at a time , to lose the opportunity of gaining the one or the other of these gifts , both of which are , as it were , ready to fall into our hands I But the erection of these new buildings and the re-arrangeinent // of the College square , of which we have spoken , are not things belonging only to the outward life of the institution . The grand old edifices of Oxford and Cambridge have an elevating power upon the minds and hearts of those who find their homes within them , and it will be so here in the future . The stndent of other days will not go away from his College life with only those influences which come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been brought in contact with . The very buildings which have met his vision from day to day , and in which he has passed the happy season of his education , will have taught him other and valued lessons . They will have entered , by their insensible yet constant influence , into his inward life ; and who shall say that the builders of them will not have wrought for the welfare of the mind and soul ? The accomplishment of the plan which shall effect these results , then , is not a matter of small moment , or a thing not to be labored for at present . The work of the new era , as it builds up the University , shoud include within itself-even from the outset - this building of a more beautiful home for the University . It should undertake to unite the influences of Architecture with those of Literature and Religion , and to do all things with one comprehensive purpose and by means of one far-reaching and common effort . The thought , which has just been presented leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very briefly in our last Article-namely , that , in the new arrangement of the College buildings , the University Chapel should be placed within the quadrangle , and near the center of it . The strong desire and prayer , as we believe , of most of the friends on whom Yale College rests , is that it may ever continue a Christian institution-a place where religion shall be taught , as well as human learning , and where the science of duty and of God shall be supreme over all others . But , at the same time , there are evident indications that a party is growing up with other views and other desicrns It is not unlikely that this party may be-b come stronger in future years , and that a serious conflict of opinion may arise on this subject , the decision of which shall involve vast interests . In view of the possibility of such a conflict , the believers in the Christian faith , and , not only in this , // bat in Christian education , may well adopt every wise measure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undoubtedly , the end is to be accomplished mainly by intellectual and spiritual means . But these are not all . The minds of men are affected , in no small degree , by what their eyes see . The silent influence of things which strike the senses becomes , in the long progress of time , an effective power to guide and control public sentiment The location or the archite9ture of a building may seem a small , or even an insignificant thing , in itself , but it may prove to be of more force than labored argument . It will teach its lessons constantly , and , while it provokes no controversy about the truth , it may bear a perpetual witness to it . In our judgment , the placing of the house of religious worship for the University at the central point of all the other edifices , will be one means of defending and preserving the true faith here . To the hundreds and thousands of young men , who shall come to this great institution in the distant future , the turning and pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love which the fathers have had for God and his kingdom will impress itself upon every beholder , and their manifest consecration of all learning to Christ and His cause , in this honor given to His house , will be as a continual impulse toward belief and duty . The question now open to those on whom the determination of this matter rests , is not a question of convenience , or of beauty of arrangement , or of the present time , only . It is a question whose decision reaches into the future , and may have a very appreciable and powerful influence upon the moral life of the University in the coming generations . With everything else favoring the location of which we speak  --  the quietness of retirement from the public thoroughfares , the effectiveness of the buildings as a whole to the eye of the observer , the fitness of the place , if the Chapel is to be , in any way , connected with a memorial of those who died in the struggle for the life of the country , the great appropriateness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chime of bells shall call the College community to worship and to prayer - we would urge , with especial earnestness , upon the new President and his associates in authority the consideration , that , in locating the University Chapel thus , they will be doing a // service-how great a one the future only can tell  --  to the good cause . And we ardently hope that , with all which they may do in their direct religious influence and by defense of the truth , they will not suffer the peculiar , though silent , power to which we have referred ,  --  a power which it is in their hands to put into perpetual operation  --  to be lost in the work of Christian education here . By reason of the recent action of the Legislature of Connecticut and of the Corporation of the College , the new era , of which we are writing , is made to open with a great change in the governing board of the whole institution . So long as this change was only proposed or desired , it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Bat now that the steps have been taken which render it certain , it suggests some thoughts in regard to the progress and welfare of the University which deserve our consideration . Not only is the work of the coming time a peculiar one , but a new element is to be introduced into that body which must authorize and direct the accomplishment of it . The graduates of the College are to be represented in its administration , and thus , in a certain sense , are to take charge of its interests . We think it fortunate , if this change was to be made at all , that it is made just at this moment . The turning-point of the College history has arrived . Great things present themselves before the vision and the hopes of the friends of the institution . The enthusiasm of the Alumni is to be depended on , in large measure , for the full realization of these things . Great sums of money are required for the supply of wants of various kinds . The plans for the attainment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for every reason , that the time of passing into the new epoch should be the time of introducing the new men . But what may be and ought to be expected from this change ? The first thing , as it seems to us , which we have a right to expect is , that the Corporation , both as individuals and as a body , will take a more active part in carrying forward the outward interests of the University . The clergymen of Connecticut could not , for obvious reasons , accomplish very much in awakening the enthusiasm of the graduates scattered over the country , or in the work of enlarg // ing the funds . They have managed admirably the endowments which have been received . They have , also , given their moral support to the professors and others who have energetically , and often successfully , presented the cause of the College to the public favor . They have guarded the good name and , best of all , the Christian character of the institution . But there have been regions of effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , influential men from among the Alumni are to take the places of the most inactive part of the body  --  the State members . They will , doubtless , be representative persons , and , perhaps , from different localities . Thcy will have all the advantage of knowing , by their own experience and observation , what the University needs . They will have , centered in themselves , the personal interest of a great number who have taken part in their election to office . No persons , certainly , can be better qualified than they to do active service in all those ways in which the Trustees of a College can help it forward . They ought , immediately after their entrance upon their duties , to take into most serious consideration the pecuniary wants which make so urgent a demand . They ought to feel that it is their business to aid and to relieve the instructors in this matter . Their office should not be a sinecure . It should not be a sphere for mere giving of advice . Advice from gentlemen living at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing comparatively little needed . But , if they consent to become Trustees of the institution , they should labor for its welfare . The duty of instruction does not fall to them , but the duty of collecting funds and guarding them  --  the duty of providing the means of enlarging the usefulness of the University by increasing its endowments-is one which they can not justly set aside . We do not say that they should do the whole of this work . Doubtless , they can not accomplish it all . But they should take their share of it , and should feel that it devolves upon them as truly as it can upon any one . And this should be the more deeply impressed upon their minds , because the very reason for this change , which has been urged by those who have favored it , is the fact that such persons could move the graduates and the wealthy men of various places to give to the College , as Connecticut senators and clergymen could not . // We may add , in the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert a healthful influence , both within the institution and outside of it , for the growth and progress of the University . This influence can be exerted on the outside public , by instructing the public , at proper times and in suitable ways , as to what the University is and is doing - what it needs and what it can accomplish . They can prevent such impressions from spreading abroad as have been occasioned by the many ignorant newspaper letters and articles of the past eighteen months . They can awaken a right public sentiment , and can bear witness to all their fellow graduates that a good work is going forward here . By these and other means ,  --  the result of wise counsels and warm affection ,  --  they can be of great advantage to the cause of the institution . Within its own walls , also , they may infuse the spirit of enterprise wherever it may be needed . T.hey may bring new impulses from the outer world , and impart something of new life . They may bear encouragement to those who labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet all their reasonable demands . They may contribute to the best sentiments and feelings among the community of students , by showing them in how high estimation the most honored of the graduates hold the College studies and life . If they effect these results and adopt this course , the future years will afford great reason for gratitude that this change in the Board of Trustees has been made . But the influence of which we speak must be exerted in a healthful way , if it is to be of real value . There must be no restless desire of change for the sake of change ; no wild following of the present and passing public thought ; no conviction that a university can be made in a day by giving up old rules and old studies ; above all , no feeling that power is of no use unless it is continually exercised , or that the interests of the institution and its success depend wholly upon the Board . They must be as ready to be guided as they are to guide , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of the University , no matter how entirely inconsistent the effecting of that good may chance to be with any of their own pre-conceived views . They must be , in a word , a body of wise counselors , who look upon themselves as holding a great public interest in trust . // In the third place , we think that the new eleme n't in the Corporation-being composed , as we hope it will be to a considerable extent , of men familiar with business and financemay be of service in the laying out of wise and large plans . In the single matter of landed property for the purposes of the institution , we hope they may more fully appreciate than some others are apt to do the needs of the future-that the limited area of the College square will be soon insufficient , and that additional ground in the neighborhood should be secured . It requires but little foresight of the future , as it seems to us , to perceive that every lot in the vicinity of the College which the Corporation now own must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any such property to others is little short of madness . In the new era , we trust that no such step will be taken as has been taken , at two or three different times , in the past-wheii one of the most eligible lots near the College has been offered by the College authorities for sale . This calamity which has been fortunately averted , almost by accident , ought to be guarded against with all diligence in the future . In this and in all similar poi*1ts , it is earnestly to be desired that the outlook upon the coming time and its wants may be a wide one , and that early provision may be made , wherever it can be , for the supply of those wants when they shall have arisen . We think it may fairly be questioned , also , whether in regard to the investment of funds some changes might not wisely be made under the direction of the Board as newly constituted . No doubt , safety of investment is the chief and all important thing to be desired with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially is it so , with funds given to educational objects . But , when we consider the low rate of legal interest in the State of Connecticut as compared with what is found in many other States , and when we remember the good securities to be obtained elsewhereequally good with those which are offered here ,  --  it will scarcely be unpardonable to suggest that a portion of the funds might be placed at interest where it could be done with better results of income . The difference between nine or ten per cent and six is a very appreciable difference , and , if it should be made in the income of a tenth or a twentieth part of the University // funds , it would do much good . It is true , indeed , that the College authorities have never lost anything which has been intrusted to them . This is much to say . It is even the best of all things for a Board of Trustees to be able to say . But the question , which we think may be worthy of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some degree , change their investments so as to enlarge the annual receipts , and yet , in the future , be able to make the same declaration . The new members of the Board may , perhaps , have some useful suggestions to offer with regard to this point , and may , possibly , add more of wisdom to the body than the Connecticut Senators , whose seats they take , have ever furnished . The Corporation should , also , keep in mind the idea of the unity and unification of the whole University , in all their actions and plans . To this end they should not only make a wise and impartial distribution among the several departments , according to their necessities , of whatever funds may be gathered for University purposes , but they should keep all the funds , as it appears to us , under their own control . The creation of separate boards of trustees for the care of moneys devoted to special objects or departments is disintegrating in its tendency . The natural and almost necessary influence of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not at once , there will arise a separation of interests or of views between the different boards , and the consequence will , almost inevitably , be an injurious want of harmony in action . The one body or the other will try to gain control beyond its own bounds , by reason of its power over the funds entrusted to it . Such is , to say the least , a danger which may befall the institution from this source . The possibility of it ought to be avoided . But whether this be admitted as a thing to be anticipated or not , there can be no doubt that the union of all interests under one government is , in a University as well as everywhere else , the best of all means to the end of harmonious and healthful progress . In an especial degree , may we say , is this true in a University , for , if new boards of trust are created for each new department , it is almost certain that they will generally consist of a few persons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of the department . The members from abroad will // possess so little knowledge , as compared with their as'sociates from among the instructors , in regard to all the matters appertaining to the institution , that they will , in most cases , be governed altogether by their views , and in this way the control of the funds in question will be , practically , in the hands of two or three professors . If the faculty in general were to be made the guardians and administrators of all the pecuniary interests of the University-if the faculty , thus , were to become the trustees-we do not know that any serious harm would be done . Such an arrangement would be a tolerable one though , perhaps , not the best . But , in our judgment , there could be devised no more dangerous or undesirable system than that by which the property of the theological or the academical department , for example , should be managed by one-half or one-third of the faculty of either of those departments . There might , indeed , no evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , because the particular professors who should have charge of the trust were honorable men , or because no question of great moment happened to arise which was calculated to awaken selfish interests . But the arrangements of a College are for all time , and the evil will manifest itself sooner or later . The period will arrive when it will be important to use the power , which such trusts give to those who hold them , and when it will be used-it may be to change the character of the institution-it may be to establish the new education in place of the old , or to make the old exclude altogether the new . But-all danger aside-such a system is manifestly unjust , conferring powers upon a portion of a body of instructors in which others ,  --  their equal associates-have no share . In the long run , such unfair distribution will diminish or destroy good feeling . The portion who are without control will be grieved and offended , and very properly so , and that harmony which is the first essential of a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to a membership in the Board of Trustees of Yale College , we would rather reject a gift of any amount for any purpose than consent , for one moment , to have that gift placed under the control of any other board  --  and this , not because we should care to have the control of it ourselves , for its own sake , but because we deem it essential to the highest interests of the University . Least of all would we consent to place it in the // charge of a portion of the faculty , whether associated or not with other persons . The recent act of the College Corporation , by which they have allowed the establishment of one such Board is , in our judgment , a very unwise one , and we earnestly hope that the new era may see no further act of the same order . If the present Corporation is not competent to keep and administer the funds , let one be constituted that will be . But do not let us have ten or twenty bodies of trustees governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or we shall not continue to be bound together as a University except in name . With the change , however , which is now to be made in the Corporation , the charge of incompetence , which some have urged of late ,  --  - very unjustly as we think-passes away . The minds of all complainers are satisfied , and there is no possible ground for the creation of such new boards any longer existing . There is every reason , therefbre , why the opening era should find the governing body firm in their purpose in this regard . They should take the ground , as we think , that unity is essential to the University , and that to this unity it is equally essential that there should be but one government , having control over all funds , and extending its sway equally over every branch of every department . We urge this point with the greater emphasis , because , as this is to be an era of large individual gifts , there is a great probability that some persons , in the bestow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees . They ought to be met by the uniform and persistent policy of the institution . To such a policy they will , in almost every case , yield with gracefulness , but , if not , it ought to be remembered that present gifts may be gained at too great a sacrifice , and that there are losses and injuries to the life of an institution for which nothing can compensate . It seems to us , finally , that the Corporation ought to meet more frequently hereafter than they have done . Within the past few years , the institution has very rapidly enlarged itself It requires , therefore , much more thoughtful care and attention than was formerly the case . A single meeting of the Board , in the hurry and confusion of Commencement week , is no longer sufficient for the discharge of business , much less for that thorough deliberation which is sometimes essential . Indeed , it // would appear that no meeting for important work sho'uld be held at that time , but that twice a year , at least , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better opportunity to form plans of action and to make wise decisions . It is no doubt true , however , that such a body may come together too often . If they meet more frequently than the public business of the University requires , there is a constant danger that they will undertake too much to manage and direct the internal and daily life of the institution , which it belongs to the faculty to control , and which ought to be left wholly to them . It will be an evil day for Yale College-we can not forbear to say again , what has been said in substance , though in another connection , in our first Article-it will be an evil day for Yale College , if the wise course followed by the Corporation in this regard , in the past , is ever changed . It would be better to have no aid from the governing Board at all , than to have this liberty which has distinguished our institution , and has been so greatly prized here , diminished in the least . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instructors here so ready to do service to the College , in spite of every discouragement and all insufficiency of support . It is this which has enabled them to accomplish so much , each in his own department , for the advancement of learning and the growth of the University . They have been free and unfettered-therefore Yale College has become what it is . The Corporation , in its new organization , will begin its life a few months after the inauguration of the new President He will have had time to survey the wide field and to mature his views for their consideration , and , thus , will be enabled to co5perate with and to guide them in the best way . With doubts on the part of some , but with hopes on the part of the large majority , the members who come from the graduates will enter upon their work . They may accomplish much for the institution , and the ways in which their work should be done are , as we believe , those or like those that have been now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prominent graduates of Yale , in reviewing the history of this College as compared with that of another of the New England colleges , said , that , while mart // had made the Presidents of that institution , God had made the Presidents of this . Whatever may have been the truth of the former part of this remark , we are sure that no friend of this University will doubt the force and fitness of the latter . There have been three great periods or divisions of the history of the College since the beginning of the present century . The first of these was what we may call a creative period . It was a time when the College , in any high and real sense of that word , was first established . The foundations and plans were then laid , on which all that might be built up in after times mn*st rest . A wide survey of future possibilities and a generous sympathy with all learning were needed in those who were leaders in its work . The most thorough knowledge of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most inspiring enthusiasm to stimulate both teachers and pupils , were especially called for on the part of the one who presided over all . A man of large heart , and wide vision , and great ability to organize and direct , and of commanding influence over all men about him not only in the institution , but in the community and the State , was the man for the crisis . How wonderfully all these qualifications and demands were answered in the distinguished teacher whom the Divine will called to the Presidency , at that time , the unanimous voice of his contemporaries and successors has borne continual testimony even to our day . The period which followed was of an entirely different character . It was not a time of creating new things and forming wide-reaching plans , but of establishing into a settled and permanent order the things which had been already originated . Traditions were to be fixed . Foundations were to be made secure . The work which had been wisely begun was to be wisely carried forward . The conservative forces were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive , in the former generation , were to be made conservative now . Calmness , wise judgment , the slow and steady movement of a quiet mind , the gentleness yet even firmness , which should not only establish present government in the institution , but should be the guide for all future government-these were the qualities that the new presiding officer required for his peculiar work . And where could a man have been found , if searched for over the world , who was more truly after this pattern , than that one who // was selected for the important office when the new period dawned upon the College . It was a wisdom beyond that of our human minds , as we who look back over the past can not help feeling , which summoned him to this post of duty-which made him to come forward now in the succession , and to secure for all coming time the good results of the creative era which had just ended . But another and a different epoch was yet to come , and , as he perceived its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with the wisdom which always distinguished his actions , laid down his office that it might be given to another . The period which now commenced was as unlike , in all its leading characteristics , to that which preceded it , as that , in its turn , had been different from the one which it had followed . The scholarly life of the College was now to be carried forward to a far higher development . Sound learning was to be established here as in its home . Accuracy and thoroughness and breadth and richness were to be made the student 's aim in all his work . The love of learning for learning 's sake , and the glory and beauty of it as it adorns the cultivated mind , were to become the inspiring power of all within the circle of the institution . A noble example of a Christian scholar , hating all deception and pretence , and elevating before every mind the standard of truthfulness and simplicity in all working ,  --  this was the demand which the times were now to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in its departments towards a future University , this spirit of real scholarship needed to infuse its influence everywherethat the substance , not the show , of learning might be the basis of all subsequent progress . The twenty-five years which have now come to their close have seen this great end accomplished . The work is done , as we may hope and believe never to be undone . But who could have been chosen to accomplish it so well as the one who was chosen ? No graduate of these many years since he entered upon his official life , can question for a moment that there was a Divine interposing , at that critical hour , when a new man was needed , and that the guardians of the College were guided as if by an inspiration from above . But not only may we , thus , trace out the wisdom which has manifested itself in the selection of each individual for his peculiar work  --  a work for which the others were not remarkably // adapted . The fact that each has come in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not only been fitted for the times , but the eras have been in that immediate succession which was best for the welfare and growth of the institution . They have not come in a wrong order . They have not been separated from one another by years of inactivity or of retrogression . They have moved on as by the direction of an intelligent and superintending mind to a predetermined future completeness . The lessons which the past thus teaches may give us confidence and hopefulness for the time to come . The era upon which we are now about to enter resembles the first of the three already mentioned more than either of the others . It is to be a creative era . As the early beginnings of the pre . vious times were to be fashioned , in the first of these epochs , into a College which should have in itself the seeds and possibilities of indefinite growth , so the various parts are now to be formed into a united whole  --  the College , as we have so often said , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches . The requirements of the new epoch are , therefore , of a similar character to those which were manifested seventy years ago . They are not , however , precisely similar . The presiding officer who now enters upon his career finds everything prepared for his working . The Departments are already in existence , and most of them growing rapidly stronger . The means at command are large , and those which are still necessary may be more easily gained than ever before , because the public generosity is so ready to bestow them . A company of energetic professors , who have already done much for the interests of the institution , are at hand to support and assist him . He is not alone , with the necessity laid upon him to make all things , even from the foundations . He has only to unite and harmonize the body now existing in its separate portions-to strengthen whatever is weak and bear forward what is already strong  --  to bring to completeness that which the past epochs have been gradually building up . The possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fourth great step may be taken in these coming years , which shall establish a University in New Haven  --  a University which has only to develope itself as time passes onward , in order to be whatever the remoter future may ask for . We do not believe // that progress is to cease with this period of which we speak . Far from it . But we look upon the century which is now passing and which is divided into these four eras  --  the three that are past and the one that is beginning-as the period within which the University may be created . The centuries to come will have their work in erecting the superstructure upon this foundation - in enlarging , in ways and degrees beyond our thought perchance , that of which we , in these early days , have made the commencement . In the course of these Articles we have attempted to set forth the peculiar work of this new era , both in its comprehensive character and in its separate parts . If we have been successful in our undertaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us ,  --  what the extent of the plans ought to be , if the desired end is to be attained ,  --  what the spirit and energy are , which are called for in the guiding and controlling power of the University . The age is to be one of heroic earnestness , if it is to prove the natural successor of those which have preceded it . The heroic element is essential , therefore , to the leader who is to act in it . He needs to have an all-comprehending mind and purpose , as he looks out upon the futurean all-sympathizing and generous heart , as he meets every fellow - laborer in every department of the great institution over which he is called to preside-an all-conquering and never ceasing energy for the fulfillment of the work to which he is summoned . As the choice has fallen upon one who has long been in the service of the College and whose mind is awake to the excellence of all science-as it has fallen , also , upon one who has been held in honor by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the graduates , we are sure , will unite sincerely in the prayer that he may show , in his new station , the heroic energy and the large-minded wisdom of which we have spoken . They will hope that , as he goes onward , he may enter more and more fully into the fellowship of those who have preceded him as the leaders in the past epochs , and that , by the completion of what could not be accomplished in their days  --  the final and full establishment of a harmonious , well-developed University here-he may give occasion once more for recognizing gratefully the Divine wisdom in making the Presidents of Yale .
