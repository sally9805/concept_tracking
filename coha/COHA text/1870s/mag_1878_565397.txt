ENGLAND ON THE RAILS . Jouy , the author of L'llermite de la Chauss*e d'Antin , which is the French Spectator , has a remark which those who are ready to generalize upon national peculiarities would do well to consider . " Plus on r*fi5chit , " he says , " et plus on observe , plus on se convainct de la fausset* de la plupart de ces jugements port5s sur un nation entli*re par quelques *crivains et adopt*s sans examen par les autres . " 1 He illustrates and confirms this conclusion by asking , XVho is the Frenchman that does not believe himself to be one of a people the most mobile and the most inconstant in the world ? Nevertheless , he adds , if we observe and study the character of our people elsewhere than in the capital , where it denaturalizes itself so easily , we shall discover that , so far from being inclined to change , the French is , of the peoples of Europe , the most enslaved by its prejudices , and the most bound ( lown to routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no more impressive illustration of the truth of his judgment than the opinions formed of each other , and tenaciously held for more than half a century , by the people of England and those of " America , " or , as the latter is generally called in the former , " the States , " both phrases being brief make-shifts for the long , complex , and purely political designation , " the United States of America . " One of these notions is counterchanged , as the heralds say . When one half a shield , for example , is white and the other black ( party per pale or per fesse , argent and sable ) , and a figure is imposed upon it of the tints of the field , the part which is upon the black side being white and that which is upon the white side being black , it is said to be counterchanged . This quaint contrivance , by which a figure , a lion for example , is shown one half black and the other white , in oppo1 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more we are convinced of the falsity of the greater part of those judgments passed upon a whole sition to the party-colored background upon which it is displayed , has a grotesque resemblance to the opinions sometimes entertained of each other on one subject by two individuals or two peoples . Thus British writers , and the British people generally , adopting , as Jouy says , without question the opinions of their writers , speak of us as a nation of travelers ; while many of us , on the other hand , think of Englishmen as staid , immobile folk , slow in all their actions , mental and physical , and , compared with ourselves sluggish , stolid , and with a dislike of movement which is composed in equal parts of vis inertiae and local attachment . There was never a notion more Incorrect , or set up more directly in the face of commonly known facts . Englishmen are , and always have been , the greatest travelers in the world . Englishmen , of all people , have been the readiest to leave an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are the colonizers , of the earth . It is because Englishmen are travelers and colonizers that two English - speaking nations monopolize the larger and the fairer part of this great continent ; that the vast continent-like island of Australia is rapidly becoming another New England ; that Victoria counts among her titles that of Empress of India ; and that the aborigines of the southern wilds of Africa are beginning to yield place to the Anglo-Saxon . Even on this continent more men from the Old England than from the New have traveled to the Western plains for curiosity or for the pleasures of the chase ; and in South America , - in the Brazils , in Peru , and in Chili , - of the English-speaking denizens and mercantile houses ten to one are British . Upon the latter point I do not of course speak with personal knowledge , but by inference from what I do know and from testimony . people by some writers and adopted without question by others . ( L'Hermite , etc . No. v. , 21st September , 1811. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a nation of travelers has sprung chiefly from the largeness of our hotels , and the freedom and ease with which we use them . In former years the greater nuniher of English travelers in England went , except when they were actually en route , to lodgings . It is only of late years that large hotels like ours have been established in the principal English cities ; but there , notwithstanding all that has been said of the Englishman 's dislike of hotel life , they are profitable , and seem to be well adapted to the habits of the people . Our large hotels were at first the result of a certain social condition . We had not a class of people who liked to let a part of their own houses to transient lodgers of a class above them . Keeping a hotel or a boarding-house as a business was quite another matter . It was undertaken like any other business . Hence our hotels and boarding-houses , and our free use of them merely as places where we could buy food and rest for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any shop , without concerning ourselves about the landlord in one case or the shopkeeper in the other . And this notion of our being so much more given to travel than Englishmen arc had its origin many years ago , before railways were , and when we used , even much more than we do now , what Englishmen can never use lar* , ely as a means of locomotion , steamboats . A British traveler , finding himself in one of our large riverboats , with one , two , or perhaps three or four hundred people , came not unnaturally to the conclusion that our whole population was constantly moving about in those to him wonderful vessels . He had never seen more than a stage-coach full of fellow-passengers at one time , and the great throng astonished him . But for one traveler in a stage-coach here Vhere were a hundred in England , besides those who traveled post . However all this may have been , nowadays half England seems to be every day upon the rails . High and low , rich and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway carriages . Ladies who would not venture themselves in a London cabalone ( although that they do now pretty freely ) travel by rail unattended , or at most with a maid , who is generally in a second-class carriage while they are in a first . Not only married and middle-aged women do this , but young ladies , even of the higher and the upper-middle classes . ' The number of trains that enter and , leave London , Liverpool , Birmingham , and other large cities daily is enormous . The great stations in London , of which there are six or seven , like the Victoria , the Charing Cross , and the Euston Street , swarm with crowds at all hours . The entire population of the island seems to be always " on the go . " And all this is dime without bustle or confusion . The Englishman and the Englishwoman of today are so accustomed to travel that they go about upon the rails with no more fuss than in going from the drawing-room to the dining- room , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet in locomotion is much aided by the perfect system of the railway management , an ( l the comfort with which the whole proceeding is invested . A long train arrives at a great station whence hundreds of people are just about to start . There is no confusion , and the train is emptied , and in five minutes or less all the passengers , with their luggage , are out of the station and on their way homeward . There has been much dispute as to the comparative convenience of the English and American systems of railway traveling . I give my voice , without hesitation or qualification , in favor of the English . In England a man in his traveling , as in all other affairs of life , does not lose his individuality . He does not become merely one of the traveling public . He is not transmuted , even by that great social change - worker the railway , into a mere item in a congeries of so many things that are to be transported from one place to another with the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked after , his individual wishes 1 Teste : the adventure of colonel Valentine Baker , now , as Baker Pasha , restored to grace and good society in England . 762 June , // are so far as is possible consulted . He arrives at the station with his luggage . One of the company 's porters immediately appears , asks where he is going , and takes his trunks and bags . He buys his tickets , and directed , if he needs direction , by other servants of the company , all of whom are in uniform , he takes his seat in a first-class or secondclass carriage , as he has chosen . He is assisted to find a comfortable place , and , if he appears at all at a loss , is prevented by the attendants from getting into a wrong train or a wrong carria* , e . For here , as in all similar places in England , there is always some authorized person at hand to answer questions ; and the answer is civil and pleasant . His luggage , properly labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carria*e in which he takes his seat . For , contrary to the general supposition , first , second , and third class carriages are not distinct vehicles or , as we might say , cars , coupled together in a train . The body of the vehicle on each " truck " is divided into first , second , and third class carriages or compartments ; and each one of these composite vehicles has a luggage van . A minute or two before the train is to start a servant of the company , whose particular business it is , goes to the door of every carriage and , examining the tickets of the passengers , sees that each one is properly placed . In more than one instance I have seen the error of an ignorant passenger who had neglected to make the proper inquiries rectified by this precaution , which prevents mistakes that would have proved very annoying . When this has been done the doors are closed but not locked , the word is given " all right , " and the train starts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no clanging of bells or shrieking of whistles . The quiet of the whole proceeding is as impressive as its order . And I will here remark that that most hideous of all sounds , the mingled shriek and howl of the steam-whistle , from the annoyance of which we are hardly free anywhere in America , is rarely heard in England . At Morley 's Hotel in London , which is in Trafalgar Square , within a stone's-throw of the great Charing Cross station , and where I stopped for some days , I did not once hear , even in the stillness of night , this atrocious sound . On the rails it is rarely heard ; and there the noise is not very unpleasant . It is a short , sharp sound , - a real whistle , not a demoniac shriek , or a hollow , metallic roar . The care that is taken of the safety of passengers is shown by an incident of which I was a witness when going to Canterbury . The way- stations are on both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side ; those going down , on the other . The communication between the two sides of the station is either by a bridge above the rails , or by a tunnel under - ground ; and no one who is not a servant of the company is allowed to walk on the tracks , or to cross them , under any circumstances whatever . On the occasion to which I refer , a man stepped down from the platform on one side , and was ins tautly met by a person in uniform who ordered him back . He submitted at once , and then said , good-humoredly , to the station-master , " I suppose you adopted that regulation because of the accidents that happened . " , " No , " replied the othgr , with a smile ; " we adopted it before the accidents happened . " Here we always wait for the accident . The carriages are the perfection of comfort . The first - class are in every way luxurious . You are as much at your ease as if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to support your head as well as your shoulders . The second - class carriages on some of the lines are hardly inferior in real comfort , although they are not so handsomely fitted up ; the chief important difference being a diminution of room . But even in the first - class carriages there is no glare of color or of tinsel , no shining ornaments of wood or metal . All is rich and sober ; and there are no sharp corners or hard surfaces . The holder of a first-class ticket may ride in a second or a third class carriage if he desires to do so and there is room 1878. // for him ; and I have again and again , on the stopping of the train , gone from one to the other to observe the passengers in each and to talk with them , - for English people are much more talkative and communicative than we are , particularly when they are traveling . In this way I had the pleasure of many long conversations , even with ladies whom I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a train stops the doors are all immediately thrown open , and if it is at a way-station the passengers give up their tickets as they pass out through the station . If you choose to go beyond the point for which you have bought your ticket , you merely pay the additional fare , for which a receipt is given ; doing which causes you no appreciable delay . When the train reaches its destination it is stopped a short distance from the station , and an officer of the company comes to the door of the carriage and asks for your ticket . Sometimes this is done at the last way-station , if that is very near the end of the line . The train then moves on and quietly enters the station , slowing its gentle movement so gradually that motion insensibly becomes rest . There is no clanging , bumping , or shaking . If you have only your hand-bag and your rug , you step out , and if you do not choose to walk you take the first of the line of cabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . If you are in London , and are observant , you will see as you pass the gate that your cabman gives your address to a policeman , who writes it down with the number of the cab , taking a look at you as this is done ; but the cab does not perceptibly stop for it , and then is off on a trot . If you have luggage and more than a single trunk , you hold up your finger , and one of the company 's porters is instantly at the carriage window . You tell him to get you a four-wheeler , and give him a bag , a rug , a book , ora newspaper , which he puts into some fourwheeled cab , which is thereby engaged for you . You get out , go with the porter to the luggage van , which is not one of two or three huge cars , full of trunks and boxes , away at the end of the train , but a small compartment just at your side ; and the contents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the luggage of the passen*ers on one vehicle . You point out your own trunks and boxes , the l ) orter whisks them up to the cab , and in five minutes or less from the time when the train stopped you are trotting off to your house , your lodgings , or your hotel , and all your baggage is with you for immediate use , without the bother of checks and expressinen and a delivery of your baggage at some time within half a day afterwards . If by chance any mistake has been made as to the disposition of your baggage , which happens with extremest rarity , according to my observation , it is discovered at once , and there is the whole force of the company 's porters and higher officers to rectify it , and to search for and produce your property under your own observation ; and the thing is done in a few minutes . Police officers are there , too , not lounging or indifferent , but ready , quick , and active to give you protection and help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your own eye , and the having it immediately at your residence . It is customary to give the porter who gets your cab an ( l takes your luggage to it sixpence or fourpence for his trouble . Nothing is more remarkable on an English railway than the civility of the company 's servants ; and this is the more impressive because it does not at all diminish their firmness and . precision in obedience to orders . I happened on two occasions to remark this particularly . But before telling my own experience in England I will relate that of another person under similar circumstances in America . A young gentleman , whom I know very well , started from Philadelphia to New York , buyin* a through ticket . He stopped on the way and remained a night , and the next morning resumed his journey . When he presented his " coupon " ticket to the conductor , he was told that it was worthless , as it was dated the day before , and was good only for the day on which it was // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken from Philadelphia to New York he had the right to be taken the whole distance , whether he stopped on the way six hours or twenty-four , and he refused to pay the double fare demanded . At the next station the conductor ordered him out of the car . He refused to go , and thereupon the other undertook to remove him ; this , even with the assistance of a brakeman , was not found highly practicable , and was given up as a bad job . But when the train reached Trenton the conductor and his assistants entered the car with a man in plain clothes who said that he was an officer , and who arrested the passenger . This officer said that he was commissioned by the governor and also by the mayor of Trenton , hut that he was in the employ of the company . The passenger demanded the intervention of the mayor , was able to enforce his demand , and the mayor ordered his immediate release . The matter was then placed in the hands of a lawyer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happened that just at that time I was in a precisely similar position in England . The affair being in all its circumstances very illustrative of the difference between the two countries in railway regulations , and in the manners of those who administer them , I shall relate it in detail . While at a Liverpool hotel , close by the station , I had spoken to a porter of the house , who did me some little services , of my intention to go to London in a day or two , stopping at Birmingham for the last day of the great triennial musical festival . On the afternoon when I was to start , I came in belated and in great haste . I had but twenty minutes in which to pack , pay my bill , buy my ticket , and get off . I sent this porter to get me a second-class ticket . He went , and my luggage was taken in charge by another porter . I reached the train just in time , and the first porter , whom I found standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some silver change , all of which I thrust into my waistcoat pocket without looking at it , and got into the carriage which he had selected for me . The other porter , who had taken my luggage , came to the door , said " All right , sir , " and we were off . I was so close upon the time of starting that the inquiry as to my destination was made just as the train began to move . To my surprise the ticket examiner said , as I showed him my ticket , which of course I had not yet had time to look at , " This ticket is for London , sir , and you said Birmingham . " As it proved , the first porter , having heard me speak of going to London , had in his haste forgotten what I said about Birmingham , and had bou0ht me a London ticket . I was immediately in a state of unpleasant doubt as to what my experience would he and what would become of my luggage , for I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping-place I made inquiry of the guard , and was told that the stops were so short that nothing could be done until we reached Stafford , where the train would stop ten minutes . The train had hardly come to a stand-still at Stafford when he made his appearance and took me immediately to a superior official , who , when I had stated my case , said that I must see the station-master ; and in less than half a minute that personage appeared before me . He was an intelligent , middle-ac , ed man , very respectable in his appearance , and very respectful in his bearing . The guard told him the case briefly . He ordered the luggage in the van of my carriage to be taken out . It was all turned out , and mine was not found . I was asked to describe it particularly . I did so , and the order was given to take out all the luggage from all the Birmingham and London carriages . It was now quite dark , and the search was made with lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were engaged , so quickly did they work , and so little luggage , comparatively , was there in each van ) my trunks were found , duly labeled " Birmingham . ' * The second porter had made no mistake . I then told the station-in aster that I had intended , as he saw by the labeling of my luggage , to stop at Birmingham , and asked him if with a Lou1878. 765 // don ticket I could break my journey for a day . He said that he thought that I might , bade me good evening , and the train started without the delay of a minute . I stopped at Birmingham , stayed two days , and then resumed my journey to London . At a short distance from the Euston Street Station the train halted , and we were asked for our tickets* I gave mine , and the ticket taker , glancing at it as he was moving on , stopped short , and said , " This is a - day 's ticket , sir . I can not take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " for I have no other . " " Then I must ask you , sir , to pay me your fare from Birmingham . " " I ye paid it once , and I certainly shall not pay it twice on this line until I have been taken to London . " " I beg pardon , sir , but I must positively refuse to take this ticket . It s against my orders ; and I must ask you for your fare from Birmingham . " I was struck by the man 's respectfulness , civility , and quiet good humor , but none the less by his unflinching firmness ; and I answered him with , I believe , equal respect and firmness , " I am sorry , but I shall not pay double fare . I refuse positively . " " Then , sir , " was his reply , " I must ask you for your name and address . " I took out my card , wrote upon it the name of the hotel in London to which I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap , saying , " Thank you , sir . Good evening . " I replied , " Good evening , " and he passed on . The affair had , of course , attracted much attention from my carriage inmates , one of whom said to me , as the train started again , " I think you 11 find you re wrong . This is a matter the companies are very particular about ; I do n't know why ; and I believe the question has been decided in their favor ; I ca n't see why . You d better write to the general superintendent of the company when you get to London , " and he gave me his name . The next morning I did write , stated my case , received a courteous reply , and the matter was settled quietly , good-naturedly , decently , sensibly , with respect on both sides , and with the least possible ttouble . I think so much could not be said of the proceedings in the case of my young friend between Philadelphia and New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was able to give a name and references very well known , and I was a stranger in England and had never been in London . At the great railway stations such is the throng of travelers ceaselessly passing back and forth , or waiting for trains , accompanied sometimes , in the case of ladies who are going alone , by friends , that these places afford very favorable opportunities for the observation of all sorts of people from all parts of the country , whose superficial traits may be thus conveniently studied and compm*ed . The variety of classes and conditions is great ; the difference unmistakable . Here we see nothing like it . True , we can tell Northerners from Southerners , Eastern from Western men , and can distinguish by the outside between a denizen of one of the great cities and one from the rural districts . An observant eye can even detect slight variations between the urban and the suburban man or woman , none the less easily when the latter has her garments carefully made according to the patterns in Harper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers tells us little . In England , notwithstanding the leveling and assimilating tendencies of the last half century , due largely to the railway itself , the gradation of classes is readily perceptible , even to a stranger 's eye ; nor is the condition , or in many cases the occupation , less distinguishable than the class . Agricultural laborers are very rarely seen upon the railway , except when they move in gangs for special work ; and then they are quite likely to be Irishmen . The farmers travel much more than I supposed they did , - very much more than they do with us . I met with them and talked with them in second-class cars on every line on which I traveled ; for as I have said it was my habit , when alone , to change my place at station and station to second and third class carriages , which I learned that the holder of a first-class ticket might do if the trains were not crowded . I found // that my apprehension of their class and condition from their appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain limits , of course ) in regard to other classes . Not only are the upper classes , that is , we may say , those who are educated at Eton and Harrow and the two great universities , unmistakable by their bearing and expression of countenance , but among the professional classes a barrister would hardly be taken for a physician , or either of these for a clergyman , or a clergyman for either of those . The London city man , " commercial person , " is also unmistakable , unless he is one of those highly educated great bankers or merchants which are found in England , but are very rare in America . Such a person might be taken for a peer , unless you were to see him and the peer together , when , with a few " tip-top " exceptions on the city side , the difference would manifest itself , if in no other way , by the countenance , if not in the behavior , of the city . man himself . The intermediate ch*sses , commercial travelers , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their distinctive outside and expression , difficult to define in words when dress has come to be so identical in form and color among all classes , but still , as I found it , quite unmistakable . I remember that on one Sunday , when I went to morning service at a little village church with the " lady of the manor , " I noticed in the choir , close to which her pew was , a man so very earnest in his singing that he attracted my attention . As we walked back through the shubbery , just beyond which the church stood , shut off by a wall through which was a little gate , I spoke to my hostess of this man 's singing , and asked if he was not a carpenter . " Yes , " she answered , with a look of surprise ; " but how did you know t.hat ? " ( I had come to - only the day before . ) Oh , " I said , " I knew that he must be an artisan , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did not look like the village blacksmith or wheelwright , I therefore concluded that he must be a carpenter . And besides , he sawed away so at his singing . " The man 's dress was like that of my host in fashion and material , a black cloth frock and trousers , and they were perfectly fresh and good , and his linen was clean ; but the difference of rank and breeding between the two men was as manifest as if the one had worn his coronet , and the other his paper cap and apron . All these various classes are nowhere seen together as they are at the railway stations ; for , except the agricultural laborer and the lowest classes in the city , all travel . I therefore never was near a station without entering it and walking about for a while among the people there . A trifling incident at one station , which was connected with a hotel at which I was , interested me . I had gone down to breakfast in my slippers ; and when I rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which two or three trains were about starting . As I was quietly eying the motley multitude , I heard a small voice : " Black your shoes , sir ' ? - only a penny ; " and as I did not immediately reply , my attention being fixed upon a group at a little distance from me , the words were repeated , and I turned my head . The speaker was looking up earnestly into my face . I , smiling , pointed down to my slippered feet ; and the boy , a goodlooking little fellow , smiled too , but shyly , and , seeing his mistake , blushed to the edges of his hair . Wonder of wonders ! thought I. Here is a country in which boys can ' blush ; where boys who speak English and black boots have some shamefacedness in the presence of their elders . The little fellow gained somewhat by my not having a job for him to do ; but what he took so joyfully should have been more , by a hundredfold , to acknowledge fitly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was on the 31st of August , and I saw in the station and elsewhere signs of the time unknown in America . There were keepers , with leashes of dogs , going hither and thither to the preserves ; for shooting was to begin on the morrow . There was such a fuss and talk about it that one would have thought that it was a matter of life and death to some thousands of gentlemen that they should burn 1878. 767 // powder and kill birds on that day , and that some other thousands of men , and three or four times as many thousands of dogs , should be promptly on the spot to help them . The dogs were mostly handsome , intelligent animals ; the keepers were smallish , tight-built fellows in long gaiters , with a strange mixture of brutality and shrewdness in their faces . On this same journey I had the good fortune to witness an incident very characteristic of the society in which I was . I took the train at Birmingham at about four o'clock in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second - class ticket , I entered by mistake a first-class carriage . The grades of the carriages are indicated on the glass of the upper half of the doors ; but as the doors were opened and thrown back against the carriage , I did not see " First Class " on the door of the one I entered . When the guard came 1 said " London , " and put my hand to my pocket for my ticket , and he , supposing I knew my place , nodded his head and passed on . When the train started I was alone in the carriage . When we reached the next station , or the next but one , a party of three , a young gentleman and two ladies , approached the carriage , and one of the ladies entered it and took the seat next me on my left hand , between me and the door , I having one of the middle seats . Her companions appeared to be her brother and sister , or her sisterin-law ; and from their talk , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going a short distance , and was to be met by her husband at the station where she was to stop . When the train began its gentle , almost imperceptible motion , both of them kissed her , - the lady with feminine effusion , but the young gentleman in a perfunctory manner ; and when I saw his cool salute , and heard his " Take care of yourself , old girl , " I was sure he was her brother . No other man having his privile*e could have availed himself of it with such indifference . For my carriage companion was a beautiful woman ; and her beauty impressed me the more because of its delicate character , and because she was the first really pretty woman of her cla.ss that I had yet seen in England . She was just tall enough to be noticeably so , and the noble elegance of her figure could not be concealed by her traveling dress . This was a long garment , of a soft texture and light color between buff and cream , buttoned from the throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of the dress . Her hat , or her bonnet , was also of the same material , and was without ornament of any kind . As a bonnet has strings , I believe , and a hat has not , it was probably a hat ; for no woman not inhuruanly disposed could conceal by a ribbon the inner outline of such a cheek as hers ; and she was not inhuman . In her ( lainty ears were small dull-gold earrings set with turquoises , which were matched by the brooch which confined a lace frill around her lovely throat . Her eyes were blue , her brow fair ; her mouth had the child-like sweetness which Murillo gave to the lips of his Virgins ; in expression her face was cherubic . She apparently had no other luggage than a small Russia-leather bag , which she put into the rack above our heads . We sat in silence ; for there was no occasion for my speaking to her , and she looked mostly out of the window . After we had passed one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took oi*t a bottle and a small silver cup , and turning herself somewhat more to the window poured something into the cup and drank it off at a draught . I did not see what she drank ; but in an instant I knew . The perfume filled the whole carriage . It was brandy ; and the overpowering odor with which I was surrounded told me of the strength of her draught as well as if I had mixed her grog myself , or had joined her in a sociable cup . At this I was not so much astonished as I should have been two or three days before ; for at the Binningham festival I had seen , during the interval between the two parts of a morning performance , potation of the same kind by ladies of whose respectability there could be no question . We went on in silence . After passing one or two more stations we stopped at one - Rug-768 June , // by , I believe - for a little longer time than usual . Soon I was conscious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open door , when my angelic beauty sprang from her seat , and placing herself before the door cried out , " No , you sha n't come in ! Iwo n't have third-class people in the carriage ! " There was remonstrance which I did not clearly hear , and the people attempted to enter . She then threw her arm across the door-way like a bar , claspin0 firmly one side of the carriage with a beautiful white dimpled hand . I thought at once of Catherine Douglas ; and the Scotch girl , when she thrust her arm through th' staples of the door , to keep out the pursuers of her king , could not have been more terribly in earnest . She ( my Catherine Douglas ) almost screamed out , " Go hack ! go back ! You sha n't come in ! This is a first-class carriage , and I wo n't have third-class people put into it ! " Then came counter-cries , and there was a hubbub which certainly was of the very first class . She turned her beautiful head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still and made no sign . A guard , or other official person , who accompanied the inferior intruders expostulated with her ; and I heard him explain that the train was so full that all the third and even the second class carriages were occupied , and that as these people had their tickets and said they must get on he was obliged to put them into our carriage . It would be for but a little while , only till we reached a certain station . My fair companion was obdurate , and perhaps was a little set up by the contents of the silver cup . But two first-class passengers came in , and as they pleaded for the admission of the luckless third-class people , and the assurances that there was no alternative and that the period of contamination would be brief were repeated , she at last subsided into her seat , still grumbling , and the objectionable persons were admitted . They certainly were not people with whom it would have been pleasant to sit down to dinner . One , a woman , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 769 coarse , ill-looking fellow , sat himself opposite to her . The face and hands of the woman , sallow and leathery , although she was young , might have been cleaner , and contrasted very unfavorably with the lovely , fair , and fresh complexion of the angry beauty . Her nails were like claws , with long black tips . She had a red woolen comforter around her neck , and her bonnet was a hopeless mass of crumpled ribbons and dingy , flaring flowers . Her companion was the male proper to such a female , - a little less noisome , however ; and I have observed that when a woman sets out to be dirty or disagreeable she succeeds better than a man . Immediately a war of words began between the two " ladies , " and it was fought across me . The beauty repeated her objection to third-class people , and protested that as she had paid for a firstclass place it was a shame that she should be made to travel third class whether she would or no . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do anybody by riding in the same carriage with them , and added , " Some peepull that coil themselves first - clawss peepull because they paid for a first-clawss ticket mi , , lwbe no better than other peepull that paid for a third-clawss ticket . " A sniff and a toss of the beautiful head . Then she of the comforter : " As for me , I m not going to stop in Rugby all night with race-peepull . " ( It appeared that there had been races somewhere in the neighborhood of Rugby that day . ) " If peepull u , ere only third-clawss peepull , they could n't be expected to stop all night in a place wen the ole town was filled with only race-peepull . " This proposition seemed to meet with general bland assent from all the company in the carriage ; and I was delighted to find that below the deep of common third - class people there was admitted to be still a lower deep , into which third-class people could not be expected to descend . Op .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman , to the establishing of whose local color many gallons of richly-flavored port must have gone . He had not an apron or even a dean 's hat , but either wohld well have England on the 1 ? ails . // become him . He soothed the fair firstclass being with a mild mixture of sympathy and expostulation . There was a general discuSsion of the situation , in which every one of my fellow-passengers had something to say ; and the impropriety of third-class people being put into contact with first - class people was generally admitted , without the least regard for the presence of her of the red comforter and of her companion . At last I was appealed to ; for all the while I had sat silent . I replied , " Really , I ought n't to say anything about the matter ; for I myself am only a second-class passenger out of place . " The beauty turned upon me a stare of surprise , and with a bewildered look " wilted down " into her corner . She of the dingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while the silence was broken by the third - class person 's saying that she wanted to get to a certain place that night , and asking vaguely , of no one in particular , if she could do so . There was no reply at first ; after a moment or two I was surprised by hearing the first-class dame say " Yes , " softly , with a mild surliness , and looking straight before her . Her former foe asked , " How ? " A shorter pause ; then " Take the train that meets this one at Blisworth Junction , " came from the beautiful lips between the turquoises , the head turned slightly toward the questioner , and the words dropped sidelong . This seemingly announced a treaty of peace ; and again to my surprise , and much more to my pleasure , a conversation went on across me , but now in perfect amity , and information as to the minutest particulars was freely asked for with respectful deference , and given with gracious affability . The fact that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister showed that she was what is called " a respectable woman ; " and the manner and speech of the three were those of cultivated people . Moreover , upon reflection I became convinced that she was neither a termagant nor a particularly ill-natured person . She had merely June , done , in a manner rather unusual , I believe , even in England , and somewhat too pronounced to suit my taste , what it is the habit of the whole people of England to do : she had insisted upon her rights , and resisted an imposition . She meant to have what she had paid for . This is the custom and the manner there . English people are , according to my observation , kind and considei*ate , noticeably so , and ready to do a service to any one in need of it ; but they resist , vi et armis , unguibus et ore , tooth and nail , the slightest attempt to impose upon them ; and they do it instantly , upon the spot , and follow the matter up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it may cause some disenchantments , but it has its advantages , and they are not small . Another characteristic of the country is shown in its railwa*r vocabulary . There is , for example , a " guard " or guards on the train , and a " booking office " at the station . The guard guards nothing , and has nothing to guard . The steam-horse was not only " vara bad for the coo , " but for the highwayman , who long ago ceased to labor in his vocation . At the " booking office " no booking is done . You merely say , to an unseen if not invisible person , through a small hole , " First ( or second ) class , single ( or return ) , " put down your money , receive your ticket , and depart . But as there were booking offices for the stage-coaches which used to run between all the towns and through nearly all of the villages of England , the term had become fixed in the minds and upon the lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard and his name ; and when the railway carriage supplanted , or rather drove out , the stage-coach , the old names were given to the new things , and the continuity , had traveled so little comparatively , owing in a great measure to the long distances between our principal towns and even between our villages , and stage-coaches were so comparatively rare and so little used , that when the railway engine came , England on the Rails . // not only they but all connected with them , words as well as men and things , disappeared silently into the past , and left no trace behind . In such continuity on the one hand , and such lack of it on the other , is one of the characteristic differences between the Old England and the New ; and its cause , as it will be seen , is not in the unlikeness of the people ' , but in that of their circumstances.1 Richard Grant White .                   @ @
