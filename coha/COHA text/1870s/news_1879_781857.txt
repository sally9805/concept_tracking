txt It is a matter of remark , almost of com-plaint , by European travelers who come to the United . States for the purpose of studying our People and our institutions , that , although the extremely democratic form of the latter affords occasion for reflection and for comment , the external life of America , except in the far West , presents to the stranger little that is peculiar or interesting . It could hardly be otherwise . But there is in New-York one fashion which intelligent travelers have remarked upon , although we believe not yet in any book of American travel . This is the recklessness with which substantial and expensively-built houses are removed , or " torn down " as the phrase is , to make way for more profitable structures . In European towns , the destruction by private hands of a substantial house is a comparatively rare occurrence . It is regarded as a wasteful and almost a ruthless proceeding . Such houses , when they can no longer he profitably used for their original purpose , are not unfrequently altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over " ; but their walls , their roofs , and even their floors , are not disturbed . In Engla nd , and on the Continent of Europe , most of the dwelling-houses in the old quarters stand as they were built a century or two centuries ago , and some are even older . And this is in a measure true of the older towns in America . Boston , Philadelphia , and Baltimore have countless houses which were built in the days of the fathers and of the grandfathers of the present generation . But , although New-York is one of the oldest towns in the country , a ? search through its streets for houses of even this very moderate agedness  --  we can not say antiquity  --  would be almost in vain . Not only has Wall-street anal the region round about it been rebuilt twice within the last thirty-five or forty years , but Broadway , from the Bowling Green to Union-square is new even to young people . The cross-streets and the parallel streets near it are in like manner filled with warehouses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter have taken the places of dwelling-houses of small size , the sites of which were needed for business purposes , the change is not at all surprising . But now the same change is going on rapidly in the upper part of the City , to the destruction and . entire removal of large and substantial houses in which fashionable people of the present day have lived and given splendid entertainments . Within the last five or ton years Fourteenthstreet , between Broadway and Sixth-avenue , has entirely changed its aspect . Houses which in spaciousness and elegance would have satisfied the needs and the taste of an English nobleman have been taken down , and their place is occupied by handsome , or at least showy , shops , or buildings intended for other business purposes . Within the last few months two houses there , on the south side of the street , large , elegant , built of handsome cut-stone , have been taken away as if they had been card-houses built by children . The building on the north-east corner of this new street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again been thronged with the fashionable society of the day , and was afterward occupied by DELMONICO 'S restaurant . Among the elegant dwelling-places of the generation which is passing away , only Bond-street , Lafayette-place , St. Mark's-place , and Washington-square have escaped this rude transformation , and they have done so merely because it would not " pay " to tear them to pieces . But in St. Mark's-place the destruction began some years ago , and the character of the neighborhood has entirely changed . A more marked indication of this change , or a more striking example of the mutability of material things in New-York could hardly be than that which is afforded by the appearance of a new place of amusement in Eighth-street , just opposite Lafayette-place . This is a " Variety theatre " of the cheapest sort , managed by a German , and conducted chiefly , it would seem , with an eye to the selling of lager beer . But the most interesting and . significant fact in regard to it is that this variety and lager beer establishment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost of historical interest . Dr. DEWEY 'S old church in Broadway , opposite the New-York Hotel  --  a granite structure built like a fortress  --  has , indeed , for a long time been a theatre of not very high class , and is now a circus ; but this building is far inferior in interest to that recently converted to base uses in Eighth-street . This church once stood in Murray-street , nearly opposite the rear of Columbia College . It was the church of the famous Dr. JOHN MASON , a Presbyterian divine whose reputation spread over this country and was honored in Europe . He was not only a man of great eloquence and . learning , but was of the straitest of his sect , and . was the antagonist of Bishop HOBART , the loader of the High Church Episcopalians . When the up-town movement caused this church to be entirely deserted , it was not destroyed , but was carefully taken apart and carried up to Eighth-street , where it was put together again , and where it now stands . Deserted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought by the Roman Catholics , was consecrated , and was known for some years as St. Ann 's Roman Catholic Church , Ere long , however , it was abandoned by the Roman Catholics , and was bought by A. T. STEWART &; Co. , who fez some years used it for their upholstery business . After the death of Mr. STEWART this was removed , and the great Dr. MASON 'S church , the actual building which stood . in Murray-street , has at last become a " Dutch " variety theatre . It is enough to make the sturdy old Scotch Boanerges turn in his grave . ( We call him Scotch because , although born here , he was the son of a Scotchman and was educated at Edinburgh . ) But it may be doubted whether , if he wore alive , he would . have regarded the variety performances and . the lager beer or the religion : ceremonies conducted . under the auspices of the " Scarlet Woman " with the greater horror as a desecration of the famous Murray-Street Presbyterian Church . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-downs and the beer . New-York is probably the only place which turns its churches into theatres and circuses ; and it is almost as singular among cities of more than two centuries old . which " teat down " handsome and substantial houses with-out compunction or remorse . But it by no means fellows that Now-York is exceptionally sacrilegious or ruthless . The simple truth is that New-York has become during the last thirty years merely a place in which to make money . The claims of domesticity and of religious association must needs give place to those of trade and traffic . To trade people must live , and . therefore there are dwelling-houses in New-York . But its chief function is to be a place in which people can do business , to which they may come by railways and steam-ships , and . through which they may travel by railways , elevated and other . With regard to any building , Trinity Church excepted , the simple question is , will it pay better to let it stand or to " tear it down " I If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground I And thus New-York  --  not a capital , not a centre of any interest , intellectual oz moral , bat that of commerce  --  becomes year by year more and more a splendid . shop and railway station .
