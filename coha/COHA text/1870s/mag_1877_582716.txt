superintendent ; the poor man dropped into it the one offering of the school and blushing deeply as he looked at me , said to the scholars : " Well , you usually do better than that . " The scene was so painfully ludicrous that it was only by a violent effort that I was able to meet his glance with the sympathy it merited . I was sitting in the church before the bells had begun to ring . But I soon heard behind me the rustling of dresses in the aisles . The rustling quickly became more frequent . The prayer-books were noisily let fall in their receptacles . As the various companies of village maids came up the aisles and sat in the pews , odors of heliotrope , anenome , lavender and new-mown hay began to diffuse themselves through the building . I was offered many prayer-books which I was unable to take . For how could I accept the book of the ladies on my left when I had already declined that of some ladies who sat just behind me ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of some very pretty girls who sat in the next pew to my right . In the pew just in front of me there were two little girls who were , I think , not more than ten years old . One of them , looking back , saw that I was without a book .. There soon began a low whispered conversation between them . One nudged her little friend and said : " You ; " the other whispered : " No , you . " At length one , barely looking round , held out a book in a very timid way , and this , of course , it was necessary that I should take . The service over , the people st-ayed a considerable time under the trees by the church door , standing on the grass and cool stone walks , shaded from the hot summer weather without . It was long before the sociable assembly had finished their greetings . The carriages waited , drawn up before the door , while the people chatted . Indeed , it is by no means easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families which take up two pews to themselves . Not to speak of the little girls in blue boots , there are three boys very near of a size , and the whole have to be marshaled by the two tall girls in white hats and red sashes . Young mammas , who had not met for a week , perhaps a fortnight , stood by the gate and pecked each other with many inquiries and many expressions of delight . Afterward I walked back to the tavern , and the landlord gave me such a dinner as I did not suppose an American tavern could supply . It was not French , of course ; but an appetite which the morning 's ride and the sermon had made eager was met by a sound and fresh repast . The dinner was from the landlord 's own garden ,  --  the lobster even , it was said , having been caught in the little bay which approached the foot of it . Later in the day I set out for New York , and , after an hour 's riding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I passed the Jerome race-course , with its gilt and yellow gate-way . I passed many roadhouses , and met on my way caravans of rapid drivers , looking madly unhappy . I soon reached the well-kept woods of the Park , and saw before me , in the advancing sundown , the roofs and towers of the town , the hewn fragments of rising cathedrals , and the scattered structures of the newer city . The sky beyond the bay and the town was of a cold and faint red . It was a scene of bronze which I now looked over , most unlike those quiet villages , unconscious of the nearness of a great city , which I had left but two hours before . SMETHURSTSES . SMETHURSTSES , mum-yes , mum , on accounts of me bein ' Smethurst an ' the waxworks mine . Fifteen year I 've been in the business , an ' if I live fifteen year more I shall have been in it thirty ; for wax-works is the kind of a business as a man gets used to and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! there 's no tellin ' how much company them there wax-works is . I 've picked a companion or so out of the collection . Why , there 's Lady Jane Grey , as is readin ' her Greek Testyment ; when her works is in order an ' she 's set a-goin ' , liftin ' her eyes gentle-like from her book , I could fancy as she knew every trouble I 'd had an ' was glad as they was over . And there 's the Royal Fam'ly on the dais all a settin ' together as free and home-like and smilin ' as if they was n't nothin ' more than flesh an ' blood like you an ' me an ' not a crown among em . Why , they 've actually been a comfort to me . I 've set an ' took my tea on my knee on the step there many a time , because it seemed cheerfuller than in my // own little place at the back . If I was a talkin ' man I might object to the stillness an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an objection as wax-works is open to as a rule , though I ca n't say as it ever impressed me as a very affable gentleman once said it impressed him . " Sm*ethurst , " says he , " you must have a blamed clear conscience ( though , bein ' rather free-spoken , blamed ' was not the precise word employed ) - you must have a blamed clear conscience or I 'm blamed if you could stand so many blamed pair of staring eyes gimleting you year in an ' year out . An ' as to them with works , " says he , " they 're worse than the others , for even if they turn away a minute they always turn back again , as if they would n't trust you out of their sight . " But somehow , I never thought of it in that way , an ' as to not liking the quiet , why should n't I ? In a general way I have n't got no more to say than they have , and so it suits me well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt particular comfortable in the Chamber of Horrors , an ' never would n't have had one , but even in a small collection like mine the public *kmands it , an ' would n't hear of bein ' satisfied without one , " for " says they , " what 's the use of a wax-works without Manning an ' them , an ' the prisoners in the dock an ' the knife as the young woman was cut up in pieces with ? " So I was obliged to have the little back room hung with black , like Madame Tussaud 's in a small way , and fitted up with murders and a model of the guillotine and two or three heads of parties as come to a untimely end in the French Revolution . But it ai nt my taste for all that , and there 's always a heaviness in the air as makes me low-like an ' I 'm glad to turn the key on em at night an ' leave em to have a rest from the stares an ' talk an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame an ' agony of their dreadful deaths . Good Lord ! it turns me sick to think of them havin ' been real livin ' creatures with mothers an ' wives an ' friends , some of em perhaps livin ' to-day all crushed an ' blasted with the horror they 've went through . But that ai nt the story as I 've half-way promised to tell you . If you really want to hear it , mum , I do n't mind tellin ' it , though I do n't know as it will be interestin ' -I 've often wondered if it would be as interestin ' to outsiders as it was to me , bein ' as it 's the story of a friend of mine as was something like me an ' likewise had a waxworks . Would you mind settin ' there , mum , next to the Japanese party ? This lady 's works was broke an ' her bein ' absent at the cleaner 's leaves the chair vacant most convenient . His name it was Joe-this acquaintance of mine , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my build an ' temper . He was a quiet chap an ' a lonely chap , an ' London was his native place-leastways , I do n't see as it could have been no nativer than it was , bein ' as he was laid at the door of a London foundlin ' when he was n't no more than a few days old , and London fed him and clothed him until he was big enough to take care of hisself . He had n't a easy life of it as you may be sure . He was n't handsome nor yet sharp , he could n't answer back nor yet give cheek ; he could only take it , which he had to do frequent . There was plenty of folks as give him the character of a nat'ral born fool , an ' they may have been right . They said as no chap as had his right senses could be as good-natured an ' ready to forgive a injury an ' above all as slow to suspect as one was bein ' done him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm a-goin ' on was the best proof of his bein ' a fool ,  --  an ' he was n't ready enough with his tongue to argy the point . He was n't never good at a argyment-Joe was n't . Well , he growed up , an ' he did first one thing an ' then another , until at last he was picked up by a travelin ' wax-works showman as had just such a collection as this here of mine-havin ' in it just such a Lady Jane Grey , and likewise a sim ' lar Royal Fam'ly . " Well , " says the wax-works man , when Joe first goes to ask for work , " what can you do ? " " Not much , perhaps , " says Joe ; " leastways , I 've not been in the business before ; but if you 'll give me a job , Mister , I can do what I 'm told . " The showman gives him a look from head to foot . " Well , " says he , " at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uns as knows everything an ' ca n't dust a figger without knockin ' its head off . I 've had enough of them sort " - savage like- " a-ruinin ' my Richard Cure the Lion , an ' a-settin ' Mary Queen o ' Scottses insides all wrong " ( which was what his last young man had been adoin ' ) . " No , " answers Joe , slow and serious , " I do n't think as I 'd do that . " // The showman gives him another look , an ' seems sort of satisfied . " Go inside an ' get your dinner , " he says . I 'll try you just because you have n't got so imuch cheek . " And he did try him , an ' pretty well they got on together , after a while . Slowness is not a objection in a wax-works as much as in a business as is less delicater . I 've thought myself as p'r'aps wax-works has their feelin 's , an ' knows who means respec'ful by em an ' who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ful , an ' never took no liberties as he could help . He dusted em reg'lar , an ' wound em iip an ' set em goin ' accordin ' to rules ; but he never tried no larks on em , an ' that was *why he gets along so well with his master . " That other chap was too fond of his *1ark* , " says the showman , kind of gloomy whenever he mentions the first young man . He never forgave him to the day of his death for openin' ' the collection one day with Charles the Secondses helmet on Mrs. Hannah Mooreses head , an ' Daniel in the Lions ' Den in William Pennses spectacles , with some other party 's umbrella under his arm . But Joe were n't of a witty turn , an ' not given to jokes , which is not suited to waxworks as a rule , collections bein ' mostly serious . An ' , as I say , him an ' his master got along so well that one day , after they Ihad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says to him , " Joe , " says he , " I 'm blessed if I 'd mind takin ' you in as a partner . " An ' that very momin ' he has the reg'lar papers made out , an ' the thing was done without no more said ab0ut it . An ' partners they was till he died , which happened very unexpected-him a sayin ' sudden one night when they was a-shuttin ' up together , " Joe , old chap , I 'm blessed if my works ai nt a runnin ' down , " and gives one look round at the figgers , an ' then drops-which the medical man said as it was dropsy of the heart . When his things was looked over , it was found he 'd left everythin ' to Joe except one partic'lar ugly figger , as turned his eyes with a squint an ' could n't be done nothin ' with , an ' him he 'd left to a old maid relation as had a spite agin him ; " for , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he 's the only chap I ever see yet as could match her-let alone stand her , an ' it 's time she was takin ' a partner , if she 's goin ' to . " They did say as it was nearly the party 's death , for , though they 'd quarreled reg'lar for twenty-five years an ' hated each other deadly , she 'd always believed as she 'd come into his belongin 's if she outlived him , thinkin ' as he would n't make no will . Well , havin ' had company for so long , it was nat'ral as Joe should feel lonely-like after this , an ' now an ' then get a trifle downhearted . He did n't find travelin ' all alone as pleasant as it had been , so when he was makin ' anything at all in a place , he 'd stay in it as long as he could , an ' kind of try to persuade hisself as it was kind of home to him , an ' he had things to hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in secret as might have been laughed at if people had knowed em . He knew well enough as he was n't the kind of chap to have a home of his own-men as has homes has wives , an ' who 'd have wanted to marry him , bless you - he was n't the build as young women take to . He were n't nothin ' to look at , an ' he could n't chaff , nor yet lark , nor yet be ready with his tongue . In general , young women was apt to make game of him when their sweethearts brought em ' into the collection , an ' there was times when a pretty , lighthearted one would put him out so as he scarcely knew the Royal Fam'ly by name , and mixed up the Empress of the French and Lucreecher Borgiar in the description . So he lived on , lonesome enough , for two or three year , an ' then somethin ' happened . He went up to London to stay while the races was goin ' on , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there comes in a swell party with a girl on his arm . The swell , as was a tall , fine-lookin ' chap , was in high sperits , an ' had just come in for the lark of the thing , Joe sees plain , for he were makin ' his jokes free an ' easy about everythin ' , an ' laughin ' fit to kill hisself every now an ' then . But the girl were different ; she were a little rosy thing , with round , shinin ' eyes , an ' a soft , little timid way with her . She laughed too , but only shy an ' low , an ' more because she was happy an ' because the swell laughed . She was n't the kind of young woman as the swell ought to have been a-goin ' with . She was dressed in her best , an ' was as pretty as a pictur ' ; but her clothes was all cheap , an ' Joe could see as she belonged to the workin ' class , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleman 's arm , an ' seemed half frightened , an ' yet so glad an ' excited that she would have minded you of a six-year-old child . It were the first time she 'd ever been into a waxworks , an ' things looked wonderful to her . When they come to Lady Jane Grey she was quite took with her , an ' begun to ask questions in the innocentest way . - // " She 's one of the nobility , sir , is n't she ? " she says to her companion . " Did you ever see her ? Is n't she beautiful , sir ? He laughs delighted , an ' squeezes her hand a bit with his arm . " No , Polly , " he says . " I never saw her until to-day . She did n't keep her head on her shoulders long enough . It was cut off some time ago , my dear . " An ' then he whispers : " An ' it was n't nearly as pretty a head as yours , Polly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' tries to laugh too ; but Joe knew as she 'd took the words more to her innocent heart than was good for her . " Lor ' me ! " she says . " What a shame it was to cut her head off-an ' her so sweet an ' quiet ! " " Yes , Polly , " says the young gentleman , a-laughin ' more . " Very quiet . Wax-works are , as a rule . A nice time a proprietor would have , if they were not , with such a lot of queer customers ,  --  Bloody Mary , for instance , and Henry the Eighth , and Nana Sahib , and John Knox , and Lucretia Borgia , - though you do n't know much of their amiable characteristics , my dear . " They went on in that way through the whole room ,  --  him a-jokin ' an ' makin ' light , an ' her enjoyin ' herself an ' admirin ' everythin ' she set eyes on , an ' Joe a-watchin ' her . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of him the minute he first sees her . He kep ' a-wishin ' as the collection was ten times as big , so as it would take longer for her to go through . He could n't bear the thought of seem ' the last of her , an ' when they comes to the Russian party , as stands near the door , dressed for the winter season ,  --  his nose bein ' protected with fur , after the fashion of the country ,  --  his heart were in his mouth , an ' when she passed out into the . crowd , he seemed to swallow it with a gulp , as took it into the heels of his boots . " Lor ' ! " he says , all of a tremble in his insides . " I sha n't never see her again ,  - -  never ! " He had n't no spirit in him all that day , nor the next either . It was as if somethin ' altogether out of common had happened , an ' he could n't never be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down an ' nervous , an ' there was n't a figger in the collection as did n't seem to know it . He took to standin ' at the door whenever he could , a-lookin ' at the people a-passin ' by . An ' yet he scarcely knowed what for . If he 'd seen the face he wanted to , he would n't a ' dared to say a word , nor yet to move a step ; an ' still he was a-hungerin ' day an ' night for a glimpse of what could n't be no good to him . Well , if you 'll believe me , mum , instead of gettin ' easier as time went on , he got uneasier . He was as lonesome again as he had been , an ' he took his tea a-settin ' with the Royal Fam'ly reg'lar ,  --  he could n't have swallowed it by hisself . After shuttin ' up , he 'd go out wanderin ' in the streets nielancholy and wistful like , an ' one night he stops short all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comm ' to him sudden what ailed him . " I 've fell in love , " says he , fearful an ' respec'ful ,  --  " that 's it ,  --  an ' there 's no help for me . I 'm not the man as should have done it , for I ca n't look for nothin ' to come out of it . " He give hisself up to it , because he did n't see no way out of it . Nobody was n't troubled but hisself , an ' so it did n't matter . He got pale an ' thin , an ' did n't sleep well o ' nights , but there was n't no one to bother themselves about him ,  --  there were n't even a soul as he could a ' left the collection to , if he 'd a ' died . It went pretty hard with him to leave London , an ' when he did leave it , he could n't stay away ; an ' I 'm blessed if he did n't come back in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Here 's a place as is somethin ' more than the others , at least , though it is in a sorrowful way , an ' I 'd rather as the collection would earn me a bare livin ' in a sidestreet in London , than make money away from it . I might see her again ; an ' , Lor ' bless me ! what do I want of money a-layin ' back ? " Well , the very first night after he came back , he did see her again . He 'd set out the collection in the room he 'd hired , an ' then he 'd gone out in the old wanderin ' way , an ' he had n't hardly stepped into the street before he comes on a crowd gathered around somethin ' near a lamp-post ; so he stops nat'ral , an ' makes inquiries . " Anybody hurt ? " says he . " No , not exactly , " answers the man he 'd spoke to . " It 's a young woman as has fainted , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' as soon as he claps his eyes on the deathly face under the lamp-light , he sees as it 's the face he 's been lookin ' for an ' thinkin ' about so long . // " It 's her ! " he says , so shook as he did n't know what he was doin ' . " It 's Polly ! " " Polly ! " says the woman as was holdin ' her head . " Do you know her , young man ? If you do , you 'd better speak to her , for she 's just comm ' to , poor little thing ! " He knew he could n't explain , an ' he thinks , besides , as the feelin ' he had for her might make his face look friendlier than a stranger 's , so he kneels down as the woman tells him , just as she opens her eyes . The crowd seemed to frighten her , an ' she began to tremble an ' cry ; an ' so Joe speaks to her , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be afraid , miss , " he says ,  --  " do n't . You 'll be well directly . " She catches hold of his hand like a frightened baby . " Send them away ! " she says . " Please , do n't let them stare at me . I ca n't bear it ! " " Miss , " says Joe , " would you mind bein ' took into a collection , if this good lady would go with you ? " " A collection ! " she says , all bewildered . " I have n't got any money . What is it for ? Oh ! please make them go away ! " " Not a hat took round , miss , " says Joe . " Oh , dear , no ! I was alludin ' to a waxworks which is quite convenient , an ' belongs to me , an ' a fire an ' a cup of tea ready immediate , an ' a good lady to stay with you until you feel better ,  --  an ' all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " Thank you , sir . Oh ! take me away . " So between them , Jo* an ' the good woman helps her up an ' leads her to the door as was but a few steps off ; an ' Joe takes them in an on to the back room , where the fire was a burnin ' an ' the kettle singin ' an ' there he has them both to sit down . The woman makes the girl lie down on the sofa by the fire , an ' she bein ' weak an ' wanderin ' yet did as she was told without askin ' a question . " A cup of tea 'll set her up , " says the woman , " an ' then she can tell us where she lives an ' we can take her home . " Joe went about like a man in a dream . His legs was unsteady under him an ' he was obliged to ask the woman to pour the water on the tea , an ' while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the collection secret , to make sure the Royal Fam'ly was there an ' he was n't out of his head . The woman , havin ' girls of her own , was very motherly an ' handy an ' did all she could , but she could n't stay long , and after she 'd given Polly her tea , she says she must go . " An ' I dare say as the young man as is so kind-hearted 'll come along with me an ' we 'll see you home together , my dear . " They both looks at Polly then a-waitin ' to see what she would say , but she only looked frightened an ' the next minute hides her face in her little hands on the sofa-arm an ' begins to sob . " I have n't got no home , " she says , " nor nowhere to go . What shall I do-what shall I do ? " Then the woman looks very serious an ' a bit hard-like about the mouth-though not as hard as some might have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the least short . " I have n't none , " says Polly . " I lost her a month ago . " " You ai nt in mournin ' , ** says the woman . " No , ma'am , " says Polly , " I could n't afford it . " " An ' your father ? " But this made the poor little thing cry harder than ever . She wrung her hands and sobbed pitiful . " Oh , father ! " she says . " Good , kind , easy father , if you was alive I would n't be like this . You always loved me-always . You never was hard , father . " " What have you been livin ' on ? " says the woman , lookin ' as if she was a-relentin ' . " I was in a shop - But Joe could n't stand no more . " Ma'am , " he says in a undertone , " if a pound or so , which not bein ' a fam'ly man an ' a good business at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , here it is . An ' he pulls a handful of silver out of his pocket and holds it out quite eager an ' yet fearful of givin ' offense . Well , then the woman looks sharp at him . " What do you mean ? " she asks . " Do you want me to take her home with me 9 " " Ma'ani , " says Joe , " yes , if a pound or so But she stops him by turning to the girl . " Are you a respectable young woman ? " she asks . The pretty face was hidden on the sofaarm , an ' the little figure looked so droopin ' that Joe could stand that less than he could stand the other . " Ma'am , " says he hurried , " if five pound It seemed like the woman 's heart was touched , though she answered him rough . " Young man , " she says , " you 're a foolbut if you do n't want me to speak out before // 472 her , take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " So Joe took her into the collection an ' the end of it was that they made an agreement , an ' sharp as she seemed , the woman showed as she was fair and straight an ' would take no advantage . She let Joe persuade her at last to take the girl with her an ' ask no questions , an ' he was to pay her a trifle to make it straight an ' no burden to her . " Though , " says she , " if she had a different face an ' one as was n't so innocent an ' young , I would n't take her at no price-for I 've girls of my own as I tell you , an p'r'aps that 's what makes me easier on her . " When they was gone away , Joe goes into the room they 'd left an ' sets hisself down by the fire an ' stares at the sofa . *She set there , " he says , " an ' she laid her head on the arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her again as sure as I 'm a man . " An ' not a wink of sleep does he get that night , but sits , an ' stares , an ' thinks until the fire dies out into ashes , an ' it 's gray early mornin ' . Through a delicateness of feelin ' , he does not go anywheres near her for a day or so , an ' then the woman-whose name is Mrs. Bonny-calls in to see him . " Well , " she says , " it seems all right so far . She 's a nice little thing , an ' she 's got work in a millinery down town , an ' I 've kept my word an ' asked no questions , an ' will you come an ' have a cup of tea with us this evening ? " Of course he went , glad enough , though awkward , an ' he saw her again , an ' she was prettier an ' innocenter lookin ' than ever , though pale an ' timid . When she give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for bein ' so kind to me , " he could n't say a single word in answer , he were . so bashful an ' upsot . He was always bashful enough , even after they knew each other better an ' was good friends , which they came to be . She seemed to take a childish liking to him , an ' always to be a rememberin ' as she 'd somethin ' to be grateful for . " What made you so kind to me that night , Joe ? " she 'd say . " You had n't never seen me before , you know . Oh , how good you was , Joe ! " An ' he had n't never the courage to tell her as he had . Through one thing an ' another , it was quite a while before she chanced to see the collection , but , at last , one afternoon , they all comes down-Mrs . Bonny , the girls , an ' Folly . Folly was a-goin ' round with Joe , an ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had seen the place and him before . An ' she did . Before she had been in the room three minutes , she begins to look round strange an ' puzzled , an ' when she comes to Lady Jane Grey , she catches Joe 's arm an ' gives a tremblin ' start . " I 've been here before , " she says . " I was here last races-I-oh , Joe , - " and she breaks off with a sob . He sets her in a chair and stands before her , so as the Bonnys ca n't see . " Do n't cry , Folly , " he says , but he says it with a sinkin ' feelin ' , because he sees as she does n't remember him at all , an ' that she has n't forgot her handsome sweetheart . She does n't cry much more for fear of the Bonnys , but she does n't laugh nor talk no more all the rest of the day , an ' her little downcast face was enough to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think as Joe was a fool to hang on so in the face of all this , but it was his way to hang on to a thing quiet an ' steady , and you remember what I 've said about his simpleness . So he does hang on without a bit of hope until through Folly herself he speaks almost without knowing it , an ' it happens in the collection just three months from the day as she recognized Lady Jane Grey . " What made you so good to me that night , Joe ? " she says again to him , moumful an ' gentle . " I never shall forget it . No one else would have been so good . " " Folly , " he says , a-takin ' out his bandanna an ' wipin ' his forehead , for , though a cool day , he had broke out in a free perspiration . " Folly , it was because I loved you . " An ' he went straight through an ' told her the whole story . " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come between you an ' me , Folly , for why should it ? You have nothing to give me , Folly , an ' , consequently , I do n't ask nothin ' . " " No , " says she , in a half whisper . " I have n't nothin ' to give no one . " An ' yet , it was n't three weeks before - ; but , I 'll tell you how it happened . He 'd been invited to the Bonnys ' to tea , an ' when he went there , he found Folly ailin ' . She was white an ' nervous , an ' her eyes looked big an ' woeful . " She had a fright last night , " Mrs. Bonny told him . " Some scamp of a fellow followed her all the way home an ' it 's upsot her . " // She hardly spoke all the evenin ' , but lay back in the big rockin ' - chair a-lookin ' at Joe every now an ' then as if she was askin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid em all good-night an ' was half-way down the street , he hears the door open again , an ' who should come runnin ' after him , but her , all out of breath , an ' catches him by the arm cryin . " Joe , " she says , " do you-do you love me yet , Joe ? " " Folly , " he says , " what is it , my dear ? an ' hearin ' her ask him such a question , turned him almost sick with joy an ' pain together . " Because , " she sobs out ,  --  " because , if you love me yet ,  --  take me , Joe , an ' keep me safe . " An ' before he knows how it happens , he has her in his arms , with her face against his coat . After they was both a bit quiet , he takes her back to Mrs. Bonny , an ' says he : " Mrs. Bonny , Folly an ' me is goin ' to be married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Folly , that 's sensible ; an ' though I say it as should n't , I must own as I would n't care if it was Meliar . " An ' she kisses Folly , an ' the girls kisses her , an ' they all shakes hands , an ' it 's a settled thing . They was married almost immediate , an ' Joe was as happy as a man could be under the circumstances ; for mind you , he was n't a-deceivin ' hisself , an ' knowed well enough as his was n't the kind of a marriage where there 's two hearts beatin ' warm together , an ' both is full of joy an ' hope . " But , " says he , " I never expected this much , an ' I 'd be a queer sort of chap not to be grateful , as the woman I love could turn to me for comfort when she needed it ; an ' if love can bring love , mine 'll be like to do it some day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best , an ' he sometimes thought as Folly drawed a bit nearer to him as time went on . At any rate , she was a good , gentle little thing , an ' always seemed tryin ' to please him in a wistful , longin ' way , as if she had somethin ' to make up for . Once , when they was settin ' together at night , she came an ' knelt down before him , and hid her face on his knee . " Joe , " she says , " was you never afraid to marry me ,  --  when-when you remember as I 'd never told you nothin ' ? " " No , " he answers . " No , Folly ,  --  never . " " But I might have been a wicked girl , " she whispers . " No , " says he , stout and tender . " You might n't , Folly ; " an ' he stoops down an ' kisses her pretty hair . She burst out a-cryin ' , and creeps closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I might have been , " she says ; " but I was n't , Joe ,  --  I was n't , because God an ' you helped me . " An ' yet he knows as there 's somethin ' behind as keeps her from bein ' happy , though she tries so hard an ' faithful . He always sees the wistfulness in her eyes , an ' hears it in her voice , an ' time an ' time again he knows she 's lyin ' awake at night a-grievin ' quiet . One mornin ' , after she 's been lower than common , a letter comes to her , an ' he sees her turn white , an ' after she holds it a minute , she walks up to the fire an ' throws it in , an ' before he goes back to the collection , she comes an ' catches him round the neck , an ' says : " I want to be a good wife , Joe ,  --  I want to be , an ' I will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there comes a swell into the wax-works , an ' as soon as Joe sets eyes on him , he knows it 's the chap he first see Folly with in the race-week , and there he is a-saunterin ' round an ' pretendin ' to be unconcerned , an ' yet keepin ' a sharp look-out around him . So Joe goes up to him , and speaks to him quite firm and low : " Was you lookin ' for any one , sir ? " he asks . The swell looks at him cool enough . " What 's that you say , my good fellow ? " he answers . " Well , " says Joe , " nothing in a general way , perhaps ; only , sir , I was a-thinkin ' as p'r'aps you might be lookin ' for some one as was unprotected an ' helpless , an ' there ai nt no such a party here ; an ' if you 'd like your money returned at the door ,  --  me bein ' the proprietor of the collection ,  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection ! " says the swell ; but he turns round an ' goes out , half alaughin ' . At tea that evenin ' , Folly was dreadful restless an ' timid , an ' seemed to be a-listenin ' to somethin ' , an ' after a bit Joe finds out what it is ,  --  it 's footsteps a-passin ' back'ard an ' for'ard near the house ,  --  passin ' back'ard an ' for'ard reg'lar ; an ' they goes on that way for a good hour , an ' then stops ; an ' all the time Folly sits close to Joe , as if she was afraid to leave him , her eyes shinin ' an ' her voice shakin ' when she speaks . Only // that somethin ' tells him as she does n't want him to go , he would have went out ; and in the middle of the night he was almost sorry he did n't , for she started out of her sleep , callin ' out , frightened : " Oh ! the footsteps  --  the footsteps Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I must go ! " She was quite ill an ' weak for a month , an ' then , queer enough , a change came over her . She got her color back gradual , an ' went out oftener , an ' was brighter when she was in the house . She went to see the Bonnys frequent , a-helpin ' them get ready to take their trip to the sea-side , which they did reg'lar ; for though workin ' - people , they was comfortable off . There was such a alteration in her , that Joe began to feel hopeful , an ' was as cheerful as the day is long ; an ' well he might be , for she actually lays her pretty head on his breast once , an ' whispers : " Joe , I believe I 'm goin ' to be happy ,  - -  an ' it 's all through you bein ' so lovin ' an ' patient . You bore with me a long time ,  - -  did n't you , Joe ? " They had been married neartwelve months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe has to go too , bein ' called away by business ; an ' sorry enough he was to go . But he says to Polly when he kisses her good-bye at the door : " If you get lonesome , pack up an ' go to the Bonnys , my dear , an ' let them take care of you ; but I wont be no longer than I can help . " An ' she gives his neck a little wistful squeeze , half laughin ' , with the tears in her eyes , an ' says : " No , you must n't , because no one can take such care of me as you ; - an ' I want you , Joe . " Well , it happened as his business was got over quicker than he 'd looked for , an ' he gets home within two weeks . But when he gets back he does n't find Polly . Things are a bit upsot , as if she 'd gone off in a hurry , an ' he finds a little letter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bonnys ' , dear Joe-it was so lonesome without you . " An ' when he reads it he sees tear-marks on it , an ' he says to hisself , " Why , here a tear fell , Polly . You must have been a bit low , my dear . " He had that there letter in his hand , an ' was still a-lookin ' at it , when there comes a knqck at the door an ' he answers it , an ' in walks Mrs. Bonny herself . " Well , " she says , " you 've come back , have you ? How are you , an ' how 's Polly ? " " Polly ! " says he . " Polly ! " " Yes , to be sure , " she answers him back , " Polly ; for , to tell the truth , I 've been a bit anxious about her , an ' that 's why I came here the minute I got back to town . " Well , they both stood still an ' looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dazed . " Mrs. Bonny , ma'am , " says he at last , " Polly went to you a week ago , for here 's the letter as tells me so . " " Joe , " says Mrs. Bonny , a fallin ' back an ' turnin ' pale too , " Polly ai nt never been nigh us " Then , " says Joe , " she 's dead . " He never thought of nothin ' else but that some cruel thing had happened as had cut her off in her innocence an ' youth . Think harm of Polly , as had laid her cheek against his breast an ' begged him to come back to her ? Lor ' bless you , ma'am , he loved her far too tender ! It was Mrs. Bonny as first said the word , for even good women is sometimes hard on women , you know . She followed him into the room an ' looked about her , an ' she broke out a-cryin ' , angry an ' yet sorrowful . " Oh , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she have the heart to do it ? " But Joe only answered her bewildered . " The heart , ma'am ! " he says . " Polly ? " " The heart to leave you , " she says . " The heart to go to ruin when there was so much to hold her back  --  the heart to shame a honest man as loved her , an ' her knowin ' what she did ! " " Ruin , ma'am ? " says Joe . " Shame , ma'am ? Polly ? " He rouses himself to understand what she meant , an ' he sees it 's what the other people will say , too , an ' he can not help it or save Polly from it . " It is n't true , " he cries , wild-like . " It is n't nat'ral as it should be . She 's trusted me all along , an ' we was beginnin ' to be , , , happy , an - " You 've trusted her , " says Mrs. Bonny . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets , an ' we knew she had em . An ' there 's my Meliar as heard of some fine gentleman a-follerin her on the street an ' talkin ' to her . " But Joe stops her . " If she does n't come back , " he says , " she 's dead , an ' she died innocent , " an ' would n't hear another word . As soon as he could get his strength together , he gets up an ' begins to set the place in order , a-makin ' it look just as much as if // she was there as he could . He folds away the two or three things as she 's left about , and puts em in the drawers an ' shuts em up , an ' Mrs. Bonny sets a-watchin ' him . She could n't understand the slow , quiet way as he does everything . " Joe , " she says , when he 's done , " what do you mean ? " " Mrs. Bonny , ma'am , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ready for her an ' a-waitin ' , whenever she comes back , an ' Iwwever . " " However ? " says Mrs. Bonny . " Yes , mum , " he says , " howsumever , for love is n't a thing as is easy killed ; but , mind you , I 'm not afraid as her soul has come to hurt , an ' I 've no thought of givin ' her up . " Mrs. Bonny , she sees he 's in earnest , an ' she shakes her head . She meant kind enough , but it was n't her as had been in love with Folly , an ' had worked so hard to win her . When she went Joe followed her to the door . " Ma'am , " he says , " have you any objections as this here should be a secret betwixt you an ' me ? " Well , I 've no doubt as it was a bit hard on her as she should n't have the tellin ' of it an ' the talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showin ' it in her looks ; but she 's a good soul , as I 've said , an ' she promises , an ' Joe , he answers her , " Thank you , ma'am ; an ' would you mind givin ' me your hand on it ? " An ' she does , an ' so they part . You may think what the next week or so was to Joe , when I tell you as , though he tried night an ' day , he could n't hear a word from Folly , or find no sign . An ' still believin ' in her , he would n't make no open stir an ' talk . He had a fancy as perhaps somethin ' of her old trouble had took her off an ' he stuck to it in his mind as she 'd come back an ' tell him all . An ' I dare say you 'll say , " Why should he , in the name of all that 's simple ? " Well , ma'am , he had a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' else would . But it seemed as if all hope was to be tore from him . A-cleanin ' up the room one afternoon , he comes across a piece of half-burnt paper as has lodged in a corner , an ' in pickin ' it up somethin ' catches his eye as strikes him blind an ' weak an ' sick  --  a few words writ in a fine , flourishin ' hand , an ' these was them : " - wasting your life , my sweet Folly , on a stupid felldw who has not even sense enough to see that you are making a sacrifice and breaking your innocent , foolish heart . Do n't break mine , too-do n't turn away from me as you did on that dreadful night . If you love me , trust me . Come to- " That was all , for the rest was burnt ; but when he 'd read it , Joe 's hope was swept away complete . She 'd been gettin ' loveletters from another man , an ' readin ' them an ' keepin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He set down , an ' let the paper drop on the floor . " I-did n't know , " he says , " as them-was women's-ways . Lord help you , Folly ,  - -  an ' me ,  --  an ' Lord be pitiful to It ! " There 's no use of makin ' the story longer than can be helped , an ' besides , words would n't tell what sufferin ' that there little back room saw in the three next weeks . There 's no knowin ' what kept the poor chap from staggerin ' in from his work some night an ' fallin ' heart-broke in death on his lonely hearth . He suffered an ' strove an ' bore , an ' yet kept his secret close . He neither eat nor slept , his face growed white an ' haggard an ' his eyes holler . He kept away from the Bonnys , an ' kept away from all as knowed him . Even the sight of the collection was too much for him . He 'd set there by the ashes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grayness , an ' not carin ' to stir . " I did n't know , " he 'd say again an ' again over slow to hisself an ' the emptiness an ' quiet ,  --  " I did n't know - as them-was women 's ways . " Just five weeks from the time as he 'd come home an ' found his wife gone , he was a-settin ' this very way over the grate one evenin ' at dusk , when he hears a key a-turnin ' in the door gentle-like , an ' he lifts his head to listen . " Who 's that , " he says , " as is tryin ' to come in ? " But the next minute he starts up , a-knockin ' the chair over back'ard , his heart abeatin ' loud enough to be heard , for the one as turned the key was in , an ' had light feet , an ' come an ' pushed the room door open an ' stood there a second . An ' it was Folly , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bless you , though she were a little pale an ' excited . She was even a-laughin ' , in a shy , happy , timid way , an ' her eyes was wide an ' shinin ' . But Joe , he were n't strong enough to bear it . He breaks out into a cry . " Folly , " says he , " is it because you 're dead that you 've come back to me ? " An ' he makes a step , gropin ' an ' staggerin ' , an ' would have fell if she had n't run an ' caught him , an ' pushed him into a chair . " Joe , " she cries out , kneelin ' down before // him ,  --  " Joe , dear Joe , what 's the matter ? It 's Polly , an*-** and she puts her face against his vest in the old way- " an ' you must n't frighten me . " That , an ' the touch of her hand brings him back , an ' he knows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he catches her an ' begins to hug her tight , too shook to say a word . But she pulls back a bit , half frightened an ' half joyful . " Joe , " she says , " did n't you think I was at the Bonnys ' ? Have you been anxious ? " An ' then , a-laughin ' nervous-like , " You must n't squeeze so , Joe-do n't you see ? " An ' she lays the bundle on his knee an ' opens the shawl an ' shows him what 's in it . " He's-he 's only a little one , " she says , a-laughin ' an ' cryin ' true woman fashion , " but he grows every day , an ' he 's noticin ' already . " Joe makes an effort an ' just saves hisself from bustin out in a sob as might have told her all-an ' this time he folds em both up an ' holds em , a-tryin ' to stumble at a prayer in his mind . " Polly , " he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for I do n't understand how it is as it 's come about . " But girl as she is , she sees as there 's sornethin ' behind an ' she gives him a long look . " Joe , " she says , " I 've more to tell than just how this happened , an ' when I lay quiet with little Joe on my arm , I made up my mind as the day I brought him home to you , was the day as had come for you to hear it , an ' so you shall  --  but first I must lay him down an ' make the room warm . " Which she gets up an ' does , an ' wont let Joe do nothin ' but watch her , an ' while she 's at it he sees her sweet young face a-workin ' , an ' when everythin 's done , an ' the fire burnin ' bright , an ' the kettle on , an ' the little fellow comfortable on her armshe draws a little wooden stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' her face is aworkin ' still . " Not as I 'm afraid to tell you now , Joe , though I 've held it back so long ; but sometimes I 've thought as the day would never come when I could , an ' now I 'm so glad-so glad , " she whispers . An ' then a-holdin ' his hand an ' the child 's too , she tells him the whole story of what her secret was an ' why she kep ' it one , an ' as you may guess it was all about the man as Joe had seen her with . The night she 'd fainted in the street she 'd found out his cruel heart for the first time an ' it had well-nigh broke her own . The people as she worked for had turned her off through hearin ' of him , an ' her own mother , as was a hard , strict woman , had believed the scandal an ' turned against her too . An ' then when she had gone to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with words as was worse than blows . " But bein ' so young , Joe , an'so weak , " she says , " I could n't forget him , an ' it seemed as if I could n't bear my life ; an ' I knew that if he come back again it would be harder to turn away from him than ever . An ' it was-an ' when he follorred me an ' tried me so as I knew as I 'd give up if there was n't something to hold me strong . An ' I asked you to save me that night , Joe , an ' you said you would . Joe , " she whispers , " do n't hate me for bein ' so near to sin an shame . " After a little while she tells him the rest . " But even when he knowed I was a good man 's wife he would n't let me rest . He tried to see me again and again , an ' wrote me letters an ' besot me in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' did n't love you as I ought . But the time come when he grew weaker an ' you grew stronger , Joe . How could I live with you day after day an ' see the contrast between you , an ' not learn to love the man as was so patient an ' true to me , an despise him as only loved hisself an ' was too selfish an ' cruel to have either mercy or pity ? So the day come when I knew I need n't fear him nor myself no more an ' I told him so . It was then I told you I was goin ' to be happy ; an ' Joe dear , I was happy-particular lately . Do you believe me , Joe ? - say as you do . " " Yes , Polly , " says Joe . " Thank God ! " " Kiss me , then , " she says , " an ' kiss little Joe , an ' then I 'll tell you how the other come about . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' then the other was soon told . " I had n't seen him for a long time when you went away , " she tells him , " an ' I thought I 'd seen the last of him ; but you had n't been gone a week before I met him face to face in the street ; an ' that same night a letter come , an ' through me bein ' lonesome an ' nervous-like , art ' seem ' him so determined , it frightened me , an ' I made up my mind I 'd go to the Bonnys an ' get heartened up a little before you come back . So I started all in a hurry as soon as I // could get ready . But before I 'd got more than half way to my journey 's end , we had a accident ,  --  not much of a one , for the trains as met each other was n't goin ' so fast but that they could be stopped in time to save much real harm bein ' done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened . But I fainted away , an ' when I come to myself I was lyin ' on a bed in a farm-house near the line , an ' the farmer 's wife , as was a good soul , she was a-takin ' care of me , an ' says she , Where 's your husband , my girl ? ' an ' I says , I 'm not sure I know , ma'am , ' an faints away again . " Well , the next mornin ' I was lyin ' there still , but little Joe was on my arm , an ' I had the strength to tell where I lived , an ' how it was I did n't know where to send for you . An ' the farmer 's wife was like a mother to me , an ' she cheers me up , an ' says , Well , never mind . Bless us ! what a joyful surprise it 'll be to the man ! Think of that ! ' An ' I did think of it until I made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all until I could come home myself ; for , says I , . He 'll think I 'm at the Bonnys ' , an ' it 'll save him bein ' worried . ' An ' that was how it was , Joe , " kind of hesitatin ' . " Have you anything to tell me F " She looks at him timid an ' gentle , an ' he looks down at the fire . " Not if you 'd rather not , Joe , " she says ; " but I thought- " Joe , he thinks a bit , an ' then answers her grave an ' slow : " Polly , " says he , " I found a piece of that there letter . Will you forgive me , an ' let it pass at that for little Joe 's sake ? " She stoops down and kisses his hand , with tears in her eyes . " Yes , " she answers , " an ' for yours too . You 've more to forgive than me , Joe ,  --  an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks him another question , but sets there sweet an ' content , an ' they both sets there almost too happy to speak ; an ' there 's such a look in her face as goes to Joe 's heart , an ' he breaks the quiet , at last , a-sayin ' : " Polly ,  --  I hope it ai nt no wrong in me a-thinkin ' it ,  --  for this ai nt no time for me to have none but the reverentest an ' gratefulest humble heart ,  --  but as you set there with the little fellow so peaceful on your breast , I ca n't help bein ' minded of the Mother as we see ih the churches , an ' as some prays to . " Well , mum , that 's the whole story , an ' somehow it 's run out longer than I thought for but there 's nothin ' more left to say , but that if you could see that there little Joe to-day he 'd astonish you ; for though but five year old , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection by name , an ' is as familiar with Henry the Eighthses fam'ly as I am myself ; an ' says he to me only the other day , " Father - " at least - Well , mum , I suppose I may as well own up to it , now I 've done ,  --  though a nat'ral back'ardness made it easier for me to tell it the other way . But you 're right in supposin ' so ; an ' not to put too fine a point to it , the story is mine ,  --  that there Joe bein ' me an ' Polly my wife , an ' that there collection Smethurstses.
