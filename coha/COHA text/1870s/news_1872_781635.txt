txt Those who remember the terrible consequences that attended the shipment of fireworks to New-Orleans in September , 1871 , will be interested to know that public carriers have at length been discovered having sufficient regard for the lives of their servants to refuse freight of this dangerous nature . It appears that the agent of the Alabama State Fair recently sent to NewYork for material to get up a pyrotechnic display , but failed to induce the Express Company doing business with that part of the South to undertake the delivery . The owners of the steamer Champion , it is to be regretted , had . no such scruples of conscience , andimmediately consented to relieve the Fair Commissioners , or trustees , from their embarrassment . It has long since been pretty clearly established that great danger attends the shipment of even the most harmless fireworks , on steamers and sailing-ships . In ' whatever way the cases are marked . the risk is not much lessened ; for when a vessel begins to roll violently , there is a reasonable probability that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it anything of a combustible nature , it is only by the merest chance or good luck that the whole does not immediately take fire . In September of 1871 , the slip Burnet sailed from New-York for New-Orleans , - with a miscellaneous cargo , of which there were three hundred cases of explosive fire-works , consigned to the firm of McGuAw &; Co. by BLTJEBER &; GOLDSCHMIDT. of Beekman-street . She arrived at her destination without accident . But before the whole consignment had been nut out upon the wharf at New-Orleans , an unfortunate carman. named CONNESS began the carting of the cases , and had just got away with the first load when , by an incautious movement , be displaced a case , and an explosion followed . The poor fellow was literally torn to pieces and scattered over the house-tops like so much chaff . Several persons were struck and seriously injured at the same time . About a month before this occurrence , an explosion of Union torpedoes outside the factory of BLUEZBER &; GOLDSCHMIDT bad resulted in the killing of the latter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the surviving member of the firm from continuing the business . The frequency of accidents of this kind induced Congress to pass slaw in 1871. making it an offense punishable by fine and imprisonment for any person to ship fire-works without setting forth upon the cases the nature of the contents . The first arrest under this act was made last month in this City . A Mr. JOSEPH PIIRDYWaS detected in an attempt to ship fire-works on board the steamer Henry Chauncey as common merchandise ; and , after a lengthy examination , he was very properly held for trial by Commissioner OSBORN . Now , the question for consideration is , does the act of 1871 afford sufficient protection against fire for the traveling public ? In our opinion , it does not . It may suffice for those who travel by railroad exclusively , , , for , in most instances , passenger-trains have few , if any , freight-cars attached . With steamers and sailing-ships it is altogether different , for there is not one of them that does not carry a number of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of an explosion . During the past fey months , fires at sea have b been too painfully frequent , that it is mit unreasonable tl demand from Congress that the act o 1871 shall be amended so that further limit may be put to the shipment of combustible material . Fire-works should be prohibiter altogether .
