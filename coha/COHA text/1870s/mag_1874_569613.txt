ARTiCLE i-AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN STUART MILL. * Tuis is a frank and truthful record of a life marked by more than ordinary distinction in its external contact with the world , and peculiarly strange and sad and instructive in the unfolding of its inner phases . Its interior development furnishes the thread of the whole narrative , as the author meant it should . For he gives three reasons for leaving this memorial of himself : first , that there might be " some record of an education which was unusual and remarkable ; " second , that there might be open to study " the successive phases of a mind which was always pressing forward , " " in an age of transitions in opinions ; " and third , and most especially , that due acknowledgment might be made of " the debts which this intellectual and moral development owed to other persons. ** This life began in London , on the 20th of May , 1806 . Its earthly career was closed , as other hands make record , near Avignon , on the 8th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dates form a period of stirring activity and conflict in the political history of Europe , and of yet more * Autobiography . By JOHN STUAI*T MILL . Now York : ilenry Holt &amp; co. 1873. // stirring activity and conflict in the domain of human thought for the world . The circumstances of this individual life brought it very peculiarly under the molding pressure of one set of influences incident to such a time . We can not wonder , therefore , that the development was abnormal and one-sided , almost to deformity . Tn the case of most men of eminence , the impress of a mother 's animating spirit and plastic touch of love is seen to be determinative of best results . But it is a singular fact that the word " mother " does not once occur in this autobiography , and the sketch shows hardly a sign of anything like homeaffection , filial or fraternal , in its subject . As soon as the birth is announced , the prominent figure in the foreground is the father , only the father , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brains , with a powerful intellect , improved by high culture and tasked with intense work , he was by constitution and by habit devoid of the gentleness and sympathy which are essential qualifications of one who undertakes the training of a child . Then , as in spiteful hostility to the truths of Christianity he broke away from the faith of his fathers and abandoned the service of the Church for which he was educated , he became , by that very act , more cold , skeptical , bitter , unfeeling , and cruel in the rigor with which he insisted on his own ideal of mental development . Hence , almost before the child could go alone , this father snatched him from his nurse 's arms and subjected him to a course of intellectual discipline which seems to us terrible . Mill says : " I have no remembrance of the time when I began to learn Greek ; I have been told that it was when I was three years old . " The precocious development thus early commenced went on under steady pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood and from all association with other boys . Mill rates himself rather below than above par in the natural gifts of quick apprehension , retentive memory , and active , energetic character . Yet we find him at eight years of age reading ilerodotus , Xenophon , and Plato , with only his father for a lexicon . In his eighth year he commenced Latin , a learner , and , at the same time , a teacher of his younger brothers and sisters , compelled // to evince his own proficiency by the results of his teaching . During the next four years , he read the works of all the leading Latin authors , also those of the Greek poets , dramatists , orators , and philosophers , even to Aristotle 's Rhetoric . During the same period , he learned thoroughly geometry and algebra , and was compelled to grapple alone with the problems of the calculus and higher mathematics . This close application to study was interspersed with extensive private reading , chiefly of history , to an extent that seems almost incredible ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation in frequent , long walks taken with his father . His chief amuseinent he found in reading books of experimental science without either performing or witnessing any practical experiments . The inexorable rigor of his training is illustrated by the fact that in the higher mathematics , with which his father had not kept up his early acquired knowledge so as to give needed explanation , the boy " was continually incurring his father 's displeasure by his inability to solve difficult problems for which he did not see that the necessary previous knowledge was wanting . " Some relief from this he found in a voluntary exercise which he took up and called writing histories . Thus in his eleventh and twelfth years , he compiled from Livy and Dionysius a history of the Roman Government , writing enough , he says , to make an octavo volume . This was his play . At about the same age , in addition to his other tasks , he was compelled to write English verses , having been introduced to a few of the choice old poets . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , and in it he made no great proficiency . From the age of twelve , he entered on what he calls an advanced stage of his education and took up Logic , beginning with Bacon 's Orgarton and following that with some Latin treatises on the subject . His subsequent reading of Latin and Greek authors was for the sake of their thoughts , his father requiring him to read aloud in the Greek , especially Plato and Demosthenes , and to answer questions when asked , and making this , at the same time , a severe and irksome drill in Elocution . In his fourteenth year , he was taken through a complete course of Political Economy , partly by the study of such books as were then published on the subject and partly by a sort of peripatetic course of lectures and discussions in walks with his // father . " At this point , " he says , " concluded what can properly be called my lessons . " When about fourteen , he left England for a year , the most of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return his education was carried forward by a different method . The question naturally arises , What moral influences accompanied this severe intellectual discipline ? In a distinct chapter , our author answers this question squarely . His father , stumbling at the problem concerning the existence of evil in the world , had fallen into complete atheism . He found it " impossible to believe that a world so full of evil was the work of an author combining infinite power with perfect good .. ness and righteousness . " " He considered what is commonly presented to mankind as the creed of Christianity to embody the ne plus ultra of wickedness . " Hence , with no less pains than marked the rigor of his intellectual drill , he labored to impress it upon his son 's mind " that the manner in which the world came into existence was a subject on which nothing was known ; " that tfie question " Who made me ? " can not be answered because we have no experience or authoritative information from which to answer it . Coming up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions on this as in other parts of his son 's education , the result was what must be expected . John Mill thus frankly confesses : " I am one of the very few examples in this country of one who has not thrown off religious belieg but never had it . I looked upon the modern exactly as I did upon the ancient religion , as something which in no way concerned me . " Then further on , he says , " My father 's moral convictions , wholly dissevered from religion , were very much of the character of those of the 0-reek philosophers . In his views of life , he partook of the character of the stoic , the epicurean , and the cynic . In his personal qualities , the stoic predominated . His standard of morals was epicurean , inasmuch as it was utilitarian , taking as the exclusive test of right and wrong the tendency of actions to produce pleasure or pain . But he had ( and this was the cynic element ) scarcely any belief in pleasure . Accordingly* temperance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short at the point of modera // tion in all indulgences , was with him as with them about the central point of educational precept . " There was nothing in the associations of the youth to qualify the strong influence of such a father . The habitual frequenters of his father 's house were Bentham and a few of his disciples of the utilitarian school . He seems to have been carefully guarded from all contact with any who might impart other views of Christianity and virtue till his habits of thinking and feeling were unalterably set . The year spent on the continent introduced him to mountain scenery and modified his tastes for life . While in France , he also took lessons in various kinds of bodily exercise , attended lectures on science , and went through a course of the higher mathematics under private tuition . But he thinks the highest advantage of his residence abroad was the fact that he breathed , for a whole year , the free and genial atmosphere of continental life , and thus by contrast apprehended the great defect of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him a strong and permanent interest in continental liberalism , which qualified his subsequent political views . On his return to England , young Mill was called to help his father in preparing for the press a work on Political Economy , by making a running abstract in the form of marginal notes on the manuscript Soon after , he commenced reading law , intending to make that his profession . But his guide was John Austin , a devoted disciple of Bentham , and very naturally Bentham s treatise on Legislation was made their leading text-book . Other works of Bentham were taken up , and then , passing to some of the principal English writers on mental philosophy , his course of law-reading seems only to have brought him out into the field of metaphysics a thorough Benthamite , so that " the principle of utility " became the keystone of his knowledge and beliefs . Mill claims for himself the credit of giving to that philosophical school the title Utilitarian , taking the term out of one of Galt 's novels and applying it to a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which was kept up for three and a half years . At the completion of his seventeenth year , his father secured for him an appointment from the East India Company , in whose // service the most of his own life was spent . John Mill , for thirtyfive years , until the abolition of that corporation , continued his connection with it , rising steadily from the lowest grade of clerks to the highest post in his department This position gave him a support and , at the same time , much leisure for the prosecution of literary pursuits . His chief duty was to write despatches and conduct the political correspondence of the company-an exercise which he deemed profitable both as a training in the expression of opinions and as qualifying his speculative theories by practical observation of the difficulties and obstacles always met with in the conduct of public affairs . He thinks these labors were of considerable value to him as a theoretical reformer of the opinions and institutions of his time . In 1823 , the same year that he enter*d the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by Mr. Bentham and his followers , avowedly as a Radical organ in politics and religion , to make head against the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews , then in the full height of their reputation and influence . The first number opened a direct assault in an Article by James Mill , reviewing the Edinburgh Review from its commencement . The younger Mill had during the previous year commenced his " youthful propagandism " of the new opinions by writing articles for the morning papers . He was now called to assist his father in this attack by reading through the forty volumes of the Edinburgh Review and noting the artitides most open to criticism . The assault made a sensation at the time , but the object of it survived and continues still to hold its leading position as an exponent of the sound conservative thinking of the times , as they move on . From this time , for about five years , young Mill was a constant contributor to the Westminster Review , guided chiefly by his father 's very positive opinions , which , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utilitarian propagandism of that time. * , During this period , he was brought into close relations with Bentham by being made the editor of his great work on Evidence , and this labor he thought gave a great start to his powers of composition . Meantime , for his better self-cultivation , he was learning German with a class of a dozen or more , // who also , in reading and conversation , studied and discussed Political Economy , Logic , and Psychology . In another association , his powers of argument and oratory were cultivated by spoken debates on the leading questions of the day . So we find the subject of this sketch , at the age of twentyone , occupying an office which ensured a support for life , and in literary associations which gave him ample scope for working influence on the world through his pen , for the facile use of which his whole training had given him excellent preparation . His ambition was to be a Reformer , and everything seemed to favor success in his aims . But just then , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a dark cloud . He went on mechanically with his ordinary occupations , but gloomy thoughts filled his mind . He could find no rest or satisfaction in what he was , or in anything before him . He thus describes his condition , in the autumn of 1826 : " I was in a dull state of nerves , such as ever*ybody is occasionally liable to ; unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement ; one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times becomes insipid or indifferent ; the state , I should think , in which converts to Methodism usually are when smitten by their first conviction of sin . ' In this frame of mind , it occurred to me to put the question directly to myself : Suppose that all your objects in life were realized : that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to , could be completely effected at this very instant : would this be a great joy and happiness to you ? ' And an irrepressible self - consciousness distinctly answered No ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation on which my life was constructed fell down . All my happiness was to have been found in the continual pursuit of this one end . The end had ceased to charm , and how could there ever again be any interest in the means ? I seemed to have nothing left to live for In vain I sought relief from my favorite books ; those memorials of past nobleness and greatness from which I had always hitherto drawn strength and animation . I read them now without feeling , or with the accustomed feeling minus all its charms ; and I became persnaded that my // love of mankind and of excellence for its own sake had worn itself out " In this state , he had no friend to whom he could turn for advice . Instinctively he seemed to apprehend that his father could give him no relief for the trouble came from a defect in his education which had been guided mainly by that father 's will . The susceptibilities and sympathies of his nature which had been repressed , almost crushed , by the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong done them . We must think he was nearer right than he supposed , when he compared his state of mind to that of one under religious influences , feeling his way towards a Christian conversion . Pity that he could not have fully understood that God was dealing with him to bring him to know Himself and " Jesus Christ whom he had sent , whom to know is life eternal . " But every avenue through which the true light could find entrance to his soul seems to have been shut . So , for half a year or more , he floundered on , in the depths of gloom . So great was his distress that he says , " I frequently asked myself if 1 could , or if I was bound to go on living when life must be passed in this manner . I generally answered to myself that I did not think I could possibly bear it beyond a year . " At length a little ray broke in upon his gloom from the simple circumstance that as he read in Marmontel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere boy , on his father 's death , felt to be everything to the distressed family , the fountains of feeling in his own soul were opened ; he was moved to tears , and that evidence that all freling was not dead within him lifted the cloud slightly , and gave a new aspect to the possibilities of his future . Shortly afterwards , the power of music , in which one of the imaginative arts he had always found pleasure , touched his sympathies anew as he listened to the melodies of Weber 's " Oberon . " Then , taking up Wordsworth 's poems , he found his soul soothed and charmed by his simple expression of " states of feeling and of thought colored by feeling under the excitement of beauty . " The fact is the man was love-sick , in the sense that he was pining for some object to love . The first step to relief was to apprehend that state , as he could do through the quiet , sentimental verse of the // poet of nature , who tells how " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength and cheerfulness to bear " the burden of existence . " Again we can not repress the wish that he had seen that " light of love " as it beams from the cross of the Crucified and kindles all the soul to a kindred feeling responsive . It was a blessing to him to get this partial relief , increased as it was by an earnest debate into which he entered in defense of the merits of Wordsworth as compared with Byron . The process of recovery was aided by the contact into which he was brought with men of some religious faith and spiritual aspirations , such as Maurice , and Sterling , and Coleridge . His heart , in its new experience , was drawn towards the men , even while it repelled the religious elements which made them attractive . Thus gradually , as the months and years rolled on , he emerged into enjoyable life and action . Mill himself names two marked effects of this experience . The first was the conviction that while , according to his old philosophy , happiness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained only by not making it the direct end . " Those only are happy who have their minds fixed on the happiness of others rather than their own . " The other effect was , so to speak , the revelation of the fact that " the internal culture of the individual " must be placed among the prime necessities of human well-being , " - " that the passive susceptibilities need to be cultivated as well as the active capacities and require to be nourished and enriched as well as guided . " Another consequence of this crisis , gradually unfolded , was a change in his philosophical views , involving a considerable dissent from the opinions early received from his father and Bentham , and an emancipation , in part at least , from the narrowness of a strict interpretation and application of the one fundamental principle of the utilitarian school . Of this change he says : " If I am asked what system of political philosophy I substituted for that which , as a philosophy , I had abandoned , I answer , no system ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex and many-sided than I had previously had any idea of and that its office was to supply , not a set of model institutions , but principles from which the institutions suitable to any given circumstances might be // deduced . " In connection with all this , a deep interest in the political movements and discussions on the continent , consequent on the French revolution of 1830 , came in , with the writings of Comte and the socialist theories of Saint Simon , to qualify his Liberalism and his hopes and efforts for accomplishing something for the general elevation and improvement of mankind . That strange crisis of this strangely developed life ended with the beginning of a new association  --  the introduction of a new influence , more effective , if we may accept the author 's conviction , than all others on the last forty years , and on the lasting fruits of this man 's life . Tn 1830 , when in his twentyfifth year , Mill , whose soul had been so sick , if we read the case aright for the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for all the rest of his days , his affections went out in idolatrous devotion . It so happened that she who so charmed him was the wife of another man and the mother of children by him . But their mutual affinity was strong enough to overcome this barrier . It only qualified their mutual passion , repressing , for the time , the sensuous element , and bringing out what comes nearer to that ideal Platonic love , much talked og than anything else we have read of in these modern days . For , no doubt , we may believe Mill 's distinct statement that during the lifetime of the legitimate husband , their personal intercourse was held under due restraint , though passing many hours of every day in each other 's society . At the same time , each seems to have cherished a true esteem and strong affection for the man whom , according to the current sentiment of Christian morality , they were both so flagrantly wronging , but who submitted to the wrong without complaint . In this restriction upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferred to the common sense of propriety in the community . For he says explicitly , neither the principles inculcated by his father , nor his own convictions , nor the lady 's views of duty , would have hindered their devoting themselves to each other , in entire disregard of the previous marriage connection . As it was , this intimacy involved the breaking of friendship with other women of great woi-thiness into whose society he had been thrown , and who had shown him great // kindness . Those ladies justly refused to receive , even as their friend 's friend , a woman so lightly held by her sacred marriagevows . The consequence was that they were shut up almost exclusively to each other and to the full force of their mutual influence . To the imagination of Mill , Mrs. Taylor is presented as the ideal of personal excellence . He says : " I soon perceived that she possessed in combination the qualities which in all other persons whom I had known I had been only too happy to find singly . In her , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes a pretended perfection to the order of nature and the universe ) , and an earnest protest against many things which are still part of the established constitution of society , resulted not from the hard intellect , but from strength of noble and elevated feeling , and co-existed with a highly reverential nature . ' " Her intellectual gifts did but minister to a moral character at once the noblest and the best balanced which I have ever met with in life . Her unselfishness was not that of a taught system of duties , but of a heart which thoroughly identified itself with the feelings of others , and often went to excess in consideration for them by imaginatively investing their feelings with the intensity of its own . The passion of justice might have been thought to be her strongest feeling , but for her boundless generosity and a lovingness ever ready to pour itself forth upon any or all human beings who were capable of giving the smallest feeling in return . The rest of her moral characteristics were such as naturally accompany these qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loftiest pride ; a simplicity and sincerity which were absolute towards all who were fit to receive them ; the utmost scorn of whatever was mean and cowardly , and a burning indignation at everything brutal or tyrannical , faithless or dishonorable in conduct and character , while making the broadest distinction between mala in se and mere mala prohibita-between acts giving evidence of intrinsic badness in feeling and character , and those which are only violations of conventions either good or bad , violations which , whether in themselves right or wrong , are capable of being committed by // persons in every other respect loveable or admirable . " This passage may stand without comment both as his fancy-portrait of the woman whom he loved , and as a type of that morality which has no settled foundation in the recognition of a supreme God . Of this woman 's influence on himself and his subsequent labors , he says , " What I owe even intellectually to her is in its detail almost infinite . " " Not only during the years of our married life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded , all my published writings were as much her work as mine ; her share in them constantly increasing as years advanced . But in certain cases , what belongs to her can be distinguished and specially identified . Over and above the general influence which her mind had over mine , the most valuable ideas and features in these joint productions - those which have been most fruitful of important results , and have contributed most to the success and reputation of the works themselves , originated with her , were emanations from her mind , my part in them being no greater than in any of the thoughts which I found in previous writers , and made my own only by incorporating them with my own system of thought . " , His whole strain of enthusiastic eulogy of this woman sounds like infatuation , especially when we read the statement from one competent to say it , that " nobody else among those who knew her discovered in her these lofty gifts . " There is no doubt that Mill 's mind was encouraged and strengthened by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religion which , though he terms it wise , we may safely call his greatest folly . In the autobiography , we have detailed accounts of the manner in which those works which have given him his chief distinction were conceived , matured , and published to the world . But we will not follow the narrative through those details nor stop here to criticise their merits or their influence . Mr. Taylor died in July , 1849 ; and in the year 1851 , after twenty years of the strange intimacy already referred to , that which Mill calls the " most valuable friendship of his life " was consummated by a formal marriage , and so , he says , " was added to the partnership of thought , feeling , and writing which // had long existed , a partnership of our entire existence . " For seven and a half years they were spared to each other , and after her death , near Avignon , he fixed his residence near her grave , where , with her eldest daughter , he cherished her memory as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with supreme regard to her approbation . To complete the outline sketch of this life , we need only notice the facts that , on the dissolution of the East Tudia Company in 1856 , Mill retired from the office he had so long held and occupied himself altogether with his literary labors till 1865 , when he was returned to Parliament . His career in that body was not particularly marked . It seems to have disappointed his constituents . He showed some independence in action , but had not much influence . He says of himself , " The most important , perhaps the only really important public service I performed in the capacity of a member of Parliament , was the motion to amend the reform bill so as to admit women to the suffrage . " This measure was rejected , and in the subsequent new election he also was rejected , his extreme views on that and other subjects having intensified the opposition of the Conservative party and weakened the enthusiasm of the Liberals towards him . Here the autobiography closes with the statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of a country life in the south of Europe , alternating twice a year with a residence of some few weeks or months in the neighborhood of London , " and a brief notice of the miscellaneous literary work to which he devoted his leisure . We do not propose to speak at length of the merits of the man and his works , nor to estimate the measure of influence which has proceeded or may yet proceed from the life thus sketched . It was evidently a life of wonderful mental activity , through the whole period of which a strong and highly cultivated intellect was tasked to give to the world its best thoughts on the philosophy and the practical problems of man 's social state . But , as evidently , there was wanting all along the balance of sound judgment and the nerve of established prin ciple which are essential elements of that influence which is abiding and controlling for best results in the world 's progress . As his own mind , warped off from the old foundations of // knowledge and belieg found no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writings is to unsettle the existing foundations of human society without furnishing any new and reliable supports . This autobiography seems to come in as a timely safeguard against the worst mischief of many of his other books , because it reveals so clearly the purely destructive tendency of his theories of reform . We may fitly linger a moment and gather up the lessons of the book as they appear in connection with the three reasons named by the author for preparing it . 1 . The course of education presented was " unusual and remar/cable " as respects its early beginning ,  --  its authoritative direction by the single mind and will of a stern father ,  --  its wide range and the intense pressure under which it was carried on ,  --  the prominence given to the study of language and the methods by which that study was advanced ,  --  the special effort made to develop the pupil 's power of thought and expression by conversation and discussion with the teacher on the topics of study and reading ,  --  the seclusion of the boy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter omission of all culture of the affections , and the rigorous exclusion of all religious truth and practice , or rather the positive and persistent inculcation of ideas adverse to all faith and godliness . The most remarkable thing of all is that such a process could be carried through and that it should prove successful For it must be acknowledged a success , so far as realizing the aim of him who planned and guided it is concerned . IRarely is it the privilege of a teacher to see his desire so fully accomplished . There is , however , little reason to expect or apprehend that the example , as a whole , will be often imitated . It stands before us in this presentation , self-condemned . For some reason , the father never repeated the experiment with another of his children . Scarcely one child in five hundred could be found with physical and mental constitution capable of enduring the process . The details of the process shock our common sense of what is right and wise and good , so that a father willing thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rarely appear . And not more than once in a generation could it happen that father and son should be thrown together // with the mutual adaptation essential to the carrying out of such a course of education . At the same time , the example , forbidding though it be as a whole , is suggestive of some considerations that seem timely and valuable . It encourages intelligent parents to take the education of their children , in its first stages at least , into their own hands more than is ordinarily done , and to begin some intellectual exercise early . The tendency to a contrary course of action , especially in our country , has run to an extreme that needs correction . It suggests the importance and value of authoritative requirement in order to secure the thorough and effective discipline of young minds . We see a tendency growing in certain quarters to depend too much on " the persuasion of soft words , " rather than the prescription of authority , and to leave the pupil to apply his mind to what best pleases himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , will be for his best good . It suggests also the advantage of occupying the mind of a child early with the study of some language not its own , and by methods more simple than the rules and formulas of abstract grammar . Words and sounds and idioms of speech may be most happily mastered before the mind attains maturity sufficient for their accurate analysis . And especially does this example indicate the great value of that which Mill terms " the cardinal point in his training , "  --  the effort of his father to make his education more than mere " cram , " by requiring him to master for himself and to express as his own what he learned and read . No one knows that he knows a thing till he can tell it , and in this view those talks as they walked are worthy of frequent imitation . Though these things appear in Mill 's case to have been pressed to a violent extreme , they are nevertheless hints worthy of special notice and capable of being used to real profit Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are instructed . For a full knowledge of mankind and their wantsfor power to sway men and reform society , the training of the boy must be in contact with boys , the ripening of the man in contact with men of more than one type . Only so can the ability be acquired of harmonizing the theoretical and the practical in well-balanced judgments . Furthermore , for the // symmetrical development of the individual , the culture of the intellect and the culture of the feelings must advance together , that they may reciprocally warm and regulate each other . And finally , the success of this father in impressing his son with his own convictions and feelings respecting religion , and the sad consequences of that success , may well confirm our faith in the necessity and the efficiency of a genuine Christian nurtare , that some positive religious elements may flow into and qualify the whole course of education from its earliest beginning . So , only so , will the God of our religious faith be apprehended in his true relation to all science , all history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect reach its legitimate climax of strength and glory , when pervaded and ruled by the sweetness and power of love supreme to Him who is Most High and Most Holy . 2 . From noting , as we have endeavored fairly to do , the successive phases of this mind , as it pressed forward in an age of transition in opinions , we learn , first , how the progressive advance of such a mind may be determined for it , as by a fixed law of momentum , through the direction given by the first force impressed ; and second , how easily such an one may come under the self-deception of thinking that he is dealing fairly with all questions and forming opinions candidly , as in a pure white light , while he is real1y**taking a one-sided view of everything , by a light that comes through a medium which excludes all colors but one . Mill 's mind never really broke from the leading-strings of his father 's early influence . The other forces which were permitted to act upon it come in only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was started . This seems to us the great fault and failure of that education of which we have just spoken . It did not so draw out the soul as to give it full freedom for the exercise of all its capacities . It did not launch the soul into the pure air of heaven for a lofty flight on balanced wing under the free impulse of its own noblest instincts and the attractions of grandest objects distinctly apprehended , in a wide world , all open to its gaze . This was an active soul , shut into a contracted sphere ,  --  really in bondage , while glorying in its liberalism . And does not the same thing characterize much of the // boastful progress of self-styled " liberals generally . " " If the truth , " the whole truth , " shall make you free , then are ye free indeed . " 3 . To some it may seem a mere affectation of modesty in Mill to make formal acknowledgment of his obligation to other persons for the intellectual and moral development on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard it rather as the prompting of an ingenuous soul , who , with a high estimate of what he had grown to , was conscious of having been much aided by the influence of others , and felt in honor bound gratefully to indicate the sources of that influence . Through all his life , it appears plainly that he was , more than most persons , susceptible to impression from other minds . He was not an original thinker . His chief distinction was the ability to give fresh , clear , and forcible expression to ideas which , with quick perception , he had received and made his own by absorption . It is creditable to him that he understood himself so well and was so frank as to avow his indebtedness . In this recognition were included , no doubt , Mr. Bentham and his disciples and others with whom Mill was associated in the years of his greatest activity in his intellectual progress . But chiefly , the tribute belongs to the father , whose authority was supreme and unresisted in the first stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witchery of magnetism over all his later years , to life 's end . Honorable as this tribute was in its motive , and just as it was in its recognition of real merit , yet to the sober judgment of common people the expression of it seems excessive towards both persons . The abject submission of the youth to the absolute , sometimes unreasonable exercise of parental authority , goes beyond the requirement of the fifth commandment ; and in later years , the language of deference and admiration for that father 's judgment is such as men are wont to use towards one whom they conceive of as a superior being , endowed with wisdom infallible ; nor could any worshiper of Astarte , or Venus , or the Holy Virgin , express his adoration in higher strains of eulogy and devotion , than we find here employed respecting the woman who became the idol of this man 's affections . Indeed , it does seem that the religious instinct , in this case , suppressed towards its legitimate object , // could not be stifled , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range on which to exercise itself The veneration which was meant to flow towards God , the Sovereign Lord and authoritative guide of our life , was turned aside to spend itself on a human father .
