Saxe , John Godfrey , 1816-1887 : THE DECLARATION . from The declaration 1872 " Faith ! women are riddles ! " I muttered one day , As I sat by my beautiful Bess ; It seems very queer that whatever they say , Their meaning no mortal can guess . I knew that she loved me by many a sign That served her affection to show ; But when I suggested , will Betty be mine ? Confound her !  --  she answered me " No ! " ' T is the way with the sex  --  so I often had heard  --  And thus their assent they express ; But I could n't but think it extremely absurd That a " No " was the same as a " Yes . " So I ask 'd her again , with my heart in a whirl , And said , " Do not answer me so ! " When twice in succession the mischievous girl Repeated that odious " No . " " There ! " she said , with a laugh , " that is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't have forced me to say it again ; For I think I have spoken it twice . " " I see , " I exclaim 'd , as I clasped in my own The hand of my beautiful Bess ; " I now recollect  --  what the grammar has shown  --  Two negatives equal a " Yes . "
