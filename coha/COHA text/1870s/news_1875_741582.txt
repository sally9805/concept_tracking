txt For a supremely stupid legislative session , such as this has thus far proved and promises to be to the close , the past week was noteworthy from the fact that it developed two or three points of originality , and that , in the main , there has been some interruption of the Democratic Party programme which may end in serious conflict before many weeks have elapsed . And the condition of affairs derives additional interest from the fact that this peculiar state of chaos , which now marks the site of what was but so lately the temple of Democratic policy , was wrought , not by the " responsible majority , " as it is represented on the floor of the Assembly , but by a few of the several " bosses , " to all of whom the party owes fealty , and through whom the " institution " of Democracy is so terribly racked throughout the State , in the effort to obey them all . No one who has ever seen this Legislature e. , the lower branch of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of itself . It gets its orders , and in a disjointed way tries to carry them out , but the orders come from too many points of the compass , and harmony of action is out of the question . The Canal " Ring " has its little coterie on the floor , and there is also an antiCanal Ring element , which possesses , perhaps , less absolute strength , so far as Gov . Alvord 's idea of the " brute force of votes " is concerned . But it certainly possesses More of the kind of ability which makes a show upon the floor of the House . The Canal Ring has money and patronage at its back , but not one good sharp debater on the floor . Instead of an orator there are several long-headed men like Willard Johnson , and Page , of Oswego , who can do enough quiet wire-pulling in an evening at the hotes to upset all the logic and facts that could be crammed into a ten hours ' speech . Davis , of Washington , is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canal Ring with a sharp stick ever since the session opened . In his speeches he carries conviction to the ear of all who listen , but after listening and being convinced they do n't vote his way more than once out of a dozen times  --  which clearly shows that Johnson 's whisper is far more potent than Davis ' declamation . THE SOUTHERN TIER MEN AND THEIR LEADER . Another and distinct element in the House are what are known as the " Southern tier " delegations , of whom Speaker is properly recognized as the leader . On State affairs generally they exert a great influence , and when they swing into line with John Kelly on New-York City affairs , as they have manifested a singular proneness to do on several occasions ? notably the United States Senatorship and the Costigan bill  --  they are strong almost to invulnerability , as they carry the Canal party on such questions , giving in return their support to the latter faction when it is needed . It is an undoubted drawback to the Southern tier men that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to concentrate them , as has been frequently the case , the Speaker has had to leave the chair and take the floor . He has always been very effective on these occasions , even when possessing no argument but pure party cry ; but it is a matter of no little risk for a Speaker to leave his position in other hands pro tern. , for important questions are very trequently decided by prompt perception and rapid rulings on the part of the presiding officer . THE " LIGHT " BRIGADE . As a disciplined organization on the floor , of course the Tammany delegation takes the palm . Like the immortalized " Six Hundred " of Balaklava , " Theirs not to reason why , Theirs not to make reply , Theirs but to do " The Tammany delegation rarely takes any part in debate , but it is inspiring to the hearts of all independent minded patriots to see the way they vote . No running about the chamber . or " ear-wigging , " or giving or receiving of instructions . In a division of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammany list , and as Bennett votes so vote his sixteen fraternal colleagues . Within a week or two there has been a light diversion , created by the penchant which Mr. Dessar has developed for speech-making on every question that comes up , but no serious consequences are threatened either to Mr. Dessar 's health , to the positions of Messrs . Daly and Wachner , as leaders . or to the general welfare a the party . THE HOME-RITLE DILEMMA . These little groups of strength which I have briefly outlined have lately been subjected to a shock which threatens to impair their efficiency when concert of action is required , and it came about in this wise : All the world knews that the Democracy , in convention at Utica last Fall , swore eternal fidelity to , and uncompromising hostility toward any abridgement of the principle of home rule . It has been the key-note of every speech made from the majority side of the House , especially from the Tammany wing . It was understood that John Kelly and Mayor Wickham had sent up here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept in the State museum , and to be visited and regarded as their divinity by the delegation . But in a moment of painful abstractedness John and the Mayor sent over to New-Jersey for Gen. Fitz John Porter to come and take Commissioner Van Nort 's place . The " plank " rotted out of the Utica platform immediately ; the delegation no longer venerates the stuffed specimen , or the . idea which it represented ; and there is a fearful vacuum in Democratic statesmen 's vocabulary , and a hiatus in the catalogue  --  a bead dropped from the rosary  --  of party principles . But the trouble does not end here . The whole party was as much committed to Home Rule as was John Kelly , but at once the defection spread , and there is now no knowing where it will stop . Mr. Lawrence , of Columbia , believes he has as much right to " bolt " the platform as any other man , and so took an opportunity on Friday last to rap Home Rule severely by introducmg a bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 30 , 1873 , " which is the chronological title of the charter of the ? City of New-York . In his bill he so far revels in the demolition of this " fundamental Demogratis principle " above spoken of as to suggest to the rural members of the majority side that they turn Mayor Wickham and the new Board of Aldermen out of office next month , and allow the people to elect other Democrats to the vacant positions . Thetis one position on Home Rule  --  Albany and the State at large against the City of New-York , and the last is to give the Governor the power to appoint a Controller . The dose , it must be confessed , is a strong one , and would be conducive of great improvement in the health and moral tone of the party . But , being so strong , it - would undoubtedly act as an emetic on John Kelly 's gastric system , and of course Tammany 's " light brigade " will be expected to bring ? their best cavalry tactics , " Black-Horse , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad effect which Gen. Porter 's appointment will have on the programme will be , doubtless , to knock Mr. Henschel 's Home Rule resolution out of existence . This resolution , it will be remembered , calls on the Committee on the Affairs of Cities to inquire into and report as to the number of persons who are now , or have been since 1870 , employed in the New-York City departments through the influence , direct or indirect , of Senators or Assemblymen . The preamble to the resolution opens with a flourishing exordium on " the overwhelming indorsement which the people-of the State gave to the Democratic principle of Home Rule , as enunciated at the Utica Convention , " &c.,; and it would be interesting now to know whether an amendment to that preamble would not be in order . Mr. Henschel intended to have called his resolution up on Wednesday last , but Mayor Wickham had meanwhile brought his Bobadil from NewJersey and made things inconvenient for Mr. Henschel . Some of the Republican members now talk of moving the resolution in case its originator fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons are quite unfeeling in the way in which they make random inquiries as to " when the Legislature will adjourn . " They seem to display some sortof anxiety about it , as though this Legislature was something that should be gotten rid of as soon as possible . These people forget that it would be very unseemly for a Legislature to adjourn without doing something . On the other hand the question is naturally asked , " when will they do something ? " and every member looks at his fellow for a response . Speakto the best Democrats in the House about adjournment , and they will tell you that they " do n't think they can get through before the end of April  --  it may run into May , indeed ; for , yon know , there is a great deal to be done in the way of framing these General Laws . " Ask who is framing these laws , and what has been already done , and no one seems to know anything about them . The Republican members of the House introduced early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the requirements under the constitutional amendments , and the effect of their prompt action was to stir up a very strong and outspoken feeling of envy and jealousy on the part of the majority side . A little later some of the few Democrats who can draw a bill scraped together some ideas , and in other eases copied almost literally some of Mr. Prince 's bills , and introduced them as " general laws , " but thus far nothing has been done with any of these bills , and they are kept sleeping , like dormice , in the pigeon-holes of the Judiciary Committee 's desks until the advent of Spring warms them up , and . they will then be rushed through hastily and incVnplete , probably in the closing hours of the seseion . Political legislation will be deemed of far more consequence , for a week or two yet , than the passage of general laws for the people , and while the Senate is busy with the now historic Costigan bill , the House may have a splendid spurt one of these days over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
