ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Throughout the preparation of this volume Mr. Robert Campbell , secretary of the Actors ' Fund of America and the son of Bartley Campbell , has given me constant and invaluable aid . This formal recognition of his help is but a poor indication or the gratitude I owe him . I wish to express my thanks to Mrs. Abbott Graves ( Montie Aldrich ) for answering vexing questions about her manuscript of My Partner ; to George and Portia Kernodle for searching the Cleveland , Ohio , newspapers for reviews of Campbell 's plays and for securing some London reviews of My Partner ; to Mr. William Coder for giving me , from his unpublished History of the Philadelphia Theatre , 1855-1878 , the dates of the Campbell performances in Philadelphia ; to Miss Henriette Naeseth for information about the Deadwood , S.D. , performances ; to Mr. John Gerber and Mr. Merwin A. Meyers for searching the Pittsburgh and Boston newspapers respectively ; and to Miss Catherine Sturtevant for valuable aid given throughout the editing of the volume . Gratitude is also due to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Beatrice Winser of the Public Library of Newark , N.J. , to Miss Irene Stewart of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh , to Mr. Richard G. Hensley of the Boston Public Library , and to Mr. Henry House of Springfield , Ill . BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Bartley Campbell was seen to be an extremely tall and slender , youngish , light complexioned man , with curly auburn hair ; the perfect double for Artemus Ward . Mr. Campbell has been , like him and Mark Twain , and Mr. Howells , a western journalist , and is evidently a genuine product of the soil , with all his Americanisms still flagrant upon him from the cut of his necktie to the cut of his boots . " The man so described by the Boston Evening Transcript on December 6 , 1879 , the day after he had made a curtain speech at the opening of his play Fairfax at the Park Theatre , had suddenly , after years of comparative failure , become the most popular of American playwrights . The recent and great success of My Partner at the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , had made the opening of Fairfax in Boston a highly important theatrical event . Bartley Thomas Campbell , Footnote : 1kb the son of Bartley and Mary ( Eckles ) Campbell , both of whom had emigrated from Ireland in 1840 , was born on August 12 , 1843 , in Allegheny City ( now a part of Pittsburgh ) , Pa . His father was the proprietor of a brickyard , in which Bartley worked as a boy . Of his education one obituary notice said , " Bartley , they say , never went to school a year in his life . He never saw the inside of a grammar . " Note : 1Kb While this statement may be somewhat exaggerated , it is certain that he received little schooling except that given him at home by his much older brother Robert . At a very early age Note : 1Kb Campbell began to work on the Pittsburgh Post and until 1868 was engaged mainly in various kinds of journalistic work in Pittsburgh . On the Pittsburgh Leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic critic . According to the New York Herald , Note : 1Kb he " was regarded as a faithful critic , so faithful in fact as to warrant the chastisement of an actor and endanger the publication of the paper with libel suits . It is remembered that the entire staff of the Leader breathed easier when Mr. Campbell left the office and commenced to publish the Mail . " In Pittsburgh on March 26 , 1868 , Campbell married Miss Elizabeth Woodhouse . Throughout Campbell 's career his wife was his constant companion and helper . She survived him many years . To Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were born three children : a girl who died in infancy , and two sons , Robert and John , both of whom have been connected with the American theater . The Pittsburgh Mail which Campbell founded in 1868 was very short lived , and upon its failure he left Pittsburgh . After a short stay in Philadelphia , where he worked on the Press and where he was arrested because of something he wrote for that paper , he started for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in business . On the way there he stopped in Louisville , Ky. , and for a short time was employed by Henry Watterson on the Louisville Courier Journal . In New Orleans Campbell founded the Southern Monthly Magazine . Although only two issues appeared , August and September 1869 , Campbell wrote for it articles , poems , criticism , and one novel . After the failure of the magazine Campbell 's brother secured for him the position of official reporter of the Louisiana legislature , a position he held until the spring of 1870 when he started back to Pittsburgh . On his way he stopped in Cincinnati , where he worked for a short time on the Cincinnati Enquirer . In Pittsburgh he founded another short-lived newspaper called simply The Paper . Before Campbell began writing plays , he had achieved some little reputation not only as a reporter , dramatic critic , and magazine editor , but as a writer of " popular " tales and verse . From about 1860 to 1872 he wrote tales and sketches which were published , usually anonymously , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury , The New York Ledger , and Leslie 's Weekly . At least two novels , Almost LostFootnote : 1kb and Who Killed Her ? were published under his own name . After Campbell began writing plays , he seldom mentioned these works , and when he did , it was with great contempt . But he was very proud of his verse , and continued to write it until the end of his career . Dramatic critics often referred with great respect to Campbell 's poetry . This consisted of lyrics , sometimes used as songs in his plays , narrative poems , and all sorts of occasional poems . Campbell 's most ambitious poetic effort was his drama Clio . It is unfortunate that the manuscript of this play has been lost . A few of Campbell 's poems were published in magazines , but most of them appeared in newspapers . Among his better known poems were " Grant , " Note : 1Kb " Victor Hugo , " Note : 1Kb " The Legend of Eddystone , " Note : 1Kb and " That Baby of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dialect poem in the manner of Will Carleton 's Farm Ballads , was frequently recited by Campbell at benefits and first nights , and had the honor of being included in at least one " elocution book . " Note : 1Kb Typical examples of Campbell 's prose narratives , essays , dramatic criticism , and verse are to be found in the two issues of The Southern Monthly Magazine . Campbell seems to have begun his career as a dramatist sometime early in 1871 . In May of that year his first dramatic work , America an Historical Allegory , was published in Pittsburgh . Peril was copyrighted November 1 , 1871 , and Through Fire two days later . The latter was first performed at the Pittsburgh Opera House at the Christmas matine , 1871 , and the former at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , February 12 , 1872 . After the Philadelphia production of Peril he superintended a production of it at the Academy of Music in Chicago where it had but little success . Of the next period in his life Campbell told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did I do ? ' I led a regular Bohemian life for a time , and had some strange experiences . I wrote stories , poems , edited cookbooks , made speeches for political aspirants with more money than brains . I recollect I was employed by a very poetical brewer to bolster up his business in verse . Parnassus and vats do n't hitch . ' How was it I fell in with Hooley ? ' Well , " said Bartley , " about a year after the Chicago production of Peril I heard Hooley had opened a comedy theater here . Padgett was associated in the management , and when Hooley signified a desire to secure a resident author , Padgett , who had seen Peril , recommended me . I was eager for the post , and put my salary at $25 a week and $10 a night for my plays . A bargain was struck . I recollect the day of my arrival distinctly . The city was decked in robes of ermine , " Bartley poetically remarked . " Hooley and I went into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman house was n't built  --  and over Scotch , Hooley unbosomed himself . He began with the solemn statement that the whole thing was a failure and a fraud  --  meaning the new theater . He had been advised to start a comedy theater here by one of the leading newspaper proprietors . He had been running six weeks , and he Hooley had lost $1800 . ' I know this , ' he said , ' what they want is a nigger band . Unless comedy looms up in a couple of weeks , we 've got to get right longside of ' em . ' " Footnote : 1kb The Hooley Theatre did finally prosper , and Campbell probably had much to do with bringing this about . From December 1872 until the end of the season of 1875-76 , Campbell was connected with the theatrical activities of R. M. Hooley , both as " literary attach " and general assistant . As " literary attach " he revised old plays , and wrote Fate , Risks , On the Rhine , The Virginian , Hearts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto of Hooley 's Chicago theater , " The Parlor Home of Comedy . " As general assistant he aided in the selection of the company , Footnote : 1kb which , incidentally , was one of the best in the West , helped direct it , and assisted in the staging of the plays . Campbell went with the Hooley Company to San Francisco in the summer of 1874 and there met Mark Twain , with whom he formed a lasting friendship . When , in September 1875 , Hooley temporarily lost control of the Chicago theater , Campbell went with him to Hooley 's Brooklyn theater where he aided the manager in his attempt to change it from a minstrel house to another " parlor home of comedy . " Campbell produced there a number of the plays he had brought out for Hooley elsewhere , but evidently without success , for the theater soon returned to minstrelsy . In addition to the work done for Hooley , between 1872 and 1875 Campbell wrote Little Sunshine for Ettie Henderson from whom he received $1600 , Gran Uale for Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New World for W. H. Ellis . He also revised Through Fire for Frank Aiken , which piece Aiken copyrighted as The Argonauts of ' 49 but played as Bert ; or , Ocean to Ocean . In the autumn of 1876 Campbell went to London where he supervised a moderately successful production of The Virginian . Returning home early in 1876 , he sold the rights of A Heroine in Rags , which he had written in London , to Effie Ellsler and directed its production in Cleveland and Philadelphia . In the summer of 1876 Campbell organized a theatrical combination for the production of his own plays , and with it toured the country during the seasons of 1876-77 and 1877-78 . The company at various times contained such popular actors and actresses as Harold Forsberg , J. W. Morris , W. H. Leake , Rosa Rand , Estelle Mortimer , and Josie Batchelder . The repertoire consisted of various old favorites and at least three new plays : How Women Love , My Foolish Wife , and Clio . During these two seasons Campbell had little success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he later told an interviewer : " I struggled hard against fate  --  sometimes elated and sometimes depressed . I failed to get a New York opening , and my failure to do that so discouraged me that at the end of the last season I began to look at the footlights as a chimera . I had made up my mind to burn all of my plays , and return to journalism . " Footnote : 1kb Campbell then told the reporter of the marvelous change in luck which came to him in the autumn of 1879 . " I wrote My Partner in about four months . You know its success . Then I produced The Galley Slave , a drama written some time ago ; Fairfax followed at the Park in Boston . It proved another hit . Mr. Longfellow has just written me a letter in which he says : ' I have rarely been so entertained , and I see in it the promise of an American dramatic literature . ' " The great period of Campbell 's career which began in the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three successful plays already mentioned , he wrote during this time The White Slave , My Geraldine , Siberia , Separation , and Paquita . Not only did he write these plays , but he directed the production of all of them . He also organized and directed a number of road companies  --  there were at least six in 1884  --  which produced his plays throughout the country . From 1879 to 1885 Bartley Campbell was not only the most popular American dramatist , but he was regarded by most critics as one of the best . At least two of his plays , My Partner and The Galley Slave , were popular successes in Germany , and almost all of his later pieces , as well as some of the earlier ones , were presented in England , Australia , and Canada . On April 30 , 1885 , Campbell took over the lease of the Fourteenth Street Theatre , New York , renamed it Bartley Campbell 's Fourteenth Street Theatre , and produced in it Paquita , his last play . During this period of success Campbell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he attended himself , further strained an already overburdened mind . By the end of 1885 his mental condition began to cause worry , and in November of 1886 he was committed to the State Hospital for the Insane in Middletown , New York . He remained there until his death on July 30 , 1888 . A. M. Palmer and various other friends arranged and announced a funeral service in the Little Church Around the Corner , but because Campbell was a Roman Catholic , his family made other arrangements . The funeral was held in St. Paul 's Cathedral , Pittsburgh , and the body was buried in the adjoining St. Mary 's Cemetery . Shortly after Campbell 's death " Nym Crinkle " ( Andrew C. Wheeler ) wrote of him : " He never quite reached the level of literary greatness , but he overshot the level of generous impulse  --  if impulse can have a level . It would be a perfectly truthful epitaph to put on his grave : ' Killed by his own sensibilities . ' And if there is anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the victim of his own sensibilities . Bartley never wrote a play that the hard sense of the public did not have to correct some of his emotional effusiveness . He said to me once : ' If I could regulate my heart as I do my head , I 'd have no trouble with plays . But I fall in love with my heroine ; I want to redeem my villain ; I want to forgive my erring children . I 'd end everything in the traditional pot of grease , if I did n't watch myself continually . ' " The turn in Bartley 's intellectual career was coincident with the development in him of the spiritualistic mania . When he first gave attention to this thing , he was quite rational about it . I have seen him at Charley Foster 's sweating and plowing over the occultism of raps and pellets , but sensible and good humored . Long afterward I saw him when he was in daily communication with Aristophanes , and had Sappho herself behind his chair . I have a curious little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his best estate Bartley was apt to remind me of a literary Abe Lincoln . He had the same rough honesty ; the same uncouth humor ; the same rusticity and homeliness of method all in a smaller way . He was unschooled , untrained , undisciplined . He went into the fiercest of all arenas with an intellectual fight before him . " When he got in up to his ears , he began to have new views of the enormous horizon , and he took to books with a new haste . This sudden demand made upon a brain that is no longer elastic is always dangerous . It killed John McCullough . " One of our most eminent neurologists watched both these men , and predicted cerebral breakdown . No one knows about the stress of theatrical work who has not been through the ordeal . " I confess that I read of Bartley 's death with something like a feeling of satisfaction . It was freedom from the most dreadful of all imprisonments.

Following this information excerpts from reviews of the plays are quoted . Campbell was rather irregular in the matter of copyrighting his plays . Some were copyrighted before they were performed , some shortly after the first performance , some years later , and some not at all . In one case it is strongly suspected he entered for copyright a title for which no play ever existed . When a play was copyrighted , Campbell classified , or rather described , it in a word or two in the entry , and this description is used in the following list . When no such description by Campbell exists , the play is classified according to the terms most frequently used to advertise it . The date given as that of the first performance is , of course , merely that of the first performance the editor has located . While in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain that the date listed is actually that of the first performance , in a few cases it is also reasonably certain that the date given is not . No attempt has been made to list all of the casts and all of the performances of any play , but only such as indicate the spread , popularity , and life history of the play in this country and abroad . A great many , possibly too many , excerpts are quoted from reviews of Campbell 's plays . It is hoped , however , these reviews will show how Campbell 's contemporaries regarded his plays . When possible , reviews of first performances are given , and these are followed by reviews of New York , Chicago , and foreign performances .

" When Aiken gave it at Wood 's Theatre in Chicago during the week of May 22 , 1876 , he chose to be mysterious about its origin ; and not only did he suppress Campbell 's name , but he intimated that the play was written by some Chicago politician .

Campbell himself directed Bulls and Bears at Hooley 's Brooklyn Theatre , September 20-26 , 1875 , with a cast which included M. C. Daly and Minnie Doyle . The Hooley troupe have found their strong piece in Ultimo . It is a kind of high-pressure comedy , full of action and the most absurd vicissitudes . Bartley Campbell has apparently imbibed the atmosphere of this city to some purpose , as his adaptation is full of local bits and phrases of the street .

Clio . Romantic play in four acts . Copyrighted by Bartley Campbell , March 12 , 1878 . First produced at Haverly 's Theatre , Chicago , March 4 , 1878 , it ran until March 9 . I have been unable to find the cast for this first production of Clio , and only a few of the actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Rand played the model ; Amy Gordon , the " soubrette " ; Josephine Craig , " the countess " ; and the dancers were Mlle. Elise and Mlle. Gertie . " The Quaker City quartette , " " a dozen beautiful coryphes , " and " a group of finely formed females who represent statutes " were also mentioned . A week before the play opened an advertisement appeared in the Chicago newspapers calling for " 25 children , 100 ballet girls , and 50 supers " for the production . A much revised version of Clio , with music by G. Operti , was produced at Niblo 's Garden , New York , August 17 , 1885 , and ran until September 12 , with the following cast : Lucia Adele Belgarde Didi Marion Elmore Countess Ellice May Newman Duchess de Montmaitre Mrs. Charles Poole Fabian Frank Losee Pietro T. H. Burns Paulo Harry Rich Marquis Mattre Harold Fosburg Prince Zellah Harry Carter King of France Edgar Davenport Phillapaux Jay Hunt Sancho James Beckwith Alsozage F. W. Strong Spring Tommy Russell Dancer Mlle. Cornalba A road company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clio in Chicago at Hooley 's , March 14-27 , 1886 , and at the Academy of Music during the week of March 1 . In 1887 another road company , headed by Sybil Johnstone , gave Clio at the Academy of Music during the week of January 10 and at the People 's during the week of February 14 . Clio was presented at the Elephant and Castle Theatre , London , during the week of August 14 , 1885 . To epitomize the story in a paragraph : A sculptor named Fabian picks up a little girl in the streets of Rome , whom he finds begging for a witless father , and gives them both a shelter . When the girl ripens into womanhood she serves him for a model of Clio , which he hopes to bring to the notice of the Medici , and secure lasting fame thereby . Unconsciously the sculptor and his model have conceived an attachment for each other , which is interrupted by the machinations of an adopted daughter of a French Duchess , then resident in Italy , who offers him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go there . He refuses at first ; but the wicked woman convinces him , through an accomplice , that his model is a wanton , and so he casts her off , and declares for France and fame . In the next act Fabian has attained to his ambition . He has all the rewards of fame , but finds glory does not mean happiness . To add to his cup of bitterness , his model , who has been a sort of modern Penelope , appears at court as a woman of the world , scorning his work , and weaving her meshes around the King . Stung to frenzy he insults the court , and stigmatizes the King , and , but that the palace is almost immediately destroyed by an earthquake shock , would have worked his ruin . In the next act , his court experiences prove to have been only a dream , the guilty are brought to justice , the lovers united , and Clio proves to be the real countess instead of the wicked Ellice.  --  Chicago Tribune , March 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in view when he sat down to build his new drama , Clio , it was probably that of bringing poetic language into practical use as an elevator of the modern spectacular drama . Being an experienced and intelligent playwright , as well as something of a poet , he saw with sorrow that the tendency of the great mass of playgoers was in the direction of a foolish fondness for the cheap displays , produced by the scenic artist , that are known as spectacular effects ; for an exhibit of feminine legs with the aid of calcium lights ; for dancers , for acrobats , and for pose plastiques . A laudable wish was created , undoubtedly , by the contemplation of these things , to evolve harmony out of the mass of apparently discordant elements  --  to insinuate poetry into it , just as well-disposed persons will shove a religious tract into your hand as you are going into a beer-hall . ... Mr. Campbell 's genius ( for sonorous , glittering sentimentalisms ) has found free vent , and it would not be surprising to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression to be detected throughout the dialogue . ... The literary excellence of the production hardly plays a figure in such a case . ... The effort ... was an honest one , but we think the author has not succeeded in accomplishing his purpose .  --  Chicago Tribune , March 10 , 1878 . But Clio is positively the least meritorious thing which has emerged from this playwright 's workshop . It has neither coherency nor dramatic interests . Plotless , soulless and devoid of dramatic reason and common sense , the singular jumble of detached ideas and improbable incidents reasonably excited mirth when they did not create interest .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , August 22 , 1885 . It is a jumble , but it is a success , and it is not a jumble of tricks , like the coarse comedy play of the day  --  The Tin Soldier and things of that sort  --  but a jumble of situations and ideas really dramatic .

Sensational drama in five acts . This drama was written for Lester Wallack , but some trouble between him and the author led to Campbell 's producing it in Boston , at the Park Theatre , December 8-20 , 1879 , with the following cast : Edwin Fairfax Joseph E. Whiting Dr. Gaylord Joseph Wheelock James Marrigold W. F. Owen Webster Winne W. J. Ferguson Willie Wagstaff Alfred Selwyn Uncle Ben T. G. Riggs Moses W. Cullingham Sheriff Fred Bond Mrs. Marrigold Agnes Booth Diana Dorsie Sidney Cowell Mrs. Dorsie Mrs. G. H. Gilbert Tibbetts Marie Chester Virgie Little Belle Wharton Fairfax played at the Park Theatre in New York from December 29 , 1879 , until January 31 , 1880 , and at McVicker 's Theatre in Chicago May 3-8 , 1880 . In the New York performances Fred Robinson played Fairfax ; Louis F. Barrett , James Marrigold ; W. F. Owen , Uncle Ben ; and Effie Barrett , Virgie ; otherwise the cast was the same as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made , the main ones being in the rles of Fairfax , Dr. Gaylord , and Tibbetts , played by Edwin Knowles , Joseph Whiting , and Nellie Whiting , respectively . With an entirely new cast , Fairfax was given in Chicago May 2-8 , 1881 . While this would seem to indicate some popularity for the play , I find records of few performances after this date , nor does OdellFootnote : 1kb record many New York performances after the first engagement . His play Fairfax is not by any means so bad as might be expected from any previous acquaintance with the American drama . As a play of plot , mystery , and dnouement , Fairfax , it will be seen , is ingenious , but not of the finest or best possible structure ; as a literary production , it has about the same qualified claim to admiration . It has some thrilling bits of naturalism in the dialogue  --  oftenest in places where the movement of incident is rapid . The dialogue intended to represent great emotion , on the other hand , falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stilted rhetoric habitually employed by the heroes and heroines of the stories of the Waverly magazines . ... It is clear Mr. Campbell 's American drama is a thing to be considered ; an institution that promises much , either of weal or of woe , for American art .  --  Boston Evening Transcript , December 9 , 1879 . The action is strongly suggestive of Lady Audley 's Secret but with a wide difference . ... The chief merit of the piece , it seems to us , lies in the ingenious way in which the author has worked together so many apparently borrowed bits of dramatic composition into a story of much interest .  --  Boston Advertiser , December 8 , 1879 . There is little that is new in Mr. Campbell 's plot , the story having been told , with slight variations , in countless novels and plays . ... He invests the old-time tale with some freshness by clever handling of some of its details .  --  New York Herald , December 30 , 1879 . The reader will sufficiently perceive that it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , strain after startling situations through the medium of illogical mechanism , and that the wish " to see how it will turn out " is the sole motive any spectator can have for following its course . No attempt has been made to impress by the characters themselves , aside from what they suffer and ail . Mr. Bartley Campbell always means well . It is a splendid basis , this same sincerity of purpose , steadfast pluck and frank willingness to dash pell-mell into dramatic effort  --  on which to build up the structure of a mind that shall be ripe in the knowledge of the world , fresh in invention , and clear in its perception and strong in its exercise of the methods in which to use a fine and firm artistic faculty .  --  New York Tribune , December 30 , 1879 . Fairfax is in many respects the best piece of work Mr. Campbell has thus far offered us . In it he has departed from the methods employed in his other most successful dramas  --  The Galley Slave and My Partner  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliancy , strong dramatic interest and broad bold reaches of thought and poetic imagination . The author has given too much scope to this latter quality , and occasionally , by the introduction of an extravagant metaphor in a commonplace situation , an incongruous effect is the result . But this fault is perhaps pardonable , as the originality and beauty of many of the speeches show that the playwright possesses the unusual faculty of blending tints of graceful imagery with the deeper and more lurid hues of melodrama , without detracting from the effectiveness of either . The comedy element is especially praiseworthy . The dialogue contains a degree of finesse and sparkle that eclipses in this respect his previous efforts . There are numerous little subtleties and exquisite passages occurring frequently during the progress of the drama , that appeal to the appreciation of a refined and intelligent audience . ... Bartley Campbell was right when he said the other day to a Herald man that Fairfax is the best work he has thus far produced .  --  The New York Dramatic Mirror , January 3 , 1880 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a genuine success , though in some respects it is an absurd play . The scene is laid in what Mr. Campbell likes to call the " sunny South , " and very sunny it is to judge by the view of the " Fairfax " estate displayed in the first act . This estate is one of those fine old properties once so common in Florida , where Southern gentlemen of ancient family used to be found living before the war , surrounded by their loving slaves and lapped in luxury . At the head of this establishment is Mr. Fairfax himself , a widower in the prime of life and in love with Miss Clarke , who is really Mrs. Marrigold . In the prologue Mrs. Marrigold has very properly refused to surrender to her drunken husband ( who has reduced her and her dying child to extreme misery ) a bank note given her for her child 's benefit by the benevolent ( though in manner cynical ) Dr. Gaylord . In the struggle which ensues , her husband 's pistol goes off and kills him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it .

The situation is made worse by the reappearance of the tramp , who , for purposes of his own , denounces her as a murderess . In the end , of course , true love is triumphant , the tramp meets his deserts , and all ends happily .  --  Nation , January 8 , 1880 . Bartley Campbell has become the fashion , and everything he produces must , while his popularity lasts  --  and let us hope it last forever  --  be taken as at least worthy of consideration . ...

When Miss Le Clerq returned to England in 1876 , she kept Fate in her repertoire and for a number of years presented it at the principal theaters in the provinces . It was chosen for a special benefit given for Miss Le Clerq at the Olympic in London on August 6 , 1885 . In September of 1879 , Miss Agnes Herndon presented Fate in Brooklyn ( Odell , XI , p. 202 ) and in January 1880 gave it in Peoria , Ill. , under the title of A True Woman . During the week of August 20 , 1888 , Fate was revived at the Windsor Theatre , New York , by Rose Osborn and Russell Bassett , and by them taken on tour during the 1888-89 season . Other revivals of it occurred in Chicago , at the Hopkins Theatre in 1895 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A manuscript of a " revised version " of Fate is in the Morton Collection at the University of Chicago . The moving springs of Fate are jealousy and an intriguing woman , and over the incidents growing out of the union of these the baneful doctrine of free love casts a phosphorescent glow . There is a husband , who has come into the possession of boundless wealth ; a wife of devoted love ; an adventuress who comes like an evil angel between the happy pair ; and a half crazy person , husband to the adventuress , but kept out of the way until the dnouement , in order that her ambitious plans may not be thwarted . The subordinate parts are an old uncle of the hapless wife ; a returned showman ; a lady of free love tendencies and a few other characters of use as convenient padding . The action passes principally in Brooklyn , where the rich but unhappy couple reside . By her intrigues the adventuress brings about a separation between the husband and wife . He gives the divorced lady a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professes nothing more than a simple Platonic regard , the cottage in which they live , and an exceedingly handsome douceur . After a lapse of several years he loses his property and returns to his old home . His divorced wife comes to the same place at the same time , desirous of purchasing the old homestead where so many happy hours had been spent . By a series of events , the guilty woman is exposed by the energies of her misused husband and a happy result is arrived at . The troubles are numerous but the issue out of them more than repays for their bitterness .  --  Chicago Tribune , January 4 , 1873 . The piece has many pleasant qualities . The dialogue is sometimes inane and diluted to the thinness of tinfoil , but it sometimes sparkles with bright thoughts , and good , although not pregnant sayings .  --  Chicago Tribune , January 14 , 1873 . The dialogue of the play is always lively , generally containing the truthfulness of real life , with occasional passages of the serio-dramatic sort .  --  Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , one of that class of plays intended to bring out the virtues of a particular star , but still there can be no question that in both plot , dialogue and situation , it is much superior to the run of such plays . ... The plot into which these several persons are drawn is artistically woven , and while Mr. Campbell has not done his work perfectly , he has written a piece which pleases the audience and draws down rounds of applause at each moment . There is much also that is comic without being burlesque .  --  New York Herald , June 2 , 1874 . It is a play of slender merit  --  whether on the score of invention or that of intellectual treatment of character , emotion , and significance of thought  --  but it is commended by the domestic sentiment and by the interest of the domestic story .  --  New York Tribune , June 8 , 1874 .

Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in My Geraldine , reworked his earlier On the Rhine ( q.v. ) , adapting the part of Carrol Moore to Scanlan 's special abilities . The first performance of Friend and Foe , of which I have any record , occurred at the Academy of Music in Chicago on September 25 , 1882 . Scanlan later played it at the Windsor Theatre in New York during the week of October 16 , 1882 , and he kept it in his repertoire during the seasons of 1883 , 1884 , and 1885 . The cast in Chicago and in New York in 1882 was as follows : Carrol Moore W. J. Scanlan Quintin La Font R. C. White Ambrose C. B. Hawkins Pierre Fontaine G. R. Mc Cann Captain Rolfman P.

Mr. Campbell was impressed by his neat and genteel style , and he conceived the idea of writing for him a play in which the Irishman should be seen without the traditional red-coats and wicked landlords , so Friend and Foe was the result of his labors . It is a play in five acts , picturing an intelligent Irishman in France at the time of the Franco-Prussian war . He is in the family of a music-loving Frenchman , who loves him like a son , and the Irish hero falls in love with the daughter of his French benefactor . An unscrupulous French landowner desires the love of the girl and threatens to turn the family out of the house . Just at that time war is declared and the villain is conscripted . He offers 15,000 francs for a substitute , and , to save the family , the Irish hero accepts it and goes to the front . He is arrested by the Germans as a spy and sentenced to be shot , but his French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ends well with the prospective wedding of the two . The dialogue is very pretty , and in Mr. Campbell 's best vein , appealing to the lower part of the house as well as the gallery . The situations are strong at the end of each act , and the play is received nightly with laughter and applause . Mr. Scanlan as Carrol Moore is in his element . He is graceful and handsome , and introduces a number of original songs which are highly appreciated . The company supporting is a good one .  --  Chicago Tribune , September 27 , 1882 . The piece played through the country , but this is the first performance in New York . It is " a great go on the bowery. "  --  New York Herald , October 12 , 1882 .

The Galley Slave . Drama in five acts . Copyrighted by Bartley Campbell , September 4 , 1880 . This play was produced at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , September 29 , 1879 , with the following cast ( in part ) : Francesca Remini Emily Rigl Cicely Blaine Katherine Rogers Sidney Norcott James M. Hardie Psyche Dora Goldthwaite Mrs. Phoebe Gay Mrs. J. J. Prior Oliphant George H. Griffith Franklin Fitts Charles Stanley Nichette Alice Mansfield Other members of the cast were Henry Lee , Frank B. Wilson , George Hoey , and Mr. Bartram . The Galley Slave was first given in New York , December 1 , 1879 , at Haverly 's Theatre with the following cast : Cicely Blaine Maude Granger Psyche Estelle Mortimer Sidney Norcott Frank Evans Nichette Charlotte Neville Carot Charles Webster Franklin Fitts T.

A second company continued the play at Niblo 's until February 14 . The first New York company presented The Galley Slave at Haverly 's in Chicago , January 25-February 1 and March 25-28 , 1880 . The play had several years of great popularity in the major theaters , and in the minor theaters it retained its drawing power until the end of the century . The last production of which I have record was at the Thirty-First Street Theatre , Chicago , in 1903 . The Galley Slave was first given in England at the Theatre Royal in Hull during the week of November 22 , 1880 . Following these performances , a company organized by Wilson Barrett toured the provincial theaters of the British Isles , playing it under the title of No Escape ; or , The Galley Slave . It was never performed in London . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney Norcott was played by T. Bolton , Cicely Blaine by Maud Brennan , Francesca by Agnes Templeton , and Baron Le Bois by Dennis Coyne . The Galley Slave was translated into German by Dr. Carlotta under the title Der Galeerensklaven . Gettke 's Buhnen-Almanach ( 1883 , 1884 ) records the following performances : Berlin at the Wilhelm Theatre during the week of April 30 , 1882 , Hamburg during the week of April 22 , 1883 , and St. Gallen during the week of December 2 , 1883 . A motion picture version of The Galley Slave , in which Theda Bara was the star , was made about 1910 . The Galley Slave is a play whose merits are somewhat above the average of those with which Bartley Campbell favored us before he made his hit with My Partner , but has some of the bad as well as most of the good qualities of his work . The theme is well chosen ; the story is interesting , the development of the plot is consecutive . ... On the other hand , there is a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frequently sloppy and now and then positively indelicate , and the redundancy of passages explanatory of the most obvious situations is at times very tedious . Luckily these flaws are not so much a part of the texture of the play that they can not be eradicated by a diligent and unsparing use of a blue pencil and a pair of scissors in competent hands . ... Mr. Campbell should begin by modifying the closing scene of the first act , in which a charge is made that were better suggested , and by cutting the coarse passage in the dialogue between the serving people in their courting scene .  --  Philadelphia Times , September 30 , 1879 . Of Bartley Campbell 's The Galley Slave we can say without hesitation that it is one of the best , if not the very best , of plays ever written by an American . ... It would of course be possible to pick flaws in the work , but mere fault finding is not criticism and as the author has closely followed all the recognized laws of dramatic construction and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why he should not be accorded in print all the praise which he last evening received from an immense throng of delighted auditors . True , he occasionally defies probability , now and then strains a point for stage effect , and not unfrequently permits the lines of his comedy scenes to sink into double entendres , but he never exceeds the hounds of possibility , never resorts to old-time claptrap , and never allows his humor to become actually vulgar . In a work of such merit the double entendres could well be spared , and should be expunged , but their presence , while demanding notice , can not be regarded as offensive , for all are witty , none particularly obtrusive . The very worst that could be said of the drama would be that it has the poorest name that a good play was ever burdened with . ... From the opening lines to the final consummation , The Galley Slave bears every evidence of being the work of an experienced dramatist and nothing could exceed the cleverness with which the pathos and humor are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined and individually interesting , while the language , though never unnatural , often attains a high plane of rhetorical beauty . ...  --  Philadelphia Press , September 30 , 1879 . It contains materials that should make any play succeed , but the author has not used all of them to the best advantage . There is too much talk that amounts to nothing , and the opportunities to explain the misunderstanding upon which the whole plot hangs are so numerous that the audience can hardly help wondering that the dnoument escaped the second or third acts .  --  New York Herald , December 2 , 1879 .

The following quotation , attributed to the Birmingham Gazette , appeared on the Edinburgh playbill for May 30 , 1881 . The play is one of the best combinations of comedy and drama that has been seen on the stage in years , the comedy element in the first two acts predominating almost to the exclusion of the other , while the drama , although strong and powerful , is distinctly of a modern school and bears very little resemblance , beyond containing powerful situations and somewhat sensational incidents , to the flesh-creeping monstrosities with which we used to be regaled some years ago .

" Whether Williamson actually bought the play and , if he did , whether he played in it , I do not know . The only performances of it I have found were those at the Grand Theatre , Chicago , February 7-13 , 1881 , where George Knight played the lead . Inasmuch , however , as the Chicago reviews indicate that Knight was successful in the play , it seems unlikely these performances were the only ones he gave . The story hinges upon the loss and ultimate discovery of 2000 dollars worth of government bonds . Leopold Lander , an ex-revolutionist of 1848 , is the central figure . Lander is engaged in a bank .

This , in brief , is the plot of the play , out of which naturally grow a number of incidents of more or less interest .  --  Chicago Tribune , February 8 , 1881 . The play is short , concise and to the point .

The play abounds in catchy humor , the first act especially creating great merriment .  --  Chicago Times , February 8 , 1881 .

Curley Priest Mr. Chamberlain Guard Mr. Winters Clerk Mr. Chamberlain Mrs. O'Reilly Mrs. Keases Maggie Murphy Miss Frankie Easton This play has usually been referred to as Gran Uale , but in the Chicago performances the name always appeared as Grana Uaile . The name refers to a celebrated Irish rebel heroine of the time of Queen Elizabeth , but the play 's only connection with this person is that its heroine is imprisoned in the ruined tower of her castle . Actually , of course , the Irish name was used because of the popularity of Boucicault 's romantic Irish dramas , Arrah-na-Pogue , The Colleen Bawn , and The Shaughraun . These plays , titles and all , were much imitated in the 1870 's and ' 80 's by American dramatists . Fred Marsden 's Kerry Gow and Shawn Rhue , played by Joseph Murphy for many years , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success , Con Murphy , who played its lead , evidently saw that it had some possibilities . In 1884 he copyrighted under his own name a piece called The Ivy Leaf in which he acted for many years . This play , as I discovered by a chance reading of a manuscript copy of it , followed exactly the outline of Grana Uaile . In answer to my queries about this , Mr. Robert Campbell wrote : " After The Ivy Leaf had been played for several years , M. C. Daly , a prominent actor , went to see The Ivy Leaf at Niblo 's Garden , New York , and reported to Mr. A. M. Palmer , who was Trustee of Bartley Campbell 's estate , in 1887 , that The Ivy Leaf was nothing at all except Bartley Campbell 's Irish play , Grana Uaile . ... A substantial financial settlement would indicate that the claim was well founded . " When Campbell went to Brooklyn with Hooley , he produced Grana Uaile at Hooley 's Brooklyn Theatre , October 23-27 , 1875 , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Chicago Times attacked Grana Uaile rather savagely . The Tribune said it was nothing but a bad combination of The Colleen Bawn and Arrah-na-Pogue with bits of The Shaughraun thrown in for good measure . It noted the likeness of Mike Mullen to Danny Mann , of Conner Kennedy to Kyrl Daly , of Ryman O'Reilly to Shawn the Post and Myles-na-Coppaleen , and noticed how much the tower-climbing scene was like a scene in The Shaughraun . Of the language of the play , the Tribune wrote , " Mr. Campbell has discovered an Irish vocabulary which , if he continues to use it in future productions , will damn him to everlasting ridicule . " The Times said , " Whoever accords to this rising young dramatist the credit of writing an original play on the strength of Grana Uaile will extend to him a poetic license at which even Boucicault would not cavil , and which would send Charles Reade mad . " The Chicago Inter-Ocean , however , liked the play and said of it , " in plot , construction , in nearly everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boucicault 's Irish dramas . " The scene is laid on the northwest coast of Ireland ; Conner Kennedy , the heir of Tullyrush , arrives home from France , where he has spent the last four years of his minority , his estate having meanwhile been managed by a land steward called Dan Kelley . Prior to Conner 's going abroad , he has conceived a passion for Mary Clare , the niece of a pedantic pedagogue , who is likewise beloved by Kelley , and , the latter finding his suit spurned , casts about him for some means to outwit his rival . A certain unpleasant character named Ann Murray , who is the foster sister of the young magistrate and deeply in love with him , joins hands with Kelley and between them they hatch up a conspiracy to ruin the reputation of the interesting heroine . By means of a forgery Mary is brought to a lonely spot on the cliffs on the expectation of meeting Conner . She is however confronted by Kelley , who urges his suit with every art he is capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deaf ear . At this point Kelley , looking up , sees Conner , who has been sent there by Ann , standing on a ledge of rocks in the moonlight , and the sudden thought of destroying the girl 's character comes to him . At once his pleadings give way to reproaches , and the declaration that he could never marry a girl who could under any circumstances sully her honor . Not understanding the import of words that are to her incomprehensible Mary attempts to force an explanation but is frustrated by Kelley bidding her a hasty adieu and rushing off . Then follows the meeting of the lovers . Conner , believing Mary is guilty , addresses her in language excessively bitter , and , at length , covering her with reproaches , leaves her . Desperate now , the girl 's first thought is suicide but she is saved by the return of Kelley who , finding all argument useless , makes a prisoner of her , taking her to an old ruin where he places her under the care of a villain named Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliffs . Finding that she has disappeared leaving her shawl on the edge of the precipice , he comes to the conclusion that she has leaped in the sea , and breaks out into self-reproach and self-accusations which finally lead to his arrest for her murder . At the trial , Mullen , at the insistence of Kelley , swears he saw the squire throw Mary into the sea , and this leads to his conviction . At this juncture Ryman O'Reilly , a ballad singer , one of that numerous class in Ireland , having faith in the innocence of the accused , finds Mary Clare 's place of concealment , and with much strategy succeeds in saving the life of Conner , and reuniting the lovers . Indeed throughout the play , which is in five acts , Ryman is the good angel , turning up very opportunely on almost every occasion .  --  Chicago Tribune , February 14 , 1875 . Hearts .

It is Agnes ' bridal eve , and Fernleigh is busy with preparations for the coming nuptials .

The latter is deeply in love with Fanny , but being a bashful fellow had not the courage to face her raillery . After a clever scene between Gregory , an amateur detective , and Madge , a housemaid , Dr. Thorne seizes upon the opportunity of finding Agnes alone to inform her of his passion for her lovely cousin . While he is doing so , George enters , and overhearing his avowal , believes the passionate words intended for Agnes , whereupon he steps between Agnes and Thorne and the curtain descends upon a strong picture .

Agnes frankly tells him of her husband 's suspicions and he , seeing the trouble he has unwittingly caused , consents to withdraw . Ere doing so he kisses the hand of Agnes in token of friendship merely and as he does so George Gartney appears at the window bathed in the white moonlight . Agnes screams in terror and calls on her husband to come in . He refuses and rushes madly by . The scream arouses the household , who rush in demanding the cause of the outcry . Agnes laughs , says she was frightened at a ghost and sits down in a tremor of terror which is deftly concealed from those about .

Of course Agnes believes her husband guilty and when he comes in , which he does almost immediately , she in a whisper charges him with the crime , and the curtain descends on a powerful situation . The third act is exceedingly dramatic , giving Agnes splendid opportunities for powerful acting . It is the night of the murder ; Agnes attired in her robe-de-chambre , awaits her husband 's coming . When at last he does arrive , a stormy scene ensues . Agnes demands his immediate flight to save himself from arrest , but he , protesting his innocence , at first declines to go , but finally consents . A parting scene , very tender and touching between husband , wife and child , follows and just as Gartney disappears Fanny enters . She , too , has suspected George , and moved by a tender memory of the dead doctor , declares her intention of having him immediately apprehended . The wife seizes her frantically and begs , entreats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily , the daughter of Agnes , rushes into the apartment . The mother catching her up exclaims , " For her sake !

And Fanny , who by this time has learned to love Phil Kirby , is nursing her tenderly back to reason . After some clever maneuvering on the part of George , the real murderer is discovered in a common tramp , and the dnouement , of course , is a happy one .  --  Chicago Tribune , October 21 , 1873 .

As a bit of curious information in connection with the production of Miss Effie Ellsler 's new play , A Heroine in Rags , is the following account of the conception of its plot in the mind of its author . Having long since recognized Miss Ellsler 's ability , the author of Fate , Peril , and The Virginian proposed writing her a play which would give her not only an opportunity to act but also to make use of her magnificent vocal power . " It was no easy matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Miss Ellsler could be piquant , playful , tender and tragic and withal , preserve an individuality throughout . For two years I racked my brain for the needed plot but nothing answering the want was forthcoming . Once I thought I had mastered the situation and , full of enthusiasm , sat down to write it out , but before the second act had been finished I realized that it was not what I wanted at all and so , in despair , I set the work aside . Six months ago , while walking along Fleet Street in the city of London , my eye fell upon a picture of a street singer in a shop window . The face was eloquent with feeling and the artist had wrought in the depths of the human eyes the shadow of a deep sorrow . My attention was at once arrested and I began at once to weave about her an imaginary story . The bustle and noise of Fleet Street is not conducive to mental exertion and I determined on reaching some quiet spot , where I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of old St. Paul 's , I entered . The afternoon service was just beginning and the choral service was being chanted , as I turned up the well worn stone stairs to the right , that led to the great dome . Fainter and fainter the strains of the sacred song came to my ear , until finally nothing but the hush of the huge pile and the warm rays of the sinking September sun filled the vaulted corridors ; up , up , up , until the whispering gallery was reached and the worshipers among the monumental piles in the aisle below looked like black blotches in the stone flooring . Here , over two hundred feet from the ground , in that wonderful circle Christopher Wren has hung in the sky like a liberty cap on the head of London , the first faint outline of A Heroine in Rags was sketched on the back of an old envelope . " That same night , at a table in the Savage Club , under the picture of an old Cleveland reporter  --  Artemus Ward  --  the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material out of which her genius will create a character entirely new to our stage .  --  Cleveland Plain Dealer , March 27 , 1877 . Being curious to know the opinion of Mr. Bartley Campbell on the interpretation of the character of " Jeanette " in the new play , A Heroine in Rags , a Plain Dealer reporter called on him at his rooms in the Weddell house yesterday afternoon . We will not tell how we found him ; that is no one 's business and it shall ever remain a secret . He was not robed in a soft merino gown , however , and his eye was not a frenzy forming , and he  --  well , there was a skeleton lying before him on the table . At least he called it a skeleton and said he had been working hard , trying to get it to hang together . " You see , " he said , pushing the loose pile of papers from him , " the skeleton is the hardest thing to arrange . Once the skeleton is built , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly catching his meaning we asked him to leave the region of anatomy and invade that of fact , realizing , however , how hard a task we were setting before a man who had a newspaper training . Facts are ugly obstacles to the average editorial mind  --  they are puzzling and depressing . " Well , I call my plots skeletons and the dialogue the flesh . " We heaved a sigh of relief . " It is a coinage of my own but to me it is full of meaning and very appropriate . If the skeleton is imperfect no flesh tint can make the being fair . Therefore my plots are of the first importance . Once I have action perfected I feel the hardest part of my task has been attained . Remember , there is no one who has a keener appreciation of the value of good dialogue : only that I attach more importance to the fabric  --  the warp and woof , as it were  --  than to the conceits and pretty fancies that may be embroidered thereon . " He was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the minute and we felt the importance of putting a stop to him and coming to the object of our visit at once and so broke in with : " What do you think of A Heroine in Rags . " His face lit up ; his eye beamed . " I think it an excellent acting play ! " he exclaimed : " in fact , very much better than anything I have hitherto done and since I have seen it played I am enthusiastic on the question of its merit . " " Then you think it well played ? " " Capitally ! Indeed there are few companies outside of those organized for comedy who , on the whole , could give it a better illustration . Several of the parts are in excellent hands and  --  " He was getting up steam again and distancing an excellent Eagle with a rapidity that filled us with alarm . " But Miss Ellsler  --  what do you think of Effie 's performance of ' Jeanette ' ? " Again there was a glow in his eye and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen all the good actresses that are now on the English speaking stage including Marie Wilton , of the Prince of Wales theatre , London , the Terry girls , of the Court and Haymarket as well as Mrs. John Wood , of the St. James , and , of course , all our American women , but there is not one among them who combines the excellencies Miss Ellsler displays in A Heroine in Rags . " " What are these ? " " Piquancy , playfulness , pathos and tenderness , backed up and supplemented by a voice of remarkable vocal expression and power of execution . Indeed I do n't know of anyone else who can sing ' Arline ' in Balfe 's ' Bohemian Girl , ' to the satisfaction of a critical audience , play ' Rosalind ' and ' Juliet ' splendidly and win the public 's plaudits in ' Fanchon '  --  do you ? " He had now reached one hundred and fifty-eight words a minute , and we could only give our head a negative shake . " As for ' Jeanette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absolutely faultless . There is one chief charm about her comedy in the first and second acts , and that is not veneer of the actress , but rather the outflowing of the sunshine of the girl 's inner consciousness , and her laugh has a bubbling , rippling music , altogether indescribable . It is in fact suggestive of the music of a mountain brook , only a good deal more so . " " You seem to think her first acts the best ? " we mildly ventured . " They would be if her pathos was not so genuine ; but , as you can see by the tears on the cheeks of her audience , it goes right home to the heart . " " Then you think you have fitted her ? " " She has a fit in which there is a fortune for her . ' Jeanette ' is ' Ophelia , ' ' Fanchon ' and ' Louise ' in the Two Orphans all rolled into one , with an opportunity to sing which gives it a musical flavor . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that she might  --  " " No ; I think not . She could not improve the part and any change could not fail to mar the symmetry of her " ( one hundred and eighty-nine words a minute ; we struggled manfully to catch every word ) " performance in its entirety  --  the perfection of detail  --  general excellence  --  " It was no use . We gave it up and escaped out into the open air and paused for breath .  --  Cleveland Plain Dealer , April 2 , 1877 . Her Miss Ellsler 's simulated madness in order to save her lover , entitles her to respect as a heroine , and affords an opportunity for some pretty performances of a character known in technical phrase as " the soubrette " kind . She has a hard task of breathing the breath of life into a play , the incidents in which would hardly interest anyone who does not intend to go and see it . Some of these incidents might strike one as being amusing , but the most amusing things are unfortunately those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very clearly told and when it is told one is compelled to admit there was not much to tell . Miss Ellsler plays the part of a pretty flower girl  --  who seems to have extraordinary privileges , such as breaking into courts of justice and singing songs  --  and she presents the character so prettily as to make us forgive and forget some of the surroundings of her situation . The play is copiously supplied with the usual amount of stock sentiments , such as are supposed to " bring down the house " and they did not fail to carry out their purpose last evening .  --  Chicago Tribune , December 10 , 1878 . How Women Love ; or , The Heart of the Sierras . Sensational drama in five acts . This play was produced at the Arch Street Theatre , Philadelphia , May 21-26 , 1877 ; at the New Chicago Theatre , Chicago , October 15-27 , 29-31 , and November 16-17 , 1877 , by the " Bartley Campbell Company .

" A later version of this play was called The Vigilantes ( q.v . ) . A partial listing of the cast in Philadelphia in 1877 : Claire Le Moyne Geraldine May Reuben Craig Joseph Wheelock Joe Comstock W. H. Leake Brady Harold Forsberg The cast for the performances in Chicago in 1877 was as follows : Claire Le Moyne Rosa Rand Mabel Morgan Estelle Mortimer Roxy Craig Josie Batchelder Mrs. Lyon Louisa Morse Letitia Lamb Louisa Almeda Reuben Craig J. W. Norris Joe Comstock W. H. Leake General Lyon Willie Maurice Brady Harold Forsberg George Silsby L. R. Willard Silas Craig H. C. Story Jim Kenton W. F. Wallis Major Green N. B. Honey John Latimer H. Wilson It is a very poor affair , so poor as to be beneath serious criticism . It is surprising to us that Mr. Campbell should have put his name to so pitiful a production . Of plot or dramatic construction there is no vestige . Throughout the piece the characters wander on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come like shadows , so depart , and nobody cares a straw for their movements . ... As for the incidents , they are fearfully and wonderfully compounded . It is as though the author , having surfeited himself with some of Bret Harte 's latest effusions , say with Gabriel Conroy , had fallen asleep and been visited by a nightmare , and that upon awaking , he had written out his dream and had then divided it promiscuously into acts and scenes . As a general thing the acting was about on a par with the authorship .  --  Philadelphia Inquirer , May 22 , 1877 . In the present effort the dramatist has not been so successful as in his former plays . ... The dramatist has slighted , to a certain extent , his own ideas and has paid more attention to those of other authors . ... It is also poorly constructed ; the various situations and climaxes being worked up in a very clumsy manner , while the first two acts have nothing to do in reality with the piece , and are too tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not rise above mediocrity but in this act there is a splendidly effective piece of dramatic writing which calls forth the warmest praise . ... The dialogue is rather wordy , but is remarkably well written  --  bright gems of thought every now and then sparkling forth and falling very pleasantly upon the ear . ... Miss Geraldine May , the clever young actress , essayed the rle of the heroine  --  a beautiful creation  --  and played it with girlish tenderness , rare grace , and an earnestness which was truly impressive .  --  Philadelphia Evening Bulletin , May 22 , 1877 . There is much that is natural and forcible in theatrical effect , with occasional lapses into what will be generally condemned as weak and purposeless . As a whole the story is full of action , and the personages introduced clearly drawn , some of them being a real addition to the current stage characterization . Yet , in order to get at a climax the author permits himself to drop into certain wild vagaries and adopt in at least one incident some attenuated trick which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weekly Romance . The drama relates how Reuben Craig ( Mr. Norris ) loved Mabel Morgan ( Estelle Mortimer ) , a pretty but thoughtless girl of fashion , who was incapable of any abiding love for anyone . They get married , and soon begin to appreciate that they have made a mistake . Meanwhile Claire Le Moyne ( Rosa Rand ) , an orphan , and a pure-hearted , high-minded , self-sacrificing creature , has become secretly enamoured of Reuben , who fails to see it in that light , much to the distress of Claire . The latter at the same time has won the undying love of an honest miner , Joe Comstock ( W. H. Leake ) , who is ready to make all sorts of sacrifices for her sake . A highly-effective scene occurs between these two in the second act , where Joe blurts out his long-pent-up passion for the girl , and she tells him that she can not return his love . There are some bickerings between the married pair , and the insidious foe of domestic peace makes his appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reuben goes off one day to escort Claire on some pious mission and Mabel listens to the insinuations of Silsby and elopes with him . The husband comes back and finds himself abandoned and disgraced . He goes to the dogs , and in the fourth act we find him in prison , condemned to death for having shot Silsby . Through the efforts of the brave Claire , however , he is saved , and eventually united to her , after the knowledge that the faithless Mabel is dead . Joe is sacrificed , of course , to the desires of the two selfish lovers , and a faint compensation is dealt out in marrying him off at the end to Roxy Craig ( Josie Batchelder ) , one of your rough diamonds , who plays a conspicuous part in the early scenes of the play . The weak point in the plot is the cause assigned for the elopement , which is not made very clear nor very strong . The same incident is better defined in the play of East Lynne . Here , one can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple incident on which the catastrophe hinges could be so easily explained to all parties interested . The prison scene may be historical , but it certainly looks like an exaggeration , almost a burlesque . ...  --  Chicago Tribune , Oct. 16 , 1877 . Kidnapped . See The Orphans . Little Sunshine . " Soubrette drama . " This play , a dramatization of a novel which had appeared in the New York Weekly , was written expressly for Mrs. Ettie Henderson , who paid $1600 for it . Published ( Lacy , vol. 110 or French Acting Drama , no. 1461 ) without the author 's permission , it was , until the appearance of the present volume , the only one of Campbell 's dramatic works available in print with the exception of the allegory America . The first performance of which I have found record was at the Bowery Theatre , New York , September 22-27 , 1873 .

It would appear almost as though Miss Ettie Henderson had appealed to Bartley Campbell and asked him for a play as one would go into a drug store and ask for a box of pills , and received an answer like this from the great writer of Society pieces : " Sorry I have n't any made up . What kind do you want ? Oh , yes ; I 'll have it ready for you in a few minutes if you 'll be kind enough to sit down . " And the lady , not being in any particular hurry , sits down . " Nice day , " says Mr. Campbell . " Very nice , indeed , " remarks the lady . " Not so gloomy as usual , " says Mr. Campbell , slicing a scene from " Caste " and four or five situations from other plays in pigeonholes round his dramatic pill-shop . ... " Want something pretty strong , I suppose , " puts in Bartley , with the manuscript of another ancient Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a trifle to move an audience , " she replies , and the scissors run through three more papers . " I 'd like a goodly part , of course , for the sympathizers , " puts in the lady . " Certainly , " says Campbell , with a pleasant smile ; " I have a heavy stock of that on hand , " and he scribbles down a few stock platitudes . " I wo n't keep you much longer , " he adds , shaking up and piecing the scraps . " Here you are , ' Little Sunshine , ' " says he , labelling the mixture " By Bartley Campbell "  --  " thank you , yes ; seeing it 's you , I wo n't charge much for it . Good day . Call again .

" Mr. Robert Campbell , in substantial agreement , says the piece was " a capital and labor play , dealing with the Pittsburgh riots in 1877 . " He , however , locates the production in Pittsburgh . Unfortunately , a careful search of the Pittsburgh and the Philadelphia newspapers for 1877 and 1878 fails to reveal any reference to The Lower Million . Matrimony . American comedy .

" And , as the program for this production reads , " First production in Brooklyn of Bartley Campbell 's Highly Successful and Brilliantly Humorous Comedy , " the play may well have been tried out elsewhere before coming to Brooklyn . Miss Dickinson has tried this species of playwriting and failed . This has not deterred die undaunted Mr. Campbell from having his little fling at it , too . We hope he 's satisfied that it ca n't be done  --  at least by him . The best use he can make of Matrimony is to sell it for gun-wadding or food for the Central Park goats . Mr. Campbell 's success in turning out two such plays as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly won for him reputation as a rising American dramatist  --  should not lead him into the error of giving stage room to his earlier productions , which are crude , rough-edged , and wholly unfit for practical performance , and which require an apologetic note of explanation on the bills . They can only put down and destroy the good foundation he has made on which to build future works of credit . He is now at work on the concluding act of an Irish drama entitled Geraldine , which will be put on at the Standard as soon as it can be got ready , and which , it is said , will rival in merit his two best known plays .

Strong Letty Livingston Rosa Rand Maude Marble Estelle Mortimer Diana Delmay Josie Batchelder Mrs. Kenton Mrs. Morse Tabby Louisa Almeda Shop Girl Ann Browning My Foolish Wife is at the most an amusing trifle . Its construction has evidently been based upon the doubtful maxim that the end justifies the means . The author has said to himself " Go to ; let us write something amusing ; let us raise a laugh ; honestly , if we can , dishonestly , if we must , but raise a laugh anyhow , " and in the undertaking he has achieved a partial success . If he had only held fast to this original design the effect would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodramas he has perpetrated crowded upon him , and like Uncle Dick with the head of Charles the First , he could not keep them out . They crept into his " farcical comedy " and made of it a composite affair , neither one thing nor the other . ... The maudlin sentimentality , the forced situations , the pitiful attempts at pathos which the author thrust into the third act , they the audience could not away with , and after having once bidden fair to make a hit , the piece fell flat . My Foolish Wife has absolutely no plot . It is a bundle of incidents without connection or logical sequence . The " foolish wife " is a stage-struck woman and her eccentricity is the only motif the play has . Dramatic interest  --  there is none , while the probabilities are flagrantly violated throughout . In a piece having no pretensions to art , all that might have been pardoned had its burlesque qualities made compensation , but they did not .

My Foolish Wife is styled a farcical comedy , but is an almost unadulterated farce . The motive of the work seems to be that everybody shall be at cross purposes with everybody else , and this end is cleverly compassed by making the heroine a stage-struck young woman , who gives up most of her time to surreptitious rehearsals  --  surreptitious because her husband will not permit her to go upon the stage . Naturally these performances lead to endless confusion , continually being regarded by one or another of the characters as the deadliest earnest and fraught with the most horrible consequences . ... Things are in a good deal of a whirl pretty much all the time ; and this fact combined with the confusing effect of the rehearsals , tends to make the play  --  especially in the second act  --  rather incoherent . ... ... It does not profess to have any aim higher than to raise a laugh , and this it most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance with higher canons of dramatic art would be equivalent to hunting butterflies with a shotgun . The author really has shown a great deal of ingenuity in contriving comical situations , and in the majority of cases has shown a very considerable amount of originality . ...  --  Philadelphia Evening Bulletin , October 16 , 1877 . Pink Domino and My Foolish Wife may be classed together as extravaganzas of the rough and ready order which are enjoying their day upon the stage . They are situation plays which might be described as " four door " farces . The recipe for the construction of these pieces is a very simple one . Take a room with four doors leading into so many bedrooms , bring in two young married couples , the males bent on mischief , females suspicious , mix the couples and put them into the wrong rooms , then introduce a jocose old party , an innocent young man ; get a hired girl in disguise and an eccentric old lady , tumble them all around the stage , overset the furniture , smash a kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pass current . Mr. Campbell has introduced into his play a man whose principal business it is to get in a situation where he can be sat down upon , or pounded with dumbbells , or kicked in the stomach or smashed on the head . There is always someone coming in whose presence involves the necessity of this man concealing himself . Sometimes he gets under the seat of the parlor lounge , and immediately someone comes in and throws a heavy pair of dumbbells on him . Of course , he yells , and sticks his head out in view of the audience , but nobody on the stage notices him . Then he is put in a sandbag and suspended from the ceiling and two young men come in and thump him with their fists . These are specimen situations , and it must be said that while they do provoke laughter at the moment , they reflect small credit on the ingenuity of the author . ...

In 1882 during the week of April 10 the play was given at the Academy of Music with Emily Rigl playing Mary Carroll ; in 1884 , May 11-16 , a revised version called Ardendale ( q.v. ) , with the part of Teddy Cregan enlarged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard Theatre .

The " New York Company " with Marie Brainard and I. O'Hara presented the play in Chicago during the week of June 25 , 1888 , at the Waverly , and during the week of February 3 , 1889 , at the Baker Theatre . The New York Herald thought the story " strong but somewhat familiar " and that it was " told too slowly through three acts , but moved rapidly and powerfully in the two acts which followed . " The New York Tribune considered the play but another imitation of Boucicault and said , " It is called Irish because the scene is laid in Ireland and for no other reason . " The piece is unlike the bulk of Irish plays . Its motive is not the enmity of the Hibernian race for their British oppressors ; it has no smugglers , red-coated soldiers , constabulary or conspirators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many respects Mr. Campbell 's play is worthy of commendation ; in many others it deserves severe criticism . The story is interesting though improbable ; the language is less didactic than that to which this particular author has accustomed us . On the other hand the story is tedious and the story is spread out . The scene in the ruined abbey , in which Geraldine goes into hysterics over some imaginary rats , might very properly be curtailed . Many of the incidents are too lurid to coincide with the intense interest of the quiet portions of the play . These rugged faults may assume the guise of virtues to the gallery , but they form no bid to the favor of the downstairs people .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , December 25 , 1880 . Mr. Bartley Campbell 's new Irish drama , My Geraldine , has now been played for some weeks at the Standard Theatre by a strong company , attracting large and appreciative audiences . The play has a skillfully constructed plot , and contains several very strong situations .

Footnote : 1kb My Partner is now being played in Australia ; Fairfax has been running in San Francisco ; Van , the Virginian is being played in the Southern States . The English and Australian press speak in the highest terms of Mr. Campbell 's ability , one of them saying : " For the first time in the history of Australia an American play has delighted a refined and cultivated audience . " The success that the subject of our sketch has achieved is chiefly due to his ability to develop strong situations , and to mingle with his story broad humor and powerful pathos .  --  New York Graphic , January 12 , 1881 .

The story is one of strong romantic interest , and , although there can be found throughout the same faults  --  though not so strongly marked here  --  which the critics have found in his other works , excepting My Partner , the public , we dare say , overlooks those technical blemishes , and only sympathizes with the sorrows of its principal characters , and finds mirth in its excellent comedy .  --  Chicago Tribune , February 6 , 1881 .

Shortly after the opening performance Campbell sold the rights of My Partner to Aldrich for the sum of ten dollars a performance  --  a fact Campbell bitterly regretted later . Aldrich then sold a small interest in the play to Parsloe , and from 1880 to 1884 Aldrich and Parsloe played in My Partner throughout the country . In 1884 the partnership was dissolved and Parsloe sold his interest back to Aldrich . After trying another play in which he failed , Aldrich returned to My Partner , playing in it until 1887 with various people in Parsloe 's old part . After 1887 Aldrich leased the rights to other actors , and the play was frequently given until the end of the century . The last professional performance of which I have any record was at the People 's Theatre in Chicago , May 8-14 , 1904 . My Partner was performed at the Olympic Theatre , London , April 10-May 8 , 1884 ; in the cast were George Ringold , Phil Beck , Howard Russell , Harry Curtain , Rosina Power , and Alma Murray . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mein Kumpan . This was given at the Residenztheater in Berlin , September 15 , 1883 , and at Bomberg during the week of June 22 , 1884 . A moving picture version of My Partner was made in 1909 . While My Partner has been less often performed than The White Slave , it has received much higher praise than any other of Campbell 's plays and has always been regarded as his masterpiece . That suggestions for material used in My Partner came from the tales of Bret Harte and from the tales and plays of Joaquin Miller there can be no doubt , but , within its limits , the play remains an original and a good piece of dramatic writing . It should be noted that many people found My Partner a distinctly immoral play . In it Campbell certainly violated one of the dearest principles of the contemporary " satisfactory " play  --  the principle which demanded death at the end of the play for any " lost " woman , regardless of how sympathetically she may have been treated earlier in the play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drama of the second half of the nine-teenth century who " sinned " and later achieved a happy marriage . The following letter published in the Lewiston ( Maine ) Journal represents a not uncommon attitude towards the play . Lewiston , Me. , Oct. 2 , 1880 . To the Editors of the Lewiston Journal :  --  Hon. Wm . P. Frye , in his eloquent dedicatory address at Music Hall as reported in the Journal , said : " We have built this hall , and allow me to say that while we own it we pledge you it shall be pure . We shall devote it to pure art and pure drama if such a thing can be . " The play entitled My Partner is announced by elaborate pictures upon our bulletin boards to be produced in Music Hall , Oct. 6th . Have the gentlemen for whom Mr. Frye assumed to speak , transferred the hall to other hands ? I find upon consulting my scrap book that in an article published in your paper last season , I quoted from the dramatic column of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving every night this week , a play entitled My Partner . The Journal says : ' Two miners love the same woman . She loves the least worthy of the two , who ruins her . The other avows his love and she confesses her unworthiness . The false lover is slain in a brawl . She returns to her father 's house a mother . He demands an explanation . Her true lover opportunely appears and claims to be her husband . To satisfy all doubt , and to hide her shame , he marries her in the presence of her father . ' " Is this a sample of the pure drama the honorable proprietors of Music Hall have promised may occupy their hall ? It would be impertinent to assume that a single Christian will attend this performance ; but I appeal to that other large class of our citizens , who possess self-respect and a love for decency , to see to it that plays of such infamous character shall be performed to empty seats . Is there a parent in our community so lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation to our young people of such vile lessons in depravity ? It is to be hoped not . If the theatre is to cease to be the hot-house of vice and wickedness , as its patrons fondly believe , they must see to it that shamelessness and crime shall not be the central features of the plays that are produced . Yours Respectfully , J. Benson Hamilton . It is almost certain to be a popular success because it is full of local color  --  or rather of the color which is popularly supposed to be local  --  thanks to the imagination of Bret Harte and his school , and abounds in interesting situations , some of which are exceedingly dramatic . The piece can be greatly improved by the excisions of some of the sentimental passages , especially those which assert that Heaven looks with especial favor on the frailty of woman . It is one of the weaknesses of the border drama that very ordinary sinners are made to pose as saints and martyrs . The author would do well to restrict the use of the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Posie Pentland , which are mere claptrap , and likely to give offense to conscientious persons . It is not work of the highest order , but good of its kind .  --  New York Evening Post , September 17 , 1879 . It is a very strong piece . The effort has been made to deal with elemental passions and real persons , and to paint a picture of tragedy and heroism upon the tumultuous background of a turbulent semi-civilization ; and the object has been accomplished with startling force and unusual if not even skill . It makes a very valuable addition to dramatic literature  --  and one strictly American . It is a better piece of its class than has hitherto been produced in America .  --  New York Tribune , September 17 , 1879 . Bartley Campbell has written several excellent plays  --  none better , however , than My Partner . ... In the creation of his plot , and development of the story  --  keeping , as he does , the tide of interest always at the flood , in happily commingling rough humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving us a purely American drama , based on incidents that are possible and presented by characters not extravagant .  --  New York Herald , September 17 , 1879 . The play  --  My Partner  --  which he has produced is a more natural , a more logical and a more interesting drama of California life than The Danites . A good authority once said that Bartley Campbell displays more poetry in his writings than all other living dramatists combined . It is true . There are in My Partner lines of the tenderest and most unspeakable pathos , poetry as deep and full and genuine as the sounds wooed and wafted through a forest of pines , and as redolent of the atmosphere of California as the streams which love its valleys , or the snows which crown its heights . There is humor and sentiment , there is sense and sequence , there is chivalry and feeling , and there is poetry throughout . Everyone has imagined that the author or dramatist who has lived within the shadow of a California canyon is brought closer to nature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It might seem as if nature had selected the forest garden of the Pacific as the last place where man would penetrate , hence the repository of her best gifts in profusion . Mr. Campbell has caught the spirit of this and framed a pretty domestic story in the pure gold of a rough mining habitation . There are no pistols , dirks or shotguns in My Partner . There is but one murder .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , September 20 , 1879 . In every respect My Partner may be justly said to be the greatest play ever written by Bartley Campbell , and it is a play which should , as it has , make him rank among our foremost dramatists . It is a purely American play . Unlike some others laid in the Far West , it is less idyllic than realistic .  --  Chicago Tribune , February 10 , 1880 . It is not an exaggeration to say that My Partner is Campbell 's best play , and not only that but the best American drama by an American author ever written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer and Fall was a justly merited one , and signalized a marked spot in the history of our own drama . It is as far above The Danites in the scale of literary merit and dramatic construction as The Danites is below it . Dealing with a subject at once rude and yet with great possibilities of crude beauty , Campbell seized on the very kernel of the rich nut that laid within his grasp , cracked the hard shell that encompassed it , and exposed to view the hidden and dormant attributes of true genius . My Partner is a wonderful play . It touches the heart , it stimulates laughter , it arouses the better feelings in man 's nature . The frailties , the sacrifices of the kind that makes the whole world kin are brought out with a faithfulness and a truthfulness as rare as it is admirable . About the character of the rough but tender-hearted Joe Saunders there hangs an interest most intense . The nobility of the man raises him above the humble station in which he is placed to a height that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observer . The play has been noticed at length already in The Mirror , and there is little or nothing new to add now in criticism of the play . All the beauties of its dialogue remain intact like diamonds undimmed by usage and wear and tear . My Partner is a dramatic work that benefits and betters everybody that sees it , and it is one of a class that should be oftener given to the stage .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , April 17 , 1880 . At the Union Square Mr. Bartley Campbell has made a hit with his new Californian play called My Partner . We trust , for the sake of the great future which we still believe lies before the Pacific slope , that there are no such people as Joe Saunders and Mary Brandon inhabiting it . In Major Henry Clay Britt , vulgar and offensive as he is , it is possible to trace some semblance of humanity ; we are able , by remembering the lowest politicians in public life , to imagine the sort of man Mr. Campbell may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain who hunts his best friend down behind a smiling mask of hypocrisy , we have met with in other plays , if not in real life ; Mathew Brandon is not out of nature ; and Ned , during his short life , behaves as we can without difficulty imagine a young man of his education and surroundings behaving . But Joe ( Mr. Aldrich ) and Mary ( Miss Maude Granger ) are characters which it required a powerful imagination or else much reading to invent . Were it not that the suggestion would seem to challenge Mr. Campbell 's claim of originality , we should say that Joe belonged to a period considerably antedating the present , when it was the delight of novelists and dramatists to clothe virtue in the habiliments of extremely low life , and to attribute to coal-heavers in London or gold-diggers in California a delicacy of sentiment and elevation of spirit which would have done credit to a knight-errant . But Joe is all this , and something more . Mary Brandon is a part of a kind always unpleasant in any form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen to present it . The betrayal of a woman may be made use of in tragedy , because it is a peculiarly tragical thing ; but a play turning first on betrayal and utter social ruin , and subsequently on rehabilitation through marriage with a sentimental miner , is neither tragical nor comic . We will not say that such a subject can not be used in a play successfully , but that Mr. Bartley Campbell has not used it successfully . When we say successfully we refer to success in the eyes of the judicious , for there is no doubt that to the average audience My Partner seems just what a play ought to be .  --  Nation , October 16 , 1879 . ... This time we looked for salvation to England and America who had thus far shown little distinction in any extraordinary productivity . But the two plays exhibit very little originality . There are the same situations , the same characters , the same discourse which we all know from countless works , and which might well have been spared the trip across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand at Mein Kumpan ( My Partner ) , a character play in four acts by Bartley Campbell . Many successful performances in the United States are attached to the name of this author . Transatlantic papers assured us that in this author America had produced her playwright . He became known to us by a crass , sensational play , Der Galeerensklaven ( The Galley Slave ) , which had delighted our audiences in the suburban theaters . One need not consider the question whether we are faced by a new dramatic talent . Campbell is simply a man of crafty , theatrical tricks , and his capacity lies merely in being able to convert available poetic motives to fit the demands of the stage . External theatrical effects are his only concern ; one finds in his plays neither emotions , dramatically developed passions arising from the depth of the soul , nor close observations of characters . Some sensational situation will create a contrast , in which people will be jerked mechanically to and fro ; the author wants to excite our nervous system , he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths of life . This is not merely accidental and has a symbolical significance . The play begins with a coarse kick and ends with a view of the gallows . Here and there are , however , some calmer and more humorous moments , but the background consists of only gruesome and glaring motives : seduction , murder , and false suspicion . The action takes us to California , the land of gold diggers which has been described to us by Bret Harte 's novels and sketches . Campbell has also busily studied the author of Gabriel Conroy , and has borrowed many characters from him , such as the drunkenly happy Major Britt , a direct descendant of Bret Harte 's Colonel Starbottle . Concerning the fable in My Partner , the love story and the inquiry connected with the crime run parallel in it . Two gold miners , Joe Saunders and Ned Singleton , have both fallen in love with the same girl who , in her weak moment , yielded to the latter and is now anxiously awaiting the moment which will make her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " partners " to vow to marry her . This done , the two men divide their gold and separate . Now the inevitable frowning villain enters the scene . He tries to persuade Ned to consider himself free from his recent pledge and attempts to arouse his suspicions against the girl . The reader must remember that we are now in California where the vagabonding scoundrel is entitled to play the part of Providence . During the ensuing strife , Ned is fatally wounded , while the murderer , having filled his pockets with gold , calmly goes on his way , after craftily turning public suspicion on Joe who just returned . While the jury withdraws to decide the sentence on the latter , the love story of the young girl continues . The unhappy creature is being overwhelmed with reproaches and curses by her father , so that Joe affirms his intention to marry the girl , in order to save her from complete misery . A marriage then , while the executioner waits outside for the bridegroom ! It is too bad that this situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither a new one nor a good one . Of course , the author is only making fun . When the situation becomes desperate , the truth comes to light . The murderer had been so inane as to throw his bloody shirt cuff into some corner where it is found by some Chinaman . The whole play rests on this cuff , a play in which the whole relation of cause and effect is turned upside down . Whether the situations develop in this or the exactly opposite direction , this is merely decided by the stage effect , in the lowest sense of the word . The scenes sometimes are flung like firecrackers on the stage . In the dainty little Residenztheater where there exists such an intimate relation between audience and actors , such a smeared wall painting has a quaint effect indeed . One must forget much , if one is to be satisfied with that which is presented on the stage in the Blumenstrasse . One descends from an aristocratic well-furnished bel etage to a basement apartment .  --  Translated from Die Gegenwart , vol. 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tenth , was produced , for the first time in England , a rough-and-ready , vigorous melodrama , called " My Partner , " written by Mr. Bartley Campbell . The playbill states that " My Partner " is at present being " played with phenomenal success thruout the Australian Colonies , the United States , and Canada . " Five-and-twenty years ago , in London , Mr. Bartley Campbell 's " powerful emotional drama " would have been accounted one of a purely transpontine type ; but now that the bridges have been made toll-free , the transpontine drama has crossed into Middlesex , and seems to be as welcome there as it formerly was in Surrey . ...  --  Illustrated London News , vol. 84 , p. 370 . There is a flavour of Bret Harte and his backwoods about this play of Mr. Bartley Campbell 's , and in it there are many of the faults we found eight years ago in The Virginians sic , of which the chief are crudeness of method , a sort of spluttering fashion of introducing characters who have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brusque fashion of treating moments of passion , coupled curiously enough with very tall talk . The eternal heathen Chinee with his " me washee-washee , " and the electioneering stump orator , have been introduced to us by Mr. Edouin and Mr. Florence in other transatlantic plays , and Joaquin Miller gave us dramatic glimpses of mining life in The Danites . Still , there is distinct strength and very honest pathos in this play , and it is worth seeing , if only for the sake of the strong central scene . ...  --  Vanity Fair ( London ) , April 19 , 1884 . My Partner , the play by Mr. Bartley Campbell , presented at the Olympic on Thursday , proves to be a fairly satisfactory specimen of the backwoods drama , with something of the rude force as well as most of the crude weaknesses characteristic of such productions . In spite of the fact that its prominent comic characters  --  a carpet-bagging politician and a heathen Chinee  --  rather miss fire with English playgoers , Mr. Campbell 's play seems likely to gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London production , The Virginian , at the St. James 's in 1876 . This it will accomplish mainly through the agency of an effective episode of life in a mining camp as it is delineated in the powerful sketches of Bret Harte . The love of two rough " partners " for the same girl , and the tragedy which brings their rivalry to an end , produce a deep impression , such as will remain long after the foolish and tedious dramatic accessories of the piece are forgotten . The best scene of My Partner , which occurs at the close of its second act , gains much from the well-contrived earnestness and sincerity of Mr. George Ringold 's interpretation . ...  --  London Observer , April 13 , 1884 . ... Like most American dramas hitherto introduced to London , it depends for its success to a large extent upon " local colour , " a quality that is not likely to help " My Partner " very greatly , for the reason that at subsequent representations Mrs. Conover may deem it expedient to considerably curtail what last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting domestic story . ... Eccentricities of dialogue and of manner that are doubtless fully understood on the other side of the Atlantic , and perhaps in Australia , are not so plain to metropolitan playgoers.  --  London Morning Post , April 11 , 1884 . Local colour is provided by a Chinaman and by a rough " orating , " whisky-drinking candidate for the State Legislature . The drama , properly so-called , is a good deal overlaid with tall talk and extraneous matter , much of which is wearisome and even meaningless , but there is one effective situation that will go far to ensure the popularity of the piece .  --  London Times , April 15 , 1884 . My Partner is a play that may very well please the taste of its patrons . Indeed , with certain modifications , Mr. Bartley Campbell 's My Partner would be quite sure to renew here " the phenomenal success " which is said to have attended its representation in America , Germany , and the Colonies , though in any case it would probably be found better fitted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Siskiori sic County , California , a remote mining district , where one naturally expects to meet Bret Harte 's typical heroes , including his famous heathen Chinee . What one does not expect is to be bored with an elaborate study of the professional politician of the West , a tiresome personage , who , doubtless in the most life-like manner , wearies his hearers with stump orations , which naturally have no bearing upon the action of the play . This gentleman , a Major Henry Clay Britt , we may dismiss at once , with the remark that , conscien iously though he is portrayed by Mr. Henry Courtaine ( who has had over five hundred nights ' practice with the part ) , his excision would , from the English point of view , greatly benefit the drama . ... A curious incident in these two latter acts is the sheriff 's permission to the prisoner during his trial to leave the court and see his friends  --  a visit during which he goes through an impromptu ceremony of marriage with Mary , much , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the bridegroom is every moment expected to be condemned to death . For the most part My Partner is , it must be confessed , a crude piece of work , and its dialogue is often ridiculous when it is meant to be most impressive . But it is saved by its great situation , which honestly deserves the loud applause that it gains by sheer dramatic force and interest .  --  London Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News , vol. 21 , p. 126 .

The only performances of which I have any record are those given at Maguire 's Opera House , San Francisco , May 31-June 5 , 1875 , by the company from Hooley 's Chicago Theatre . The play was later revised and given as Friend and Foe ( q.v . ) .

At this moment Quentin returns for his answer and gets a refusal , which closes the first act . In the next act , he institutes proceedings against Fontain and threatens foreclosure of a mortgage . Carroll now regrets his selfishness and recommends Andria to wed La Fou , in order that her father 's home may be spared him . To her query , " And where will you go ?

The plot of the play is a slight variation from a score of others of the same class , of recent origin , embodying several interesting if not thrilling situations ; and but for the interpolation of a few positive vulgarities in the dialogue , and the annoyance of watching supers watching the progress of the play from the wings in full view of the audience , the entertainment was one of the best of the Hooley season .

Vanderen Campbell 's company played Paquita in Chicago in 1886 at the Criterion Theatre during the week of January 11 and at the People 's Theatre during the week of February 8 . A second company , headed by Frederick De Bellville , gave the play in San Francisco in 1886 . A manuscript of Paquita is in the Morton collection at the University of Chicago . The New York Herald was , in general , unsympathetic to Paquita , saying of it , " The play is in five acts . Four of them are weak ; one of them strong . " In Chicago the play was given at minor theaters and was not reviewed . But the Chicago Tribune , while commenting on Clio , which was playing at Hooley 's at the same time , said Paquita was a definite failure . There is much that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Campbell 's restless brain , but there are some genuinely effective situations  --  his power of melodramatic effect has not weakened . The most distressing parts of the play are the solemn stretches of arid and parched humor . There is enough of action and incident , of strong words and telling points , to enlist the public attention and applause in a generous measure . The first act is biographical and therefore dull . It closes with the entry of the wolf into the sheepfold , the arrival of the gorgeous Mexican cavalier , Don Jose Borosco , with whom the unhappy heroine Hortense proceeds to fall in love . She sets about this self-imposed task with boundless energy and self-determination . In the second act , the husband refuses to take the life of the self-confessed repentant Mexican Don Giovanni , freely offered in expiation of his guilt .

In the next act , Hortense is effusively forgiven by her husband , and is dying with her child in her arms , while significant glances are exchanged by Paquita and the bereaved husband .  --  New York Tribune , September 1 , 1885 . There is much that pleases and a good deal that produces the opposite result in Bartley Campbell 's new romantic drama , Paquita , produced at the 14th Street Theatre on Monday night .

The second and fourth acts are replete with vigor . Nothing , in any of Mr. Campbell 's plays is better than the situations which precede the close of these acts . The dialogue is dramatic and to the point here , but there are other places where the action is retarded by verbosity , and some incongruous and inartistic comedy scenes are introduced , excision of which would vastly benefit the piece and quicken its action . The audience found much to applaud , and several times during the evening they were carried along to a high pitch of enthusiasm . In spite of its several weak passages , Paquita is , we believe , destined to win popular approval .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , September 5 , 1885 . Peril . Comedy in three acts . Copyrighted by Bartley Campbell , November 1 , 1871 .

After Campbell became " literary attach " at Hooley 's Theatre in Chicago , he directed performances of Peril there March 11-22 , 24-29 , 1873 , September 18-27 , 1873 , and November 20-21 , 1874 . The casts at Hooley 's were : New York first saw Peril at the Union Square Theatre June 22-July 4 , 1874 , with McKie Rankin as Dick Rothley , Bevil Ryan as G. W. Bailey , Maude Granger as Laura Hayden , Ada Gilman as Alice Playford , and Mrs. Wilkins as Mrs. Tinsel . Campbell directed this production as he did one at Hooley 's Brooklyn Theatre , October 4-13 , 1875 . A somewhat shortened version of Peril , sometimes played as Peril and sometimes as Flirtation was popular on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the name Matrimony ( q.v . ) . There is much evidence to the effect that Campbell was constantly rewriting Peril . When copyrighted , it was in three acts ; when presented in Chicago it was in four ; and at the Union Square it was in five . In the first performance was a long scene in the first act between Price and Clover , and this was later dropped . In the early performances Naomi Porter not only flirted with Ralph Hayden offstage , but had one scene with him . And Mr. Pitty Pat , " a society swell , " appeared and disappeared from time to time . The Chicago newspapers reported in 1873 and in 1874 that Campbell was making many changes in the text . However , the various accounts of the plot of Peril show that the essentials of the story remained the same from the Philadelphia performances in 1872 to the versions used on the road after 1875 . Peril can not be regarded as an exceedingly valuable contribution to American drama . It is the work of a playwright who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has added a great deal that is very stale and threadbare and then has joined the parts together in a manner which betrays the presence of an inexperienced hand .

Faults of construction and the fashion of compelling the characters to do the most desperately wicked and foolish things without any apparent motive , are conspicuous throughout the play . ... ... Much of the dialogue is good ; and some of it , notably the gossip of the tale-bearing women , is considerably better than the average . Several of the characters also are capital . Mrs. Tinsel , a professional scandal monger is about the best , as Mrs. Morse 's performance of it was the most satisfactory personation of the evening . G. W.

The first act is better written than some other portions , but the action is rather slow . A considerable improvement in the latter respect is noticeable in the second act which moves forward briskly and concludes with quite a strong situation . The third act shows a falling off but contains one highly amusing episode , a declaration of love from a pettifogging lawyer to a scheming widow , with an altogether unexpected termination .

To construct a successful drama in an age when histrionics have descended from stilts to walk on the terra firma of nature and common sense requires a rare and peculiar combination of power and experience . By the term drama we mean such congeries of delineations and scenes as are co-ordinated with a vivid and harmonious picture of the genuine features of life . The diarrhea of trash and stupidity which a certain class of writers have discharged themselves of , to meet the requirements of hybrid strollers , the bastard fruit of the unholy embrace of negro minstrelsy and legitimate drama , we do not include under this head . It is therefore a matter of some congratulation when we find a young dramatist , who has enough consciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficiently true to the voice of his intellectual conscience to say retro sattianas to such selfish seductions and give his mind up to the writing of legitimate drama . ... The play is in some respects weak and inconsequent . ... It is given to but few men to display the ripe genius of Congreve , Sheridan , or Robertson in early years . But it is only just to ascribe to Mr. Campbell 's play a considerable merit as to character and plot . It would be gross flattery to say that his turn of dramatic kaleidoscope reveals an ensemble perfectly harmonious either in structure or coloring ; but with all his crudeness we detect some fine sense of effect and situation . It is with much pleasure we feel ourselves justified in assigning to the dialogue a high degree of merit . The dramatic student will find much in Peril which echoes other plays .

There is some good dialogue , and the situations are sufficiently inspiring to draw applause from the audience ; but there is a want of motive , or rather a lack of dignity of motive in the working out of the plot which prevents any active exercise of sympathy .  --  New York Graphic , June 22 , 1874 .

Raymond secured the acting rights to Risks , and immediately rewrote the play , pushing the main plot into the background and bringing forward the part of P.

Raymond played his version of Risks at the Pittsburgh Opera House , September 20-22 , 1877 , and in Chicago at Hooley 's , October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes made in the play and realized that Raymond was responsible for them . But when Risks was given in New York at the Park , January 14-February 2 , 1878 , the New York critics who had not seen the earlier version of the play noted that the star rle had little , if any , relation to the plot , and quite naturally , though wrongly , blamed Campbell for this situation . When Raymond played Risks in Chicago he was supported by Harry Pearson , Laura Don , Cora Tanner , and Clara Stoneall ; in New York , by W. J. Le Moyne , Minnie Palmer and Sidney Cowell . I find no record of performances of Risks after 1879 . The plot is quite Robertsonian in its simplicity . It hinges on the clandestine marriage of Paul Varney , an aristocratic young swell , to Bella Newton , a poor farmer 's daughter . Paul is depending on the purse of Aunt Mabel , whom he fears to offend , lest she in a fit of pique , should disinherit him . His passion for Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes him forget both caste and prudence and a secret marriage is arranged . This takes place in the country where Varney and a number of " friends " are spending the summer . Paul starts for the city to break the news to his aunt and if possible to secure her forgiveness , but before doing so , he receives a letter from his little niece in which she signs herself his " little wife . " This epistle he carelessly tears up for the purpose of lighting his cigar , and carelessly casts the unburned portion at his wife 's feet . After he leaves , she sees the paper and reads , " I am dying to see you . Your little wife , Hester . " Believing now that she has been deceived and that the marriage was made a secret one only for the purpose of ruining her , she resolves to leave home forever . Thereupon she writes a letter to her grandfather and blind mother telling them of her shame , and is about to quit the house , when the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next act is in Washington Heights where Paul Varney is entertaining his friends at his aunt 's villa . After a great deal of innocent love making , Bella enters , accompanied by an old friend , named Luke Lorring ( whom she chanced to meet in the city ) , and in the grounds encounters Hester Kendall , who , by the way , has designs on Paul 's heart , and who , on discovering Bella 's secret , informs her that she is the author of the letter , and is Paul 's wife . Almost frantic with grief and despair , Bella rushes off , and in a subsequent act , attempts self-destruction by leaping into the East River . From this she is rescued by Luke , and this closes the fourth act with a beautiful panoramic view of New York by twilight . Bella is induced to return to her home , and there meets Paul , who in turn believes she has deserted him for Luke . And then comes the stormy scene followed by an explanation and a happy finale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comedy supplied by Mr. Dillon , who , in the character of a life insurance agent , insists on taking a risk on everybody , while light and shade is given to the whole by the love affair between Mayberry and Katie Carter .  --  Chicago Tribune , May 4 , 1873 . The play is too long , and various of its scenes belong to the drama of sensation rather than to society drama . On the whole Risks may be considered a successful play ; it resounds with a healthy smack of the simplicity of nature which savors the whole work with the common emotions of mankind .  --  Chicago Times , May 4 , 1873 . A full house greeted John T. Raymond at the Opera House last night to see Bartley Campbell 's last and best play , Risks ; or , Insure Your Life .

The truth is , P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable from the type of character imagined by the author . The author will be amazed as well as amused with the liberties taken by the actor .

At the time of Campbell 's breakdown he was working on a play to which he had given this title . The scene was to have been Denver , Colo. , during its boom days . Separation . Comedy drama in five acts . After Separation had been rejected by several managers , it was produced with success by Shook and Collier at the Union Square Theatre , January 26-April 5 , 1884 . After closing at the Union Square , the company played for a week at Haverly 's Brooklyn Theatre , and then made a short tour of some eastern cities .

The outline resembles that of Odette except the wife , however , becomes an operatic prima donna , instead of going wrong . In several respects Separation is the best play the public has seen from the pen of its author . Its literary quality is superior to anything he has ever done . The construction is closer . There is much more play of character , the rles more balanced , and the movement of the piece is vivacious and free from the spasmodic element which enters into so many of his poorer works .  --  New York Herald , January 29 , 1884 . To illustrate this incident of matrimonial infelicity Mr. Campbell has written a large quantity of dialogue , some of which is excellent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called acts , but which in fact are a series of colloquies . A dramatic mechanism  --  the display of a plot by means of deeds and incidents  --  has scarcely been attempted . The piece states a case , recites its facts ; shows its aspects at different points of time and urges its moral . Mr. Campbell 's play might have been more effective had he thought more of dramatic point and less of moral significance .  --  New York Tribune , January 30 , 1884 . Separation was produced at the Union Square Theatre before a crowded house on Monday evening . Its success was emphatic . A greater triumph could not have been wished . Rejected by three leading managers , it proved the judgment of all to have been at fault , justified the author 's faith in his work , and rewarded Shook and Collier for their pluck . Indeed it did much more , for it opened the doors of one of our leading stock theatres to the American dramatist , who has never before obtained that recognition which is his due . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first glance . The success of Separation opens vast possibilities by drawing the attention of stock managers to a class of playwrights who have been neglected in first-class quarters , and indicating that profit is not confined to the reproduction of second-hand imported dramas . On the stage , where Sardou , D'Ennery and Belot have held supreme sway , Campbell scores a triumph as brilliant as any of the many identified with the history of this house . ... Aside from the ethical aspects of Separation  --  which is likely to arouse some warm discussions , as some people are inclined to think that the conduct of both Blair and his wife is unusual , inconsistent and strained  --  it is a strong , interesting play . The materials are old but they are handled vigorously , originally . The characters are powerfully drawn ; they represent variety of contrast and fidelity to nature , excepting that at the end of the first act , the climaxes are dramatic . The situation where the mother meets the daughter , but refrains from disclosing her identity , is novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parts of Fanny and Felix are quite new to the stage , and that of Maxwell is refreshing and natural . Indeed naturalness pervades the entire play . Mr. Campbell has hit the happy medium between literary excellence and strong human interest . Those wiseacres who predicted that Separation would prove unsuitable to a Union Square audience because Mr. Campbell could not write refined dialogue , were all at sea . The language of this piece is pithy and polished . It abounds with virile ideas , healthy sentiments , and there is a dash of that breezy poetry here and there , that freshens all of this author 's work . Furthermore , from beginning to end , in plot and dialogue there is not a suggestion or line that is not pure . Marital infelicity has often been selected by modern playwrights as the basis of their stories , but they have generally used it to construct adulterous dramas which are degrading to the stage and demoralizing in their effects upon the public . Purity , under ordinary circumstances should not be singled out as a merit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , unhappily , the sins of frail women have been woven so extensively into the woof of society dramas recently , that we may be pardoned for calling attention to the cleanliness of this particular play . A strong play , fairly acted and exquisitely mounted , invariably attracts a large share of public attention . Separation , therefore , will in all probability hold the boards at the Union Square for many weeks to come .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , February 2 , 1884 . The play , like all the plays of Bartley Campbell 's , is written down to the level of mediocre taste , but it has a certain vitality that redeems a tone which is always commonplace and is often vulgar . ... The motive of the drama is trivial ; the moral to people of sense is impertinent ; nevertheless the story to the multitude must be entertaining , as it illustrates the struggle between two estranged hearts for the possession of a child 's love .

Its last performance of which I have any record was at the Imperial Theatre in Chicago , December 5-12 , 1915 . Siberia was given at the Princess Theatre , London , December 14-19 , 1887 . Campbell was probably moved to write Siberia because of the great interest taken by American newspapers in all things Russian following the assassination of Emperor Alexander II in 1881 . While it is likely that some of the material for Siberia was taken from newspaper and magazine articles , Campbell also received some suggestions from Scribe 's The Jewess and Von Moser 's Deborah ( Leah the Forsaken ) . Bartley Campbell 's latest play , Siberia , was produced last night for the first time on any stage , and was witnessed by an audience that filled the theater from orchestra to gallery . The play deals with the story of two young girls , the daughters of a Jewish father and Christian mother . They wander through seven acts , and are assisted by various characters who help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Properly speaking , there is little plot and less motive for the melodramatic action and ending of all the acts ; but Mr. Campbell 's experience as a playwright stood him well in hand in previous plays , and the facility of catching melodramatic effects did not desert him in the construction of his last work . ... Like all of Mr. Campbell 's plays , it is replete with dialogue full of insipid sentimentalisms and old saws worked over into newer and less effective language . The subject gives many opportunities for the display of remarkably fine scenic and melodramatic tableaus , and they have been richly supplied . In fact , the play is crowded with so many incidents and details that the story itself and the real dramatic sequence is less a matter of importance than the smooth working of every particular scene and mechanical contrivance .  --  San Francisco Examiner , November 29 , 1882 . A crowded audience waited until the curtain fell on the last scene of Siberia last night at the California , and inasmuch as that did not occur until close upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play was acceptable . There is every chance that it will run for some time . It is full of thrilling effects , the scenery is exceptionally fine and a ballet heightens the charm . To take the play to pieces would hardly be generous , since so many melodramas have been accepted for their power to excite . Bartley Campbell has gone in for the unmitigatedly wild and fearful , so much so that it does not seem quite clear to the spectator when he leaves the theater what all the fuss has been about . But there can be no question that it is fuss . The play may be said to open with a massacre of the Jews , although that occurs in the second act . The ballet is the feature of the first . We would tell the story if we could , but it is too complicated and incoherent . Indeed one only needs to give the ends of the acts to explain it as it stands . ... There is so much life and action in the piece that it makes a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the characters are shifted from Odessa and Siberia and elsewhere in the most extraordinary way , the situations are effective , especially the ends of the acts , which are mainly short .  --  San Francisco Chronicle , November 29 , 1882 . There are a number of capital situations in Siberia . ... The scenes are well conceived , the costumes are picturesque and the action is rapid and sustained . The audience overlooked the fact that there was nothing strikingly original , and the action is jerky . There are great spectacular possibilities in the play .  --  New York Herald , February 27 , 1883 . The piece is well-calculated to please , for , although it deals with ancient situations and well worn incidents , it casts over them an atmosphere of novelty  --  obtained by disposing them under fresh conditions . The story is one of love that endures through many trials and of tyranny that is successfully resisted and adroitly baffled . The expert playwright , however , has handled these materials so as to arouse and maintain an interest in a story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of Russian politics is no less free than easy .  --  New York Tribune , February 27 , 1883 . ... However , melodrama and probability are the opposite of synonymous . So long as the emotions of the audience are sufficiently excited and the eye diverted by rapid and interesting action , the object of the writer is fulfilled . It is not our business to scoff at the class of play to which Siberia belongs , but to compare it with other efforts of the same character , and show in what respects it falls short of or excels its rivals . Mr. Campbell 's wonderful power of appealing to all kinds of people is shown in this play . He takes a subject that might be made romantic by a less intuitive author and works it up on the realistic principle . So strong and surprising is the climax of each act that the observer forgets the impossibilities , or even absurdities , under the crafty spell of Campbell 's subtle dramatic tact . The interest which the story of the piece handled in a less clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of producing a panorama of situations that can only be described by the word absorbing . Possibly the latter part of the drama would increase in effectiveness were a few of the startling happenings , with which the earlier acts are surcharged , taken out ; but it must be admitted that , notwithstanding the presence of such a quantity of sensations near the beginning , the melodrama is thrilling throughout . The dialogue is vigorous in the heroic passages , tender in the love scenes and witty in the comedy portions . Campbell 's English , if not always as pure and undefiled as the pro-Jonsonites might desire , is at all times direct , never feeble , and often as melodious as that handed down to us from the literary geniuses who were the contemporaries of his ancestors in the little green isle . With the dual exceptions of The Ticket-of-Leave Man and The Silver King , no modern British drama will stand comparison with Siberia .

The story does not possess the interest of intricacy and surprise , but is told straightforwardly , and generally with considerable effect .

It is a scraggly drama originally intended to be produced with spectacular effects and a ballet . It is little better than a skeleton cheaply padded , and the story is insipid . Mr. Campbell has picked up nihilism and pogroms as they are popularly supposed to exist in Russia , and following the newspaper reports of wrongs , iniquities , and persecutions , endeavors to show Russia is an exceedingly mismanaged country , and the sooner it is put in a moral strait-jacket the better it will be for the world at large .  --  Chicago Inter-Ocean , January 17 , 1884 .

Modern melodramas as a rule are not the most popular of dramatic productions , at any rate with the thoughtful and educated frequenters of the theater . There are many old dramas of this class which are an exception to the rule , and which are faultless in construction , strong in dialogue and enjoyable in performance . But the melodramas which have been produced during the past ten years can not be said to possess all , if any , of these desiderata , but on the contrary are constructed with the view to embody so much of the sensational as to sacrifice all the above mentioned qualities thereto . Just at the present time these pieces are being produced with alarming rapidity , and the stage throughout the country is flooded with such material as is found in Across the Continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plays of the same class . It is a sad sign of the times that the theatrical managers of our large cities find it remunerative to provide such questionable pabulum for their patrons . Bartley T. Campbell 's Through Fire , if it is anything , is a melodrama , and we are in candor forced to admit , that whatever its excellencies , and it has some , they are more than overshadowed by the evils of that school of drama to which we have referred above . We admit that it has excellencies , and heartily congratulate Mr. Campbell upon some portions of the dialogue , which are really good and far superior to any similar play which we have seen . But that the play is uneven in this respect we must confess , and unwillingly assert that many very weak portions are observable . We do not suppose that Mr. Campbell claims for his production the quality of originality , or that he credits himself with the creation of anything new in the matter of stage effect or business . The piece is a well managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified and remodelled , with new words put in the mouths of the familiar characters . The first and second acts vividly recall the opening scenes of Solon Shingle , the third act brings to our recollection Byron and Across the Continent , the first part of the fourth act bears a striking resemblance to portions of the Streets of New York , while the latter part reproduces the mountain scene in No Thoroughfare , and the last act is a repetition of the closing scenes in the Lady of Lyons . The first act of the play introduces an honest , industrious clerk , Bert Bristow ( Mr. Gotthold ) and a dissipated , dishonest colleague , Gus . Tivis ( Mr. Rowe ) . The action opens in the counting room of Josslyn &; Co. , and it is discovered in a conversation between the clerks that Bert is in love with Grace Josslyn ( Miss Johnson ) , the daughter of Adam Josslyn ( Mr. Dean ) , the banker . Jarvis Josslyn ( Mr. Duffield ) , a nephew of the principal of the house , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doubloons which form a part of a special deposit with the bank and is caught in the act of opening the safe by Jarvis . The two concoct a plan to accuse Bert of the theft , which is of course done , and as Mr. Josslyn considers the evidence of crime sufficient , Bert is discharged but not prosecuted . In this act Grace enters the office and she and Bert indulge in the wildest lovemaking , a situation which the surroundings in the scene make very improbable . Another weak point , too , is that Bert , without any opportunity of ascertaining Jarvis 's plot , while protesting his innocence , openly accuses that gentleman of having full knowledge of it . The second act brings Bert home , where he tells his mother of his disgrace , and introduces an extraordinary servant girl , Jenny ( Miss Georgie Dickson ) , who is the sweetheart of Sam Badgett ( Mr. Irving ) , the messenger of Josslyn &; Co . Sam , who is scarcely seen in the first act , has , in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert and accuses to him Jarvis and Tivis . Bert visits Tivis and that worthy acknowledges his guilt and agrees with Bert to accuse Jarvis of his crime . Jarvis is introduced preparing to go to Boston , and with him appear two characters which are altogether unnecessary to the action of the piece , to wit , an impossible kind of negro servant and a mercenary faro bank proprietor , who points his pistol in a drawing-room and obtains money by that means from Jarvis . The act concludes with an ineffectual attempt on the part of Bert to effect the arrest of Jarvis in a New York railroad depot where Allegheny Valley tickets are sold . In the third act a skip of three years is made , and Bert , now Wild Nat , a wagoner , is discovered on the plains with Sam , the reason of their being there and how they came there not being explained . This is an act of mysterious meetings . Grace and Jenny ( who is now her maid ) both appear in the scene , and Jenny , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bert makes himself known to Grace , and after more love-making , begs her not to sleep in the ranch as he fears something . She sleeps in her wagon , and Jarvis , who has also from some cause turned up in the same place , employs Indians who fire the ranch with the hope of destroying Grace . As she sleeps in the wagon , she with Jenny and two other persons , who accompany , escape uninjured . The fourth act is the strongest of the piece . Jarvis is a millionaire in California . Tivis turns up , enters his room , and by the muzzle of a pistol obtains from him a confession of the plot against Bert . Jarvis shoots Tivis as he leaves the house . The latter buries the confession , and as he is dying , Bert , who is going over the mountains , falls over him and is told where the confession is . Bert starts to find the paper and meets Jarvis , who is hunting for the dead Tivis , a dreadful encounter takes place and Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the characters in some way to New York , and Grace is about to marry Jarvis when Claude Melnotte  --  we beg pardon  --  Bert enters , produce ; the confession , and , to use the language of the synopsis , " All went merry as a marriage bell . " With this brief and necessarily somewhat incomplete statement of the material in the piece it will be seen that Through Fire belongs to the sensational order , and of the material the company makes the most . Mr. Gotthold throws into his rendering of Bert so much earnestness and force that he makes of the character more than we could believe it possible to make . Some of the speeches which fall to his part are really good , and for these Mr. Campbell deserves much credit . Mr. Duffield , Miss Johnson , Georgie Dickson and Mr. Irving are all that could be desired in their several rles . Mr. Campbell has , we think , erred in introducing too many characters into Through Fire . The piece is , however , a great improvement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , and his friends ( and we are among them ) would congratulate him upon this improvement . We assure him that our remarks on his production are given in the kindest spirit and for the purpose of pointing out to him what we consider as mistakes , to the end that in the future he may be more careful in the preservation of his unities and in the action of his dramas .  --  Pittsburgh Commercial , December 27 , 1871 . On the whole , Through Fire would do well to rank with such predecessors as Across the Continent , The Red Pocket Book and the like . The piece itself is not wanting in interest by any means . But the situations are so glaringly sensational , and the evolution of the plot so mazy , and assisted by such a deluge of improbabilities that the piece would readily be recognized as an imperfectly incubated first effort of a young and ambitious playwright .  --  Chicago Tribune , May 28 , 1873 . Ultimo . See Bulls and Bears . Van , the Virginian . See The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sierras . Drama of sensation . Adapted from Campbell 's earlier How Women Love ( q.v . ) . Advertised as a first performance , The Vigilantes opened July 1 , 1878 , at the Grand Opera House in New York and ran until July 5 with a cast which included Rosa Rand , Estelle Mortimer , Alice Hastings , Louise Willes , Louis Aldrich , W. H. Leake , Harry Colton , M. C. Daly , H. S. Duffield . It was again played in New York , this time at Niblo 's Garden , from November 25 to November 30 , 1878 . In this cast were Annie Tiffany , Blanche Mortimer , Harry Colton , F. A. Tannehill , and W. H. Lytell . That The Vigilantes was played " on the road " is indicated by the fact that there were performances of it at Deadwood , S.D. , on May 31 , 1879 , and at Newark , N.J. , on December 8 , 9 , 10 , 1879 . The story is one of love , adventure and frontier rudeness , and is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may invest both dialogue and action , even in this department . ... The drama opens in the Sierra Nevadas , where an orphan girl named Violette Varnett is in love with her foster brother , Frank Ransome . The latter returns from San Francisco with his heart full of love for another woman , and relates the story of his passion to Violette . She feigns indifference and wishes him joy , only to give way to a storm of grief as soon as he quits the room . This is interrupted by the entrance of an old miner named Joe Comstock , who , having saved the girl 's life when she was almost an infant , has long cherished a secret attachment for her . In a graceful love scene , full of pathos , he discloses his secret and is rejected . Frank finally marries the object of his choice , who is led , through the machinations of a villain , to desert him after a year of married life . Frank becomes dissipated , and Violette and Joe , hearing of the organization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco to save him . They arrive just in time to witness his encounter with the seducer of his wife and his arrest by the vigilantes . In the subsequent act Joe offers to die in Frank 's stead . which the latter refuses , and he is about to be led out to execution when Violette returns from a visit to the committee , now with the pardon of the man she loves . In the remaining act the rescued and rescuers start for their old home in the mountains , are overtaken by a snowstorm and are perishing for food . From another coach , similarly circumstanced , Frank 's wife comes only to crave forgiveness and die at the feet of her injured husband . This , of course , is but the vaguest outline of an interesting story .  --  New York Herald , July 2 , 1878 . The Vigilantes , a new play of Bartley Campbell , was given at the Newark Opera House . The play has elements of strength ; the plot is interesting and the situation somewhat exciting .  --  Newark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Domestic drama in five acts . This play was written for and performed at Hooley 's Theatre , Chicago , October 26-Novembcr 7 , 1874 , and April 5-7 , 1875 , with the following cast : Vandyke Vernon James O'Neill Kate Calvert Louise Hawthorne Ananias Jingle Wm . H. Crane Richard Calvert Nate Salsbury Cromwell Calvert George Ryder Jack Pennington H. M. Brown Jeminaia Jenkins Mrs. Fred Williams Lou Manning Miss Doyle Campbell directed performances of The Virginian at Hooley 's Theatre in Brooklyn , September 15-19 , 1875 , with a cast which included Annie Ward Tiffany , Minnie Doyle , M. V. Lingham , M. C. Daly and Augustus Pitou . A new version of The Virginian , one with a " happy ending , " was directed by Campbell at St. James 's Theatre , London , November 20-December 2 , 1876 . In this cast were Samuel Piercy , C. Cooper , George Honey , Lydia Foote , and Mrs. John Wood . The Virginian was included in the repertoire of the " Bartley Campbell Combination " which toured the country in 1877-78 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Affie Weaver played it on tour during the season of 1880-81 . It was played in Chicago in 1883 and again in 1895 . Tradition has it that The Virginian was very popular in the South . The dialogue of the piece is not brilliant , but possesses a quaint , homely , natural quality which is more intelligible to the average audience perhaps than the scintillations of Sheridan , and causes no little merriment to the audience . Mr. Campbell has shown increasing maturity in reaching below the mere surface of events to play upon the feelings which are common to human nature , and in a manner has succeeded in stirring them . But  --  he fails to stir the audience to any fixed purpose . The Virginian is a perfectly pure and wholesome drama , and its story interesting , but we can not say that the author has exhibited any astonishing power over the sympathies or left any decided impression .  --  Chicago Tribune , October 27 , 1874 . The Virginian is a play of strong human passion , and in that sense , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act ends with a powerful situation . With every desire to do justice to Mr. Bartley Campbell 's abilities , it may be said that his Virginian has the same effect upon the mind as is produced by reading the dialect poems by Bret Harte . The Virginian contains the character of a wilful , generous-hearted American girl named Lou Manning , that is an admirable study of character , worthy of Dickens , or even of Sterne . It is essentially a novel theatrical type , and is well worth a visit to sec.  --  London Sportsman . The Virginian is mainly a creditable work . It is , to be sure , over lachrymose , and to be truly artistic , should have a cheerful finale to compensate for the tearful nature of its general story . Mr. Campbell has caught a bit of touching life history , and has compressed it artfully into four acts of rational entertainment . As long as Mr. Campbell can make women in the audience poke handkerchiefs into their eyes , and set men rubbing their coat sleeves across their blurred optic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of dramatic unity .  --  Chicago Times , October 27 , 1874 . It has been stated that the play ... has enjoyed a large share of popularity in its three year tenure of the American stage , and we feel a great curiosity , to wit : how much of truth this statement may be credited . ... But not even this excuse can be admitted into any speculations as to the probability of the favor claimed for this play in its own land . It is true that it is called The Virginian and that the two principal characters are supposed to have been fighting against the Armies of the North . It is true , moreover , that the sentiments of the characters are occasionally couched in that vernacular and occasionally rendered with that peculiar drawl which is usually accepted as one of the national characteristics . The story might be told of any people , for indeed it has often been told before now . ... It has been sometimes objected to the comedies of today that the conversation is far brisker and more entertaining than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to The Virginian.  --  London Times , November 22 , 1876 . And when on Xmas Day a convenient snow-wreath envelops and suffocates the husband , his wife clasps with ecstacy her second love to her heart , the Xmas bowl is raised aloft in triumph , and the Xmas party overflows with festive raptures . We decline to believe , however , that anywhere in the world the sorrows of a man who returns sick and wounded from fighting his country 's battles , to find his wife in the arms of another , and the child of a stranger prattling on her knee , can be regarded with anything but sympathy , and the joy which is raised over the demise of such a one is surely out of place anywhere except in the worship of Moloch . The strong situations which Mr. Campbell has introduced misled the audience for a time , but the closing scenes did not pass without opposition . A drama more unpleasant and more subversive of right feeling has seldom been placed upon the stage . Some dexterity is shown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The serious characters , are , however , altogether unsympathetic , the hero especially displaying a promptitude worthy of Joseph Surface in cloaking with a noble sentiment an indefensible or ignoble action .  --  Athenaeum ( London ) , November 25 , 1876 .

The manuscript of West Point is in the possession of Mr. Robert Campbell . The White Slave . Drama in six acts . Copyrighted by Robert Campbell , 1909 . The most popular of Bartley Campbell 's plays , The White Slave , had its premire at Haverly 's Theatre , New York , April 3 , 1882 , and ran until May 6 , with the following cast : Lisa Georgia Cayvan Daphne Emmie Wilmont Nance Etelka Wardell Mrs. Lee Mrs. G.

Smith Little Jim Master la Forrest At the dose of this run a somewhat changed company then began a coast to coast tour which included a Chicago engagement , at Hooley 's Theatre , from October 29 to November 11 . For the next several years The White Slave was an annual attraction at important theaters throughout the country . After its drawing power at these theaters waned , it began a long career at the minor theaters in New York and throughout the country . Chicago saw at least one week 's performance of it every year until 1901 . A White Slave company , directed by Mr. Robert Campbell , toured the country from 1912 to 1918 . Its last official performance was at the Walnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , February 23 , 1918 , when Lisa was played by Rita Knight , Nance by Gertrude Perry , Letty Lee by Helen Collier , Clay Britton by Scott Moore , William Lacy by Allen Lee , and Stitch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how devoid The White Slave is of literary merit , we would fall into the trap that caught the critics of all the daily papers , who should not have allowed Bartley Campbell to put salt on their tails . We are wiser birds , and we do n't intend to be ensnared by any such patent devices . We will not , therefore , draw and quarter the poor White Slave and kick the dismembered pieces in the dust . That is work for Gommys . But Mr. Campbell 's play was merely written to please the public , and this by catering to the appetite of the moment . Such a composition must necessarily be utterly innocent of the slightest claim to artistic merit . Dramatists work for money as well as other people . If Wilkie Collins found that trash was craved by the reading public , he would undoubtedly desert the pleasant paths of good literature and write a dime novel  --  and a reeking one , too . If he did not , he is more conscientious in respect to his profession than nine tenths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Fairfaxes fail , and Geraldines refuse to " catch on " with that tenacity so necessary to their continuance , then the horizon must be carefully scanned , thorough observations taken , and the whereabouts of the ship of " Public Craze " precisely located . This is what Mr. Campbell did ; hence The White Slave , which , as we have said , shall not fall slaughtered by our hand , because it is a play for the people , and from their standpoint , and not from our own , it shall be regarded . ... The White Slave , partaking as it does of the salient virtues of the three  --  the only three  --  dramas of the South , has in it all the elements of a popular success . The craze for melodrama has extended far into the East and West , and there is money to be made by feeding it . New Yorkers who can see such magnificent spectacles as Youth and The Lights o ' London will not go wild over the sensations of Mr. Campbell 's production ; but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents amazingly , and a pot o ' money will find its way accordingly into the author 's capacious pocket .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , April 8 , 1882 . It was all slap-bang on the Fourteenth Street stage Monday night . Fires , villains , knives and sheet lightning mingled in the most startling manner imaginable . When a cannon goes off the snap of the cap is heard a second before the big report . The White Slave is the reverse of the cannon . The grand explosion comes first and the puny crack of the percussion afterwards . The first three tableaux rattle off like musketry , the last three drag out with as little effect as the report of a popgun . To be less gunny , Campbell 's play needs stiffening up towards the end . If this is done The White Slave will take like  --  like smallpox . The story is a perfect terror of sensations . They are crowded into every tableau , and as the nervous spectator alternately jumps from his seat or rubs his chin against the big hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave is a big success . The people want to exercise their hair  --  when they 've got some  --  in these days , and the girls all prefer to have their blood chilled than to sip Maillard 's creams . At least , that is about the size of it according to Pencil ; therefore Campbell 's condensed blood-and-thunder will be the favorite diet for the coming fortnight . The Octoroon is liberally drawn upon all through the play . The same tragic " Touch me not , villain ! " " Become your favorite ? Never-r-r ! " " Royal raiment has not the  --  " etc. , etc. , do service again . In one tableau the villain , hero , heroine , and a quadroon float across the stage , clinging to pieces of burning wreck .

Mr. Scanlan 's negro certainly has a wee drop of Irish in his dialect . This is a novelty at any rate .  --  New York Dramatic Mirror , April 8 , 1882 . Bartley Campbell is in for another popular success . It is not as well written as My Partner and The Galley Slave but is full of effects pathetic , melodramatic , and scenic that are sure to please the people who buy theater tickets .  --  New York Herald , April 4 , 1882 . There was no call to touch The Octoroon unless it could be treated in a better way , and Mr. Campbell is far behind its model .  --  New York Tribune , April 4 , 1882 . The play is well worth seeing by all lovers of the drama , and it may be said here that Mr. Campbell has gathered up and put in its construction all that is worth saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property in the past-and-gone slavery system .  --  St. Louis Republican , quoted by Chicago Tribune , October 29 , 1882 . The White Slave is an ingenious intaglio or piece of dramatic marqueterie with no more originality than a photo engraving . Bits of Uncle Tom , The Octoroon , Kit , and The World , and other sensational dramas have been kidnapped , uglified , attenuated , and melted in the Campbellean stewpan , warmed up with the gentle heat of the Bartlean genius . Dispensing with its utter want of originality and evaporating considerable slipshod sentiment in which Campbell can not help but indulge , the piece will draw . Its rhodomontade of catchpenny sentiments appeal to the half educated , and the cooing of the love-makers charm the fairer sex , so that its popularity will exceed that of many a better play .  --  Chicago Daily News , October 30 , 1882 . In the present dearth of original dramatic talent The White Slave ... may pass muster ; but Mr. Bartley Campbell had better make the most of it while the public is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not likely to outlast the season . It is one of those exasperating productions that are beneath serious criticism , and even defy classification . Literary work it is not ; dramatic work it assuredly is not , and if in despair one calls it a play , the word must be received in its most liberal acceptance . Mr. Campbell gages the public taste with great nicety ; he is careful to produce nothing that will be caviar to the meanest capacity ; he appeals to popular love of claptrap sentiment and cheap virtue ; and he recognizes the fact that in a highpressure age like this , men who have been at business all day do not want to be bothered with too much thought when they visit the theater at night . ... Yet this thing has been successful . And why ? Because it is cunningly put together with an eye to stage effects ; because the situations and scenic effects run little risk of failure , having in former and better plays received frequent and public approval , and because to an interesting story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , and transpontine sentiment , defeated villainy and triumphant virtue which seldom fail to appeal to a western audience . " Rags , " etc. , is one of those sentiments which from the lips of a pretty heroine like Lisa seldom fail to evoke plaudits from the gallery .  --  Chicago Tribune , October 31 , 1882 . The White Slave has been found to be greatly to the taste of American audiences . For English sympathies it is a little too heavily weighted with exciting and harrowing incidents . In other words , it is rather ponderously elaborate melodrama . It seemed , however , to give satisfaction to the audience Monday evening , who heartily applauded its negro plantation songs and hymns , and exhibited a creditable amount of compassion for the horrors of slavery in those pre-emancipation days .  --  London Graphic , August 23 , 1884 .

Ananias Jingle I can not say that it always does , but it generally does . Van . Vandyke Vernon Then I am not a refugee , generally or otherwise . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Behind table Have you been in the army ? Van . Vandyke Vernon Well , the fact is , I was going into the First Virginian , but my mother died when the bells were ringing out the victory of Manassas , and she was a Northern woman , born somewhere in the hills of Pennsylvania , and she made me promise I would n't fight against her kin .

If there is a pitiable sight in this world , it is a young doctor waiting for gray hairs and patients , or a young lawyer starving to death in his own office . Enter Cromwell , R.2.E . Crom .

Kate Calvert Yes . My husband is in the Ninth , and when I heard there had been a battle , I felt a nameless terror take possession of me as if I was resting under the shadow of a great cloud that might at any moment break into desolation and end in darkness . No one knows , unless it be those unfortunates who have experienced it , what a painful thing it is to sit day after day and await the arrival of tidings which may come all too soon at last . Rising Van . Vandyke Vernon I sympathize with you , madam , I really feel for you , but I would keep a stout heart . Trouble is always bad enough when it comes .

I would give twenty years of my life  --  yes , pile the years up like faggots  --  to have a fireplace in a woman 's heart as bright for me . But what 's the use in me rushing ?

Striking pocket Have something hot ? Penn . John Pennington Not now . You see , I 'm wounded , and the doctor does not allow me the use of liquor . Van . Vandyke Vernon So you are wounded ?

John Pennington On both sides of the line . Solemnly Van . Vandyke Vernon What do you say to a quiet game of Old Sledge , just to pass the evening , you know ? Penn . John Pennington I can not . I am here on important business . Van . Vandyke Vernon You are right  --  business before pleasure . Penn . John Pennington I wish it was a pleasure . Do you know young Mrs. Calvert ? Van .

John Pennington Yes , it is . I saw Dick fall ; shot through the head . Van . Vandyke Vernon Hush ! You have n't got the heart to tell her , have you ? Penn . John Pennington I promised Dick that very morning , when we went into the fight , to come and tell the folks if he should fall ; and you would n't have me violate a solemn promise , and that given to one now dead ? Van . Vandyke Vernon But the woman loves this man . Penn . John Pennington But she must hear it sooner or later . Van .

Jing . Ananias Jingle Jeminaia , you are harsh ! You are even more , you are cruel ! And from the way you eye that apprentice there , I may say inclined to be perfidious . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Do n't be a fool ! That apprentice is a mere boy . Jing . Ananias Jingle Boy ! Do boys have their suits of clothes ? Do boys wear gaiters ? Do boys wink slyly at young women ?

May I ask you who , in your opinion , is an ornament to that vague and indifferent being called  --  for lack of better appellation  --  society ? Jem . Jem inaia Jessup Why , just Van there . Look at him . Five years ago he came here a stranger , a poor man without a friend in the world , and nothing but his strong arms to depend upon . He went to work like a man . Jing .

Jem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and I knew them both . He would never have made Kate Vernon so happy as Van does . He was too fond of drinking , like yourself , and depending upon his father for support .

And besides , I am a professional man . It would be beneath my dignity to work in a forge like Van . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Rubbish !

Jeminaia Jessup She is going to surprise you with something . Van . Vandyke Vernon Bless her happy eyes , I have got something in store for her , too . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup You have ? Van . Vandyke Vernon Yes . I gave out the contract for the new house . It will be ready before Christmas . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Splendid ! Van . Vandyke Vernon Well , I should say so . Here 's the plan .

What is either of them to standing by quietly while your heart is being torn out of your body ? To be compelled to look down aisles of the future paved only with burning bitter tears . Chas .

Vandyke Vernon I know you are , Mr. Jingle , and I 'm sure I 'm grateful . After all a kind word is not air , no , sir . The good feeling that gives it utterance is the alchemist that turns it to gold , and none but the miserable know how deeply it sinks into the heart . Jing . Ananias Jingle Sitting But how often do we find , my dear boy , that the world is more niggardly of its kind words than its gold ? I have stood in need of a gentle word of admonition , of sympathy  --  did I receive it ? No  --  save and except from Jeminaia , sir . Van . Vandyke Vernon Well , well , to business .

We have but a few moments now , and I have so much to say to you . Kate . Kate Calvert I never knew until now how much the human heart could stand and not break . Van . Vandyke Vernon Trouble teaches us some queer lessons . Storms , they say , clear the atmosphere , and peoples ' sorrow catechises , by reminding us that we still belong to the great legion of poor humanity . This even With emotion may prove for the best . Kate . Kate Calvert For the best , to tear you from my life ! To break up our happy household ; to  --  oh , the very thought of this is enough to drive me mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he whom you have only known four short months in all your life should have the right to take you from me , in whose heart you have rested for more than as many years , but you are his wife by the right of holy ordinance  --  let us not forget that . Kate . Kate Calvert I shall miss you so much  --  your gentle words , your sympathy . Van . Vandyke Vernon And shall I not suffer , too ? You do not , you can not know how dear you have grown to me in all those years . You have been so kind , so loyal . But pshaw , I want you to be brave and here I am weakening your sense of right by words which had better be buried in the past , which today we must hide away as something never to be reclaimed in all the coming years . Kate . Kate Calvert Do not expect too much of me , Van . I am nothing but a weak woman , governed more often by impulse than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Van .

Vandyke Vernon My happiness ? Well , as to that , I do n't think there is much of that kind of thing in store for me , but my burden will be easier to bear if I know you are not crushed with the weight of yours , and I am quite content to stand down in the everlasting gloom if it will only make you happier . Kate . Kate Calvert God help us both to bear this blow . Lays head on table and sobs Van . Vandyke Vernon And so He will . I have here , Kate Producing wallet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and so we had better make a fair division of it . Kate . Kate Calvert No , no , Van , not a penny . Van .

Kate . Kate Calvert Sobbing I promise . Is there no hope for us ? Van . Vandyke Vernon I have put away hope as I would any other temptation . I must go now . Kate .

Charles Knox But Calvert may be very kind and teach her to forget . Lou . Lou Manning Dick Calvert is not the man to eclipse Van Vernon 's image in a woman 's heart . He is selfishness itself , and women are not much given to love men who love themselves , I can tell you that , Mr. Charlie Knox . Chas . Charles Knox What are you angry with me for ? Lou .

Ananias Jingle Yes , I heard him , too , and I must say I have not been edified in the least possible degree . Crom . Cromwell Calvert He has had a heap of trouble , and is mighty crusty , especially with Kate . Poor girl , I pity her , indeed I do . Will you take something ? Jing . Ananias Jingle Thank you , no . Crom . Cromwell Calvert A little gin and sugar ? Jing . Ananias Jingle No , sir . Crom . Cromwell Calvert What do you say to a compromise of brandy and water ? Jing . Ananias Jingle No , sir , I do n't drink . Crom . Cromwell Calvert Do n't drink  --  the devil ! Jing . Ananias Jingle I hope not . The devil was never a favorite drink of mine . Crom . Cromwell Calvert It 's a regular pledge , eh ? Jing . Ananias Jingle As regular as the principles of common law . Crom . Cromwell Calvert I am glad to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am . Jing . Ananias Jingle Shakes hands Thank you . Crom . Cromwell Calvert I only wish that you could get Dick to follow your example . I 'm afraid he 's going to the bad , and no mistake . Jing . Ananias Jingle I do n't think there is any use of talking to Richard Calvert . He is a little harder nut than I would like to attempt to crack . In fact , I 'm not certain that I 'm fireproof myself , yet . Crom . Cromwell Calvert Do you think , Jingle , that I could quit drinking at 67 ? Jing . Ananias Jingle You can try . Crom . Cromwell Calvert And so I will . I will take the pledge at once . Going with Jingle Remember that this is a matter that do n't admit compromise . Exeunt , C. Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Enter , L.

Kate Calvert Do you think that the terror of his anger will prevent me from going ? I am tired of this dreadful existence ; tired of his cruel upbraidings ; tired of his unwarranted suspicions . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup But he may not permit you to return . Kate Kate Calvert I care not . I would rather go out into the world as the meanest mendicant that ever solicited alms , than be denied the privilege of seeing my child . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Then if you will go with me , get your wraps at once before he has a chance to prevent your leaving . Kate . Kate Calvert Yes , yes . I will be ready in an instant . Going , R. Jem .

Little Hattie Then why do n't she come and live with us like other girls ' mamas do ? Van . Vandyke Vernon That is a long story and you would n't quite understand it . You are too young yet . Hattie . Little Hattie But some day I will be big and then you will tell me why you cried so hard over mama 's picture last night , wo n't you ? Van .

Aloud Not now , my child , not now . Going , C. Rich . Richard Calvert Outside Once for all , I forbid you . Van . Vandyke Vernon That is Calvert 's voice . Why , he is angry ! They are quarreling . Stop ! I must not let him see me . It would only make matters worse . Why , I always thought they were happy and she contented . Poor child . Ah , he is coming this way . Perhaps going to leave the house . Come , dear , let us go in here . Going L. Hattie . Little Hattie But do n't we see mama ? Van . Vandyke Vernon Yes , yes , we shall see her presently . Exeunt , L.

Kate Calvert I have already answered that question . Rich . Richard Calvert Again I demand a reply . Where are you going ? Kate . Kate Calvert To see my child . Going C. Rich . Richard Calvert That 's a subterfuge . Kate . Kate Calvert As your wife , I have reached almost the lowest depths , but I have not fallen so low as to need a subterfuge in this case . Rich . Can you deny that you are more anxious to see this man than the child ? Kate . Kate Calvert To such a question , I have no reply other than my silence . You can contrive as you think proper . Crosses , L. , and sits Rich . Is that the obedience of a wife ? Kate . Kate Calvert What demand have you upon my obedience ? Rich . Richard Calvert I am your husband . Kate . Kate Calvert You are in name , nothing more . Rich . Richard Calvert What do you mean by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband when you ceased to love and treat me as one . For a whole year  --  a long , bitter , dreadful year , I have lived in the dust of your feet , subject to your taunts , your sneers , your malice . I shall do so no longer . Crosses , R. Rich . Richard Calvert Crosses , L. Then you have no duty to perform , no responsibility for your acts ? If this is your creed , madam , you will learn that I have rights , too , and not only that , but the power to enforce respect from you . Kate . Kate Calvert Facing him What would you do ? Goes to him Rich . Richard Calvert I will kill you or you will obey me . Catches her hand Kate . Kate Calvert And do you think I fear to die ? Goes upstage Why should I prolong an existence which is only a long unchanging realization of misery and tears ? I have tried to be a patient and ever affectionate wife . Rich . Richard Calvert And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , for you met my self-denial with reproaches , my patience with torture , my affection with indifference . Rich . Richard Calvert Why not say cruelty ? Kate . Kate Calvert And so I might , for if to spend one 's days plotting another 's misery is not cruelty , then there is no need for such a term . Rich . Richard Calvert Your indictment is very cleverly drawn ; but women like you see but your own wrongs , as you are pleased to term them , forgetting that I , too , have reasons to complain . Going to her Can you picture to yourself my return , after four years of captivity , to find the woman I had made my wife on the eve of departure the wife of another ? Kate . Kate Calvert But I thought you dead . Rich . Richard Calvert I believe you did , at least I will give you credit for as much consideration , but I can never forgive you for forgetting me in one short year as completely as if I never existed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not acknowledge the legality of your rights and leave a home that was a paradise , aye , even the tenderest associations known to a woman , the companionship of her child ?

Kate Calvert We can not lock up our hearts as tombs and lay one 's love in them even when duty commands ; but you have not tried to kindle the affection I once entertained . You have been the owner , not the lover . The law binds me to you and that the chain clanks unpleasantly in your own ears is not the fault of the slave , but the master . Rich . Richard Calvert You have found your speech at last ; but every word you utter is only decreasing your chances of seeing your child . Had you been more choice of your words , had your memory not retained the occurrences of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it is too late . Locks every door Kate . Kate Calvert What will you do ? Rich . Richard Calvert Prevent you leaving this house . Kate Calvert , listen to me . You shall not see Vandyke Vernon or his child again . From this day forth , you are a prisoner in this house . When you leave it , it will be in your coffin . Kate . Kate Calvert Goes to him No , no ! You do not mean that ! Kill me if you will , in mercy kill me , but let me , oh , let me see my child again ! On knees Rich . Richard Calvert Your prayers and tears are in vain . I am resolved and nothing can shake my purpose . Kate . Kate Calvert Rising Then do your worst , for I will go . Rich .

Scene : Richly furnished apartment in Mr. Jingle 's house . Lights full up at opening ; red for fireplace . Large window , R.C. , through which can be seen mountain range , and snow falling at end of Act . Moon rises on mountain and snow ceases . Time , Christmas day , 1867 . Jingle discovered at table , R. , arranging holly boughs over window . Jing . Ananias Jingle That looks like it . There is a suggestion of Christmas in that last sprig . Enter Jeminaia , L.3.E . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup What on earth are you doing there ? Jing . Ananias Jingle Curb your curiosity , Mrs. Jingle . I know I am asking you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your curiosity , but as your husband , as the partner of your bosom , as the father of your  --  I mean our child  --  Jem .

Jem . Jeminaia Jessup We should thank Heaven for sending us such a treasure . Jing . Ananias Jingle Eh ? Oh , yes , certainly , it was Heaven who did it , of course ; and the celestial sphere has kindly put its monogram , a bit of blue , in either eye  --  Jem . Jeminaia Jessup I 'm so glad to see you so happy . Jing . Ananias Jingle Why should n't I be ? Am I not the owner of this little nest ? The husband of one of the best little women ? Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Dear Jingle ! Embraces Jing . Ananias Jingle Besides , there is something about Christmas that mellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merriest airs . By the way , where is the goose ? Jem . Jeminaia Jessup The goose ? Oh , dear , brown as a berry and the stuffing  --  Jing . Ananias Jingle Oh ! The stuffing ! I do wish Kate would come . I feel as if I would like to turn that stuffing to a particular account . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup She will be here by four o'clock , but Lou and Hattie ought to be here now . Jing . Ananias Jingle Does Kate expect to see her child here ? Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Certainly . It was that she might see her poor baby and spend Christmas with those who love her that I arranged this dinner party . Jing . Ananias Jingle It 's a great pity that Van could n't be here . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup I do n't think he would come . You know that it was only to avoid meeting her that he went to Virginia  --  to get out of temptation as he called it . Jing . Ananias Jingle I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Van , he is made of queer stuff . With him there is only one sentiment  --  duty . He even felt it his duty to leave his child with Lou , so that the little thing might be near its mother , that she might see it now and then . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup It was a great pity Van ever came here . Jing . Ananias Jingle It 's a great pity the rebel 's bullet made a tour round Richard Calvert 's cranium instead of going through it as it should have done , and as any sensible bullet would have done . Enter Lou , Hattie and Charles , D.F. Lou . Lou Manning Merry Christmas ! Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Thank you , thank you . Jing . Ananias Jingle You did get here at last , and Mr. Knox , too . Lou .

Jeminaia Jessup I hope nothing serious . Jing . Ananias Jingle Nothing of a mortuary character  --  Chas . Charles Knox Not so bad as that . Lou . Lou Manning Bad ! Do you call it bad at all ? It is n't bad in any sense . It 's the very quintessence of everything that 's delicious and delightful . Chas . Charles Knox Well , that 's what I meant to say . Jing . Ananias Jingle You pique my curiosity . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup And mine . Chas . Charles Knox R.C. , aside I wish I had n't said anything . Lou .

Exeunt , R.2 . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Tell me how it came about . I did n't think Charlie Knox would muster so much courage . Lou . Lou Manning He always had courage enough but he was sadly deficient in language . This morning he made a splurge  --  a desperate leap . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup And he said he loved you . Lou . Lou Manning Oh , dear no . He told me that long ago ; but the thing that stuck in his throat was the all-important question . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup You mean the pop ? Lou . Lou Manning Yes , the asking me to marry him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lou Manning But remember my dear , that Mr. Knox has a keen sense of delicacy . Jem .

Lou Manning Yes . Do n't look so . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup How ? Lou . Lou Manning Well , you see when he came in this morning I noticed something wrong with him . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Wrong ! Lou . Lou Manning Sort of white about his lips , and a general unsteadiness of person . Of course I knew at once the cause . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup You did ? Lou . Lou Manning Certainly . At first I did n't know what to do . It was an awful position to be placed in . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Terrible . Lou . Lou Manning I had a notion to run away at first , but I thought better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barometer of Mr. Knox 's courage may fall to zero and it will take him four or five years to revive . Now you know , my dear , the youngest of us can not afford to waste so much valuable time . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup No indeed , and you  --  Lou . Lou Manning You wo n't tell Mr. Jingle ? You do n't tell your husband everything ? Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Do you think I am a fool ? Lou . Lou Manning Well , I did n't know . Some women are , you know . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Go on please . Lou . Lou Manning I told him he had something on his mind . He admitted he had . I asked him to relieve his  --  Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Mind . Lou . Lou Manning Yes , mind , at once . He made several ineffectual attempts , and in time got so far as " How would you like "  --  when I unfortunately turned my head , and he threw up his hands in despair . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The position to a sensitive man must be one full of acute pain , so I said , " Do n't attempt it here . Go in the other room and relieve your mind . " Jem . Jeminaia Jessup And he did ? Lou . Lou Manning Yes . Through the keyhole he begged me to name the day . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup And you  --  Lou . Lou Manning Said February first . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup What followed ? Lou . Lou Manning A heavy fall , as of a limp and helpless body coming in contact with the floor , and then I was away . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup Did he fall ? Lou . Lou Manning I think he did , at least when I came back I found him with a large lump on his forehead . Jem . Jeminaia Jessup And so it is settled ? Lou . Lou Manning Yes , thank heaven .

Lou . Lou Manning You could n't stay in Virginia  --  ? Van . Vandyke Vernon The place was torture to me . I carried a heavy load back to the old homestead  --  a heart filled with bitter pain and haunting memories . Everything , too , was changed . War had left its desolating signet upon the hearts of the people  --  tall gaunt chimneys , all that remained of pleasant homes , pointed with spectral fingers to the heavens . A sort of solemn warning against man 's dead work and , well , it was  --  Lou . Lou Manning No longer home . Van . Vandyke Vernon Home ! I did n't expect to find a home .

Vandyke Vernon Would I like to see her ? Would the prisoner imprisoned in a dungeon for a long , long year like to see the sun-shining landscape ? Would a lost soul like a glimpse of Paradise ? Lou . Lou Manning You shall see her . She is coming here today . Van . Vandyke Vernon Today ! But do you think it would be right ? Lou . Lou Manning Why not ? Van .

Even the snow has ceased to fall , and beyond the mountain is the moon struggling with the snow and darkness . I can scarcely believe that I am the same gay , light-hearted fellow I was two short years ago . It do n't seem natural that trouble should change a man so much ; but it does .

Kate Calvert I had no one to send ; and day after day , night after night , I lay there looking woefully at the large black mountain that seemed to raise its great head between us , and wishing  --  oh ! How I wished for strength to climb over its rugged sides and see your dear kind face once more ! Van . Vandyke Vernon And He who never turns a deaf ear to a weak woman 's prayer , granted yours at last . Kate . Kate Calvert Yes ; but it was not until my faith in Him almost died .
