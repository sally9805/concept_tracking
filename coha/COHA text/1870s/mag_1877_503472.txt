TN the course of some of our former reviews of a class of books which is now assuming a very important position in the literature of science , we have used the phrase physiological psychology , inventing it to express a department of scientific investigation for which we know no name . As physiology refers to man 's body and psychology to his soul , our phrase may have seemed to some of our readers a contradiction in terms . But we find support for it in a book before us , which is of the highest authority upon the subject to which it refers. * Henry Maudsley , in . the preface to his " Physiolo*y of Mind , " says that " the current of psychological thought having set so strongly in physiological channels , it is pretty certain that the reflections which one person has had , however original they may seem to him , some other person has had , has now , or very soon will have . " Psychological thought in physiological channels is snore briefly physiological psychology . And , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one person has had , or even more , has now or even most , will soon have certain thoughts upon this or any other subject , can in any way affect their originality in the mind of another person , who derived them from no foreign source , particularly if that person was the first to give them expression . The philosophic study of man , of which Maudsley 's book is so important and interesting an exponent , is the result of the application to man of the inductive method of investigation . It rejects as folly all intuitive consciousness of the absolute , the unconditioned , the unknowable , and applies itself to the observation and study of what is known in regard to the human organization . It confines itself to facts ; and these it compares and classifies , and from these and these only it makes deductions . As to * " The Physiology of Mind " : Being the First Part of a Third Edition , Revised , Enlarged , and in Great Part Rewritten , of " The Physiology and Pathology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i2mo , pp. 547. *ew York : B. Appleton &amp;Co the unconditioned and the absolute , in the words of our author , " such existence has no more relation to us as conscious beings than the moral feelings of mankind have to the sensibility of an oyster or of an infusory animalcule ; it could be known only by a consciousness which had the power of transcending consciousness ; and to affirm anything of it , either positive or negative , is simply nonsense . " This is the ground , the starting point of the new philosophy of mans nature . The conclusion thus far arrived at by those who pursue the meth. * od of investigation indicated above , is that man is not dual but single *in hfs constitution ; that he is not a. body inhabited by a soul , but that wha*t has been called his soul or his mind is a mode of manifestation of his physical organization . Briefly it declares that psychology and physiology are one and the same thing , or different branches of one and the same subject . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself , entirely separate from the body , it has been long recognized , as we all know , that the brain is the organ of the mind , that through which it acts . This has been so long regarded as established that the words brain and mind have become almost synonymes . We say that a man has no brains , meaning that he has no mind ; that he has a weak brain , meaning that his mind is weak . According to the new philosophy this use of the two words has more than a metaphorical correctness ; and the brain , the spinal column , and the nervous ganglia , or at least what we call the mind , is the mere manifestation of their action . This opinion was held at one time by Robert Hall , the great Baptist preacher . " I am , " he said , as quoted in his memoirs , " and have long been a materialist . . . . My opinion upon this head is , that the nature of man is simple and uniform ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain organization of matter , and that after death he ceases to be conscious until the resurrection . " This opinion , we // DECEMBER , are told , he afterward abandoned ; but it is very important and significant as having been held by an evangelical Christian minister of Robert Hall 's ability , at a time when he was in the full exercise of his ministerial functions . Dr. Maudsley 's book must be admitted , even hy those who do not accept all his deductions ( and wo do not ) , to he one of very great ability . It shows wide and patient research , a candid spirit , clear perceptions , cautious method , and fine reasoning powers . We can not review it in detail , hut we can give our readers a just notion of its character by glancing at the view which its author presents of one of the most important , perhaps the most important , of man 's mental fuactions-memory . Memory is really the most wonderful and inexplicable of all those functions , and yet it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a continuous existence . If it were not for memory , a man would not know to-day that he is the same being that he was yesterday . On each awakening from the temporary oblivion of sleep he would have to begin a new existence , as if he were then first born . It is only by his memory that he knows that he has lived from infancy to any period of after life , that one of his days , or of his hours , or of his minutes has any relation to the other . And yet what memory really is , and how that so-called faculty acts , has heretofore been a mystery . Dr. Naudsley undertakes to solve this mystery , and to tell us how it is that we are conscious at one time of what has happened at another , and even how we are able to recall by an act of volition what had passed , as we supposed , utterly out of our consciousness , and was , as we siy , forgotten . The process , as he views it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spinal column . It may be supposed , according to Dr. Maudsley ( and we certainly must all agree that it may be suppo8ed ) , that the first brain action in regard to an event or a thing did leave behind it when it subsided some after effect , some modification of the nerve element , whereby the nerve cfrcuit was disposed to fall again readily into the same action , such disposition appearing in consciousness as recognition or memory . Here we have the unmitigated materialism once avowed by Robert Hall . Knowledge , consciousness , is the mere reception of an impression by a nerve , and memory is the mere disposition of that nerve to resume that impression ; recollection is a restoration of that impression . A startling and we must confess not altogether satisfactory theory . At the sa*ne time we must admit that psychology affords us not the least help in this matter , and that our author is quite right in saying that psychology , " in describing memory as a faculty of the mind , or the conservative faculty , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an explanation . " Am*I there is so much of this in metaphysics , and even in science . Science , moral or physical , . gives a thing a Latin name descriptive of its functions , classifies it and pi*eonholes it , and plumes itself upon a successful investigation , leaving us as to the cause , the nature , and the mode of action of this learnedly named thing just where we were before . Dr. Maudsley marks clearly the distinction , too little regarded in speech , between remembering and recollecting . When an event or a thing is remembered , it occurs to the mind spontaneously ; when it is voluntarily sought for and found , it is recollected . He maintains , however , that when a thing is recollected , there is consciousness of it , for it is impossible to exercise the will as to what we are not conscious of . His final conclusion as to memory is presented in these remarkable words : " First , memory is an organized product ; secondly , it is an organization extending widely through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of what has hitherto been regarded as one of the most mysterious and subtly acting faculties of the mind into an organized product stored away like so much corn or coat is one of the most startling results of the inductive system of reasoning as applied to man by modern science . Dr. Maudsley remarks upon the fact , which is known to many other observant persons , that persons of a very low order of intellect have often surprising memories . " I have seen , " he says , " an imbecile in the Eastwood asylum for idiots who can repeat accurately a page or more of any book which he has read years before ; . . . and I once saw an epileptic youth , morally imbecile , who would , // shutting his eyes , repeat a leading article in a newspaper word for word after reading it once . " Memory not only of this strength , but of this kind , is not commonly associated with great intellectual power . Men who can reason clearly , imagine vividly , who have brilliant fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory . They can remember the essential of what they see , or hear , or read , but the rest drops from them . Macaulay was a rare exception to this rule , as iDr . Maudsley mentions . But here he is somewhat trenching upon the domain of pure psychological reflection ; and here We leave him , commending his book to our readers as the most interesting of its kind known to us , if , indeed , there is another just of its kind in the language . PROBABLY no writer of her sex is or ever has been more widely known throughout the world than " George Sand " ( Mine . Dudevant ) . Her reputation is justly such , however , that her books are excluded from the reading of the young , particularly of young women , by those who are careful in regard to the literary influences to which their sons and daughters are subjected . Such persons would be surprised if , after reading the fourth of Messrs . Appletons ' collection of foreign authors* without knowing the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded " George Saud . " It is one of the simplest and purest little stories we remember ever to have read ; thoroughly good and safe in its moral tone and full of common sense . It is as unlike such books as " Indiana " and " Leila " as the productions of the same author could be unlike each other . The story is presumed to be told by M. Chantabel , an eminent French advocate , and it relates to his family and that of Countess de Nives . This countess , although a real countess by marriage , is a kind of adventuress ; that is , she enters the family of the Count de Nives as governess to his daughter , the first Countess , who dies , leaving a beautiful and eccentric young daughter . The governess captivates the Count , who marries her , and she also has a daughter . The new *E* The TowerofPercemont . " A Novel . From the French of GEORGE S&amp;.en. lOmo , pp. 227 . New York : D.

Countess immediately sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows up between them ; and the Count , being entirely under the influence of his new wife , sides with her , and begins to hate his elder daughter . He dies , and leaves his property , so far as he can do so , in the hands of his wid ow . But he can not put it completely in her power , because part of it is landed estate . The elder daughter , Marie , Mile . de Nives , has been placed in a convent , and there her stepmother , the dowager Countess , wishes to keep her and compel her to take the veil . She finally wishes to do more , however , to have Mlle. de Nives declared incompetent and placed in an asylum for the insane , in order that she , the Countess , and her daughter may have the full enjoyment of the property . To attain this end she seeks the assistance of M. Chantabel . The shrewd , sound-hearted advocate , however , sees through her , and he also discovers that her rights in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Countess seeks other advice , and takes other measures . M. Chantabel has an ambitious wife and a good son Henri , and to please the former he buys a little land contiguous to his country residence , on which land is an old turreted chateau , called the Tower of Percemont , and this he gives to his son . The connection of the tower with the story is of the slenderest kind . A nephew of M. Chantabel named Jacques , a handsome , good-hearted fellow , sees Mile . de Nives while she is a novice , falls in love with her , and succeeds in contriving her escape , she , however , not yet being in love with him . He takes her to his house , near that of M. Chantabel , and leaves her there under the protection of his sister Miette , he retiring for French proprieties to another residence , a farmhouse which he owns . This sister Miette is loved by and loves Henri Chantabel , but there has a coolness grown up between them . The motive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , to counteract the plans of the Countess de Nives , and to save the daughter of the latter from her mother 's evil influence . The story is almost altogether one of character . Of adventure there is only enough to give movement and incident sufficient for interest , and of society // scenes there are few . NE . Chantabel reveals himself in a very simple , naif way as he tells the experience of others and his experience with them . He is a kind of man much more common in France than in England or in America , or , we fancy , in any other country at the present day  --  a man who is reserved , not from hauteur , or shyness , or preoccupation , or any other kind of egoism , but partly from a habit of observing and studying others , and partly from a deliberate self-restraint ; a man of great knowledge of the world , but of genial temper , and notwithstanding his reserve , of really open heart ; an affectionate man , and yet one authoritative with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet able to snub such a vulgar countess as Mine . de Kives ; a sedate man , and yet with a fine appreciation of humor . There were such men in England and in this country a hundred or seventy-five years ago , but now they are very rare ; the rush of the modern world has swept them out of existence , or left only a few of them circulating in the quiet little eddies of life . In France , owing to different social conditions , to the strong family organization , and to the immobility of the large rural population , such changes have not taken place so rapidly as with the Anglo-Saxon peoples , and men of M. Chantabel 's type , and others which have become foreign or ebsolete with us , still survive . His wife is a not uncommon character even with ns : a weak , loving , vain woman , who worships her husband , and dotes on her son , and who yet is imposed upon by the title and the fuss of such a person as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foible of her sex , social ambition , and wishes to take airs because of the old chateau of Percemoat ; but her husband makes fun of her aristocratic pretensions good-naturedly , and she has so much deference for him that she submits . The most striking personage in the story is MIle . de Nives , whose character is quite out of the common , and indeed seems to us to pass the bounds of nature . She has an independence which seems to be born neither of will nor of passion , but from a simple disregard of all self-restraint and of an unconsciousness of sex . She does what she pleases , just as if she were a girl of seven or eight years old , with a brain and body of eighteen or twenty . She acc opts Jacques 's aid in eloping , and goes off with him with perfect sang froid , and yet seems quite unconscious that she has laid herself under any obligations to him as a man , or assumed any relations to him as a woman ; and when he kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet afterward , when she is suddenly placed in a position in which she is asked to name her accepted lover , she point.s him out as coolly as if he were a new bonnet that she had chosen-perhaps far more so . In fact , she is a young woman fit for marriage , and yet totally without the feminine instinct . There may possibly have been such women , or such a woman ; but , thank heaven , they are so exceedingly rare as to make Marie do Nives , with all her beauty and intelligence , seem monstrous , and almost to justify her stepmother 's pretence that she is insane . THE number of special dictionaries which has appeared of late years is one of the characteristic literary features of the times . Among these dictionaries none have received a heartier welcome than Fleming 's " Vocabulary of Philosophy , " which was first published twenty years ago . It supplied a great need of the student of philosophy and of the intelligent reader of the higher literature . But it was imperfect , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its errors corrected in two subsequent editions , the last of which appeared after the death of the author , under the editorial care of Prof. Calderwood of the University of Edinburgh . There still remained much to be added to make a really complete work of reference upon the vocabulary of philosophy , and the task left unfinished by Fleming was undertaken and has been ably performed by Prof. Krauth of the University of Pennsylvania , in a volume now before us. * This comprehensive volume includes Fleming 's Vocabulary , of which it gives all the matter ( corrections excepted ) of all the editions , and it is supplemented by Prof. Krauth 's own " Vocabulary o* the * " A Vocabulary of the Philosophical Sciences . " By Cn*mmu*s P. KaAtrrn. lCmo , pp. 1,044 . New York : Sheldon &amp; Company . // Philosophical Sciences , " a work almost as large as Fleming 's . The book as it now stands is as nearly as possible complete . Notwithstanding its being the work of two authors , it has perfect unity of plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of the two vocabularies . This may make occasion for two references . What is not found in one vocabulary must be sought in the other . It would have been convenient for the student to unite the two in one alphabetic succession of terms ; but this , from a literary point of view , was impossible . Dr. Krauth has indeed-edited Fleming ; but his own matter could not have been mixed with Fleming 's without losing its individuality , a sacrifice hardly to be expected . Among the important peculiarities of the work-peculiar as compared with Fleming's-are the increased number of the illustrations of ancient philosophy , which , as the editorauthor justly says , are the basis of all real thinking , and the additions made to the terms of medkeval philosophy . In Dr. Krauth 's part of the volume the most important distinctive terms of the German philosophy are given in Germilan . This supplies the most noticeable deficiency of Fleming 's work  --  a deficiency of great moment considering the position which the Germans now hold in all departments of philosophical inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a mere index , but almost a critical and biographical catalogue of philosophical literature . By consulting this the student may see at a glance what subjects each of the great philosophical writers of past and present time has treated . Another merit of Dr. Krauth 's work is its objectivity , or , as it might be called , its impartiality . It does not undertake to impeach or to defend any system , however bad or good in the judgment of the author or of any other writer upon the same subject . It merely gives impartial information upon all systems . This is what the student needs in a book of reference of this kind ; and Dr. Krauth is to be congratulated , both upon his plan and upon its successful execution . Very copious information is given upon many subjects , notwithstanding the vocabularic character of the work . Among the articles which are remarkable in this respect we mdi cate that on " Soul . " Here we have eleven full pages , which present the conceptioris of the soul as they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English philosophers of the day . This one article , which fills eleven pages , presents the results of researches through the whole field of philosophical literature , and is worth to the student , or to any intelligent reader who is interested in its most important subject , the price of the whole book , which can not fail to take a place as an indispensable work of reference in philosophy . WE have had the literature of gush ; now we have the literature of sw-ash . The present year has been distinguished by the appearance and the enormous success of a class of books in which drivel has attained a perfection and a consideration which is sufficiently puzzling to thinking people . " Helen 's Babies " and other people 's babies , " That Husband of Mine , " and that uncle and that aunt , and people 's granduncles and grandaunts , and " They All Do It , " and what they all do n't do , are made the subjects of books , of volumes which it would seem could only be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number of copiesin two cases more than one hundred thousand-of these books which have been sold seems to be a depressing fact in the literary history of the time . But in truth it really shows only that a new class of readers has come into the market for the supply of its " intellectual " needs . The demand for good books will not diminish . These books are provided for those who otherwise would not read at all . And it would be better if their buyerswere incapable of reading . MRS . ELIZABETH STUART PHELPs 's new novel , " Avis , " i ' is the story of a woman with a " career . " As a study of womanhood it is unnatural and not attractive ; as a readable , 8ellable book it is , like her other efforts , an undoubted success . The scene is laid in a college town , Harmouth , and Avis is an artistic , unpractical genius , the daughter of an absent * " The Story of Avis .

Even then Avis ( the luckless combination of her learned papa and the mother bird ) sought to cheer the dying eyes with a little picture , and shivering in her night gown called attention to the color in the east . " Oh , mamma , the wing ! See the wing the sun has made upon the sky ! It looks as if it meant to wrap us , wrap us , wrap us in . " The sole stay of the lonely home after this was the Professor 's sister , " a homeless widow of excellent Vermont intentions , and high ideals in cup cake , " who is ridiculed in a quiet way throughout the tale ; but we really have a great respect and liking for the sensible , patient relative , and do not see how the household machinery could have moved at all without her efficient assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trying person to educate or live with , but at sixteen an illuminated , " a phosphorescent " hour caine to Avis , perched in the highest , direst branch of the highest tree in all the orchard . She sat there , that perfect morning in June , with a blue and gold copy of " Aurora Leigh " for " fibrine , " and solved the problem of her life . Three years after she went abroad with friends to study art , and remained seven years , working hard in a little attic studio all alone , treading " the mazes of Florentine life with an innocent rapture , which protected her like a shining veil . " Only one event occurred worth chronicling . Once , when rising from her knees at vespers in the Madeleine , she found herself arrested by a pair of eyes fastened upon her in the twilight , across the nave . She saw in a flash it was the face of a fellow countryman , and a remarkable face , set in a nimbus of bright hair , worn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor concealed the outline of the mouth ; but the black eyes were concentrated upon her like a burning glass . At this admiring stare from the amber god she felt a great tidal wave of color sweep across her face . This is the first meeting of the heroine with her hero . The second occurs after her return to ilarmouth , where she finds him installed as tutor . Mr. Ostrander found that the Sybil of the Madeleine must absolutely be sought . She did not join his German class , so he gained an inVitation to tea from the aunt . " After tea Avis went to her accustomed scat upon a low cricket at her father 's feet ; and sitting in the full firelight , with bent head , read the psalm for evening prayers . A beautiful womanliness was upon her . She seemed to be wrapped in it like a Naiad in a silver shell . " Then he shrewdly proposed that she should paint his picture for his mother ( a neglected party , used as a peg to hang an excuse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they marry , although it was a long struggle . Avis was wedded to art . Love was to her " like Death . " She resisted marriage because of " its consequences . " She told her lover , " I had rather not be happy than to be happy at such a cost as marriage demands of women . " At last he conquered , and " blindly , like the bird to the light-house , " she went to his waiting arms . That is , they were engaged . Another long struggle ; then she said , " If I am ever to become your wife , let it all be over with as soon as possible " ; and they were married in three weeks . The practical part devolved upon Aunt Chloe as usual . Avis painted her china exquisitely , a different feather on every piece , and would have pink doyleys . And her aunt , . always sensible , was troubled . " Mr. Ostrander may dine off painted feathers for a while , but he 's too literary to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they eat as those who think their brains the biggest part of them . And poor Avis knows no more what is before her than if she were keeping house with little stones and broken crockery in a huckleberry pasture on a Saturday afternoon . " For a time the man was so blessed , so blinded with love that all went well . First the drain got out of order , then unexpected company came to dinner , then a baby appeared for which she felt no maternal affection- " not a bit " - it was , simply*a disagreeable " consequence , " and the studio had to be neglected . One morning her husband , sitting witli disturbed face at a disorderly table , complained that the cracked wheat was soggy again , the cream was sour , the steak // cold , the coffee vile . That ; caused their first quarrel , the rift within the lute , and the aunt proved a true prophet . The incompatibility is well described . Avis tried her best to please her showy , selfish husband , and our sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eireumstanees , and her struggles with family cares and her disappointment in her Norse god are piteous . He expeeted a good meal three times a day , and she had not dreamed that the ardor of the honeymoon would ever be less . " With a terror for which I do not feel at liberty to find speech or language , Avis watched departing love shake the slow dust of his feet against her young life . With a dread which shook to the roots of belief , she perceived that her own slighted tenderness had begun to chill . " The painting as well as the cooking went on under difficulties . " Aspiration had emaciated during her married life " ; her husband had grown thinner too ! The children , whom she had learned to love though they were burdensome , had a way of using her palette for a cricket , injurious alike to colors and clothes , and on one occasion the boy tried ingeniously to cut his throat with the palette knife , while the baby was endeavoring to swallow the tube of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God had given her this talent in a mood of awful , infinite irony . She wished she were like other women-content to stitch and sing  --  to sweep and smile . She bowed her face on the soft hair of her children , but she could not forget that they had been bought with a great price . She thought of the husband whose love she had mislaid , and counted the cost of her marriage in the blood of her soul . And when her husband died and she could return to her profession , the power to create and charm had gone , but she had her little daughter to love and to train so that she might not repeat her sufferings . At the elose Miss Phelps gives her idea of the model man and woman . Perhaps they may figure in her next novel . Like one of the characters in this story , " she changes the accent of her thoughts as they pursue her , " and is therefore anything but a safe guide . Her influence is dangerous when she urges young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , to leave off giving tasteful tonehes to the old homestead and go out into the world . If the old parents fail to see the wisdom of such a course , let them grieve and go down to the grave without understanding the new day which has now dawned . And it is cruel as well as injudicious to advise girls to write when the public is nearly nauseated with feeble poems and weak novels already , and there is so much earnest work to be done at home by these ambitious tyros . She almost quarrels with her Creator ; it is an unequal contest at least , whatever we may think of its propriety . She says in this last volume , " God may have been in a just mood , but He was not in a merciful one , when knowing that they were to be in the same world with men , lie made women .

" The motif and moral of the story may be taken differently by different translators . The idea that a woman must be a failure in a home if she has a decided talent for art or literature is a gross libel . If Miss Phelps wishes to indicate the entire unfitness of a girl for matrimony who resists it , prefers her profession , considers her engagement ring a fetter , abhors the " consequences " of marriage , and would rather retouch the sphinx in her studio than pet her babies , we for once heartily a0ree with hei ' .

From " Nursery Training " to " Old Age " Miss Yonge has a chapter full of the duties of each decade ; no sparkle , no eloquence , but a deal of truth and wise suggestion . She has a wholesome horror of flirtation , false hair , mock jewelry , and boarding schools . She says : " Silly , vacant women are , it is true , sometimes preferred by men , and obtain their affections ; but what a fearful charge it is for a woman to have a man 's heart given her , " To which most of the inferior creatures would respond that it was mich more fearful not to be called to take such charge !

This is her own verdict in strong Saxon , as was her wont , but full of sense . Alluding to Dora 's grandparents , she says : " The most perfect old couple . They look good as angels . No hoarding school in the land can take the place of such influence as comes from people like them , and her father was an idiot to separate them . I shall tell him so too . People never can let well enough alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be accurately counted . Fox twenty years T. Starr King* enjoyed a continental reputation , as well known and appreciated in San Francisco as in Boston , and wherever he addressed an audience crowds from all the surrounding country flocked to hear him . Had a tabernacle been reared for his use , he would have attracted as many hearers as Mr. Moody . As a preacher , lecturer , and reformer , no orator was more popular or more persuasive . His first public address was delivered at Medford , Massachusetts , on the 4th of July , 1845 , when he was but twenty-one years of age , and he preached his first sermon at Woburn in the autumn of the same year . Boyish as he was in appearance , he at once became noted as a preacher of pe* " Christianity and Humanity . " A series of sermons by THOISAS STARR KING . Edited , with a Memoir , by Edwin P.

Chapin was his immediate predecessor , but it was the same pulpit which his father had filled , and although loved and successful , he felt there was a certain incongruity in his position there . " I preach , " he said , " to mature and aged men and women who have seen me as a boy in my father 's pew , and who can hardly conceive of me as a grown man . I necessarily can not command in that pulpit the influence which a stranger would wield , and it is best for them that I vacate the office . " The least clerical , in the formal sense of the word , of human beings , his inborn joyousness of temperament burst forth in all the social meetings of the society , which probably made certain staid people shake their heads at his display of animal spirits . " But in the pulpit , by the beds of the sick and dying , in all the scenes which test a minister 's helpful sympathy with grief , suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tenderly serious . In his articles in the Universalist Quarterly , ' and in his lecture on Goethe , he exhibited a seriousness the only fault of which was that it seemed to be beyond his years ; but in ordinary intercourse with his parishioners he recognized no distinction between clergyman and layman , and never put on gravity when there was no gravity in the occasion . " Declining many flattering invitations , Mr. King accepted the call of the ilollis street church in Boston , a Unitarian congregation , which could number among former pastors such men as Mather , Byles , Horace Holly , and John Pierpont . When the anti-slavery reform occupied the public attention , he became an ardent reformer and a violent politician . Every breeze that rocked the old cradle of liberty filled his sails . He had a great work on his hands , to drive dogma from the pulpit , falsehood from the press , and slavery from the Constitution . In all these assaults he led the van . His church , which had for a long time been distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally were disturbed by his fearless , ardent sermons on the free soil movement , the fugitive slave law , and the Dred Scott decision , but // they so loved and needed him as a pastor , that they agreed to differ on these themes , understanding that his intense sympathy with suffering and hatred of injustice led him to speak so strongly , and nothing was further from his main purpose than to criticise political parties from his pulpit . As a natural consequence of his power and popularity , he was constantly receiving calls to other churches . Indeed , from the time of the second year of his ministry to the day of his death , he may be said to have had constantly in his pockets tempting invitations from all parts of the country to leave the society he so faithfully served . At last he was convinced that it was his duty to undertake the charge of the depressed church at San Francisco which so earnestly begged him to help them . The members of his own church could not consent to part with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. E. P. Whipple , who has had the charge of editing his sermons , and has prefaced them with a memoir in his happiest style , wrote at the time of this parting to a Boston paper , endeavoring to state the feelings of that large number of Mr. Kind 's friends who were not members of his society , while occasionally listening to his discourses . " They could point to a long service as a Christian minister , in which the pulpit had never been controlled by the pews , and in which the pews could never complain that any opinions , however unpalatable , had been tainted by acrid passions unbecoming a minister to feel . They could bear their testimony that he had always been bold and independent , and at the same time been free from the wilfulness and malignity into which boldness and independence are sometimes stung by opposition . They could appeal to thousands in proof of the assertion that though in charge of a large parish , and with a lecture parish which extended from Bangor to St. Louis , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , to be open to every demand of misfortune , tender to every pretension of weakness , responsive to every call of sympathy , and true to every obligation of friendship ; and they all indulge the hope that California , cordial as must be the welcome she extends to him , will still not be able to keep him long from Iviassachusetts . " These are grand , generous words , a noble tribute to a living friend , and show plainly how Mr. King was loved and appreciated . He preached his first sermon in San Francisco April 29 , 1860 , and at once became a power there in theology and politics , having no peer in the State . The breaking out of the rebellion called for intenser efforts , for more fiery oratory . He was young , fearless , zealous , and if need be denunciatory . Every sentence in his political addresses was a logical arrow tipped with fire . His career in California and his early death , caused no doubt by overtaxing that brilliant mind and sensitive organization , are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth this notice are selected from two hundred manuscripts , and probably exhibit his best modes in pulpit oratory . They are not controversial ; their object seems to be to inculcate Bible truths as he understood them . Many of them might have been written by the most bigoted of those clergymen whom he calls " orthodox . " In the sermon entitled " The Supremacy of Jesus " no reader would infer that the writer regarded Christ as a mere man . Other discourses inculcate not only the purest morality , but the most spiritual devotion ; all are thoughtful , earnest , and practical . All denominations may be profited by a careful reading of this volume , which will be so warmly welcomed by hosts of friends , by whom Mr. King is remembered with affection and reverence . IT is a relief to turn from the frothy inundation of summer reading to such a book as the third series of Froude 's " Short Studies on Great Subjects . " * Whatever may be the defects of Mr. Froude , he always commands , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful student . He is a positive , decided writer and a profound thinker , with opinions strongly biased by his prejudices ; an author whom you must follow or resist . Few are competent to criticise his works . His researches are beyond their studies , his theories peculiar , and enforced by unanswerable arguments . As an essayist he is more * " ShorC Studies or 6'reat S , lbject8 .

He illumines every topic he touches , and makes no assertion without presenting proofs . The " Revival of Romanism " is a valuable contribution to the ecclesiastical history of the times . Most men think that popery is declining . Many scorn its claims to universal erapire , as did Dr. Arnold , who said , " Believe in the Pope ? I should as soon believe in Jupiter . " But Froude demonstrates that Romanism is rapidly advancing in England and America . " Her clergy are energetic , bold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and churches with schools , colleges , convents , and monasteries . She has a literature of her own . Her political influence exacts and commands respect . " And : he asks eagerly , " Why is Protestantism standing still while Rome is advancing ? Why does Rome count her converts from among the evangelicals by tens , while she loses to them but here and there an exceptional and unirnportant unit ? Is it that science is creeping like the snake upon the ground , eatin* dust and bringing forth materialism , that the Catholic church , in spite of her errors , keeps alive the consciousness of our spiritual being , and the hope and expectation of immortality ? " " We may look down as much as we please on our grandfathers ' ideas , but their notions on some subjects were more rational than ours . It is better that a boy should learn to make a shoe excellently than to write bad exercises in half a dozen langua0es . The wider we make the area of superficial cultivation , the more we destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are condemning the generations which are to succeed to creative barrenness and intellectual incapacity . Our men of science are fast satisfying themselves at last that mankind are highly developed apes . This theory could find no hearing while religion and intellectual culture r ained their old dominion . The Gospel of St. John , the Antigone , or Hamlet , lie external altogether to the sphere of the ape 's activity . The achievements of the nineteenth century , of which it boasts as the final efilorescence of the human soul , lie a great deal nearer to our newly-recognized kindred . " The whole discussion of this subject is deeply interesting to every Protestant denomination and wide-awake thinkers of any creed . If Mr. Froude fails to look back with proper tenderness on his hairy ancestry , he is equally skeptical as to the purity of convent life , and his researches have deepened his distrust . The " Annals of an English Abbey " shows with startling distinctness the corruption and humbug . gery practised for ages at " St. Alban 's . " " As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant or animal , we can learn much , if not the whole of its character from a single specimen , so the career on a distinguished abbey , from its beginning to its end , can hardly fail to indicate what other abbeys are likely to be , if we are again to have them among us . Planted in the same soil of human life , surrounded by the same temptations , and nourished by the same influences , the idea will naturally develop in the same direction . " St. Alban 's was founded by a murderer to appease the remorseful anguish which haunted his day and made the night unbearable . Froude traces the career of the different abbots , verifying with quotations from the original Latin . Once in a while a really good man takes the position and is an honor to it ; but the genuine saint was race . The abbot " John of the Cell " was truly good , and his beautiful life and death are dwelt on with sincere satisfaction . Not so much can be said for Brother Pygon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbot 's sibnet and sealed it . " He was sent to expiate his sins by penance in a dependent priory . His allotted diet was mea*re . One night , to console himself , he secreted a pasty and a flagon of wine , and not daring to enjoy himself where he would be seen , he carried his spoils to the cloaca . There seated , he got drunk and fell asleep , and the night being cold , he was frozen to death . In his joviality he had trolled catches , which the frightened brothers conceived afterward to have come from a chorus of devils ; voices had been even heard shrieking , Catch him , Satan ! catch him , Satan ! ' " Mr. Froude is as merciless upon the Friars Mendicants as Chaucer himself , who so enjoyed giving a sly hit at their hypocrisy and sensuality : Thof he lours under him hode With semimlaunt quanta and mylde , // DECEMBEU , If thou him trust or dos him gode , By God , thou ert begyld . Of the nine articles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies . For six weeks Froude read Euripides by the sea , and was enchanted , as Aristotle and Goethe had been before him ; and " the Grecian world was raised from the dead into a moonlight visibility , with softest lights and shadows black as Erebus . " " The Last Days of the Roman Republic , " " Lucian , " and " Divus Cmsar " are the titles of the other three . Then comes a disquisition " On the Use of a Landed Gentry , " which institution he believes in , followed by an essay on " Party Politics , " expressing a dissatisfaction with Liberalism . The volume closes with " Leaves from a South African Journal , " written in a familiar style , a chatty record of his visit to South Africa in the summer of 1874 to study the workings of an English colony and decide whether the chances in after life of the waifs and strays that were overcrowding the great cities would be more favorable there . It is fresh , never having be*u printed before , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he saw . He speaks of " a thirty miles ' drive over roads as rough as Browning 's poetry , having been jostled into idiotey , and having three times fainted ( or very near it ) , from the continued odor of negroes and molasses . " And of a dining room " so stiff of aspect that the peit modern waiter seems subdued by the atmosphere of it into oldfashioned politeness . " After reading " Little . Dcrrit " he writes : " Dickens wine has an excellent flavor , but it is watered for present consumption , and I doubt it will keep . " He compares a tedious sermon he heard on board ship to the motion of a squirrel in a cage , " the repetition of a single idea , with scarcely a variation of words , without natural beginning and without natural end , and capable if necessary of going on for ever . " Those who know Froude only as a historian will find a very amusing and sparkling satire , " The Cat 's Pilgrimage , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion : " Every day I grow more convinced that colonial and all other political questions resolve themselves into one : what object do the ruling powers set before themselves ? Is it to produce a noble race of men , or is it to produce what they call wealth ? If they aim chiefly at the second , they will not have the first . Let wealth be the sublime end of our existence , and no new English nations will be born in the Cape or in Australia . England itself will be a huge grazing farm , managed on economical principles , and the people , however rich they may appear , will be steadily going down to what used to be called the devil . " In various reviews of this book by learned critics , great pains has cvi-. dently been taken to pick out here and there an error in spelling , carelessness in looking over proofs , etc. , and the article on Euripides is said to be hastily written . It may be so ; Froude , like all other great writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is much more to admire than to condemn . THE timely publication of this little book will delight ninny amateurs who are struggling to learn by themselves the art of decorating porcelain . It is designed as a guide to all , whether they understand painting of any kind or not , and the directions seem as clear and comprehensible as it is possible to make them . Books of this class are so apt to take it for granted that every one is acquainted with the minor details of the art they describe , that it is refreshing to see ' one that is worded so that all can read it understandingly . Those who already understand the use of either oil or water colors will find in this pamphlet all the instruction they can desire on china painting ; while to those who have not this advantage , it will be of interest and use , although no printed directions will supply the place of a hand practised in the use of a brush . In the introduction the writer says that some knowledge of drawing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of coloring , a fact which is too often forgotten by those who wish to adorn their homes with their own work . The author very wisely warns beginners , that although the ever convenient tracing paper may be used by a practised hand to ensure * " China Paintiaq : A Practical Manual for the use of Amateurs in the Decoration of Hard Porcelaiu . " By hi . Louisa hICLAUGHLm . Cincinnati : Robert Clark &amp; Co. // exactness , the novice will find it very difficult to preserve the outline so made . The book is divided into six chapters , the first of which is upon firing . This will be the most interesting of all to artists who are not so fortunate as to be ncar any place where their work can be properly baked . The author describes two ways in which painted china may be baked at home . She , however , says that neither of these methods is to be recommended except to those who find it impossible to have their firing done by a regular decorator . The next chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new colors which come in tubes , instead of the inconvenient powder which was formerly used for china painting . Considerable space is devoted to directions for mixing the colors . This will be most welcome to beginners , for unless the colors are " mixed with brains , " as Joshua Reynolds said , they are liable to change in the firing , and so surprise the aspiring artist on their return from the furnace by combinations of color which . he never designed . The remainder of the book is devoted to directions for applying the color : first in flower paintin , , , then in landscapes , heads , and monograms . What makes the entire contents the more interesting is , that it is the result of the author 's own experience , and so contains many little hints on the care of the colors , use of the brushes , etc. , which only an experimental knowledge of the art can give . As the materials are not very expensive-ten or twelve dollars giving the entire outfit  --  the publication of this little book will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art so well suited to the home , which gives such charming results with so little labor , ought to find many votaries among those who have leisure and taste . THE appearance of this book so near the holiday time will decide in many families the pending question of what present will please the boys . About fifty pages of printed matter , with the designs , make up the entire volume . The large * " A 3fanua* of Sorrento and Inlaid Work for Amateurs . " With Original Designs by AETHUII Ho*z Chicago : John Wilkinson . spaces and wide margins have made quite a sizable book of what might easily have been contained in a small pamphlet , a more suitable manual for a boy 's workshop . The first chapter describes a dozen kinds of wood , with remarks on each . The author neglects to warn the beginner that Spanish cedar , which he recommends , is very apt to split , and so can only be used for coarse work , and even then requires great care . In the chapter on saws he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have many defects and only one recommendation , their cheapness ; while the one he mentions last , that of the Sorrento Wood Carving Company , of which he has no cut , is the only one fit for fine work . Even the treadle saws which he recommends are not as appropriate to the finest work as the sorrento saw . The chapter on sandpaper is excellent , as in fact are all his remarks on finishing , and should be closely studied by amateurs , who are apt to neglect this important part of the work . Considerable space is occupied by minute directions on inlaying with various colored woods , an art not often understood ; also suggestions are made with regard to shading inlays , which makes them much more effective . Several patterns are given for fret sawing , most of them very sim plo . Then follow a few pages of silhouettes , which should have been distinctly credited to the artists from whom they were borrowed . Most of them are from Paul Konewka 's " Pictures in Black . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comical picture for each letter , but is far too difficult to be sawed out by any but the most accomplished workers in wood . An equally ingenious method is given of taking silhouette likenesses of a suitable size to be sawed . On the whole , this book has many good suggestions , but a cheaper edition would be better suited to the purpose for which it is designed , as the author says in the preface his " attempt has been to make everything clear , so that children can teach themselves , to show ladies how they can beautify their homes , to tell those with scant means how few tools are necessary .
