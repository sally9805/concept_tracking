And some but yesterday Kissed parting lips , then smiling dared to part , Trusting to-morrow , with its constant ray , Should light heart back to heart . .... But who is he ?  --  what door Is open now for him ?  --  What mother stands , Yearning to fold her wanderer safe once more From the world 's restless sands ? What faithful one beside Hope 's gentle watch-fire waits for Love 's new bliss ?  --  What children , playing in Time 's crawling tide , Hold lips for father 's kiss ? One silent passenger , In the quick press of eager tongue and brain ! Whither ? I know not , nor who waits him there . He travels on the train !

Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : HER DREAM OF LOSS . from Poems of house and home ( 1879 ) In a dark cavern is a frail flower sown , The orphan of a beam In some fair garden of the Sun . Alone , In darkness and in dream , It grows and gropes for the far light above , Whose sweet tradition old Haunts its pure-lifted face . An imaged dove Nestling , its wings doth fold In the blind flower 's white core . ... My heart I know That sunless flower to be . Oh ! dear lost face , Earth 's cavern far below Prisons my love for thee !

Yet there thou liest , though all the sweet Past lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trundle-bed ! Nest of delicious fancies , dreams that grow No more !  --  quick magic-car to Fairyland ! Ghosts walked the earth then ( in our garret too : For Madge , the housemaid , told us  --  and she knew ! ) In thee we saw them near , how near us , stand ! Stars then looked out of Heaven ; to Heaven , light Prayers clothed like angels from our lips arose , Though from the heart of her who bent so close , Hushing us like fixed flowers that feel the night . .... Fresh morn , poor little dreamers lost or dead , No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed . Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : NOONING AT THE HALF-WAY HOUSE . A BIRTHDAY . from Poems of house and home ( 1879 ) Here at the Half-way House , a one-hour 's guest , I see far back , in yon bright valley deep , A tender mother rock her child asleep In the warm cradle of her happy breast ; And , forward , where the path I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor know  --  In thick , blind mist , a house secure , but low , Where I shall rest to-night , and shall not heed The fierce , sharp tempest on the beaten wold Nor the close darkness . ...

Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : A SCATTERED FAMILY . from Poems of house and home ( 1879 ) We have been all together on the earth ; But now the band that bound our gentle sheaf Is loosed  --  the powerful magic bond of birth ; Our hearts no longer turn one golden leaf Each day ; no more , through every winter night , Brightening within though skies without may frown , We all are gathered close about one light , With loving wreaths the warm quick hours to crown : For the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , From the soul 's lips , to worldly language clear , Returns an alien answer to its sound , From other firesides , winter-lighted , borne .....

Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : THE LAND OF MEMORY . from Poems of house and home ( 1879 ) Deep in some far enchanted sunshine closed , ( We sigh and dream but pass forever on , ) Shines a fair Land . The glad young Morning there Comes up as rosily from the lighted East As over the green walls of Paradise ; There noonday gathers only blissful calm ; There twilight nestles , a still bird of Heaven , With purple wings o'er soft delicious vales . Oh , you may know the beauty of that Land By those that travel hither from its bounds  --  Through the cold faces , through the shapes malign That gather round us , through the dreary toils That bar us like a prison , lo ! they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no silent Land !  --  the joyous birds , That filled lost hours so full with singing , sing From sunlit bough to bough , shaking the leaves Among the dancing blossoms of the rain In sunshine , while the rainbow clings above ; And dear blithe brooks leap on , forever , laughing , Prattling their silver fancies everywhere , Like children lost whom all things know and love . Ah , ' t is no silent Land , for they are there , Kind words , there never dead , from voices kind , That feed the longing of the soul with love . Transplanted deep in that enchanted earth , Nothing grows old , leaves fall not , nor flowers die ; The plow of change goes over no old graves In the dear face and in the loving heart . O loveliest Land in all the sphere of Time !  --  Far green oasis girt by restless sand , Circling with barren sky our empty life , While with tired limbs and thirsty lips we yearn For its bright fountains glittering to our eyes , Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memory ! Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : BLUE SKY . from Poems of house and home ( 1879 ) When dreary rains have veiled the day For many darkling hours , Till birds forget their singing May And bees their honey-flowers : How quickens all the earth anew If , ' mong the clouds alone , A single break of happy blue By the dark heaven is shown ! " Blue sky ! blue sky ! " we cheerily cry ; Our pulses waken new ; Our hearts , uplifted , blithe and high , Sing , lark-like , in the blue ! Blue sky ! blue sky ! An open door , Though small , may hold the sun , And through it watchful Hope once more Sees her Bright Day begun ! OTHER POEMS .
