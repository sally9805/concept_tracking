txt Mr. CLINTON 'S proposed bill to amend the present State law relative to homicide and the plea of insanity , presents many points worthy of consideration . Some obvious objections will , no doubt , be brought against it . For example , to make killing perpetrated in the commission of a felony without design to effect death , murder in the second degree , punishable with imprisonment for life , will seem to many like extending a certain sort of indulgence to the vary worst and most dangerous class of criminals . Under such a provision , and with the help of a skillful advocate , the assassin of RoGzRs or of NATHAN might have escaped death  --  a result that would certainly not have met with public approval . To the professional house-breaker. imprisonment for any term has fewer terrors titan to any other criminal , , since he counts on his professional skill to get him out of jail as readily as it gets him into our houses . And if it be said . that the regular burglar , as a rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with nothing worse than imprisonment to fear , he might be oftener impelled. to violence . In that case , to determine from the fatal result the exact meas% Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . ure of responsibility in the fatal intention might tax the acuteness of our most intelligent juries . The objection , however , applies to our present law with even greater force . Again , in the sections relating to insane criminals , the wording is open to grave misconstruction . Therein it is enacted that a person Remitted of felony not capital , on the ground of insanity , shall be confined in a State lunatic asylum for as long a period as , if convicted , he might have been confined in a State prison , " and until it shall be proven in the manner now provided by law that the defendant has been restored to sanity . The defendant , " the section continues , " shall be confined in such lunatic asylum accordingly , and shall not be discharged or set at liberty before the expiration of the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can only mean that the defendant 's sanity shall not be passed . on at all until after the term of his commitment has expired . Suppose , then . the case of a person who , it sane , would be convicted of murder in the second . degree , or arson in the first degree  --  telonies not capital  --  who. shown to have been actually insane at the time of the , crime and the trial , is sent to al unatio asylum for life , as Mr. CLINTON 'S previous amendment permits , and becomes sane within a year , let iissay.after ; is so dreadful a punishment as the life-long imprisonment of a sane mau with the insane , for an irresponsible azt , compatible with modern notions of justice or mercy I Moreover , a strict construction of the act would seem to permit the anomaly of punishing the insane criminal leas severely for a capital than for a non-capital offense . It is presumed , of course , that the - word capital is used in its usual sense of punishable with death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital offense " shall be confined in a State lunatic asylum for not less than twenty or more than thirty years , and until proved . " &c.,; as before . Yet for the crime of arson , a non-capital felony , the insane criminal may be so confined for life . We point out these objections not because they are radical , but because they are sure to be made , and may prejudice the merits of what is. in the main , an excellent bill . Certainly some such measure must engage the early and serious attention of the Legislature . And when it does come to be discussed , there are some other suggestions which we should be glad to see well considered . First , every effort should be made so to amend the law as to secure the greatest pas - Bible promptness and certainty in the punishment of crime . These are the features Of justice , swiftness , and sureness , winch , much more than severity , impress and . deter the criminal . The law 's delays , however necessary and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If in a civilized community it were possible that every murderer should . be hanged red-handed , the hangman 's office would soon become a sinecure . Secondly , the present jury system should be closely inquired into , with a special view to the tests of qualification , the right of challenge , and . the wisdom of requiring , in all cases , a unanimous rather than a majority verdict . Third  --  and this seems to us to be of the utmost importance ? the question connected with the plea of insanity and the employment of medical experts should be carefully examined . It is impossible , of course , in the present state of our knowledge , to frame any absolute rules by which to ascertain infallibly the mental soundness or responsibility of the alleged ' criminal . Bat medico legal jurisprudence ought to be able to digest , from the ascertained facts of psychology , a more accurate and comprehensive standard of legal insanity than seems to be extant now . Some means certainly should be taken to avoid the scandal of conflicting experts retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion they are paid to give . If medical science , is any more than a name , this indecency should . be done away with . At any rate , justice can no longer suffer it . Why  --  instead of this doubtful partisan testimony , colored by interest and professional jealousy , wherein impartiality is next to impossibleNwhy should there not be a standing examining board of experts trained . to this very task  --  a sort of medical grand . jury  --  to which all cases of criminal insanity should be referred / Its members might be appointed by the State , or chosen by the Faculty and the Bar in concert , but they should embrace only the foremost names , and their decision should be final , subject only to appeaL Lastly , in regard to the treatment of insane criminals , a plan has already been suggested in the TIMES , which seems to meet some of the objections discernible in Mr. CLINTON 'S bill . This is to provide a House of Detention , something between a prison and an asylum , whereto such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on probation ; thence . when pronounced incurable . to go to the lunatic asylum ; or , if discovered to have been shamming , to the State Prison , and where even genuine cases , after recovery , should be detained long enough to insure against a relapse . The whole question is of the utmost gravity . and can not have too ranch thought . Every earnest effort toward its solution is welcome , and we trust to see it thoroughly agitated and discussed in the public prints and in private conversation , until from the attrition of the debate is struck the spark of light we need so much to find .
