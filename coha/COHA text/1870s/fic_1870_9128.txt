BOOKS . IT is easy to accuse books , and bad ones are easily found ; and the best are but records , and not the things recorded ; and certainly there is dilettanteism enough , and books that are merely neutral and do nothing for us . In Plato 's " Gorgias , " Socrates says : " The shipmaster walks in a modest garb near the sea , after bringing his passengers from gina or from Pontus , not thinking he has done anything extraordinary , and certainly knowing that his passengers are the same , and in no respect better than when he took them on board . " So is it with books , for the most part : they work no redemption in us . The bookseller might certainly know that his customers are in no respect better for the purchase and consumption of his wares . The volume is dear at a dollar ; and , after reading to weariness the lettered backs , we leave the shop with a sigh , and learn , as I did , without surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stocks of this kind as rubbish . But it is not less true that there are books which are of that importance in a man 's private experience , as to verify for him the fables of Cornelius Agrippa , of Michael Scott , or of the old Orpheus of Thrace ,  --  books which take rank in our life with parents and lovers and passionate experiences , so medicinal , so stringent , so revolutionary , so authoritative ,  --  books which are the work and the proof of faculties so comprehensive , so nearly equal to the world which they paint , that , though one shuts them with meaner ones , he feels his exclusion from them to accuse his way of living . Consider what you have in the smallest chosen library . A company of the wisest and wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil countries , in a thousand years , have set in best order the results of their learning and wisdom . The men themselves were hid and inaccessible , solitary , impatient of interruption , fenced by etiquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bosom friend is here written out in transparent words to us , the strangers of another age . We owe to books those general benefits which come from high intellectual action . Thus , I think , we often owe to them the perception of immortality . They impart sympathetic activity to the moral power . Go with mean people , and you think life is mean . Then read Plutarch , and the world is a proud place , peopled with men of positive quality , with heroes and demigods standing around us , who will not let us sleep . Then they address the imagination : only poetry inspires poetry . They become the organic culture of the time . College education is the reading of certain books which the common sense of all scholars agrees will represent the science already accumulated . If you know that ,  --  for instance , in geometry , if you have read Euclid and Laplace ,  --  your opinion has some value ; if you do not know these , you are not entitled to give any opinion on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the questions of intellect and morals , we ask if he is familiar with the books of Plato , where all his pert objections have once for all been disposed of . If not , he has no right to our time . Let him go and find himself answered there . Meantime the colleges , whilst they provide us with libraries , furnish no professor of books ; and , I think , no chair is so much wanted . In a library we are surrounded by many hundreds of dear friends , but they are imprisoned by an enchanter in these paper and leathern boxes ; and though they know us , and have been waiting two , ten , or twenty centuries for us ,  --  some of them ,  --  and are eager to give us a sign , and unbosom themselves , it is the law of their limbo that they must not speak until spoken to ; and as the enchanter has dressed them , like battalions of infantry , in coat and jacket of one cut , by the thousand and ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be computed by the arithmetical rule of Permutation and Combination ,  --  not a choice out of three caskets , but out of half a million caskets all alike . But it happens , in our experience , that in this lottery there are at least fifty or a hundred blanks to a prize . It seems , then , as if some charitable soul , after losing a great deal of time among the false books , and alighting upon a few true ones which made him happy and wise , would do a right act in naming those which have been bridges or ships to carry him safely over dark morasses and barren oceans , into the heart of sacred cities , into palaces and temples . This would be best done by those great masters of books who from time to time appear ,  --  the Fabricii , the Seldens , Magliabecchis , Scaligers , Mirandolas , Bayles , Johnsons , whose eyes sweep the whole horizon of learning . But private readers , reading purely for love of the book , would serve us by leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are books ; and it is practicable to read them , because they are so few . We look over with a sigh the monumental libraries of Paris , of the Vatican , and the British Museum . In 1858 , the number of printed books in the Imperial Library at Paris was estimated at eight hundred thousand volumes , with an annual increase of twelve thousand volumes ; so that the number of printed books extant to-day may easily exceed a million . It is easy to count the number of pages which a diligent man can read in a day , and the number of years which human life in favourable circumstances allows to reading ; and to demonstrate that , though he should read from dawn till dark , for sixty years , he must die in the first alcoves . But nothing can be more deceptive than this arithmetic , where none but a natural method is really pertinent . I visit occasionally the Cambridge Library , and I can seldom go there without renewing the conviction that the best of it all is already within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the catalogue brings me continually back to the few standard writers who are on every private shelf ; and to these it can afford only the most slight and casual additions . The crowds and centuries of books are only commentary and elucidation , echoes and weakeners of these few great voices of Time . The best rule of reading will be a method from Nature , and not a mechanical one of hours and pages . It holds each student to a pursuit of his native aim , instead of a desultory miscellany . Let him read what is proper to him , and not waste his memory on a crowd of mediocrities . As whole nations have derived their culture from a single book ,  --  as the Bible has been the literature as well as the religion of large portions of Europe ,  --  as Hafiz was the eminent genius of the Persians , Confucius of the Chinese , Cervantes of the Spaniards ; so , perhaps , the human mind would be a gainer , if all the secondary writers were lost ,  --  say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon ,  --  through the profounder study so drawn to those wonderful minds . With this pilot of his own genius , let the student read one , or let him read many , he will read advantageously . Dr Johnson said : " Whilst you stand deliberating which book your son shall read first , another boy has read both : read anything five hours a day , and you will soon be learned . " Nature is much our friend in this matter . Nature is always clarifying her water and her wine . No filtration can be so perfect . She does the same thing by books as by her gases and plants . There is always a selection in writers , and then a selection from the selection . In the first place , all books that get fairly into the vital air of the world were written by the successful class , by the affirming and advancing class , who utter what tens of thousands feel though they can not say . There has already been a scrutiny and choice from many hundreds of young pens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fugitive journal comes to your eye . All these are young adventurers , who produce their performance to the wise ear of Time , who sits and weighs , and , ten years hence , out of a million of pages reprints one . Again , it is judged , it is winnowed by all the winds of opinion , and what terrific selection has not passed on it before it can be reprinted after twenty years ,  --  and reprinted after a century !  --  it is as if Minos and Rhadamanthus had indorsed the writing . ' T is therefore an economy of time to read old and famed books . Nothing can be preserved which is not good ; and I know beforehand that Pindar , Martial , Terence , Galen , Kepler , Galileo , Bacon , Erasmus , More , will be superior to the average intellect . In contemporaries , it is not so easy to distinguish betwixt notoriety and fame . Be sure , then , to read no mean books . Shun the spawn of the press on the gossip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without asking , in the street and the train . Dr Johnson said , " he always went into stately shops ; " and good travellers stop at the best hotels ; for , though they cost more , they do not cost much more , and there is the good company and the best information . In like manner , the scholar knows that the famed books contain , first and last , the best thoughts and facts . Now and then , by rarest luck , in some foolish Grub Street is the gem we want . But in the best circles is the best information . If you should transfer the amount of your reading day by day from the newspaper to the standard authors  --  But who dare speak of such a thing ? The three practical rules , then , which I have to offer , are  --  I. Never read any book that is not a year old . 2 . Never read any but famed books . 3 . Never read any but what you like ; or , in Shakspeare 's phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In brief , sir , study what you most affect . " Montaigne says , " Books are a languid pleasure ; " but I find certain books vital and spermatic , not leaving the reader what he was : he shuts the book a richer man . I would never willingly read any others than such . And I will venture , at the risk of inditing a list of old primers and grammars , to count the few books which a superficial reader must thankfully use . Of the old Greek books , I think there are five which we can not spare : 1 . Homer , who in spite of Pope and all the learned uproar of centuries , has really the true fire , and is good for simple minds , is the true and adequate germ of Greece , and occupies that place as history which nothing can supply . It holds through all literature , that our best history is still poetry . It is so in Hebrew , in Sanskrit , and in Greek . English history is best known through Shakspeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scottish ballads !  --  the German , through the Nibelungenlied ,  --  the Spanish , through the Cid . Of Homer , George Chapman 's is the heroic translation , though the most literal prose version is the best of all . 2 . Herodotus , whose history contains inestimable anecdotes , which brought it with the learned into a sort of disesteem ; but in these days , when it is found that what is most memorable of history is a few anecdotes , and that we need not be alarmed though we should find it not dull , it is regaining credit . 3. schylus , the grandest of the three tragedians , who has given us under a thin veil the first plantation of Europe . The " Prometheus " is a poem of the like dignity and scope as the Book of Job , or the Norse Edda. 4 . Of Plato I hesitate to speak , lest there should be no end . You find in him that which you have already found in Homer , now ripened to thought ,  --  the poet converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Homer reached ; as if Homer were the youth , and Plato the finished man ; yet with no less security of bold and perfect song , when he cares to use it , and with some harpstrings fetched from a higher heaven . He contains the future , as he came out of the past . In Plato , you explore modern Europe in its causes and seed ,  --  all that in thought , which the history of Europe embodies or has yet to embody . The well-informed man finds himself anticipated . Plato is up with him too . Nothing has escaped him . Every new crop in the fertile harvest of reform , every fresh suggestion of modern humanity , is there . If the student wish to see both sides , and justice done to the man of the world , pitiless exposure of pedants , and the supremacy of truth and the religious sentiment , he shall be contented also . Why should not young men be educated on this book ? It would suffice for the tuition of the race ,  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is that which is so attractive to all men ,  --  the literature of aristocracy shall I call it ?  --  the picture of the best persons , sentiments , and manners , by the first master , in the best times ,  --  portraits of Pericles , Alcibiades , Crito , Prodicus , Protagoras , Anaxagoras , and Socrates , with the lovely background of the Athenian and suburban landscape . Or who can over-estimate the images with which Plato has enriched the minds of men , and which pass like bullion in the currency of all nations ? Read the " Phdo , " the " Protagoras , " the " Phdrus , " the " Timus , " the " Republic , " and the " Apology of Socrates . " 5 . Plutarch can not be spared from the smallest library ; first , because he is so readable , which is much ; then , that he is medicinal and invigorating . The lives of Cimon , Lycurgus , Alexander , Demosthenes , Phocion , Marcellus , and the rest , are what history has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and the opinion of the world is expressed in the innumerable cheap editions , which make it as accessible as a newspaper . But Plutarch 's " Morals " is less known , and seldom reprinted . Yet such a reader as I am writing to can as ill spare it as the " Lives . " He will read in it the essays " On the Dmon of Socrates , " " On Isis and Osiris , " " On Progress in Virtue , " " On Garrulity , " " On Love , " and thank anew the art of printing , and the cheerful domain of ancient thinking . Plutarch charms by the facility of his associations ; so that it signifies little where you open his book , you find yourself at the Olympian tables . His memory is like the Isthmian Games , where all that was excellent in Greece was assembled , and you are stimulated and recruited by lyric verses , by philosophic sentiments , by the forms and behaviour of heroes , by the worship of the gods , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariots , armour , sacred cups , and utensils of sacrifice . An inestimable trilogy of ancient social pictures are the three " Banquets " respectively of Plato , Xenophon , and Plutarch . Plutarch 's has the least approach to historical accuracy ; but the meeting of the Seven Wise Masters is a charming portraiture of ancient manners and discourse , and is as clear as the voice of a fife , and entertaining as a French novel . Xenophon 's delineation of Athenian manners is an accessory to Plato , and supplies traits of Socrates ; whilst Plato 's has merits of every kind ,  --  being a repertory of the wisdom of the ancients on the subject of love ,  --  a picture of a feast of wits , not less descriptive than Aristophanes ,  --  and , lastly , containing that ironical eulogy of Socrates which is the source from which all the portraits of that philosopher current in Europe have been drawn . Of course a certain outline should be obtained of Greek history , in which the important moments and persons can be rightly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one lacks stomach for Mr Grote 's voluminous annals , the old slight and popular summary of Goldsmith or of Gillies will serve . The valuable part is the age of Pericles and the next generation . And here we must read the " Clouds " of Aristophanes , and what more of that master we gain appetite for , to learn our way in the streets of Athens , and to know the tyranny of Aristophanes , requiring more genius and sometimes not less cruelty than belonged to the official commanders . Aristophanes is now very accessible , with much valuable commentary , through the labours of Mitchell and Cartwright . An excellent popular book is J. A. St John 's " Ancient Greece ; " the " Life and Letters " of Niebuhr , even more than his Lectures , furnish leading views ; and Winckelmann , a Greek born out of due time , has become essential to an intimate knowledge of the Attic genius . The secret of the recent histories in German and in English is the discovery , owed first to Wolff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period must be drawn from Demosthenes , especially from the business orations , and from the comic poets . If we come down a little by natural steps from the master to the disciples , we have , six or Proclus , Synesius , Jamblichus . Of Jamblichus the Emperor Julian said , " that he was posterior to Plato in time , not in genius . " Of Plotinus , we have eulogies by Porphyry and Longinus , and the favour of the Emperor Gallienus ,  --  indicating the respect he inspired among his contemporaries . If any one who had read with interest the " Isis and Osiris " of Plutarch should then read a chapter called " Providence , " by Synesius , translated into English by Thomas Taylor , he will find it one of the majestic remains of literature , and , like one walking in the noblest of temples , will conceive new gratitude to his fellow-men , and a new estimate of their nobility . The imaginative scholar will find few stimulants to his brain like these writers . He has entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods and demons and demoniacal men , of the " azonic " and the " aquatic gods , " demons with fulgid eyes , and all the rest of the Platonic rhetoric , exalted a little under the African sun , sail before his eyes . The acolyte has mounted the tripod over the cave at Delphi ; his heart dances , his sight is quickened . These guides speak of the gods with such depth and with such pictorial details , as if they had been bodily present at the Olympian feasts . The reader of these books makes new acquaintance with his own mind ; new regions of thought are opened . Jamblichus 's " Life of Pythagoras " works more directly on the will than the others ; since Pythagoras was eminently a practical person , the founder of a school of ascetics and socialists , a planter of colonies , and nowise a man of abstract studies alone . The respectable and sometimes excellent translations of Bohn 's Library have done for literature what railroads have done for internal intercourse . I do not hesitate to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , in translations . What is really best in any book is translatable ,  --  any real insight or broad human sentiment . Nay , I observe that , in our Bible , and other books of lofty moral tone , it seems easy and inevitable to render the rhythm and music of the original into phrases of equal melody . The Italians have a fling at translators ,  --  i traditori traduttori ; but I thank them . I rarely read any Latin , Greek , German , Italian , sometimes not a French book in the original , which I can procure in a good version . I like to be beholden to the great metropolitan English speech , the sea which receives tributaries from every region under heaven . I should as soon think of swimming across Charles River when I wish to go to Boston , as of reading all my books in originals , when I have them rendered for me in my mother-tongue . For history there is great choice of ways to bring the student through early Rome . If he can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the short English compends , some Goldsmith or Ferguson , should be used , that will place in the cycle the bright stars of Plutarch . The poet Horace is the eye of the Augustan age ; Tacitus , the wisest of historians ; and Martial will give him Roman manners  --  and some very bad ones  --  in the early days of the Empire : but Martial must be read , if read at all , in his own tongue . These will bring him to Gibbon , who will take him in charge , and convey him with abundant entertainment down  --  with notice of all remarkable objects on the way  --  through fourteen hundred years of time . He can not spare Gibbon , with his vast reading ,  --  with such wit and continuity of mind , that , though never profound , his book is one of the conveniences of civilisation , like the new railroad from ocean to ocean ,  --  and , I think , will be sure to send the reader to his " Memoirs of Himself , " and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Readings , " which will spur the laziest scholar to emulation of his prodigious performance . Now having our idler safe down as far as the fall of Constantinople in 1453 , he is in very good courses ; for here are trusty hands waiting for him . The cardinal facts of European history are soon learned . There is Dante 's poem , to open the Italian Republics of the Middle Age ; Dante 's " Vita Nuova , " to explain Dante and Beatrice ; and Boccaccio 's " Life of Dante , "  --  a great man to describe a greater . To help us , perhaps a volume or two of M. Sismondi 's " Italian Republics " will be as good as the entire sixteen . When we come to Michael Angelo , his Sonnets and Letters must be read , with his Life by Vasari , or , in our day , by Herman Grimm . For the Church , and the Feudal Institution , Mr Hallam 's " Middle Ages " will furnish , if superficial , yet readable and conceivable outlines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the useful Robertson , is still the key of the following age . Ximenes , Columbus , Loyola , Luther , Erasmus , Melanchthon , Francis I. , Henry VIII. , Elizabeth , and Henry IV . of France , are his contemporaries . It is a time of seeds and expansions , whereof our recent civilisation is the fruit . If now the relations of England to European affairs bring him to British ground , he is arrived at the very moment when modern history takes new proportions . He can look back for the legends and mythology to the " Younger Edda , " and the " Heimskringla " of Snorro Sturleson , to Mallet 's " Northern Antiquities , " to Ellis 's " Metrical Romances , " to Asser 's " Life of Alfred " and Venerable Bede , and to the researches of Sharon Turner and Palgrave . Hume will serve him for an intelligent guide , and in the Elizabethan era he is at the richest period of the English mind , with the chief men of action and of thought which that nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here he has Shakspeare , Spenser , Sidney , Raleigh , Bacon , Chapman , Jonson , Ford , Beaumont and Fletcher , Herbert , Donne , Herrick ; and Milton , Marvell , and Dryden , not long after . In reading history , he is to prefer the history of individuals . He will not repent the time he gives to Bacon ,  --  not if he read the " Advancement of Learning , " the " Essays , " the " Novum Organum , " the " History of Henry VII. , " and then all the " Letters " ( especially those to the Earl of Devonshire , explaining the Essex business ) , and all but his " Apophthegms . " The task is aided by the strong mutual light which these men shed on each other . Thus , the works of Ben Jonson are a sort of hoop to bind all these fine persons together , and to the land to which they belong . He has written verses to or on all his notable contemporaries ; and what with so many occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the gossiping record of his opinions in his conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden , he has really illustrated the England of his time , if not to the same extent , yet much in the same way , as Walter Scott has celebrated the persons and places of Scotland . Walton , Chapman , Herrick , and Sir Henry Wotton , write also to the times . Among the best books are certain Autobiographies : as , St Augustine 's Confessions ; Benvenuto Cellini 's Life ; Montaigne 's Essays ; Lord Herbert of Cherbury 's Memoirs ; Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz ; Rousseau 's Confessions ; Linnus 's Diary ; Gibbon 's , Hume 's , Franklin 's , Burns 's , Alfieri 's , Goethe 's , and Haydon 's Autobiographies . Another class of books closely allied to these , and of like interest , are those which may be called Table-Talks : of which the best are Saadi 's Gulistan ; Luther 's Table-Talk ; Aubrey 's Lives ; Spence 's Anecdotes ; Selden 's Table-Talk ; Boswell 's Life of Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Hazlitt 's Life of Northcote . There is a class whose value I should designate as Favourites : such as Froissart 's Chronicles ; Southey 's Chronicle of the Cid ; Cervantes ; Sully 's Memoirs ; Rabelais ; Montaigne ; Izaak Walton ; Evelyn ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Aubrey ; Sterne ; Horace Walpole ; Lord Clarendon ; Doctor Johnson ; Burke , shedding floods of light on his times ; Lamb ; Landor ; and De Quincey ;  --  a list , of course , that may easily be swelled , as dependent on individual caprice . Many men are as tender and irritable as lovers in reference to these predilections . Indeed , a man 's library is a sort of harem , and I observe that tender readers have a great pudency in showing their books to a stranger . The annals of bibliography afford many examples of the delirious extent to which book-fancying can go , when the legitimate delight in a book is transferred to a rare edition or to a manuscript . This mania reached its height about the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty-five guineas were given . In May 1812 , the library of the Duke of Roxburgh was sold . The sale lasted forty-two days ,  --  we abridge the story from Dibdin ,  --  and among the many curiosities was a copy of Boccaccio , published by Valdarfer , at Venice , in 1471 , the only perfect copy of this edition . Among the distinguished company which attended the sale were the Duke of Devonshire , Earl Spencer , and the Duke of Marlborough , then Marquis of Blandford . The bid stood at five hundred guineas . " A thousand guineas , " said Earl Spencer . " And ten , " added the Marquis . You might hear a pin drop . All eyes were bent on the bidders . Now they talked apart , now ate a biscuit ; now made a bid , but without the least thought of yielding one to the other . But to pass over some details ,  --  the contest proceeded until the Marquis said , " Two thousand pounds . " The Earl Spencer bethought him like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had paused a quarter of a minute , when Lord Althorp , with long steps , came to his side , as if to bring his father a fresh lance to renew the fight . Father and son whispered together , and Earl Spencer exclaimed , " Two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds ! " An electric shock went through the assembly . " And ten , " quietly added the Marquis . There ended the strife . Ere Evans let the hammer fall , he paused ; the ivory instrument swept the air ; the spectators stood dumb , when the hammer fell . The stroke of its fall sounded on the farthest shores of Italy . The tap of that hammer was heard in the libraries of Rome , Milan , and Venice . Boccaccio stirred in his sleep of five hundred years , and M. Van Praet groped in vain among the royal alcoves in Paris , to detect a copy of the famed Valdarfer Boccaccio . Another class I distinguish by the term Vocabularies . Burton 's " Anatomy of Melancholy " is a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dictionary . ' T is an inventory to remind us how many classes and species of facts exist , and , in observing into what strange and multiplex by-ways learning has strayed , to infer our opulence . Neither is a dictionary a bad book to read . There is no cant in it , no excess of explanation , and it is full of suggestion ,  --  the raw material of possible poems and histories . Nothing is wanting but a little shuffling , sorting , ligature , and cartilage . Out of a hundred examples , Cornelius Agrippa " On the Vanity of Arts and Sciences " is a specimen of that scribatiousness which grew to be the habit of the gluttonous readers of his time . Like the modern Germans , they read a literature while other mortals read a few books . They read voraciously , and must disburden themselves ; so they take any general topic , as , Melancholy , or Praise of Science , or Praise of Folly , and write and quote without method or end . Now and then out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Theophrastus , or Seneca , or Bothius , but no high method , no inspiring efflux . But one can not afford to read for a few sentences ; they are good only as strings of suggestive words . There is another class , more needful to the present age , because the currents of custom run now in another direction , and leave us dry on this side ;  --  I mean the Imaginative . A right metaphysics should do justice to the co-ordinate powers of Imagination , Insight , Understanding , and Will . Poetry , with its aids of Mythology and Romance , must be well allowed for an imaginative creature . Men are ever lapsing into a beggarly habit , wherein everything that is not ciphering  --  that is , which does not serve the tyrannical animal  --  is hustled out of sight . Our orators and writers are of the same poverty , and , in this rag-fair , neither the Imagination , the great awakening power , nor the Morals , creative of genius and of men , are addressed . But though orator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain . We must have symbols . The child asks you for a story , and is thankful for the poorest . It is not poor to him , but radiant with meaning . The man asks for a novel ,  --  that is , asks leave for a few hours to be a poet , and to paint things as they ought to be . The youth asks for a poem . The very dunces wish to go to the theatre . What private heavens can we not open , by yielding to all the suggestion of rich music ! We must have idolatries , mythologies ,  --  some swing and verge for the creative power lying coiled and cramped here , driving ardent natures to insanity and crime if it do not find vent . Without the great arts which speak to the sense of beauty , a man seems to me a poor , naked , shivering creature . These are his becoming draperies , which warm and adorn him . Whilst the prudential and economical tone of society starves the imagination , affronted Nature gets such indemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frolic the imagination finds . Everything else pins it down , and men flee for redress to Byron , Scott , Disraeli , Dumas , Sand , Balzac , Dickens , Thackeray , and Reade . Their education is neglected ; but the circulating-library and the theatre , as well as the trout-fishing , the Notch Mountains , the Adirondack country , the tour to Mont Blanc , to the White Hills , and the Ghauts , make such amends as they can . The imagination infuses a certain volatility and intoxication . It has a flute which sets the atoms of our frame in a dance , like planets ; and , once so liberated , the whole man reeling drunk to the music , they never quite subside to their old stony state . But what is the imagination ? Only an arm or weapon of the interior energy ; only the precursor of the reason . And books that treat the old pedantries of the world , our times , places , professions , customs , opinions , histories , with a certain freedom , and distribute things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after the laws of right reason , and with as daring a freedom as we use in dreams , put us on our feet again , enable us to form an original judgment of our duties , and suggest new thoughts for to-morrow . " Lucrezia Floriani , " " Le Pch de M. Antoine , " " Jeanne , " and " Consuelo , " of George Sand , are great steps from the novel of one termination , which we all read twenty years ago . Yet how far off from life and manners and motives the novel still is ! Life lies about us dumb ; the day , as we know it , has not yet found a tongue . These stories are to the plots of real life what the figures in " La Belle Assemble , " which represent the fashion of the month , are to portraits . But the novel will find the way to our interiors one day , and will not always be the novel of costume merely . I do not think it inoperative now . So much novel-reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubtless it gives some ideal dignity to the day . The young study noble behaviour ; and as the player in " Consuelo " insists that he and his colleagues on the boards have taught princes the fine etiquette and strokes of grace and dignity which they practise with so much effect in their villas and among their dependents , so I often see traces of the Scotch or the French novel in the courtesy and brilliancy of young midshipmen , collegians , and clerks . Indeed , when one observes how ill and ugly people make their loves and quarrels , t is pity they should not read novels a little more , to import the fine generosities , and the clear , firm conduct , which are as becoming in the unions and separations which love effects under shingle roofs as in palaces and among illustrious personages . In novels the most serious questions are beginning to be discussed . What made the popularity of " Jane Eyre , " but that a central question was answered in some sort ? The question there answered in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of the party . A person of commanding individualism will answer it as Rochester does ,  --  as Cleopatra , as Milton , as George Sand do ,  --  magnifying the exception into a rule , dwarfing the world into an exception . A person of less courage , that is , of less constitution , will answer as the heroine does ,  --  giving way to fate , to conventionalism , to the actual state and doings of men and women . For the most part , our novel-reading is a passion for results . We admire parks , and high-born beauties , and the homage of drawing-rooms , and parliaments . They make us sceptical , by giving prominence to wealth and social position . I remember when some peering eyes of boys discovered that the oranges hanging on the boughs of an orange-tree in a gay piazza were tied to the twigs by thread . I fear ' t is so with the novelist 's prosperities . Nature has a magic by which she fits the man to his fortunes , by making them the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that fortune there , and ties them rashly to his figures , to tickle the fancy of his readers with a cloying success , or scare them with shocks of tragedy . And so , on the whole , ' t is a juggle . We are cheated into laughter or wonder by feats which only oddly combine acts that we do every day . There is no new element , no power , no furtherance . ' T is only confectionery , not the raising of new corn . Great is the poverty of their inventions . She was beautiful , and he fell in love . Money , and killing , and the Wandering Jew , and persuading the lover that his mistress is betrothed to another ,  --  these are the main-springs : new names , but no new qualities in the men and women . Hence the vain endeavour to keep any bit of this fairy gold , which has rolled like a brook through our hands . A thousand thoughts awoke ; great rainbows seemed to span the sky ,  --  a morning among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a ray remains in the memory of evening . But this passion for romance , and this disappointment , show how much we need real elevations and pure poetry : that which shall show us , in morning and night , in stars and mountains , and in all the plight and circumstance of men , the analogons of our own thoughts , and a like impression made by a just book and by the face of Nature . If our times are sterile in genius , we must cheer us with books of rich and believing men who had atmosphere and amplitude about them . Every good fable , every mythology , every biography from a religious age , every passage of love , and even philosophy and science , when they proceed from an intellectual integrity , and are not detached and critical , have the imaginative element . The Greek fables , the Persian History ( Firdusi ) , the " Younger Edda " of the Scandinavians , the " Chronicle of the Cid , " the Poem of Dante , the Sonnets of Michael Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ford , and even the prose of Bacon and Milton ,  --  in our time , the Ode of Wordsworth , and the poems and the prose of Goethe , have this enlargement , and inspire hope and generous attempts . There is no room left ,  --  and yet I might as well not have begun as to leave out a class of books which are the best : I mean the Bibles of the world , or the sacred books of each nation , which express for each the supreme result of their experience . After the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures , which constitute the sacred books of Christendom , these are , the Desatir of the Persians , and the Zoroastrian Oracles ; the Vedas and Laws of Menu ; the Upanishads , the Vishnu Purana , the Bhagvat Geeta , of the Hindoos ; the books of the Buddhists ; the " Chinese Classic , " of four books , containing the wisdom of Confucius and Mencius . Also such other books as have acquired a semi-canonical authority in the world , as expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hermes Trismegistus , " pretending to be Egyptian remains ; the " Sentences " of Epictetus ; of Marcus Antoninus ; the " Vishnu Sarma " of the Hindoos ; the " Gulistan " of Saadi ; the " Imitation of Christ , " of Thomas Kempis ; and the " Thoughts " of Pascal . All these books are the majestic expressions of the universal conscience , and are more to our daily purpose than this year 's almanac or this day 's newspaper . But they are for the closet , and to be read on the bended knee . Their communications are not to be given or taken with the lips and the end of the tongue , but out of the glow of the cheek , and with the throbbing heart . Friendship should give and take , solitude and time brood and ripen , heroes absorb and enact them . They are not to be held by letters printed on a page , but are living characters translatable into every tongue and form of life . I read them on lichens and bark ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in birds , they creep in worms ; I detect them in laughter and blushes and eye-sparkles of men and women . These are Scriptures which the missionary might well carry over prairie , desert , and ocean , to Siberia , Japan , Timbuctoo . Yet he will find that the spirit which is in them journeys faster than he , and greets him on his arrival ,  --  was there already long before him . The missionary must be carried by it , and find it there , or he goes in vain . Is there any geography in these things ? We call them Asiatic , we call them primeval ; but perhaps that is only optical ; for Nature is always equal to herself , and there are as good eyes and ears now in the planet as ever were . Only these ejaculations of the soul are uttered one or a few at a time , at long intervals , and it takes millenniums to make a Bible . These are a few of the books which the old and the later times have yielded us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In comparing the number of good books with the shortness of life , many might well be read by proxy , if we had good proxies ; and it would be well for sincere young men to borrow a hint from the French Institute and the British Association , and , as they divide the whole body into sections , each of which sits upon and reports of certain matters confided to it , so let each scholar associate himself to such persons as he can rely on , in a literary club , in which each shall undertake a single work or series for which he is qualified . For example , how attractive is the whole literature of the " Roman de la Rose , " the " Fabliaux , " and the gaie science of the French Troubadours ! Yet who in Boston has time for that ? But one of our company shall undertake it , shall study and master it , and shall report on it , as under oath ; shall give us the sincere result , as it lies in his mind , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall as honestly search , sift , and as truly report , on British mythology , the Round Table , the histories of Brut , Merlin , and Welsh poetry ; a third on the Saxon Chronicles , Robert of Gloucester , and William of Malmesbury ; a fourth , on Mysteries , Early Drama , " Gesta Romanorum , " Collier , and Dyce , and the Camden Society . Each shall give us his grains of gold , after the washing ; and every other shall then decide whether this is a book indispensable to him also .
