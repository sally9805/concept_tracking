The Novel and its Future . THE NOVEL AND ITS FUTURE . ORIGINATING in the Greek romances of the fourth century , which were themselves the offspring of decline , the novel - this losel of literature and outcast of the wise - finds itself , after a long and adventurous career , at the head of all literary forms for present popularity and power . Called forth as a servant , to amuse some idle intellects , it has at length become the master , the instructor , the educator of vast modern audiences composed of thinking and progressive men . We must confess that , whatever our theoretic reverence for the drama , and whatever the triumphs it still achieves amongst us , the novel is still the more subtle , penetrative , and universal agent for the transmission of thought from poet to people . Ours is essentially a period of prose . Versification , it is true , is a widespread accomplishment in these days , and there are instances enough of genius making it more than an accomplishment . But , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strengthening of its empire , as to emphasize the truth that things most in vogue are most in danger of deterioration . As the quantity of verse increases , the merit has a tendency to subside to a common level . Instead of fountains of song bursting freely from the hill-sides , the nineteenth century maintains a large reservoir of liquid verse from which we may draw unlimitedly . The means of rhythmic expression are perhaps more varied and more perfect than at any previous epoch ; but they assist lyrical demonstration , for the most part , - dramatic , seldom . It is the dramatic forms , however , which give the most manifold delight . Dramas are the cathedrals of poetry ; the lyric verse is their adornment , rising in pinnacles . But we do not build cathedrals nor write great dramas . The novel , therefore , attracts to itself our chief energies . The novel is a portable drama , requir ing no stage , no actors , no lights or scenery , and no fixed time of enactment . Moreover , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects not fitted for the salient treatment of the playwright . It is , further , especially adapted to the various and complex inner life of the modern world . The very finest things of which the novel is now capable are rather calculated , in their delicate profundity , for private perusal than public recitation . There is a refined emanation from them which can be appreciated in silence and solitude only , or with but a chosen listener or two at hand to share the influence . But , if the vogue of verse be regarded as an intimation of impending decline , it will be asked why the multiplication of novels is not , in the same manner , to count for a sign of approaching decadence . That there is much danger of disaster to the novel is precisely what I should like to have most clearly understood ; but there are reasons favoring its immediate and efficient advance which either can not be supplied , or are not equally operative in the case of lyric poetry . In the first place it is an organism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially dramatic ; and in the second place the popular demand supplies it with an immense stimulus , while the lyric is sustained by smaller audiences and less frequent opportunities of devotion from its servants . The drama could alone compete successfully with the novel ; but to do so it must undergo reforms more weighty than those which are needful to the perfection of the novel . Let us , however , before attempting to cast the horoscope of the latter form , consider the technical differences of drama and novel more closely , with a view to determining their respective ad* vantages as artistic means . A convenient starting-point for the discussion is to be found in Goethe 's 1874. // utterance on the subject . In the fifth book of Wilhelm Meister , he observes : " The difference between these sorts of fiction lies not merely in their outward form ; not merely in the circumstance that the personages of the one are made to speak , while those of the other commonly have their history narrated for them . . . . But in the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drama it is characters and deeds . The novel must go slowly forward ; and the sentiments of the hero must , by some means or other , restrain the tendency of the whole to conclude . The drama , on the other hand , must hasten , and the character of the hero must press forward to the end : it does not restrain , but is restrained . The novel - hero must be passive ; at least he must not be active in a high degree : in the dramatic one we look for activity and deeds . " But this definition is certainly inadequate . In reality , it applies to the novel as practiced by Goethe and Rousseau , rather than to the stature of the novel altered and strengthened by recent developments in its history . it is patent that characters and deeds are as requisite in the modern dramatically organized novel , as sentiments and events ; and that they bear just the same relation to these as in the drama . We are far enough , also , from demanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of locomotion sustained in Wilhelm Meister with almost fatal indefatigableness . Compression and swiftness , on the contrary , are becoming marked characteristics of this species of composition . But it is important to observe Goethe 's fundamental distinction , - that of the novel-hero 's passivity ; for he is still at liberty to retain this attitude whenever it may advantage him . And herein lies a special superiority of the novel over drama , in that it is thus fitted to exhibit the hero as the recipient of impressions only , - concentrating in him the phantasmagoric elaboration of all surrounding life through his individual senses and perceptions ; while , at any moment , his position may be re September , versed , so that his views of things shall no longer predominate , a purely dramatic development being accorded to all alike . In this way a double order of effects lies open to the novelist . And it is from this source that the autobiographical novel derives a chief element of power ; the suppression of internal history in every one hut the first person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholly dramatic manner . The means to this end , in the drama , are the aside and the soliloquy . But people behind the footlights can not find an escape for every significant emotion of a moment in asides ; nor is facial expression always adequate to the occasion . Although of this latter resource it is only the intellectual effect which the novelist can convey , by those numerous brief , indescribable touches of intimation peculiar to his art ; and although he surrenders the inexhaustible charm of actual impersonation , still his mode is the more natural . As for the soliloquy , that is a delicate instrument which must be used with the utmost care , - like the chemist 's centigrade-weight , which he dares not lift with the fingers for fear of diminishing its accurate poise by the slight wear and moisture of manual contact . " And therefore , since I can not prove a lover , To entertain these fair , well-spoken days , I am determln*d to prove a villain " - I confess this jars upon me . This soliloquy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolsey , not only in poetical qualities hut in its dramatic value . The same sense of inconvenience and unlikelihood attaches to the revery with which Jago closes the first act of Othello . Apparently , when the soliloquy must set forth in direct terms the speaker 's motives to impending conduct , instead of dealing with widereaching speculations or emotions , it of necessity loses somewhat of its force . It would seem to be the sensitive organ in the constit*tion of a drama , in which the weaknesses of that order of composition manifest themselves most prompt ly . But even soliloquy becomes more The Novel and its Future . // probable and more acceptable when employed in the novel . For the narrator is an admitted entity from the start , and he enjoys the presumption of having either witnessed , or had faithfully described to him the circumstances of his story which he now gives in reproductive reminiscence . He does not require that we should believe in the instant preseuce of the persons and their personal responsibility for what they are saying , as the dramatist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in his work , the whole affair is professedly drawn from something already past , and is so represented ; while in the drama we must relinquish , for the time being , even a subdominant consciousness that the scenes before us bave been supplied by an already concluded episode of real life . But not only is the advantage greatly on the novelist 's side , when the soliloquy is in question : he is also in great measure relieved from the necessity of using it at all , because licensed to come forward in his own person , when occasion strongly demands direct explanation or enlightenment - an interruption which , for the reasons already mentioned in support of soliloquy , can not disturb us . The novelist 's prerogative of description , too , though unconscionably abused in general , is in many situations , if properly respected by him , a palpable advantage . And in the matter of construction a gain is made over the dramatist 's necessary restrictions in this particular , through the novelist 's greater liberty of interrupting and rearranging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its side , and hem , , addressed to the reader at short range , so that its finest effects need not be lost or slurred over , if delicate and unobtrusive , the novel seems to offer a form in which subjects too little abounding in far-flashing externalities , to find successful embodiment in an acting play , may still be subjected to thoroughly dramatic processes . Yet the prevalent opinions among too many novel-makers , as well as novelconsumers , in respect of what constitutes the dramatic , make it evident that this species of imaginative literature must clear itself of serious misconceptions , before it can proceed unimpeded in the direction of further improvement . An agitated notion seems generally to have gained ground - always reinforced , doubtless , by a benevolent forethought for those readers who choose their fiction from the book-stall mainly according to the broken and easy aspect of the pages - that the novel should be made above all things " conversational ; " and to this mistake , serenity , and the contained and forcible utterance characterizing genuine mastery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of displaying their characters than by talking , and may be treated objedively by other means than those of conversation . Nor is the determined use of the present tense , by which writers occasionally ( but too often ) attempt to heighten the " graphic " effect of their scenes , at all essential , or even in any way an enhancement . We must take cognizance of a new modification of the dramatic , exemplified in some of the later achievements in the novel form . The stage necessarily appeals more broadly to the senses , and , in these days of excessive and corruptive mechanical contrivance , the sensuous agency has so far diminished the importance or infected the fineness of the subject-matter , as to charge the term , theatrical , with a certain implication of reproach . Those novels , therefore , which are most completely wrought out in the conversational manner , or in such fashion as to make a transposition to the stage an easy process , are not always the most dramatic , using the word at its best and highest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so written . And these possess in common a love of stimulating , melodramatic incident , unfolded in rapid and intricate succession . Collins , in particular , is noted for his ingenious joiner-work , his elaborate and studied mechanism of incidents . The long " narratives** through which he conveys the same history , or different parts 18*4. 315 // of it , by different persons , have , it is true , some faint flavor of the dramatic , being based on that unfailing surprise which arises from the partial and conflicting views taken by different people in regard to one and the same transaction . But all the true glory of dramatic abstemiousness is lost in his execution . His detail is excessive , and his accumulation of small items often redundant . The skill of selection which he exercises never rises above the plane of simple cleverness . He has arrived at a useful formula for methodic enumeration , of which he uniformly avails himself ; displaying a surprising distrust of the reader 's imaginative ability , or power of apprehending minor points , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showy familiarity with the superficial aspects of human nature enables him to dazzle the reader , enough to con*ceal the fact that , for himself , he cares much more for his plot than for his persons . The latter are cut out to fit their places in the piece ; but their individuality in this way takes an artificial tone , and their narratives seem little more characteristic than affidavits in a police-trial - a kind of literature which we may suppose to have furnished Mr. Collins with a great part of his moiff In short , we possess in this noted sensationalist an inventor , not a discoverer . He is a literary artisan , rather than an artist . Dickens and Reade , on the other hand , though theatrical in manner , possess real genius , which might have carried them higher , had they carefully pruned it and thrown its strength always to the upward . Dickens differs from Reade , in being far less studied : he is also more crude . Reade is apparently a careful student of the stage , while Dickens relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Collins , on the whole , is superior to Reade in the slow worrying and final decapitation of a mystery - a thing which the latter does not always and especially affect . But , on the other hand , Reade has a swift and sunny sympathy which Collins lacks ; and his comparative openness in the matter of plot , leaves him free to September , develop incidents and characters together , by a series of stimulant surprises . His grand fund of spirits , and his quick sensibility to smiles or tears , are akin to attributes of the finest genius , and carry us on readily through all sorts of incongruities . But , once pausing or returning , to analyze the structure of his stuff , we find the conversation ( at its liveliest ) modeled on the rapid dialogues of brilliant comedy . Mabel Vane , in Peg Wofllngton , exclaims to Triplet , " And you a poet ! * ' " From an epitaph to an epic , madam , " he answers . Her very next words , " A painter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house front to an historical composition , ma'am . " At other times , as in Love me Little , Love me Long , and later novels , we find ' Reade lost in the mire of multitudinous commonplace , apparently trying to reproduce life beyond all possibility of mistake , by letting loose upon us a flood of indiscriminate gabble . Thus he seems to waver between the farcically inclined talk of the stage , and a deadly literalism . In general , his pictures are not so much drawn from life itself , as they are spirited transcripts from stage-manners in the guise of real ones , and always strencrthened by a considerable observation of real life , besides . But the novel has , by its history , assumed , and in this essay I have claimed , that it comes closer to real life than any antecedent form . By dropping into the stage-manner , however , the writer of a novel not only fails to draw nearer to life than before , but - what is still worse - separates himself from it by a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas-light of the theatre , so he kindles in his book a still fainter illumination , the reflection of a reflection . But , with all his brilliancy and energy , Reade disregards this , and plumes himself too openly upon his cleverness , obtruding the consciousness of his dexterity in the most ill-timed and annoying paragraphs of bold allusion to it . It can not be denied that people relish this knowingness , as they do the equally omnipresent ( though unspoken ) knowinguess of Dickens . Dickens 's characters enter The NoveZ and it Future . // the arena with a jingling of the clown 's cap and bells , as it were ; and the audience sees at once that they are about to perform . There is a suggestion of the End Man 's manner , in the way he has of opening a dialogue intended to be laughable . And ( to return to our other simile ) when the intervals of joking are over , we seem to hear the ring-master cracking his whip , as a signal for the serious and breathless business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . This is a figure only partially true , yet with a truth worth heeding . The public likes this , I have said : but it likes better things , as well . Yet there is an impartiality of omnivorousness , that it is not altogether desirable to sustain . We like to settle the respective merits of authors by the scale of avoirdupois . But , rather than magnitude , it is quality and radical tendency which we ought here to consider ; for on these rests the future of fiction . The more completely a novel remains a novel , the higher must it be rated , as being the more perfect representative of its class . Buiwer was both playwright and novelist , and he is conspicuous for the production of hybrids uniting the features of these two literary forms . His books are crowded with the stnlest stage devices . One has but to look through the conversations in My Novel , Buiwer 's most careful attempt at a reproduction of real life , to see how unshrinkin0ly he could dilute the pungent currents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap . Much of the dialogue is given in the same form as if written for the stage . But in attempting , at the same time , to remain true to the aspect of common life , the author has been oyercome by a disastrous inclination simply to imitate appearances ; and the double desire to do this , and to be effective in the style of the stage , has resulted in something at once deplorably dull and intolerably conventional . Mere transcription of facts , aspects , and phases , actually observed by the writer , is - we find it necessary , notwithstanding its self-evidence , once more to announce - neither 817 artistry , nor anything approaching it . On the other hand , conventionalisms , though they are sometimes very necessary , should never be relied on for mere effect 's sake , nor admitted at all unless they are genuine , thoughtful , brilliant , or forcible . Those which Bulwer introduces in My Novel and elsewhere are , it is true , pointed after a certain fashion : but they are whittled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems crystallized by the invisible chemistry of genius . And yet these things would , no doubt , pass off well enough upon the stage . But the little green hedge of the foot-lights separates two territories of fiction in which the qualifications to success are , it would seem , by no means identical . Buiwer ignored this fact . Whether we skim the prattling shallows of Pelham , or turn the creaking leaves of Eugene Aram , - that heavy piece of melodramatic machinery , - or examine the dialogue of the Lady of Lyons , we shall hardly fail to meet everywhere the same prolix paucity , although less prolix , of course , in the plays , than in the novels . A knack of proportioning ingredients enabled Bulwer to give his works a pleasant taste to the public ; but the critic , unfortunately , knows too well that they were prepared according to recipe . Lord Lytton may be said to have maintained a flourishing " cheap store " or popular emporium of readymade romance . His novels , like those of Anthony Trollope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks of the mold , still . The excessive activity of his invalid intellect never led him to a real originality . He searched for it on every side , imitating , in turn , Fielding , S terne , Walter Scott , and Goethe ; but had he possessed it , he would have learned this by simply looking within . Originality , it maybe observed here , has even more of sameness in it than of variety ; for this lies in the subject-matter , and that is fundamental . Variety and versatility do not , of course , conflict with originality , any more than sameness is always the ensign of it . But it is the abiding peculiarities of a man 's The Novel and its Future . // point of view ( when these are developed , not derived ) which make his writing original ; and these continue to give it that character , so long as he abstains from conscious exertion to repeat and renew such peculiarities . From a stable and enduring quality of view , springs style , including not only phraseology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise . Thackeray , George Eliot , Hawthorne , Baizac , Turg*nieff , possess distinct points of view , from which to contemplate the revolving world . Pausing at some standpoint of ideal perception , they let the varicty of life pass under their eyes , and translate its meanings into the new language of their new genius . Hence comes it that large poetic genius is at once radical and conservative : it can look into the roots of things , hut it also highly appreciates the value of calm , unchanging heights , upon which to build securely and live happily . Even when en0aged in works of deracination and reform , you can see that , in spite of its intelligence , it loves and clings to what is old . But Bulwer , and the other novelists of the theatrical group , almost wholly lack the distinction of style . Charles Reade is careless , and hardly more than a mannerist , even at his best . Wilkie Collins is lucid , without being concise ; simple , not so much from severity , as because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the mental scope he allows himself ; and devoid of any deep characteristics . Dickens , it may be urged , occupies an undeniably unique point of view . But his talent was even more accessory to his fame , than his genius . Talent is quick at catching a knack that will please the popular taste ; but originality measures the sense of this taste , and guides more than it is guided by it . Shall we say that Dickens did not appreciate what was most genuine in himself ; did not know in what proportion to combine with the more precious substance of his genius the common alloy of talent , to make it pass current , without debasing it ? At all events , the deficiency in style exists . Who does not recall that droll and at the same time almost pitiable method of lengthening out sentences , to suit the increased suspense of a situation ? To so many crowded and hurried emotions , we are allowed a corresponding number of clauses connected by colons , semicolons , and dashes , - like supplemental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors . At other times , we accompany the author through long paragraphs of vague and confused description , at his own verbose leisure ; and hardly do we find at any point the enhancement of a really beautiful , resonant , masterly verbal style , organically developed from the originality of his observation . Once let us recognize that this original observation is in great part superficial , taking the tinct rather of a brilliant whimsicality than of a profound and vigorous insight , and we shall see why his style is poor and arid . Balzac laid down the law , that the modern novelist must possess des opinions arr*tees : that , in our phrase , he must have " views . ' * I But nothing is more dangerous to the fiction - writer than views which are based upon prejudice . It is immaterial whether he supports himself with social tradition or common-sense , religious authority or unfettered theory : none of these will justify prejudice . These " views " should be the results of perfectly impartial observation of character , resembling somewhat the immovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the spheres and atmospheres . Yet they can not be altogether , like this , changeless . It is simply profound and sympathetic penetration into character which is demanded . From positive views otherwise founded than upon patient and placid insight , spring the swarms of pamphleteering tales which are the bane of the fictionist 's art in our time ; and , in the domain of more genuine creation , they lead to the narrowness and limitations of Jane Austen , Miss Edge worth , and Anthony 1 I translate so , because *topinion* , ** to us , would hardly convey what I take to have been Balzac ' ; meaning . // Trollope . It is true , we should suffer irreparable loss if obliged to surrender Miss Austen and Miss Edgeworth . The world can not afford to dispense with their pure and gentle feeling . What should we do , without the well-molded gelatinous " forms " of amiability , the excellent Potted Proprieties with which they have supplied us ? - wholesome confections which it is to be hoped may regale many a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that slow , sleepy spell which Trollope knows so well how to exercise , we can not but think that writers treating human nature in this way are like placerminers , who , it is granted , may extract every grain of gold from their field of operations , but only by working in superficial deposits . And , when all is done , the gold-b earing stratum has been sacrificed , washed away in the process : only the barren bed-rock remains to after-comers . These , truly , are the " novelists of manners , " for they never get below the crust of society . A change in manners makes occasion for a new writer of the same stamp ; and Anthony Trollope , in his generation , takes up the task of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth , in theirs . What is this remark of Dr. Johnson 's , about Fielding giving us characters of manners , and Richardson characters of nature ? It would be obviously unjust to Fielding , to place him with writers like Austen , Edgeworth , and Trollope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickens , predominantly men of impulse , give no evidence in their works of having apprehended the importance of " arrested opinions . " Dickens , indeed , went so far as to follow out certain unsettled , impetuous feelings , which he mistook for convictions ; and so became a propagator of prejudice ( though doubtless effecting a great deal of transient good ) . Reade , appreciating impartiality , and trying to avoid results of this kind , is content with treating mankind as an opportune and curious plaything for the amusement of himself and his reader . But in Victor Hugo we find an altogether singular writer , capable of genuine opinions arr*t*es , and yet abounding in vagaries , and indulging an unlimited taste for the sensational-picturesque , which compel us to call him theatrical and a mannerist . Here is an author of undeniable genius , a great romantic dramatist , a delicate lyrist , exceptionally noble in his aims , and comprehending the value of an objective treatment of character ; who at times delights us with simple and exquisite observation ; yet who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature in his effects , and is wholly extravagant in style . As far as improbability is concerned , it may be said that objections to it , are too often and easily urged in a way to imply that such a thing were quite inadmissible . But if probability were in all cases an indispensable condition of poetic achievement , we should have to condemu much that is obviously above reproach . Nevertheless , it seems certain that the sentiment of probability should never be violated . If the artist should succeed with his illusion , there would be much to justify his use of the improbable . Still , it can scarcely be defended , if it does not also commend itself to the second thought ; as it does in the case of Lady Macbeth , who has no children , but who nevertheless exclaims : " I have given suck ; and know How tender t Is to love the babe that milks me . " The truth seems to be , that improbability is a potent means to effect ; but when the effect obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation 's deepest truth , it becomes meretricious , and in degree as it is unessential . With such meretriciousness Victor Hugo seems fairly chargeable , in cases . The fire-cracker-like dialogues with which he emulates Dumas , and which so needlessly confuse us , at times , as to the succession of speakers ; the multiplication of short paragraphs , that are in some danger of becoming no paragraphs at all- being often reduced to a single word ; and his curious division of a novel into books and parts , with fresh titles and sub-titles as abundant as newspaper-headings , and chapters of // every length , from a single paragraph upwards - all this is the issue of an undue desire to impress . Perhaps it should in some measure be excused , because of its service to the author , in carrying the average reader through much that would otherwise appear to him outrageously wearisome . For it is Hugo 's plan to connect everything with infinity , on the shortest notice . To fly from the simplest fact into the far ether of abstract thought is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sharing in these aerial flights , he is obliged to wrap him in a magic cloak of invisibility , woven of sundry expansive and slightly windy phrases . He indites a chapter on a girl 's hand , and reaches the weighty conclusion that " ID&amp;uchette smiling was simply D&amp;uchette . " In another place , describing the nature of a battle , he proudly convinces us , after a series of the most self-evident statements , that " he who leaves the field , is beaten . " In fine , he wrestles with nothing , in these cases , as if it were a labor only to be ventured on by intellectual giants like himself ; and he comes out of the fight with an immense appearance of victory . Under its guise of pompous emptiness , however , this method conceals capabilities of vigorous surprise and pathetic brevity . Very majestic , to my thinking , is that conclusion of Les Travailleurs de la M*r : " Nothing was now visible but the sea . " But the defects of this method are more frequent than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to expand in mystic revery furnishes another example of philosophy injurin0 art ; in the same way that the inclination of George Eliot and Balzac toward philosophical parentheses and interspersed epigram fastens a clog on the dramatic movement of their stories . The novelist , it is true , may fulfill to some extent the functions of a chorus ; but lie should be very cautious in the fulfillment . Victor Hugo is guilty of " spouting . " He tries to magnify , and often to distort , the proportions of all that comes in his way ; but things sometimes refuse to be magnified , and leave him in rather a luck-September , less plight . The elasticity and eccentricity of his form he seeks to defend by a mere hyperbole . " This book , " he says , in Cosette , " is a drama , the first person of which is the Infinite . " " Man is the second . " But it is difficult to reci , ncile ourselves on these easy terms with his reckless practice of " painting up " each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , so that it may brave the glare of the combined exhibition . This whole question with which we are engaged , as to the grounds for discrimination between theatrical and dramatic novelist , culminates in Hugo 's character as a writer of fiction . To get a fresh view of so important a figure , let us subject him to a contrast . Quitting the atmosphere of his lurid spectacles , let us enter the sad-colored every-day world in which rare Thackeray moves . Hugo and Thackeray both indulge in ample comment ; but Thackeray 's moralizing only partially impedes dramatic action , while Hugo 's declamation is so interwoven with the story as to be almost beyond eluding , and is connected with a coarse and dazzling use of colors that reminds one of the scene-painter 's trick . In Thackcray there is no hint of effect for effect 's sake ; but Victor Hugo 's novels may be said almost to reek with it . An equally eloquent contrast is furnished by the romances of Hawthorne . " As the feeling with which we startle at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the preestablished moment , " runs Coleridge 's fine phrase , " such and so low is surprise as compared with expectation . " Now , it is the determined preference of this lower pleasure that distinguishes novelists of the theatrical class . Observe , as opposed to this , that in The Scarlet Letter the identity of the unknown sharer in Hester 's sin is clearly intimated in the opening scene , and the mind of the reader thus thrown forward , in an attitude of expectation , which the objective treatment pursued throu0hout the book is designed to assist . Such a The Novel and its Future . // master does not find any Jack-in-thebox surprise needful , to engage his audience . But Hawthorne stands in an atmosphere peculiar to himself . To distinguish him from Thackeray , by calling him an idealist , would entail misapprehension ; for no novelist possessing genuine insight can fail to be in some sort an idealist . His personal impressions , and keen , unswerving perceptions must enter into the substance of his creation ; idea will insensibly enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said , that Hawthorne 's idealism is exceptionally free from all turbidness . It might be conceived of as a clear and stainless , rounded and buoyant sphere , and capable of bearing us serenely through the most solemn and awful spaces . So far is this idealism from being opposed to that of the acknowledged realistic writers , as people are often inclined *o believe it , that we find Hawthorne 's realism to be careful , detailed , perfectly true , and perfectly finished . But so suffused is it with fine spirituality , that it does not yet gain popular recognition . Some quality is perhaps wanting in his realism , which would make it more acceptable to the public ; but Hawthorne , being engaged with the operation of spiritual laws , did not enter so industriously into descriptive realism as many others have done ; although , with a true delight in appearances , he used those particular realistic means which were apt to his purpose with a complete mastery . Let us consider the import of realism . It is , without doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of different authors its manifestations must , of course , vary greatly . One reason for its value is , that it supplies the visual distinctness which is one great charm of the stage . But the necessity for it is more radical . As the painter will study anatomy , in order to a better structural idea of the human form , so the novelist will investigate the functions of all those complicated impulses , emotions , and impressions which we experience from hour to hour , from 321 day to day , and by which our actions and characters are continually controlled , modified , or explained . With his investigation of psychological phenomena , or insight into the mysteries of spiritual being , he must unite the study of all that accompany these in the individual ; as corporeality , with that curious net-work of appearances , habits , opinions , in which each human person is enveloped . Of all eminently realistic novelists , Turg*nieff is , I imagine , the most vigorous , acute , and delicate . A little livelier play of fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . That he is capable of it , certain rare touches seem to indicate . Speaking of a dandy , in I ) imitri Roudine , he says. : " He tried to give himself airs , as if he were not a human being , but his own statue , erected by national subscription . " For freshness , airiness , and genial sarcasm , this equals the best flights of Dickens 's fancy . Balzac , as well as Turginieff , however , seems sometimes to fall below the level of completely artistic representation , simply from neglect of these more elastic motions of the mind . Balzac , in particular , is often too matter-of-fact , or too statistical in his statement of characters , situations , and appearances . It is important clearly to grasp the difference between realism and that which is merely literalism . I. Realism sets itself at work to consider characters and events which are apparently the most ordinary and uninteresting , in order to extract from these their full value and true meaning . It would apprehend in all particulars the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen and unseen of human nature . Beneath the deceptive cloak of outwardly uneventful days , it detects and endeavors to trace the outlines of the spirits that are hiddenr there ; to measure the changes in their growth , to watch the symptoms of moral decay or regeneration , to fathom their histories of passionate or intellectual problems . In short , realism reveals . Where we thought nothing worthy of notice , it shows everything to be rife The Novel and its Future . // with significance . It will easily be seen , therefore , that realism calls upon imag-. ination to exercise its highest function , which is the conception of things in their true relations . But a lucid and accurate statement of these relations , in so many words , does not meet the requirements of art . In certain portions of his work , Balzac seems to overlook this : he depends too much upon exact descriptions both of mental processes and physical appearances . He is too much the classifier . In his anxiety to be absolutely correct , he grafts upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He often describes houses with a topographical minuteness that ends by effacing from our minds any picture the ima* , ination had formed for itself , and leaving us without the ability to project a new one ; and this , when his object is simply to give us a perfect physical impression . It is plan-drawing , rather than the painting of a picture ; and this defect extends to his descriptions of persons . All description should be *imple , pictorial , and devoid of technicalities . Otherwise , one kind of literalism is entailed upon us . II . In this matter , Turg*nieff completely surpasses Balzac . But there is a subtler truth which no pictorial description and no abstract exposition will suffice to convey ; for the intimation of which , in fine , fancy alone is fitted . In apprehending this , Hawthorne is supreme . Dickens abounds in instances of fancy , grotesque , humorous , and pathetic ; but he is not so uniformly true as Hawthorne . George Eliot , too , sometimes employs it graccfully . But George Eliot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat excessive regard for the appearances of realness in and for itself , seen in their labored and frequently tiresome imitations of imperfect articulation . This , though undoubtedly a valuable auxiliary in some cases , is only occasionally essential to artistic representation . When carried too far , it makes the writer a copyist , an imitator , - merely a reporter of life . This sort of literalism is exemplified in September , still another way by the novels of Anthony Trollope , who accumulates irrelevancies with a persistence proving him to be for verisimilitude before all things . He will construct a long story out of atomic particles , making it as densely compact as a honey-comb - with the honey left out . He continually gives us , with the utmost gravity , the exact time to a minute , at which some one of his characters takes a train of cars , although this precision has no result in events . And an entire paragraph is consumed by the simple statement that two gentlemen went from the City to a London suburb , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came hither ; next , he repeats the declaration , adding that it was long since they had last done so ; after which , he goes back and describes their meeting in the street - giving the precise insignificant words which they exchanged ; and finally he crowns all with the triumphant announcement that they came home together ( as he at first said ) - this time explaining that they came by means of a cab . There is a certain fascination in all this : the natural man meets mediocrity half-way : but at bottom it is vicious . Trollope panders to an intellectual laziness which is , unfortunately , characteristic of novelreaders ; and his books are pervaded by an unhealthy languor . His observation of character is timid and superficial , though abundantly clever ; and his impartiality lapses into indifference , a dullness of sensibility . He has but one method of indicating a man 's affection for a woman : that is , by making him put his arm around her waist . In Trollope , then , we see how thoroughly demoralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prescribe any rules adequate to the various cases in which literalism may occur . But , in general terms , we may say that it is precipitated so soon as the iusthetic balance between idea and fact is , from whatever cause , at all unsettled . We have also seen that realism is assisted by fancy , and quick , pictorid language . So much being supplied concerning // the nature and requirements of realism , we are in a position to recognize the general community of aims in such masters as Hawthorne , George Eliot , Balzac , Thackeray , and Turg*nieff . All these are leaders in the best dramatic novel-writing , and their example opposes itself , by its very nature , to the practices of Hugo , Dickens , iReade , and Bulwer . Among themselves , they of course differ in respect of quality and degree of realism , and as to their feeling for pure beauty . We have seen the positive character of Hawthorne 's ideal tendency ; that of the rest is more negative . Again , they vary in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences are matters of vital consequence . Hawthorne , though thoroughly objective in his rendering , sustains throughout a resonant undertone of poetic revery ; Geor , e Eliot and Balzac mingle analytical discourse and philosophic suggestion with the action - the latter , however , being by far the less diffuse , and having an easy grace in analysis which our great Englishwoman lacks . Thackeray , in his turn , takes the part of a grumbling and evil-predicting chorus ; and Turg&amp; nieff claims little more than the right to introduce his persons , and tersely to explain the periods " supposed to have elapsed . " There is fair room for choice among these several modifications of method . If Baizac and Geor* , e Eliot make their books too much like treatises on human nature , anecdotically illustrated , it must still he said that their system is admirably adapted to bring men to a true appreciation of character and there is small chance of mistakinothe special truths which they wish to enforce in their " modern instances . " So that what is lost to art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct instruction of the human race , in the problems of character and circumstance it constantly has to encounter . But that there is a loss to art , we can not allow ourselves to forget . The highest dramatic skill would work upon us less directly : it would educate , instead of instructing us . By a gentle , if also searching sat-823 ire , by a sunny insistence upon the joy of living ( the joy of sadness , no less than that of gladness ) , and by the wise exercitation in us of noble emulation and noble pity , it would insensibly develop , and strengthen , and heal us . I think we are ready for something less medicinal than these magic potions - these bitter brews from sad experience , and deep , undeluded thought - with which the novelists , in these latter and greater days of their dynasty , have come to treat us . In regard to form , it seems that Turg*nieff 's example is likely to have the most general and far-reaching influence . His self-exclusion , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muscularity of apprehension in the reader nearly equal to that of his own style of presentation . It is sometimes too violent an exercise to read his books : they set every nerve quivering , hinting the agonies of a vivisection . Besides , he would seem to do himself injustice , in recounting such woful histories as those he chooses , without allowing a single note of hope or of convincing joy to redeem their horror . He is too keenly responsive to outward beauty , to wish the destruction of our faith in some corresponding and essential beauty pervading and including all things . Yet , poet as he is , he finds the world all too unpoetical . To hini , it is apparently not malleable in the fires of profound faith , but offers only fixed , enormous oppositions of loveliness and hideousness over which he will permit no veil of illusion to rest . There is truth in his picture ; but it seems to deny beauty , and incites to despair . Does it not , then , verge upon error ? In marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist and dramatist , Bjbrnsen , who , while as strictly dramatic in the form and movement of his stories as Turg*nieff , is an enthusiastic apostle of beauty , besides . It would be difficult to conceive of a more delicately inflected piece of dramatic recital , than his novelette called The Fisher Maiden . He has there given the history of an ingenuous , // healthy , highly imaginative girl , whose glowing impulses involve her in a curious inconsistency and faithlessness with a pair of lovers , and bring temporary disgrace upon her mother . But at last her imagination makes an escape into art , and she becomes an actress . In the prejudiced community she lives in , she can not do this without a struggle ; and the climax of the tale is in her ultimate triumph , and her engagement at a theatre in the capital . We enter the theatre , to witness her performance ; but the book closes with the rising of the curtain . How exquisite is this reticence , this reverence for his subject , that compels the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any of the garish splendors or excitements with which novelists are wont so copiously to supply us ! In general , they are only too willing to raise the curtain on all imaginable scenes , and to expose matters which should never be made the subject of spectacular interest ( although admissible enough when handled with morally sensitive art ) . Fiction has too frequently indulged in what deserves no better name than downright debauchery . The advances it has made toward temperance , purity , health , and beauty are indeed surprising ; but Bjornsen , with his sweet and simple histories , has suggested the possibility of still greater refinement . We already see the dawn of a new epoch . Christ 's thought , however slow to manifest itself firmly in the details of our social , political , and religious organization , has assuredly taken root in the novel . Pity and charity , love , or admiration for the poor , the common , the unfortunate , and the unrecognized nobility of the world , are what it is continually endeavoring to arouse and propagate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes was perhaps excessive ; but there was much truth in his probably much-needed and opportune exaggeration . Thackeray stimulates inferences , by exposing false pretensions , and dethroning the unduly reverenced . The tragic element of frequency which Geor , , e Eliot points out has , in fact , been already unconsciously accepted , and the moral value of the familiar seized by the artist . Our heroes and heroines are taken from the rank and file of the race , and represent people whom we daily encounter ; indeed , we shall easily find our very selves depicted , if we look frankly for such depicture . There is no escaping the thoughtful and elevating influence of this . Nor need there be any implication of littleness or dullness in these aims . The great circle of the horizon may draw its ring around whatever spot shall be chosen as the groundwork of a fiction , and the exact zenith hang above the heads of its personages . Far from lessening the force of personality in fictitious characters , this choice of the frequent is most favorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have once become aware of the great number of points in which human beings are nearly identical ; of the real coincidence of great people and little people , in minute traits no less than in fundamental characteristics ; when , in fine , we perceive the incredible resemblances of men ; then we shall best be able justly to estimate their equally astounding differences . The level of humanity is like that of the ocean ; but each constituent particle rejoices in its own atomic being , and all have a chance to crest the highest waves , if wind and moon should conspire favorably . The instantaneous photograph is necessary to depict this ocean and its movements . But we must have more than any photograph can give us ; with the accuracy of that , should be combined the aesthetic completeness of a picture and a poem in one , - and always of a picture and a poem .
