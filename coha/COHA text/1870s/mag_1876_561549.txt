OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XVII . GREAT RUSSELL STREET , Friday , October 1 , 1830 . DEAREST H- : I have risen very early , for what with excitement , and the wakefulness always attendant with me upon a new bed , I have slept but little , and I snatch this first hour of the day , the only one I may be able to command , to tell you that I have heard from my brother , and that he is safe and well , for which , thank God ! Further I know nothing . He talks vaguely of being with us towards the end of the winter , but in the mean time , unless he finds some means of conveying tidings of his welfare to me , I must remain in utter igno // rance of his circumstances and situation and though a dread of uncertain events is foreign to my nature , which has a tendency always to be absorbed in whatever is present to me , there are reasonable fears , suggested by his abode and occupation at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of all regular communication with him , which it is vain to hope for , in spite of the gratitude I feel for his preservation hitherto , and the hopes it encourages of his future safety . Your letter , which was to welcome me to my new home , arrived there two days before 1 did , and was forwarded to me into Buckinghamshire . A few days there , - taking what interest I ' could in the sportin* and flshino the country of quiet the place , and above all the privilege of taking the sacrament , which , had I remained at Heaton , I should have had no opportunity of doing , - gave me a breathing - time and a sense of mental repose before enterin* again upon that busy life whose demands are already be sie ( *in ( * in the form me inexorable of half a dozen new stave dresses to be devised , ordered , and executed in the shortest imaginable time . Octeber 3d . You see how truly I prophesied at the beginning of this letter , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one I should be able to command that day . I might have said that week , for this is the first instant I have been able to call my own since then . I rehearsed Juliet yesterday , and shall do so again to-morrow morning ; the theatre opens with it to - merrow night . I have a new nurse , and I am rehearsing for her , poor woman ! She is dreadfully alarmed at taking Mrs. Davenport 's place , who certainly was a very great favorite . I am half crazy with the number of new dresses to be got ; for though , thanks to the kindness and activity of my mother , none of the trouble of devising them ever falls on me , yet the bare catalogue of silks and satins and velvets , hats and feathers and ruffs , fills me with amazement and Decembr , trepidation . I fancy I shall go through all the old parts , and then come out in a new tragedy . I shall be most horribly frightened , but I hope I shall do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a young man of great abilities , and to whom I wish every success . The subject of his play is taken from a Spanish one , called The Jew of Aragon , and the whole piece is of a new and unhackneyed order. * My father and I play a Jewish father and daughter ; this and the novelty of the story itself will perhaps be favorable to the play ; I hope so with all my heart . Mrs. Henry Siddons has taken a house in London for six months ; I have not seen her yet , but am most anxious to do so . Anxiety and annoyance , I fear , have just caused her a severe indisposition , but she is a little better now . I can not see her till Tuesday , and so must be patient . My cousins have just been here ; Harry has come from Chatharn , and Willy , her youngest , from Switzerland , that they may be all together some little time before Harry goes to India . What a dreadful trial that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but she is very strong . Mrs. Siddon* is much better . She is staying at Leamington at present . I was truly rejoiced to find from your letter that E- had not suffered from the spite of the elements , and much amused at her assertion that nothing but her exertino the " energy of will " had preserved her froum being seasick ; how I honor her ! This was a phrase which Holcroft , Godwin 's eccentric actor friend , was fond of using ; and when he broke one of his ribs in a fall from his horse , he assured the surgeon who pronounced that he had done so that it was impossible he should have sustained any injury whatever , as he was quite conscious of having exerted the " energy of will " as he fell . Dearest H- , returning from Buckinghamshire , the other day , I passed Cassiobury , the grove , the little lane leading down to Heath Farm , and Miss M s cottage , and the first days of our acquaintance came back to my memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gossip . // loved you wherever I had met you , but you come in for a share of my love and liking of Cassiobury , and the spring , the beautiful season in which we met first . I send you the long-promised lock of my hair ; you will be surprised at the lightness of the shade ; at least I was . It was cut from my forehead , and I think it is a nice bit ; tell me that you get it safe . Henry is staying in Buckinghamshire in all the ecstasy of a young cockney 's first sporting days . When he was quite a child and was asked what profession he intended to embrace , he replied that he would be " a gentleman and Wear leather breeches , " and I think it is the very destiny he is fitted to fill . He is the perfect picture of happiness when in his shootin , ,  --  jacket and gaiters , with his gun on his shoulder and a bright day before him ; and although we were obliged to *eturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , and left him to murder pheasants and hares , and amuse himself in a manly fashion . I did not li*e the place at which they were stayin0 as much as they did , for though the country was very pretty , I had during my summer tour seen so much that surpassed it that I saw it at a disadvantage . Then , I have no fancy for gypsying , and the greatest taste for all the formal proprieties of life , and what I should call " silver fork existence " in general ; and the inconveniences of a small country inn , without really affecting my comfort , disturb my decided preference for luxury . The principal diversion my ingenious mind discovered to while away my time with was a fiddle ( an elderly one ) , which I routed out of a lumber closet , and from which , after due invocations to St. Cecilia , I drew such diabolical sounds as I flatter myself were never excelled by Tartini or his master , the devil himself . I must now close this , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go down to the sea-shore ; how we will walk , and ride , and read , and talk , and swim , if I am with you next year . Goodby , dearest H- . The play of The Jew of Aragon , the first dramatic composition of a young gentleman of the name of Wade , of whose talent my father had a very high opinion , which he trusted the success of his piece would confirm , I am sorry to say failed entirely . It was the first time and the last that I had the distress of assisting in damning a piece , and what with my usual intense nervousness in acting a new part , my anxiety for the interests of both the author and the theatre , and the sort of indignant terror with which , instead of the applause I was accustomed to , I heard the hisses which testified the distaste and disapprobation of the public and the failure of the play , I was perfectly miserable when the curtain fell , and the poor young author , as pale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side scene , and bravely holding out his hand to him said , " Never mind for me , Mr. Kemble ; I 11 do better another time . " And so indeed he did ; for he wrote a charming play on the old pathetic story of Griselda , in which that graceful actress , Miss Jarman , played his heroine , and my father the hero , and which had an entire and well-deserved success . I am obliged to confess that I retain no recollection whatever of the ill - fated play of The Jew of Aragon , or my own part in it , save the last scene alone ; this , I recollect , was a magnificent Jewish place of worship , in which my father , who was the high priest , appeared in vestments such as I believe the Jewish priests still wear in their solemn ceremonies , and which were so closely copied from the description of Aaron 's sacred pontifical robes that I felt a sense of impropriety in such a representation ( purely historical , as it was probably considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the French stage in Racine 's Jewish plays ) . And I think it extremely likely that the failure of the piece , which had been imminent all through , found its climax in the unfavorable impression made upon the audience by this very scene , in spite of my father 's noble and picturesque appearance . // qwq Tales , and adapted to the stage by one of the Misses Lee , the sister authoresses of the Tales . The piece was very fairly successful , but my mother said that though , according to her very considerable experience , the actors were by no means more imperfect in their parts than usual on a first night , her nervous anxiety was kept almost at fever height by poor Miss Lee 's incessant running commentary of " Ah ! very pretty , no doubt - very fine , I dare say - only I never wrote a word of it ! " Lord Byron took the same story for the subject of his powerful play of Werner , in which Mr. Macready acted so finely , and with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unguarded hour to consent , as I did , to go with my friends , Messrs . Tom Taylor and Charles iReade , to see the first representation of a play of theirs called , I think , The King 's Wager , in which Charles the Second , Nell Gwynn , and the Plague were prominent characters . Accidental circumstances prevented one of the gentlemen from coming with me , and I have often since wondered at my temerity in having placed myself in such a trying situation . were addressed neither to me nor to my performance , I think if they had been the whistling of bullets ( which I have also heard nearer than was pleasant ) I could not have felt more frightened and furious . Young Wade 's self-control and composure during the catastrophe of this play reminds me , by contrast , of a most ludicrous story my father used to tell of some unfortunate authoress , who , in an evil hour for herself and some friendly provincial manager , persuaded him to hring out an original drama of hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were sufficiently appreciative to object extremely to the play , and large enough to make their objections noisily apparent . The manager , in his own distress not unmindful of his poor friend , the authoress , sought her out to console her , and found her seated at the side-scene with a glass of stiff brandy and water that some commiserating friend had administered to her for her support , rocking herself piteously to and fro , and , with the tears streaming down her cheeks , uttering between sobs and sips , in utter self-abasement , her peccavi in the form of oaths and imprecations of the finest Billingsgate vernacular ( all , however , addressed to herself ) , that would have made a dragoon shake in his shoes . The original form of which mea culpa seized the worthy manager with such an irresistibly ludicrous effect that he left the poor , guilty authoress without being able to address a syllable to her , lest he should explode in peals of laughter instead of decent words of condolence . To accompany an author or authoress ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the representation of their piece is by no means a pleasant act of duty or friendship . I remember my mother , whose own nervous temperament certainly was extremely ill adapted for such an undertaking , describin0 the intolerable distress she had experienced on the occasion of the first representation GREAT RUSSELL STREET , October 24 , 1830. $ DEAR H- : I have been too busy to answer your last sooner , but this hour before bedtime , the first quiet one for some time , shall be yours . I have heard nothing more of my brother , and am ignorant where he is or how engaged at present . You asked me whether I think he still retains his purpose of going into the church . I have not the least notion , but his present views and interests appear to me so incompatible with such an intention , that if he has not renounced all idea of becoming a clergyman , I think that he ought to do so . You judged rightly with respect to the impossibility of longer keeping my mother in ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much what I had ap // prehended ; but her feelings have now become somewhat calmer on the subject . We are careful , however , as much as possible , to avoid all mention of or reference to my brother in her presence , for she is in a very cruel state of anxiety about him . With re* , ard to II- and Dnothing has been determined ; the former is to study , I believe , at the London University , and my mother is still in communication with a lady who has applied as governess to my sister . Mrs. Harry has taken a house in London for the next six months . Her health is at present very indifferent . Harry goes out to India in the spring , and although this parting is the result of his own choice of a profession , to gratify which she has sacrificed her own feeling , yet even her unselfish paramount sense of duty can not entirely blunt the pain of losing her son ; and I believe this impending separation , together with recent annoyances , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see as much of them as I should wish ; for in order to be near my aunt Siddons they have taken up their quarters so far from us that it is quite a journey to and fro , and takes up a great deal of time . I am endeavoring as much as possible to follow my studies with some regularity . I have forsworn paying and recc*ving morning visits ; so that , when no rehearsal interferes , I get my practicing , my singing , and my reading in tolerable peace . I have had a key of Russell Square offered me , which privilege I shall most thankfully accept . Walking regularly is , of course , essential , and though I rather dread the idea of solitarily turning round and round that dreary emblem of eternity , a circular gravel walk , over-gloomed with soot-blackened privet bushes , I am sure I ought , and I mean to do it every day for an hour . We do not dine till six , when I do not act , and when I do , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from ten in the morning , when breakfast is over , I get a tolerably long day . I have obtained my father 's leave to learn drawing and 709 German , and as soon as our house is a little more comfortably settled , I shall begin both . I do not know whether I have the least talent for drawing , but I have so strong a desire to possess that accomplishment that I think , by the help of a good master and patience and hard work , I must succeed to some decent degree . I wish to provide myself with every possible resource against the engrossing excitement of my profession while I remain in it , and to fill its place whenever I leave it , or it leaves me ; all my occupations are with that view and to that end . My father has promised me to speak to Mr. Murray about publishing my play and my verses . I am anxious for this for several reasons , some of which I believe I mentioned to you ; and to these I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I possess framed , for my little room , and I should not scruple to apply part of the money so earned to that purpose . You asked me which is my room . You remember the bathroom , next to what was my uncle John 's bedroom , on the third floor ; the room above that my mother has fitted up beautifully for me , and I inhabit it all day long with great complacency and a sort of comfortable , Alexander Selkirk feeling . And this su*gests a question which has seldom been out of my mind , and which I wish to recall to yours . When do you intend to come and see me ? I can offer you a nest on the fourth story , which is excellent for your health , as free a circulation of air as a London lodging can well afford , and as fine a combination of chimney - pots as even your love of the picturesque could desire . Dear H- , will you not come and pass a month with us ? Now stop a bit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducements to and advantages of such a step . In the first place , my father and mother both request and wish it , and you know how truly happy it would make me . Your own people can well spare you for a month , and I am sure will be the more inclined to do so from the consideration that change of air and Old Woman 's aossip. // scene will be good for you , and that , though your stock of original ideas is certainly extraordinary , yet you can not be expected to go on forever , like a spider , existing mentally in the midst of your own weavings , without every now and then recruiting your strength and taking in a new supply of material . You shall come to London , that huge mass of matter for thought and observation , and to me , in whom you find so interesting an epitome of all the moods , tenses , and conjugations of every regular and irregular form of " to do , to be , and to suffer ; " and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and edified , you shall return home with one infallible result of your stay with us - increased value for a peaceful life , quiet companions , a wide sea-view , and potatoes roasted in their skins ; not but what you shall have the last-mentioned luxury here , if you will but come . Your taste for chimney - pots I have already promised to gratify ; your predilection for heavy paste puddings and pies I dare say the cook will do her best to indulge ; as to your Theseus-like musical mania , I fear I can not promise you the yelping matins of a pack of hounds , hut A- and I will exert ourselves to supply that deficiency . What can a human being do more ? You shall sit by yourself , when you do n't want company ; you shall have mine when you do ; you shall stay at home the nights I act , or go to see me if you wish to do so , or , what I should like better , sit with me in a comfortable dressing - room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while I am . Now , dear H , I wish this very much , but promise to bear your answer reasonably well ; I depend upon your indulgin* , me if you can , and shall try not to behave ill if you do n't ; so do me justice , and do not give way to your shyness and habits of retirement . I want you to come here before the 20th of November , and then I will let you go in time to be at home for Christmas . So now my cause is in your hands - avisezvous . I wonder whether you have heard December , that my father has been threshing the editor of the Age newspaper , who , it seems , took offense at my father 's not appearing on sufficiently familiar terms with him somewhere or other when they met , in revenge for which " coldness " ( as he styles it ) he has not ceased for the last six months abusing us , every week , in his paper . From what I hear I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell you that , knowing the character of this publication , I should never have looked at it , and the circumstance of my name appearing in its columns would hardly have been an inducement to me to do so . I knew nothing , therefore , of my own injuries , but heard general expressions of indignation against Mr. Westmacott , and saw that my father was extremely exasperated upon the subject . The other night they were all going to the play , and pressed me very much to go too , but I had something I wished to write , and remained at home . On their return my father appeared to me much excited , and I was informed that having unluckily come across Mr. Westmacott , his wrath had got the better of his self-command , and he had bestowed a severe beating upon that individual . I could not help looking very grave at this ; for though I should have been very well satisfied if it could have ras*ned a good threshing upon Mr. Westmacott from the sky , yet , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not rejoice that my father had done so . I suppose he saw that I had no great satisfaction in the event , for he said , " The law affords no redress against such attacks as this paper makes on people , and I thought it time to take justice in my own hands when my daughter is insulted . " He then repeated some of the language made use of with reference to me in The Age , and I could not help blushing with indignation to my fingers ' ends . Perhaps , under the circumstances , it is not surprising that my father has done what he has , but I think I should have admired him more if he had not . Mr. Westmacott means to bring an action against him , and I am afraid he will Old Woman 's Uossip. // 1876 . Old Woman ' ** Gossip . have to pay dearly for his momentary indulgence of temper . I must have done writing , though I had a good deal more to say . God bless you , dear . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better , next time . Ever yours , F. A. K. The majority of parents - mothers , I believe I ought to say - err in one or other excess with regard to their children . Love either blinds them absolutely to their defects , or makes them so terribly alive to them as to exaggerate every imperfection . It is hard to say which of the errors is most injurious in its effects . I suppose according as the temperament is desponding and diffident , or sanguine and self-sufficient , the one system or the other is likely to do most harm . My mother 's intensely nervous organization , acute perceptions , and exacting taste made her in everything most keenly alive to our faults and deficiencies . The unsparin* , severity of the sole reply or comment she ever vouchsafed to our stupidity , want of sense , or want of observation , - " I hate a fool , " - has reinained almost like a cut with a lash across my memory . Her wincing sensitiveness of ear made it all but impossible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her exclamations of impatient anguish at my false chords and flat intonations ; and I suppose nothing but my sister 's unquenchable musical genius would have sustained her naturally timid , sensitive disposition under such discipline . Two of our family , my eldest brother and myself , were endowed with such robust self - esteem and elastic conceit as not only defied repression but , unfortunately for us , could never be effectually snubbed ; with my sister and my younger brother the case was entirely different , and encouragement was rather what they required . How well it is for the best and wisest , as well as the least good and least wise , of trainers of youth , that God is above all . I do not myself un ( Ierstand the love that blinds one to the defects of those dear to one ; their faults are part of themselves , without which they could not be themselves , no more to be denied or dissembled , it seems to me , than the color of their eyes or hair . I do not feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failings of those they love . The mingled good and evil qualities in my friends make up their individual identity , and neither from myself , nor from them , nor from others does it ever occur to me that half that identity should or could be concealed . I could as soon imagine them without their arms or their legs as without their peculiar moral characteristics , and could no more think of them without their faults than without their virtues . Many were the pleasant hours , in spite of my misgivings , that I passed with a book in my hand , mechanically pacing the gravel walks of Russell Square . Certain readings of Shakespeare 's plays , Othello and Macbeth especially , in lonely absorption of spirit , I associate forever with that place . I remember , too , reading at my father 's request , during those peripatetic exercises , two plays written by Sheil for his amiable countrywoman , Miss O'Neill , in which she won deserved laurels : Evadne or the Statue , and The Apostate . I never had the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my mind by those plays was that her abilities must have been very great to have , , iven them the effect and success they had . I do not think , however , that their popularity survived her performance of them ; I have never seen them or heard of their being revived since her day . As for me , as usual , of course , my reply to my father was a disconsolate " I am sure 1 can do nothing with them . " My friend H- 5- , in coming to us in Russell Street , came to a house that had been almost a home to her and her brother when they were children , in the life of my uncle and Mrs. John Kemble , by whom they were re , arded with great affection , and whom they visited and stayed with as if they had been young relations of their own . My hope of learning German and // drawing was frustrated by the engrossing calls of my theatrical occupations . The first study was reserved for a longsubsequent season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perplexity and sorrow , from which I endeavored to find relief in some sustaine ( l intellectual effort ; and I mastered it sufficiently to translate without difficulty Sculler 's Mary Stuart and some of his minor poems . As for drawing , that I have once or twice tried to accomplish , but the circumstances of my unsettled and restless life have been unfavorable for any steady effort to follow it up , and I have got no further yet than a passionate desire to know how to draw . If ( as I sometimes imagine ) in a future existence undeveloped capacities and persistent yearnings for all kinds of good may find expansion and exercise , and not only our moral but also our intellectual being put forth new powers and achieve progress in new directions , then in some of the successive heavens to which , perhaps , I may be allowed to climb ( if to any ) I shall be a painter of pictures ; a mere idea that suggests a heavenly state of lon&amp; desired capacity , to possess which , here on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand least indispensable to an artist . Of the two pursuits , a painter 's or a musician 's , considered not as arts but as accomplishments merely , the former appears to me infinitely more desirable , for a woman , than the latter far more frequently cultivated one . The one is a sedative , the other an acute stimulant to the nervous system . The one is a perfectly independent and always to be commanded occupation ; the other imperatively demands an instrument , utters an audible challenge to attention , and must either command solitude or disturb any society not inclined to become an audience . The one cultivates habits of careful , accurate observation of nature , and requires patient and precise labor in reproducing her models ; the other appeals powerfully to the imagination and emotions , and charms almost in proportion as it excites its votaries . With regard to natural aptitude , Old Woman 's Gtossip . December . the most musical of nations - the German - shows by the impartial training of its common schools how universal it considers a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same degree ( of course I am not speakin , , of that high order of endowment which is always exceptional ) the artistic faculty exists in every child . I do not think there are more inaccurate eyes than imperfect ears , or heavy fingers for the pencil and the brush than for the strings or keys of instruments , nor do I suppose a defective sense of color more common than a defective sense of sound . And considering what time and money are lavished in cultivating very inadequately a naturally poor musical endowment among English and American girls , the frequent neglect of the simplest elementary training in drawing can hardly be justified merely upon the ground of deficient natural capacity . Up to a certain point every child can be taught music and drawing . But it is curious how much more general among us now unmusical English the one capacity is considered to be than the other , which I believe to be possessed in at least the same degree* and cultivable to the same extent in quite as many individuals . I have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decidedly a musical nation . Our musical literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the glees , madrigals , rounds , and catches , requiring considerable skill and familiarly performed formerly in the countryhouses and home circles of our gentry , and the noble church music of our cathedral choirs , bear witness to a high musical inspiration , and thorough musical training in their composers and executants . We seem to have lost this vein of original national music ; the Lancashire weavers and spinners are still good choristers , but among the German half of our common Teutonic race , the real feeling for and knowledge of music continues to flourish , while with the Anglo-Saxons of Britain and America it has dwindled and decayed . // GREAT RUSSELL STREET , November 8 , 1830. 5 DEAREST II- : I received your note , for I can not honor the contents of your last with the name of a letter ( whatever title the shape and quantity of the paper it was written on may claim ) , together with Mrs. K- 's . You know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was pleased with her kindness in remembering and writing to me . I shall acknowledge the obligation to herself , however ; but what pleased me best in her letter was that she said she thought you would come to us . I have made up my mind to let you make up yours , without urging you further upon the subject ; but I must reply to one thing . You say to me , could you bring with you a strip of sea-shore , a corner of blue sky , or half a dozen waves , you would not hesitate . Allow me to say that whereas by the sea - side or under a bright sky your society enhances the pleasure derived from them , I now desire it ( not having these ) as delightful in itself , increasing my enjoyment in the beauties of nature , and compensating for their absence . But I have done ; only if Mrs. K- has held out a false hope to me , she is ferocious and atrocious , and that is all , and so pray tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you about this disagreeable business of the Age newspaper , in my last , that I thought what I said of it would be almost unintelligible to you . I do not really deserve the sympathy you express for my feelin , , s in the matter , for partly from being totally ignorant of the nature and extent of my injuries - having never , of course , read a line of that scurrilous newspaper - and partly from my indifference to everything that is said about me , I really have felt no annoyance or distress on the subject , beyond , as I told you , one moment 's feminine indignation at a coarse expression which was repeated to me , but which in strict truth did not and could not apply to me ; and considerable regret that my father should have touched Mr. Westmacott even with a stick , or a " pair of tongs . " That individual intends bringing a suit for dam-713 ages , which makes me very anxious to have my play and rhymes published , if I can get anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " scribbles " ( as good Queen Anne called her letters ) would be better bestowed in paying for that little ebullition of my father 's temper than in decorating my tiny sanctum . What does my poor , dear father expect , but that I shall be bespattered if I am to live on the highway ? Mr. Murray has been kind enough to say he will publish my very original coinpositions , and I am preparing them for him . I am sorry to say I have heard nothing from my brother ; of him I have heard , for his whereabout is known and talked of , so much so , indeed , that my father says further concealment is at once useless and ridiculous . I may therefore now tell you that he is at this moment in Spain , trying to levy troops for the cause of the constitutionalists . I have by this time grown familiar with the idea , but you can conceive my utter surprise and dismay when I received his letter informing me that , instead of being quietly in Norfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acting in some capacity of trust and secrecy for Torrijos and the Spanish patriots . I need not tell you , dearest II- , how much I regret this , because you will know how deeply I must disapprove of it . I might have thought any young man Quixotic who thus mistook a restless , turbulent spirit , eager to embrace a quarrel not his own , for patriotism and self-devotion to a sacred cause ; but in my brother , who had professed aims and purposes so opposed to tumult and war and bloodshed , it seems to me a subject of much more serious regret . Heaven only knows what plans he has formed for the future ! His present situation affords anxiety enough to warrant our not lookin* further in anticipation of vexation , but even if the present is regarded with the best hope of success in his undertaking , the natural consideration must be , as far as he is concerned , " What follows ? " It is rather a melancholy consideration that such abilities should be wasted and misap Old Woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain and the progress of the constitutionalists are so very various and contradictory that I know not what to believe , nor am I indeed very eager in observing or reading them ; his safety is the only interest I feel in their expedition , and while praying earnestly for it I endeavor to remember that he is in the keeping of that Providence which does not measure its care of us by our deservings . Our own country is in a perilous state of excitement , and these troubled times make politicians of us all . Of course the papers will have informed you of the risings in Kent and Sussex ; London itself is in an unquiet state that suggests the heaving of a volcano before an eruption . It is said the Duke of Wellington must resign ; I am ignorant , but it appears to me that whenever he does it will be a bad day 's work for England . The alarm and anxiety of the aristocracy is extreme , and exhibits itself , even as I have had opportunity of observing in society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public events . If one did not sympathize with their apprehensions , their mode of expressing them would sometimes be amusing . The aspect of public affairs is injurious to the theatre , and these graver interests thin our houses while they crowd the houses of Parliament . However , when we played The Provoked Husband before the king and queen the other night , the theatre was crammed from floor to ceiling , and presented a most beautiful coup d'cvil . I have just come out in Mrs. HaIler . It seems to have pleased the people very much . I need not tell you how much I dislike the play ; it is the quintessence of trashy sentimentalism ; but our audiences cry and sob at it till we can hardly hear ourselves speak on the stage , and the public in general rejoices in what the servant-maids call " something deep . " My father acts the Stranger with me , which makes it very trying to my nerves , as I mix up all my own personal feelings for him with my acting , and the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dreadful to me , though it is only all about " stuff and nonsense* ' after all . I must leave off writing ; I am excruciated with the toothache , which has tormented me without respite all day . I will inclose a line to Mrs. K- , which I will beg you to convey to her . XVith kindest love to all your circle , believe me ever yours , P. A. K. I inclose you the lines you asked me for ; they are from Southey 's Iloderick ; I am fond of them : - " If ye would know How visitations of calamity Affect the pious soul , t is shown ye there . Look yonder at that cloud which through the sky Sailiug alone doth cross in her career The rolliug moon . I watched it as it came , And deem 'd the deep opaque would hiot her heams ; But meltiug like a wreath of snow it hangs In folds of wavy silver round , and clothes The orh in richer beauties than her own , Then , passing , leaves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic song ; you should come to London to hear how admirably I sing it . DEAR Mas . K : You have asked H- a question in your letter to her which I feel myself quite as competent to answer as she is , and as it particularly regards me , perhaps you will not be offended or disappointed at my replying to it in psopria persona . You ask H how I think and feel at this moment with reference to my first work 's becoming known to the public . Much as I did soon after I had written it , and ever since , while it has lain in my desk . The extreme delight and self-satisfaction I felt for a day or two after the completion of my play very soon gave way to a more sober and no doubt truer estimate of my performance , and from the opinion I then came to of its defects and nlerits I do not think the approbation or censure of others would now move me . I have been more than liberally endowed by nature witll self-esteem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty steady conscientiousness ( you see I speak to you in the phrenological language of our common friend , Mr. Combe ) , and , however high my estimate of my own powers may be , I think my perception of my deficiencies keeps pace with it . I am not easily influenced // by any standard of right but my own , but I labor to make and keep that as just a one as I can . This is a wonderful piece of egotism , but your question about me to H was put much in the fashion of one engaged in experimental science of mental philosophy , and I have answered it instead of letting her do so , and as candidly as I am able , without any view but that of assisting your observation and study of human nature iu general by my individual " manifestations . " Your son was kind enough to procure me an entrance to the House of Commons last night , where I slept profoundly until roused by the most unearthly voice I ever beard , pouring forth with wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Sheil , whom I am 0lad to have heard , though he did not speak upon any subject of particular interest . ' I must not pass the narrow bounds of my paper , which just equals my allowance of time . I am glad you do not altogether forget me , and am ever truly yours , F. K. Mrs. K- was a Miss Dawson , sister of the Right Honorable George Dawson , and the wife of an eminent member of the Irish bar . She was a woman of great mental cultivation and unusual information upon subjects which are generally little interesting to women . She was a passionate partisan of Owen the philanthropist and Combe the phrenologist , and entertained the most sanguine hopes of the regeneration of the whole civilized world through the means of the theories of these benevolent reformers . Except Queen Elizabeth , of glorious memory , I do not think a woman can have exi*ted who combined the love of things futile and serious to the same degree as Mrs. K- . Her feminine taste for fashionable society and the frivolities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gravest sort and her devotion to the speculations of her friends Owen and 1 My visit to the House of commons here referreci to was made in the days of female exclusion from the national deliherative assembly , the only place to which women were then admitted to 715 Combe , constituted a rare union of contrasts . She was a remarkable instance of the combination exemplified by more than one eminent person of her sex , of a capacity for serious study , solid acquirements , and enlightened and liberal views upon the most important subjects , with a decided inclination for those more trifling pursuits supposed to be the paramount interests of the female mind . She was the dear friend of my dear friend Miss 5- , and corresponded with her upon the great subject of social progress with a perfect enthusiasm of theoretical reform . GREAT RUSSELL STREET , November l4fh . DEAREST H- : Thank you a thousand times for your kindness in consenting to come to us . We are all very happy in the hope of having you , nor need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we shall receive or treat you otherwise than as one of ourselves . I have left my mother and my aunt in the room which is to be yours , devising and arranging matters for you . It is a very small roost , dear H- , but it is the only spare room in our house , and although it is three stories up , it is next to mine , and I hope good neighborhood will atone for some deficiencies . With regard to interfering with the routine or occupations of the family , they are of a nature which , fortunately for your scruples , renders that impossible . There is but one thing in your letter which rather distressed me : you allude to the inconveniences of a woman traveling in mail-coaches in December , and I almost felt , when I read the sentence , what my aunt Dall told me after I had requested you to come to us now , that it was a want of consideration in me to have invited you at so ungenial a season for traveling . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparent selfishness of the arrangement . Towards the end of the spring I shall be leaving town , I hear the parliamentary debates being the " lantern " of the house , the ventilator , in fact , through which its foul air escaped . Old Woman 's aossip. // hope to come nearer your land , and the beginning of our spring is seldom much more mild and inviting or propitious for traveling than the winter itself . Then , too , the early spring is the time when our engagements are unavoidably very numerous ; to decline going into society is not in my power , and to drag you to my balls ( which I love dearly ) would , I think , scarce be a pleasure to you ( whom I love more ) , and to go to them when I might be with you would be to run the risk of destroying my taste for the only form of intercourse with my fellow-creatures which is not at present irksome to me . Think , dear H , if ceasing to dance I should cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hating it , aud become an absolute misanthropist ! What a risk ! So , you see , I really did for the best , though " bad is the best , " as is too often the case in this best of all possible worlds . I feel very deeply the effort you are making incoming to us , dearest H- , and I trust that , what with the warmth of our reception and the prospect we have of continued mild weather , you will not have reason to reproach me very bitterly for my selfish barbarity . I have heard nothing more of or from John , but the newspaper reports of the proceedings are rather more favorable than they have been , though I fear one can not place much reliance on them . *i do not know how the papers you see speak of the aspect of affairs in England at this moment ; the general feeling seems to . be one of relief , and that , whatever apprehensions may have been entertained for the tranquillity of the country , the storm has blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and promises to remain so , and there **seems to be a sort of " drawing of a long breath ' * sensation in the state of the public mind , though I can not myself help thinking not only that we have been , but that we still are , on the eve of some great crisis . There are reports without end that the Duke of Wellington is to go out , and new ministries are hatched daily in every political imagination in this big , busy town ; but from a conver sation I heard the other morning among persons intimately connected with the Duke of Wellington , there seems to be quite as little truth in all these confident assertions as is usual in such reports . The king has expressed the most unbounded confidence in him , and it was asserted that the duke had said that he would not resign , for the only cause of his unpopularity is that while he is at the head of the government the mob will never be able to get the upper hand . To the suppressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry " amen , " for power wielded by ignorance must always be violent , ill-jud* , ed , and despotic , in proportion as it is new , strange , and cxci tingtoit . Mrs. HaIler is going on very well ; it is well spoken of , I am told , and upon the whole it seems to have done me credit , though I am surprised it has , for there is nothing in the part that gives me the least satisfaction . My next character , I hear , is to be of a very different order of frailty - Calista , in The Fair Penitent . However odious both play and part are , there are powerful situations in it , and many opportunities for fine acting , but I am afraid I am quite unequal to such a turpissime termagant , with whom my aunt did such tremendous things . My performance of The Fair Penitent was entirely ineffective , and did neither me nor the theatre any service ; the play itself is a feeble adaptation of Massinger 's powerful drama of The Fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit our old plays to our modern stage , the fundamentally objectionable nature of the story could not be reformed without much of the vigorous and terrible effect of the original treatment evaporating in the refining process . Mr. Macready revived Massinger 's fine play with considerable success , but both the matter and the manner of our dramatic ancestors is too robust for the audiences of our day , who nevertheless will go and see Diane de Lys , by a French company of actors , without wincing . Of Mrs. Siddons 's Mrs. Haller , one of her admirers once told me that her majestic 716 December , // and imposing person , and the commanding character of her beauty , militated against her effect in the part . " No man , alive or dead , " said he , " would have dared to take a liberty with her ; wicked she might be , but weak she could not be , and when she told the aarden Statues . 717 story of her ill-conduct in the play , nobody believed her . " While anotber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that it was worth sitting out the piece for her scene with Romont alone , and to see " such a splendid animal in such a magnificent rage .
