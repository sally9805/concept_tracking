A wretch who boasts that he never deals in anything but " horses and niggers . " A villain who under the guise of friendship robs his friend at cards and leads him to destruction . Before Clay knew him , he was a strict business man ; now Big Bend takes care of itself , and even Clay 's very nature seems changed . I 've tried to warn him , but what am I ? A leaf in a storm .

Forgive ! And save , oh , save my child ! " It was Grace 's dear sweet voice , and with its music still in my ears I awoke . This is said with great effort Nance . NanceStroking his head It was a good dream ; and before you go to join Miss Grace you will save Lisa , her child , wo n't you ? Pleadingly Judge . Judge Hardin What do you mean ? Nance . Nance Tell her the truth , that she is not my child , that she is your own flesh and blood  --  free born white woman . Judge . Judge Hardin Hush-sh ! No , no !
