FIRST ARTICLE . NO work connected with the civil war has been received with greater attention than Sherman 's " Memoirs , *** and this arises no less from the remarkable interest of the narrative , and the charm of its style , than from the author 's brilliant services and marked peculiarities of character . During the last fifteen years he has been one of the foremost , and in many respects one of the most interesting figures connected with American affairs . His brilliant but somewhat eccentric mind , strengthened by a wide observation of men and things , and . well stored with the results of an extended course of reading and study , impressed itself powerfully upon the course of events during the civil war while the high positions which he held from time to time brought him in contact with nearly all the prominent men of the period , many of whom found themselves under his command or were brought into intimate personal or official relations with him . When it is remembered , in addition , that three of the great armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something over 350,000 men , together with all the theatre of war contained between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers on the northwest and west , the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic ocean on the south and east , and the IRoanoke river on the northeast , fell under his control during the final year of the civil war , the reason why his " Memoirs " have been received with such eager attention will be easily understood . Every intelligent man , whether a commissioned officer or a private soldier , who bore arms in his country 's service , naturally feels an excusable interest in the narrative which chronicles the deeds of himself and his comrades ; and * " Memoirs of General William T. Sherman . " By himself . In two volumes . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 21 now that the General of the Army has chosen to go beyond the limits of official reports and publish his own memoirs , whether it be for the sake of history or the love of fame , or even for the less noble but perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades of every grade and station to consider how he has performed his self-assumed task , but naturally excites the curiosity of the world about his own character , and his true place in history . In writing his memoirs he has followed in a well-beaten path , for since the days of C*esar distinguished men have frequently written about themselves and their deeds , and nearly always with instruction and satisfaction to the world . Indeed , there is no branch of historical writing which is more useful or more interesting , or which is sTiore generally trustworthy , and therefore none for which there is greater justification , than personal recollections . When written with independence , candor , and truthfulness , they are absolutely invaluable as materials for the history of the times and events of which they treat , and in the nature of things they should form the very best guide to the philosophical student in his search for the hidden springs and motives of historical characters . General Sherman has written with independence and candor , and is therefore entitled to praise ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emphatically upon all questions , whether personal or impersonal , and to still greater praise for having published his writings during his own lifetime , instead of laying them away for posterity . This is specially worthy of commendation because it will call forth the story of the survivors who regard themselves as having been unfairly or ungenerously dealt with , or who think the facts of history have been incor // rectly stated or not properly understood by the author , and because after the discussion is finished it will enable him , if so disposed , to correct his errors of fact , if any shall be pointed out , and to repair such injuries to personal reputations as may be shown to have been committed by him . Marshal Marmont says that a good general " should always treat every one wearing a soldier 's coat with the greatest consideration . There is in the profession of arms something so noble , the sacrifice of life which it entails is so sublime , that those who have adopted that calling have a right to personal consideration even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true of the professional soldier , how much more is it true of the citizen who temporarily takes up arms in behalf of his country 's imperilled institutions ? If it be a rule for the marshals of France , how much more should it be one for the generals of the United States ? The memoirs under consideration are specially important as serving to throw light upon Sherman 's own character , to illustrate his relations with his superiors as well as his inferiors , to make known his views upon men and events , and to help fix his own rank among the conspicuous characters of history , though in the introductory address to his comrades in arms , which is neither a preface nor a dedication , he gives it a narrower scope . He declares that " w1*at is now offered is not designed as a history of the war , or even as a complete account of all the incidents in which the writer bore a part , but merely his recollection of events , corrected by a reference to his own memoranda , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , and account for the motives and reasons which influenced some of the actors in the grand drama of war . " In this connection it is worthy of remark that in commenting upon the fact that no satisfactory history of the civil war has been written , although ten years have passed away since its closo* he gives the impression , although inadvertently , that his own book is not broader in scope because the Government has not yet published the abundant materials that are buried in the War Department at Washington . And were it not known that he occupied an office in the War Department building , and that one of his own generals filled the office of Secretary of War , and gave him free access to the archives , published and unpublished , with permission to copy whatever he required while he was engaged in writing his memoirs , it might be supposed from the peculiar tone of his introductory remarks , as well as from the body of his work , that he had not had the opportunity of consulting these valuable records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the military academy at West Point , where he graduated in 1840 , sixth in a class of forty-two members . Generals George H. Thomas , George W. Getty , William Hays , and Stewart Van Vliet , of the Union army , and Generals Paul 0 . Hebert , Richard S. Ewell , and Bushrod Johnson , of the rebel army , graduated in the same class . He was appointed second lieutenant of the Third Artillery , and after serving in the Florida war with distinction he went through the usual routine of company and regimental duty in Florida , Alabama , and Georgia . He found himself in 1846 , just before the outbreak of the Mexican war , stationed at Fort Moultrie , Charleston harbor , as the junior first lieutenant of his company , commanded by Captain ( afterward General ) Robert Anderson . He fittingly begins his memoirs by enumerating the officers who were serving there with him . He rapidly but graphically sketches his experiences while on recruiting service at Pittsburgh ; his zealous and commendable efforts to secure active service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sailing ship around Cape Horu to California ; and his restless activity , whether in the pursuit of deserters , arresting disobedient alcaldes , I // or issuing rations . His narrative of the discovery of gold , the rise and progress of San Francisco , the surveying expeditions which he undertook for personal profit , as well as the curious account which he gives of Colonel Stevenson 's futile efforts to establish " the New York of the Pacific , " the interesting description of the rise and fall of the Vigilance Committee , and the honorable part which he took in the efforts of the State authorities to suppress it , are all told with interesting detail and becoming modesty . His resignation from the army in 1853 , and his embarkation in civil pursuits , show that he was not content to hold office and draw pay for the mere pleasure of doing so , and , although he does not say it in words , make it clear that he thought it quite as meritorious to leave the army in times of peace as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in civil life , whether as a banker in San Francisco and New York , a lawyer and land agent in Kansas , a superintendent of a military academy in Louisiana , or a president of a street railway company in St. Louis , was creditable to him in every particular ; for while he was not successful in amassing a fortune , it truthfully appears that he discharged all his duties faithfully , ably , and honestly , with remarkable energy and intelligence , and with rare independence and manliness . The narrative of this portion of his career is by no means the least interesting part of his memoirs . It shows that he secured and merited the confidence of all with whom he came in contact , but it is peculiarly important from the fact that it reveals how the varied experiences through which he passed had broadened and strengthened his powers of mind , without depriving him in any degree of the independent character which had been developed by his training at West Point and matured by his associations in the army . The outbreak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarry longer than necessary to settle his accounts and surrender his charge into the hands of those from whom he received it . With characteristic promptitude and patriotism , he returned to the North , leaving behind him no taint upon either his honor or his loyalty , but carrying with him the respect and personal good wishes of all who knew him . Although nominally a Democrat in politics , he had been neither a doughface nor a sycophant ; and while apologizing for slavery , he felt , like thousands of others at that period , that the Southern people were neither responsible for its existence nor solely chargeable with its abolition . The crisis in the life of the nation also marked a noted epoch in the fortunes of Sherman . It found him in the full vigor of matured manhood , not far from forty years of age , with a healthy , strong , and elastic constitution , an incisive and active mind well stored with exact knowledge of the military art , and broadened by a varied and extended experience in civil affairs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the brother of John Sherman , an able and influential Senator , he entered upon his new career , not only fully equipped , but powerfully supported . The war afforded him a rare opportunity , and although he was apparently slow to embrace it , after he had done so his success was the natural result of his abilities , while his fame , although possibly greater than his desert , was fairly the reward of genuine patriotism and true merit . On his arrival at Washington he " saw but few signs of preparation , though the Southern Senators and Representatives were daily sounding their threats upon the floors of Congress , and were publicly withdrawing to join the Confederate Congress at Montgomery . Even in the War Department and about the public offices , there was open , unconcealed talk , amounting to high treason " ; but he inexcusably fails to satisfy the reader 's curiosity by indicating who was engaged in it . Shortly afterward he called upon Mr. Lincoln , and was introduced by his bro // ther , John Sherman , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation which followed , the President asked him how they were getting along down South ; to which Sherman replied , " They think they are getting along swimmingly-they are preparing for war . " His tone must have been such as to convey more than the words indicate ; for Mr. Lincoln terminated the interview abruptly by remarking , " Oh , I guess we 'll manage to keep house . " Sherman was sadly disappointed , and " broke out on John , d-ning the politicians generally , and saying , You have got things in a hell of a fix , and may get them out as you best can . " With this he went to St. Louis and accepted the position of president of a street railroad company , which he held for two months , during which time he was offered the position of chief clerk of the War Department , with the promise that he should be made Assistant Secretary of War on the meeting of Congress , but declined the offer . The State of Missouri was then on the eve of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers at Camp Jackson , on the outskirts of St. Louis , while the loyal men , under the leadership of Frank Blair , determined to keep the State in the Union at all hazards . The rebel element were led by a graduate of West Point , and the Union men were looking about for one to lead them . To this end Frank Blair , by the authority of the Government , offered the commission of brigadier general of volunteers to Sherman , with the command of the department then under General Harney ; but he declined that offer also , for reasons which he states as follows : " I told him I had once offered my services and they were declined ; that I had made my business engagements in St. Louis , which I could not throw off at pleasure ; that I had long deliberated on my course of action , and must decline his offer , however tempting . " This was late in the month of April , and yet on May 8 he wrote to the Secretary of War : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I can not throw my family on the cold charity of the world . But for the three years ' call made by the President , an officer can prepare his command and do good service . I will not volunteer as a soldier , because , rightfully or wrongfully , I feel unwillbig to take a mere private 's place . " On the 14th he was summoned to Washington for the purpose of receiving his appointment as colonel of the Thirteenth Regular Infantry . He says , " Of course I could defer action no longer , " and repaired to Washington , where he now " found the Government was trying to rise to a level with the occasion . " It is difficult to understand from the explanation given why his private engagements would not allow him to take the position of Assistant Secretary of Wart or even the grade of brigadier general , and yet did not prevent his acceptance of the position of colonel in one of the ten new regiments of infantry which , according to his explanation , " Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize . " Were it not that on January 18 previous he wrote to Governor Moore of Louisiana , " I prefer to maintain my allegiance to the Constitution as long as a fragment of it survives , " and , " On no earthly account will I do any act or think any thought hostile to or in defiance of the old Government of the United States , " it might fairly be supposed that he sympathized with secession ; but these strong and loyal sentiments preclude such a supposition and compel us to look further for a motive . This is found , perhaps , in the . President 's guess that the Government " would be able to keep house , " and which in all probability Sherman over-sensitively construed into an intimation that his services would not be required . This is merely a hypothesis ; but in view of the fact that his feelings were evidently hurt by the President 's remark , it is not unreasonable . At all events the offer of the position of chief clerk of the War Department , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show him that the President had not intended to offend him , nor to decline his services , and certainly fully justified him in reëntering the military service if , under the circumstances of the hoilr , it can be said he needed any justification whatever . He soon found himself in command of a brigade of volunteers , which he led through the campaign of Bull Run , with credit to himself and satisfaction to the Government ; but as he played a purely subordinate part , it is deserving of no special mention , and is only noticeable from the fact that it was followed , somewhat to his astonishment , by a renewed offer of a brigadier general 's commission , which he was not conscious of having earned , but which he nevertheless accepted . His frank admission with the gallant General Heintzelman , that neither he nor his fellow commanders deserved any praise for their part in this campaign , is evidently sincere , and indicates that he thought at the time the defeat might have been averted by a more activ.e commander , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what means they could have been improved . It will be recognized , however , by those who have considered the history of that campaign , that McDowell was fairly beaten in strategy , notwithstanding the fact that his tactics and fighting were as good if not better than his opponent 's . He was defeated because Beauregard and Johnston , the one commanding at Manassas and the other near Winchester , discovered the forward movement from Washington in time to enable them to unite their forces at Bull Run and overwhelm McDowell before Patterson , who had been confronting Johnston , discovered his retreat or could put his army in position to reinforce the nationi columns on the day of battle . In other words , the rebel commanders had interior or shorter lines , and concentrated their forces at the vital moment upon the vital point , while the Union commanders were operating on exterior or longer lines , and both were slow . Had McDowell advanced to the attack on the 19th or 20th of June , instead of lying in camp till the 21st , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of battle , the result , according to all precedent* must have been entirely different . This is the true military lesson of that campaign , and the only one worth a moment 's consideration . It is made entirely clear by the narrative of General Joseph E. Johnston , as well as by the official reports of General McDowell and his subordinates . Neither the rawness of the troops , their lack of discipline , nor their ignorance of war , as Sherman seems to think , were primary or even important influences in bringing about the national disaster ; or it is a fact which can not be disputed , that the rebel army was equally fresh , undisciplined , and ignorant of war . Had this not been the case , or had the rebel commander had the genius to seize the opportunity brought about by his own combinations , Washington must inevitably have fallen . Without pausing to comment upon Sherman 's criticism of McClellan and Fremont , longer than to remark that it is directed to the consideration of their manners and habits rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore better calculated to arouse personal controversy than to subserve any useful purpose , we shall follow him to Kentucky , whither he was ordered at the request of General Anderson , and probably in partial compliance with the wish which he urgently expressed to remain in a subordinate position . His services in that department were noticeable from the circumstance that he soon found himself in supreme command , owing to the failure of Anderson 's health and his consequent retirement from active duty , and that while endeavoring to create an army out of the raw levies pouring in from the northwest , with which to meet the rebels advancing into that State under Albert Sidney Johnston , Buckner , and // Zollicoffer , he was visited at Louisville by Simon Cameron , then Secretary of War . While this visit seems to have been productive of good results , in the diversion of more troops and more experienced officers to that department , it was followed by the circulation of a painfuf report affecting Sherman 's sanity . His account of the interview which took place between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by implication , if not in express terms , charges the latter with originating and giving currency to the exasperating rumor . There was certainly nothing insane in the demand for 200,000 men for that zone of operations , and it is equally certain that if that number could have been promptly 6rganized and put into the*field at that stage of the war , they could not have failed to produce a marked effect in behalf of the national cause . It is easy to understand that Sherman was annoyed beyond measure at the rumor , though it is difficult to imagine any good reason why he should at this late date have recalled it to public attention . However painful it may have been , his narrative , and the letters quoted therein , make it quite apparent that whatever may have been its origin , even General Halleck had given it some credence . In a letter to General Sherman , dated December 18 , 1861 , that officer says : " I hope to see you well enough for duty soon , though there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , in writing to Thomas Ewing , February 15 , 1862 , in answer to inquiries involving the same general subject , Halleck says : " As I was then pressing General McClellan for more officers , I deemed it necessary to ex* plain why I did so . I used these words : Jam satisfied that General Sherman*s physical and mental system is so completely lrolcen by labor and care as to render him for the present unfit for duty ; perhaps a few weeks ' rest may restore him . ' This was the only communication I made on the subject . On no occasion have I ever expressed an opin ion that his mind was affected otherwise than by over-exertion . " Perhaps Mr. Cameron may have gone no further ; and in that case his conduct , though ill advised , could scarcely be characterized as wanton or malicious . From the foregoing quotations it may fairly be inferred that General Sherman 's mental constitution was really broken , as stated by General Halleck , and that he was thereby rendered temporarily unfit for duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in his writings to explain . The underlying fact , however , serves to throw important light upon his mental organization . His personal appearance indicatcs that he has what phrenologists call a nervo-sanguineous temperament , with an active and excitable mind , accompanied by a vivid imagination ; and it was his misfortune rather than his fault if at that time he could neither undergo incessant labor nor bear the burthen of his great responsibilities without mental disturbance . While he partially outgrew the worst effects of his peculiar temperament before the close of the war , there is abundant evidence in his memoirs to show that it always fettered and restrained him more or less powerfully in the midst of his greatest undertakings and in the presence of his greatest dangers . To its influence may be attributed the fact that he never fought a battle in which his entire army was engaged , never took the great risks with the hope of the great successes of war , such as Napoleon , Cvesar , and Hannibal , and even Frederick the Great were accustomed to regard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs . His powerful and active mind enabled him to see clearly and understand perfectly the plan of campaign , while his pride and loyalty made him anxious to perform well the part assigned him ; but it is equally true that his vivid imagination never failed to point out to him the counterplans of the enemy or their relations to his own . He generally knew well enough what he ought // to do under a given condition of affairs , but he also knew equally well what an able opponent would probably do to counteract him . In other words , his imagination seems to have often filled him with apprehension for what the enemy might do out of his sight , and to have magnified the danger he would encounter by risking all upon the issue of a single battle . Upon this theory his conduct at Mission ridge , which will be more fully commented upon hereafter , is easily understood . It also satisfactorily accounts for the fact that he undertook no bold and crushing movements against Johnston during the Atlanta campaign , but , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warily as did his overprudent opponent . And it may even explain why he marched to Savannah instead of going to Augusta , and thence onward toward Virginia , where was gathered the last organized force of the Confederacy , and the only one in any way worthy of his steel . But the influence of his idiosyncrasies will be better understood by following his narrative through the great events in which he was such a conspicuous figure . After returning from the leave of absence which had been granted him on account of the broken condition of his physical and mental constitution , he was assigned to the command of the camp of instruction at Benton barracks , near St. Louis , and while there had frequent informal conversations with General Ilalleck . One of these , which took place at the Planters ' House , about midwinter , he describes as follows : " General Halleck had a map on his table , with a large pencil in his hand , and asked , Where is the rebel line ? ' Cullum drew the pencil through Bowling Green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is their line , ' said Halleck . Now , where is the proper place to break it ? ' And either Culmm or I said , Naturally the centre . ' Halleck drew a line perpendicularly to the other near its middle , and it coincided nearly with the course of the Tennessee river , and he said , That 's the true line of operations . ' Thisoccurred more than a month before General Grant began the movement , and as he was subject to General Halleck 's orders , I have always given Halleck the full credit for that movement , which was skilful , successful , and extremely rich in military results ; indeed , it was the first real success on our side in the civil war . " That this conversation actually occurred no one can doubt , though just when it took place is not so clear ; while the inference drawn from it by General Sherman is neither just to himself nor to General Grant , nor is it supported by an examination of the records touching this important matter . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to which even Sherman accords the highest authenticity , it appears that the preliminary movements from Cairo toward Belmont and Columbus , early in January of 1861 , were made in pursuance of orders from McClellan , transmitted through Halleck , for the purpose of preventing reinforcements being sent to Buckner , and that these movements contemplated demonstrations up both the Cumbe*land and Tennessee rivers , and against Columbus . In transmitting these orders , January 6 , Halleck says : " But do n't advance far enough to expose your flank or rear to an attack from Columbus , and by all means avoid a serious engagement . " Again , in the same order : " Be very careful to avoid a battle . We are not ready for that . " On the 10th he telegraphed directions for them not to go at all ; but this order came too late . On the return of the troops , after an absence of a week , General C. F. Smith , a brave and accomplished officer , who commanded the column which moved out from Paducah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible . Grant received this report January 22 , and forwarded it at once to Halleck ; the same day he obtained permission to // visit St. Louis , the headquarters of the department , " having asked for it as early as the 6th of the month . On the 23d he started for St. Louis , with the express object of procuring Halleck 's permission " to take Forts Henry and Donelson ; but when he attempted to broach the subject Halleck silenced him so quickly *nd sharply that Grant said no more on the matter , and went back to Cairo with the idea that his commander thought him guilty of proposing a great military blunder . " On January 28 , however , the idea being still prominent in his mind , Grant telegraphed to St. Louis : " With permis-. sion I will take and hold Fort Henry on the Tennessee , and establish and hold a large camp there " ; and on the next day he wrote to Halleck strongly urging the feasibility of the plan ' and closing with the remark that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general commanding as to myself ; therefore further statements are unnecessary . " Commodore Foote , commanding the naval forces , also wrote to Halleck on the 28th recommending the movement , and under this pressure the desired permission , with detailed instructions , was given on the 30th . These instructions did not , howe1*er , contemplate the capture of Fort iDonelson , and there is no mention of that place in any of the correspondence till it appears in a despatch of February 6 , from Grant to Halleck : " Fort Henry is ours . . . . I shall take and destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th . " Halleck made not reply , but notified Buell on the 7th , " General Grant expects to take Fort Donelson at Dover to-morrow . " In reference to the movement against Fort Henry , Badeau remarks : " Doubtless the propriety of the campaign was apparent to all soldiers , but nobody ever ordered or suggested it to Grant except C. F. Smith in his report . " All doubt as to Halleck 's part in it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan , then Commander-in-Chief , on January 20 , only ten days prior to the date of the permission under which Grant acted , and more than twenty days after the interview upon which Sherman accords the merit of the campaign to Halleck . This letter was first publishedhy General Boynton , in the Cincinnati " Gazette , " but as it formed a part of the records of the War Department , it was within reach of General Sherman . The following extracts have an important bearing on the question at issue : " I have received no information in respect to the general plan of campaign . - This line of the Cumberland and Tennessee is the great central line of the western theatre of war . But the plan should not be undertaken without a large force-not less than 60,000 effective men . " After stating that it would also require all the available levies in Missouri , Illinois , Iowa , Indiana , Ohio , and Wisconsin , " armed or still to be armed , " and the transfer of all the troops in Kentucky " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and giving the forces at Cairo and on the lower Ohio at about 15,000 men , not counting seven regiments on the way there from Missouri , he adds : " By the middle or last of February I hope to send 15,000 more . If 30,000 or 40,000 can be added from the sources indicated , these will be sufficient for holding Cairo , Fort Holt , and Paducah , and to form the column proposed . " Again he says : " I have not designated any particular line or lines of movement ; that must be a matter of further study , if the general idea should be approved . Perhaps tfie main column should move from Smithland between the rivers by Dover , etc . Perhaps the line east of the Cumberland or west of the Tennessee would be preferable . " These quotations , taken in connection with the brilliant victories gained under Grant 's leadership . with a force of only 17,000 men and four ganboats , by the middle of February , together with the ungenerous treatment he subsequently received from Halleck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it clear that Sherman gave too much importance to the isolated conversation // SHERMAN 'S MEMOIRS . with Halleck , and could not have examined the evidence within his reach before distributing " the full credit " for this brilliant campaign . In reference to the battle of Shiloh , he makes it clear by a letter to the editor of the " United States Service Magazine , " published in 1865 and given in full in the appendix of Badeau 's first volume , that the battle field " was chosen by that veteran soldier MajorGeneral Chas . F. Smith , who ordered my division to disembark there and strike for the Charleston road . " It will be remembered that this was while Grant was detained at Donelson in arrest ; that he did not resume command till after the death of Smith , and was prevented by causes beyond his control from reaching the field till the battle had actually begun . Whatever faults , if any , were committed in the selection of this position , or in the failure to fortify it properly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , were clearly Smith 's or Sherman 's , and not Grant 's . Jomini lays it down as a rule that an invading army , after having passed beyond its primary base of operations , should establish secondary bases at convenient points , like the crossing of an important river , or at a point which can be reached by river navigation ; and that the troops " should throw up intrenched camps or t*le8 depont8 to protect the depots and to increase the strength of their positions . " He indicates clearly that in case the position . selected is on a navigable river the camp should be made on the enemy 's side ; but if there is the slightest chance of its being turned , it should also be fortified in the rear . The reasons for this are obvious and need not be discussed here . All writers on the art of war agree that intrenched camps are frequently useful and necessary , and that under circumstances like those which surrounded the Union army at this time on the Tennessee , they are imperatively demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always acted on the supposition that we were an invading army ; that our purpose was to move forward in force , make a lodgrneat on the Memphis and Charleston road , and thus repeat the grand tactics of Fort Donelson , by separating the rebels in the iiiterior from those at Memphis and on the Mississippi river . We did not fortify our camps against attack , because we had no orders to do so , and because such a course would have made our raw men timid . " Again , " At a later period of the war , we could have rendered this position impregnable in one night ; but at this time we did not do it , and it maybe that it is well that we did not . " And finally , " We had no intrenchments of any sort , on the theory that as soon as Buell 's army arrived we would march to Corinth and attack the enemy . " Now every officer who ever sat under the teaching of Mahan , or read his works , knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French army , with openings at intervala , are specially recommended to give confidence to raw troops , and that where a halt is made , like that at Pitts'burg* Landing , for the purpose of assembling an army and the necessary war material for a forward movement , it is the duty of the general commanding the advanced troops to intrench without orders . Where no halt is tG be made , and great celerity is required , as for instance in Butler 's movement , by the way of Bermuda Hundred , against the railroad from Richmond to Petersburg , no time should be wasted by the main body in intrenching , but it should move forward promptly , leaving a detachment behind for the purpose of throwing up a line of intrenchments . In view of the general principle just cited and the forcible illustration it received from the bloody battle of Shiloh itself , it is difficult to perceive wherein it can possibly be well , as intimated but not explained by General Sherman , that it was not observed upon that memorable occasion . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // SHERMAN 'S MEMOIRS . tions which grew out of the two days ' battle , with reference to the surprise of the Union forces and the part taken by the troops undei* Buell , it is proper to say that Sherman 's own conduct after the engagement began was characterized by the most untiring exertions and the greatest personal bravery , though his division disappeared almost entirely from the line of battle . His account of the battle , confined mostly to his official report , which he reaffirms and quotes at large , is unsatisfactory . It was questioned at the time by the officers of Buell 's army as well as by ex-Governor Stanton and others , and should have been strengthened by a careful and candid reconsideration of all the facts and official documents bearing upon the subject . Although he denies that he was surprised , he does not make it clear that he was properly informed of the enemy 's approach in force , or had fathomed his designs till after the action began . Had his camp been protected by a simple line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this question could never have arisen ; and he might have admitted as much without any sacrifice except a little pride of opinion . He praises Buell 's troops , and admits that their soldierly movements at once gave confidence to our newer and less disciplined men . In the letter previously referred to as having been published in the " United States Service Magazine , " he says : " I never was disposed , nor am I now , to question anything done by General Buell and his army , and know that approaching our field of battle by the rear , he encountered that sickening crowd of laggards and fugitives that excited his contempt , and that of his army , who never gave full credit to those in the front line who did fight hard , and who had at 4 r . M. checked the enemy , and were preparing the next day to assume the offensive . " These admissions are judicious and sensible , and ought to quiet all controversy as to the respective parts played by the two armies . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united at that place , and after relieving Grant from all active duty by announcing him as " second in command , " he reorganized the army , assigning Buell to the command of one wing , and Thomas to the other , with Sherman commanding a division under the latter . Alluding to this circumstance , Sherman , with a patriotic unselfishness worthy of all praise , says : " We were classmates , intimately acquainted , had served together in the old army and in Kentucky , and it made to us little difference who commanded the other , provided the good cause prevailed . " It will be remembered that Sherman had held the higher command in Kentucky after Anderson 's withdrawal , and that when hc and Thomas came together in the Atlanta campaign , he again held the superior place . The remarkable advance upon Corinth , in which the troops intrenched themselves every night and advanced during the day by " zig-zag and approach , " of which the first parallel was laid out over twenty miles from the point of attack , was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were widely dispersed over the zone of operations . This , it is *well known , was the work of Halleck , and cost the country many thousands of lives and a year of delay and humiliation . Sherman does not tarry to point out the valuable lesson which it should teach , but briefly mentioning the mistake , and rapidly sketching the incidents which took place in west Tennessee and northern Mississippi , he proceeds to the consideration of the expedition which he made in December , 1862 , down the Mississippi river , under the orders of General Grant . He frankly assumes all the blame for the failure of his effort to take Vicksburg at that time , and for the repulse which he met with at Chickasaw Bayou , though some of his subordinates were more to blame than himself . Under the influence of his imaginative temperament , he con-334 q SEPTEMnER , // qwq erate *gainst the poimts where the Mississippi Central crosses Big Black above Canton ; and lastly where the Vicksburg and Jackson railroad crosses the same river ( Big Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without quoting the military maxims which favor Grant 's plan instead of Sherman 's , or denying that Sherman 's was feasible , or dwelling upon the fact that a single retrograde step at that time would have been looked upon by the country as a national disaster and would have cost Grant his commission , it is enough to remark that the sequel fully vindicated Grant 's judgment and enrolled his name high up among the great masters of the military art . The campaign which followed the passage of the batteries at Yicksburg and Grand Gulf , and the landing at Bruinsburg , is incontestably the most complete in all respects that was ever conducted by an Amen . can general . It is shown by both Sherman and Badeau that it resulted in the capture or destruction of 56,000 out of an army only 60,000 strcng , removed the last barrier to the free navigation of the Mississippi from its source to the Gulf , severed the Confederacy into two parts between which communication for military purposes thereafter became impossible , and was , in short , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first vital blow against the rebellion . Furthermore , it was conducted throughout in strict conformity with the best precepts and examples of the art of war . The manoeuvres of Grant 's army between Port Gibson , Jackson , and Edwards station , and especially in the smaller triangle between Raymond , Jackson , and Bolton , resulting in the capture of Jackson , the separation of Johnston from Pemberton , and in the signal defeat of the latter at Champion 's hill , display in the highest degree the advantages of interior lines , celerity of motion , the concentration of masses against detachments , and the prompt seizure of vital points at the vital time . They were not exceeded in immediate successes or far-reaching results by Bonaparte 's ever memorable campaign of 1796 , in which he boldly threw himself by a rapid movement between the Austrians and Pi&amp;lmontese , and gained the memorable victories of Millesimo , Mondovi , and Lodi , nor even by his campaign of 1800 , inaugurated by the passage of the fortress at Bard , under cover of darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping everything before him , and gaining the crowning triumph of Marengo . Halleck justly compared the capture of Yicksburg to the capture of IJIm , and yet Sherman , under the influence of his constitutional tendencies , seems to maintain his preference for the plan proposed by himself . Perhaps his plan could have been conducted with less risk in case of disaster , and might have led to important results ; but no one can successfully contend that it could have possibly been either so complete or so beneficial to the national cause .
