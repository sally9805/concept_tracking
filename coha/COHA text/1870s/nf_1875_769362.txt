txt THE BEST PORTRAITS IN ENGRAVING . BY CHARLES SUMNER . Fifth Edition . FREDERICK KEPPEL &; CO . NEW YORK , 20 EAST 16th STREET . LONDON , PARIS , 3 DUKE STREET , ADELPHI. 27 QUAI DE L'HORLOGE . Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1875 , by FREDERICK KEPPEL , In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington . THE BEST PORTRAITS IN ENGRAVING . Engraving is one of the fine arts , and in this beautiful family has been the especial handmaiden of painting . Another sister is now coming forward to join this service , lending to it the charm of color . If , in our day , the " chromo " can do more than engraving , it can not impair the value of the early masters . With them there is no rivalry or competition . Historically , as well as aesthetically , they will be masters always . Everybody knows something of engraving , as of printing , with which it was associated in origin . School-books , illustrated papers , and shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while creating a transient interest , or , perhaps , quickening the taste , they furnish little with regard to the art itself , especially in other days . And yet , looking at an engraving , like looking at a book , may be the beginning of a new pleasure and a new study . Each person has his own story . Mine is simple . Suffering from continued prostration , disabling me from the ordinary activities of life , I turned to engravings for employment and pastime . With the invaluable assistance of that devoted connoisseur , the late Dr. Thies , I went through the Gray collection at Cambridge , enjoying it like a picture-gallery . Other collections in our country were examined also . Then , in Paris , while undergoing severe medical treatment , my daily medicine for weeks was the vast cabinet of engravings , then called Imperial , now National , counted by the million , where was everything to please or instruct . Thinking of those kindly portfolios , I make this record of gratitude , as to benefactors . Perhaps some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the solace that I did . Happily , it is not necessary to visit Paris for the purpose . Other collections , on a smaller scale , will furnish the same remedy . In any considerable collection , portraits occupy an important place . Their multitude may be inferred when I mention that , in one series of portfolios , in the Paris cabinet , I counted no less than forty-seven portraits of Franklin and forty-three of Lafayette , with an equal number of Washington , while all the early Presidents were numerously represented . But , in this large company , there are very few possessing artistic value . The great portraits of modern times constitute a very short list , like the great poems or histories , and it is the same with engravings as with pictures . Sir Joshua Reynolds , explaining the difference between an historical painter and a portrait-painter , remarks that the former " paints men in general , a portrait-painter a particular man , and consequently a defective model . " 1 A portrait , therefore , may be an accurate presentment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other things , genius exercises its accustomed sway without limitation . Even the difficulties of a " defective model " did not prevent Raffaelle , Titian , Rembrandt , Rubens , Velasquez , or Vandyck from producing portraits precious in the history of art . It would be easy to mention heads by Raffaelle , yielding in value to only two or three of his larger masterpieces , like the Dresden Madonna . Charles the Fifth stooped to pick up the pencil of Titian , saying " it becomes Caesar to serve Titian ! " True enough ; but this unprecedented compliment from the imperial successor of Charlemagne attests the glory of the portrait-painter . The female figures of Titian , so much admired under the names of Flora , La Bella , his daughter , his mistress , and even his Venus , were portraits from life . Rembrandt turned from his great triumphs in his own peculiar school to portraits of unwonted power ; so also did Rubens , showing that in this department his universality of conquest was not arrested . To these must be added Velasquez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame especially as portrait-painters . And what other title has Sir Joshua himself ? Sidenote : Suyderhoef . Historical pictures are often collections of portraits arranged so as to illustrate an important event . Such is the famous PEACE OF MUeNSTER , by Terburg , just presented by a liberal Englishman to the National Gallery at London . Here are the plenipotentiaries of Holland , Spain , and Austria , uniting in the great treaty which constitutes an epoch in the Law of Nations . The engraving by Suyderhoef is rare and interesting . Similar in character is the Death of Chatham , by Copley , where the illustrious statesman is surrounded by the peers he had been addressing  --  every one a portrait . To this list must be added the pictures by Trumbull in the Rotunda of the Capitol at Washington , especially the Declaration of Independence , in which Thackeray took a sincere interest . Standing before these , the author and artist said to me , " These are the best pictures in the country , " and he proceeded to remark on their honesty and fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unquestionably the finest assemblage of portraits anywhere is that of the artists occupying two halls in the gallery at Florence , being autographs contributed by the masters themselves . Here is Raffaelle , with chestnut-brown hair , and dark eyes full of sensibility , painted when he was twenty-three , and known by the engraving of Forster  --  Julio Romano , in black and red chalk on paper ,  --  Massaccio , called the father of painting , much admired  --  Leonardo da Vinci , beautiful and grand ,  --  Titian , rich and splendid ,  --  Pietro Perugino , remarkable for execution and expression ,  --  Albert Duerer , rigid but masterly ,  --  Gerhard Dow , finished according to his own exacting style ,  --  and Reynolds , with fresh English face ; but these are only examples of this incomparable collection , which was begun as far back as the Cardinal Leopold de Medici , and has been happily continued to the present time . Here are the lions , painted by themselves , except , perhaps , the foremost of all , Michael Angelo , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this collection is confirmed by that of any group of historic artists . Their portraits excel those of statesmen , soldiers , or divines , as is easily seen by engravings accessible to all . The engraved heads in Arnold Houbraken 's biographies of the Dutch and Flemish painters , in three volumes , are a family of rare beauty. 2 The relation of engraving to painting is often discussed ; but nobody has treated it with more knowledge or sentiment than the consummate engraver Longhi in his interesting work , La Calcografia. 3 Dwelling on the general aid it renders to the lovers of art , he claims for it greater merit in " publishing and immortalizing the portraits of eminent men for the example of the present and future generations ; " and , " better than any other art , serving as the vehicle for the most extended and remote propagation of deserved celebrity . " Even great monuments in porphyry and bronze are less durable than these light and fragile impressions subject to all the chances of wind , water , and fire , but prevailing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is with engravings as with books ; nor is this the only resemblance between them . According to Longhi , an engraving is not a copy or imitation , as is sometimes insisted , but a translation . The engraver translates into another language , where light and shade supply the place of colors . The duplication of a book in the same language is a copy , and so is the duplication of a picture in the same material . Evidently an engraving is not a copy ; it does not reproduce the original picture , except in drawing and expression ; nor is it a mere imitation , but , as Bryant 's Homer and Longfellow 's Dante are presentations of the great originals in another language , so is the engraving a presentation of painting in another material which is like another language . Thus does the engraver vindicate his art . But nobody can examine a choice print without feeling that it has a merit of its own different from any picture , and inferior only to a good picture . A work of Raffaelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an engraving of Longhi or Morghen than in any ordinary copy , and would probably cost more in the market . A good engraving is an undoubted work of art , but this can not be said of many pictures , which , like Peter Pindar 's razors , seem made to sell . Much that belongs to the painter belongs also to the engraver , who must have the same knowledge of contours , the same power of expression , the same sense of beauty , and the same ability in drawing with sureness of sight as if , according to Michael Angelo , he had " a pair of compasses in his eyes . " These qualities in a high degree make the artist , whether painter or engraver , naturally excelling in portraits . But choice portraits are less numerous in engraving than in painting , for the reason , that painting does not always find a successful translator . Illustration : PHILIP MELANCTHON . ( Engraved by Albert Duerer from his own Design . ) Sidenote : Duerer . The earliest engraved portraits which attract attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , translating himself . His eminence as painter was continued as engraver . Here he surpassed his predecessors , Martin Schoen in Germany , and Mantegna in Italy , so that Longhi does not hesitate to say that he was the first who carried the art from infancy in which he found it to a condition not far from flourishing adolescence . But , while recognizing his great place in the history of engraving , it is impossible not to see that he is often hard and constrained , if not unfinished . His portrait of ERASMUS is justly famous , and is conspicuous among the prints exhibited in the British Museum . It is dated 1526 , two years before the death of Duerer , and has helped to extend the fame of the universal scholar and approved man of letters , who in his own age filled a sphere not unlike that of Voltaire in a later century . There is another portrait of Erasmus by Holbein , often repeated , so that two great artists have contributed to his renown . That by Duerer is admired . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowers , shows the care in its execution ; but it wants expression , and the hands are far from graceful . Another most interesting portrait by Duerer , executed in the same year with the Erasmus , is PHILIP MELANCTHON , the St. John of the Reformation , sometimes called the teacher of Germany . Luther , while speaking of himself as rough , boisterous , stormy , and altogether warlike , says , " but Master Philippus comes along softly and gently , sowing and watering with joy according to the rich gifts which God has bestowed upon him . " At the date of the print he was twenty-nine years of age , and the countenance shows the mild reformer . Sidenote : Caracci . Agostino Caracci , of the Bolognese family , memorable in art , added to considerable success as painter undoubted triumphs as engraver . His prints are numerous , and many are regarded with favor ; but out of the long list not one is so sure of that longevity allotted to art as his portrait of TITIAN , which bears date 1587 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over it is the inscription , Titiani Vicellii Pictoris celeberrimi ac famosissimi vera effigies , to which is added beneath , Cujus nomen orbis continere non valet ! Although founded on originals by Titian himself , it was probably designed by the remarkable engraver . It is very like , and yet unlike the familiar portrait of which we have a recent engraving by Mandel , from a repetition in the gallery of Berlin . Looking at it , we are reminded of the terms by which Vasari described the great painter , guidicioso , bello e stupendo . Such a head , with such visible power , justifies these words , or at least makes us believe them entirely applicable . It is bold , broad , strong , and instinct with life . This print , like the Erasmus of Duerer , is among those selected for exhibition at the British Museum , and it deserves the honor . Though only paper with black lines , it is , by the genius of the artist , as good as a picture . In all engraving nothing is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Harlem , excellent as painter , but , like the Italian , pre-eminent as engraver . His prints show mastery of the art , making something like an epoch in its history . His unwearied skill in the use of the burin appears in a tradition gathered by Longhi from Wille , that , having commenced a line , he carried it to the end without once stopping , while the long and bright threads of copper turned up were brushed aside by his flowing beard , which at the end of a day 's labor so shone in the light of a candle that his companions nicknamed him " the man with the golden beard . " There are prints by him which shine more than his beard . Among his masterpieces is the portrait of his instructor , THEODORE COERNHERT , engraver , poet , musician , and vindicator of his country , and author of the national air , " William of Orange , " whose passion for liberty did not prevent him from giving to the world translations of Cicero 's Offices and Seneca 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as large as life , is one of the most important in the art . Among the numerous prints by Goltzius , these two will always be conspicuous . Illustration : JAN LUTMA . ( Etched by Rembrandt from his own Design . ) Sidenote : Pontius . Sidenote : Rembrandt . Sidenote : Visscher . In Holland Goltzius had eminent successors . Among these were Paul Pontius , designer and engraver , whose portrait of RUBENS is of great life and beauty , and Rembrandt , who was not less masterly in engraving than in painting , as appears sufficiently in his portraits of the BURGOMASTER SIX , the two COPPENOLS , the ADVOCATE TOLLING , the goldsmith LUTMA , all showing singular facility and originality . Contemporary with Rembrandt was Cornelis Visscher , also designer and engraver , whose portraits were unsurpassed in boldness and picturesque effect . At least one authority has accorded to this artist the palm of engraving , hailing him as Corypheus of the art . Among his successful portraits is that of a CAT ; but all yield to what are known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RYCK , an ophthalmist at Amsterdam , and of GELLIUS DE BOUMA , the Zutphen ecclesiastic . The latter is especially famous . In harmony with the beard is the heavy face , seventy-seven years old , showing the fulness of long-continued potation , and hands like the face , original and powerful , if not beautiful . Illustration : THE SLEEPING CAT . ( Engraved by Cornelis Visscher from his own Design . ) Sidenote : Vandyck . In contrast with Visscher was his companion Vandyck , who painted portraits with constant beauty and carried into etching the same Virgilian taste and skill . His aquafortis was not less gentle than his pencil . Among his etched portraits I would select that of SNYDERS , the animal painter , as extremely beautiful . M. Renouvier , in his learned and elaborate work , Des Types et des Manieres des Maitres Graveurs , though usually moderate in praise , speaks of these sketches as " possessing a boldness and delicacy which charm , being taken , at the height of his genius , by the painter who knew the best how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrative instances from Germany , Italy , and Holland . As yet , power rather than beauty presided , unless in the etchings of Vandyck . But the reign of Louis XIV . was beginning to assert a supremacy in engraving as in literature . The great school of French engravers which appeared at this time brought the art to a splendid perfection , which many think has not been equalled since , so that Masson , Nanteuil , Edelinck , and Drevet may claim fellowship in genius with their immortal contemporaries , Corneille , Racine , La Fontaine , and Moliere . Illustration : THE SUDARIUM OF ST . VERONICA . ( Engraved by Claude Mellan from his own Design . ) Sidenote : Mellan . The school was opened by Claude Mellan , more known as engraver than painter , and also author of most of the designs he engraved . His life , beginning with the sixteenth century , was protracted beyond ninety years , not without signal honor , for his name appears among the " Illustrious Men " of France , in the beautiful volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he practiced . One of his works , for a long time much admired , was described by this author : " It is a Christ 's head , designed and shaded , with his crown of thorns and the blood that gushes forth from all parts , by one single stroke , which , beginning at the tip of the nose , and so still circling on , forms most exactly everything that is represented in this plate , only by the different thickness of the stroke , which , according as it is more or less swelling , makes the eyes , nose , mouth , cheeks , hair , blood , and thorns ; the whole so well represented and with such expressions of pain and affliction , that nothing is more dolorous or touching . " 4 This print is known as the SUDARIUM OF ST . VERONICA . Longhi records that it was thought at the time " inimitable , " and was praised " to the skies ; " but people think differently now . At best it is a curiosity among portraits . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print on the walls of the room occupied by the director of the Imperial Cabinet of Engravings at St. Petersburgh . Sidenote : Morin . Morin was a contemporary of Mellan , and less famous at the time . His style of engraving was peculiar , being a mixture of strokes and dots , but so harmonized as to produce a pleasing effect . One of the best engraved portraits in the history of the art is his CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO ; but here he translated Vandyck , whose picture is among his best . A fine impression of this print is a choice possession . Illustration : CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO . ( Painted by Anthony Van Dyck , and Engraved by Jean Morin . ) Sidenote : Masson . Among French masters Antoine Masson is conspicuous for brilliant hardihood of style , which , though failing in taste , is powerful in effect . Metal , armor , velvet , feather , seem as if painted . He is also most successful in the treatment of hair . His immense skill made him welcome difficulties , as if to show his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , COMTE D'HARCOURT , known as Cadet a la Perle , from the pearl in the ear , with the date 1667 , is often placed at the head of engraved portraits , although not particularly pleasing or interesting . The vigorous countenance is aided by the gleam and sheen of the various substances entering into the costume . Less powerful , but having a charm of its own , is that of BRISACIER , known as the GRAY-HAIRED MAN , executed in 1664 . The remarkable representation of hair in this print has been a model for artists , especially for Longhi , who recounts that he copied it in his head of Washington . Somewhat similar is the head of CHARRIER , the criminal judge at Lyons . Though inferior in hair , it surpasses the other in expression . Sidenote : Nanteuil . Nanteuil was an artist of different character , being to Masson as Vandyck to Visscher , with less of vigor than beauty . His original genius was refined by classical studies , and quickened by diligence . Though dying at the age of forty-eight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , nearly all portraits . The favor he enjoyed during life was not diminished with time . His works illustrate the reign of Louis XIV. , and are still admired . Among these are portraits of the KING , ANNIE OF AUSTRIA , JOHN BAPTISTE VAN STEENBERGHEN , the Advocate-General of Holland , a heavy Dutchman , FRANCOIS DE LA MOTTE LE VAYER , a fine and delicate work , TURENNE , COLBERT , LAMOIGNON , the poet LORET , MARIDAT DE SERRIERE , LOUISE-MARIE DE GONZAGUE , LOUIS HESSELIN , CHRISTINE OF SWEDEN  --  all masterpieces ; but above these is the POMPONE DE BELLIEVRE , foremost among his masterpieces , and a chief masterpiece of art , being , in the judgment of more than one connoisseur , the most beautiful engraved portrait that exists . That excellent authority , Dr. Thies , who knew engraving more thoroughly and sympathetically than any person I remember in our country , said in a letter to myself , as long ago as March , 1858 : " When I call Nanteuil 's Pompone the handsomest engraved portrait , I express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable engraved portraits at the royal cabinet of engravings at Dresden , and at the large and exquisite collection there of the late King of Saxony , and in which I was confirmed or perhaps , to which I was led , by the director of the two establishments , the late Professor Frenzel . " And after describing this head , the learned connoisseur proceeds :  --  " There is an air of refinement , vornehmheit , round the mouth and nose as in no other engraving . Color and life shine through the skin , and the lips appear red . " It is bold , perhaps , thus to exalt a single portrait , giving to it the palm of Venus ; nor do I know that it is entirely proper to classify portraits according to beauty . In disputing about beauty , we are too often lost in the variety of individual tastes , and yet each person knows when he is touched . In proportion as multitudes are touched , there must be merit . As in music a simple heart-melody is often more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so in engraving the sense of the beautiful may prevail over all else , and this is the case with the Pompone , although there are portraits by others showing higher art . No doubt there have been as handsome men , whose portraits were engraved , but not so well . I know not if Pompone was what would be called a handsome man , although his air is noble and his countenance bright . But among portraits more boldly , delicately , or elaborately engraved , there are very few to contest the palm of beauty . Illustration : POMPONE DE BELLIEVRE . ( Painted by Charles Le Brun , and Engraved by Robert Nanteuil . ) And who is this handsome man to whom the engraver has given a lease of fame ? Son , nephew , and grandson of eminent magistrates , high in the nobility of the robe , with two grandfathers chancellors of France , himself at the head of the magistry of France , first President of Parliament according to inscription on the engraving , Senatus Franciae Princeps , ambassador to Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cardinal Mazarin with the impossible duty of making peace between the Long Parliament and Charles the First , and at his death , great benefactor of the General Hospital of Paris , bestowing upon it riches and the very bed on which he died . Such is the simple catalogue , and yet it is all forgotten . A Funeral Panegyric pronounced at his death , now before me in the original pamphlet of the time , 5 testifies to more than family or office . In himself he was much , and not of those who , according to the saying of St. Bernard , give out smoke rather than light . Pure glory and innocent riches were his , which were more precious in the sight of good men , and he showed himself incorruptible , and not to be bought at any price . It were easy for him to have turned a deluge of wealth into his house ; but he knew that gifts insensibly corrupt ,  --  that the specious pretext of gratitude is the snare in which the greatest souls allow themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in setting himself against injustice in all its forms , and that a magistrate divided between a sense of obligations received and the care of the public interest , which he ought always to promote , is a paralytic magistrate , a magistrate deprived of a moiety of himself . So spoke the preacher , while he portrayed a charity tender and prompt for the wretched , a vehemence just and inflexible to the dishonest and wicked , with a sweetness noble and beneficent for all ; dwelling also on his countenance , which had not that severe and sour austerity that renders justice to the good only with regret , and to the guilty only with anger ; then on his pleasant and gracious address , his intellectual and charming conversation , his ready and judicious replies , his agreeable and intelligent silence , his refusals , which were well received and obliging ; while , amidst all the pomp and splendor accompanying him , there shone in his eyes a certain air of humanity and majesty , which secured for him , and for justice itself , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not content with giving only his own , he gave with a beautiful manner still more rare . He could not abide beauty of intelligence without goodness of soul , and he preferred always the poor , having for them not only compassion but a sort of reverence . He knew that the way to take the poison from riches was to make them tasted by those who had them not . The sentiment of Christian charity for the poor , who were to him in the place of children , was his last thought , as witness especially the General Hospital endowed by him , and presented by the preacher as the greatest and most illustrious work ever undertaken by charity the most heroic . Thus lived and died the splendid Pompone de Bellievre , with no other children than his works . Celebrated at the time by a Funeral Panegyric now forgotten , and placed among the Illustrious Men of France in a work remembered only for its engraved portraits , his famous life shrinks , in the voluminous Biographie Universelle of Michaud , to the seventh part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Didot disappears entirely . History forgets to mention him . But the lofty magistrate , ambassador , and benefactor , founder of a great hospital , can not be entirely lost from sight so long as his portrait by Nanteuil holds a place in art . Sidenote : Edelinck . Younger than Nanteuil by ten years , Gerard Edelinck excelled him in genuine mastery . Born at Antwerp , he became French by adoption , occupying apartments in the Gobelins , and enjoying a pension from Louis XIV . Longhi says that he is the engraver whose works , not only according to his own judgment , but that of the most intelligent , deserve the first place among exemplars , and he attributes to him all perfections in highest degree , design , chiaro-oscuro , aerial perspective , local tints , softness , lightness , variety , in short everything which can enter into the most exact representation of the true and beautiful without the aid of color . Others may have surpassed him in particular things , but , according to the Italian teacher , he remains by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic calls him " king . " It requires no remarkable knowledge to recognize his great merits . Evidently he is a master , exercising sway with absolute art , and without attempts to bribe the eye by special effects of light , as on metal or satin . Among his conspicuous productions is the TENT OF DARIUS , a large engraving on two sheets , after Le Brun , where the family of the Persian monarch prostrate themselves before Alexander , who approaches with Hephaestion . There is also a HOLY FAMILY , after Raffaelle , and the BATTLE OF THE STANDARD , after Leonardo da Vinci ; but these are less interesting than his numerous portraits , among which that of PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE is the chief masterpiece ; but there are others of signal merit , including especially that of MADAME HELIOT , or La Belle Religieuse , a beautiful French coquette praying before a crucifix ; MARTIN VAN DER BOGAERT , a sculptor ; FREDERIC LEONARD , printer to the king ; MOUTON , the Lute-player ; MARTINUS DILGERUS , with a venerable beard white with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of POMPONE DE BELLIEVRE which will be found among the prints of Perrault 's Illustrious Men . The PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE is the head of that eminent French artist after a painting by himself , and it contests the palm with the Pompone . Mr. Marsh , who is an authority , prefers it . Dr. Thies , who places the latter first in beauty , is constrained to allow that the other is " superior as a work of the graver , " being executed with all the resources of the art in its chastest form . The enthusiasm of Longhi finds expression in unusual praise : " The work which goes the most to my blood , and with regard to which Edelinck , with good reason , congratulated himself , is the portrait of Champaigne . I shall die before I cease to contemplate it with wonder always new . Here is seen how he was equally great as designer and engraver . " 6 Illustration : MARTIN VAN DER BOGAERT . ( Painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud , and Engraved by Gerard Edelinck . ) And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , the eyes living and seeing , the moistened lips , the chin covered with a beard unshaven for a few days , and the hair in all its forms . Between the rival portraits by Nanteuil and Edelinck it is unnecessary to decide . Each is beautiful . In looking at them we recognize anew the transient honors of public service . The present fame of Champaigne surpasses that of Pompone . The artist outlives the magistrate . But does not the poet tell us that " the artist never dies ? " Sidenote : Drevet . As Edelinck passed from the scene , the family of Drevet appeared , especially the son , Pierre Imbert Drevet , born in 1697 , who developed a rare excellence , improving even upon the technics of his predecessor , and gilding his refined gold . The son was born engraver , for at the age of thirteen he produced an engraving of exceeding merit . He manifested a singular skill in rendering different substances , like Masson , by the effect of light , and at the same time gave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these he added great richness in picturing costumes and drapery , especially in lace . He was eminently a portrait engraver , which I must insist is the highest form of the art , as the human face is the most important object for its exercise . Less clear and simple than Nanteuil , and less severe than Edelinck , he gave to the face individuality of character , and made his works conspicuous in art . If there was excess in the accessories , it was before the age of Sartor Resartus , and he only followed the prevailing style in the popular paintings of Hyacinthe Rigaud . Art in all its forms had become florid , if not meretricious , and Drevet was a representative of his age . Among his works are important masterpieces . I name only BOSSUET , the famed eagle of Meaux ; SAMUEL BERNARD , the rich Councillor of State ; FENELON , the persuasive teacher and writer ; CARDINAL DUBOIS , the unprincipled minister , and the favorite of the Regent of France ; and ADRIENNE LE COUVREUR , the beautiful and unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The portrait of Bossuet has everything to attract and charm . There stands the powerful defender of the Catholic Church , master of French style , and most renowned pulpit orator of France , in episcopal robes , with abundant lace , which is the perpetual envy of the fair who look at this transcendent effort . The ermine of Dubois is exquisite , but the general effect of this portrait does not compare with the Bossuet , next to which , in fascination , I put the Adrienne . At her death the actress could not be buried in consecrated ground ; but through art she has the perpetual companionship of the greatest bishop of France . Illustration : JACQUES BENIGNE BOSSUET , BISHOP OF MEAUX . ( Painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud , and Engraved by Pierre Imbert Drevet . ) Sidenote : Balechou . Sidenote : Beauvarlet . Sidenote : Ficquet . With the younger Drevet closed the classical period of portraits in engraving , as just before had closed the Augustan age of French literature . Louis XIV . decreed engraving a fine art , and established an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and the great aristocracy created a demand which the genius of the age supplied . The heights that had been reached could not be maintained . There were eminent engravers still ; but the zenith had been passed . Balechou , who belonged to the reign of Louis XV. , and Beauvarlet , whose life was protracted beyond the reign of terror , both produced portraits of merit . The former is noted for a certain clearness and brilliancy , but with a hardness , as of brass or marble , and without entire accuracy of design ; the latter has much softness of manner . They were the best artists of France at the time ; but none of their portraits are famous . To these may be added another contemporary artist , without predecessor or successor , Stephen Ficquet , unduly disparaged in one of the dictionaries as " a reputable French engraver , " but undoubtedly remarkable for small portraits , not unlike miniatures , of exquisite finish . Among these the rarest and most admired are LA FONTAINE , MADAME DE MAINTENON , RUBENS and VANDYCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other engravers belong to this intermediate period , though not French in origin : Georg F. Schmidt , born at Berlin , 1712 , and Johann Georg Wille , born in the small town of Koenigsberg , in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt , 1717 , but attracted to Paris , they became the greatest engravers of the time . Their work is French , and they are the natural development of that classical school . Sidenote : Schmidt . Schmidt was the son of a poor weaver , and lost six precious years as a soldier in the artillery at Berlin . Owing to the smallness of his size he was at length dismissed , when he surrendered to a natural talent for engraving . Arriving at Strasburg , on his way to Paris , he fell in with Wille , a wandering gunsmith , who joined him in his journey , and eventually , in his studies . The productions of Schmidt show ability , originality , and variety , rather than taste . His numerous portraits are excellent , being free and life-like , while the accessories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etcher he ranks next after Rembrandt . Of his portraits executed with the graver , that of the EMPRESS ELIZABETH OF RUSSIA is usually called the most important , perhaps on account of the imperial theme , and next those of COUNT RASSAMOWSKY , COUNT ESTERHAZY , and DE MOUNSEY , which he engraved while in St. Petersburgh , where he was called by the Empress , founding there the Academy of Engraving . But his real masterpieces are unquestionably PIERRE MIGNARD and LATOUR , French painters , the latter represented laughing . Illustration : L'INSTRUCTION PATERNELLE , ( THE " SATIN GOWN . " ) ( Painted by Gerard Terburg , and Engraved by Johann Georg Wille . ) Sidenote : Wille . Wille lived to old age , not dying till 1808 . During this long life he was active in the art to which he inclined naturally . His mastership of the graver was perfect , lending itself especially to the representation of satin and metal , although less happy with flesh . His SATIN GOWN , or L'Instruction Paternelle , after Terburg , and Les Musiciens Ambulans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind in engraving is finer . His style was adapted to pictures of the Dutch school , and to portraits with rich surroundings . Of the latter the principal are COMTE DE SAINT-FLORENTIN , POISSON MARQUIS DE MARIGNY , JOHN DE BOULLONGNE , and the CARDINAL DE TENCIN . Sidenote : Bervic . Sidenote : Toschi . Sidenote : Desnoyers . Sidenote : Mueller . Sidenote : Vangelisti . Sidenote : Anderloni and Jesi . Especially eminent was Wille as a teacher . Under his influence the art assumed a new life , so that he became father of the modern school . His scholars spread everywhere , and among them are acknowledged masters . He was teacher of Bervic , whose portrait of Louis XVI . in his coronation robes is of a high order , himself teacher of the Italian Toschi , who , after an eminent career , died as late as 1858 ; also teacher of Tardieu , himself teacher of the brilliant Desnoyers , whose portrait of the EMPEROR NAPOLEON IN HIS CORONATION ROBES is the fit complement to that of LOUIS XVI. ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself father and teacher of J. Frederick von Mueller , engraver of the SISTINE MADONNA , in a plate whose great fame is not above its merit ; also teacher of the Italian Vangelisti , himself teacher of the unsurpassed Longhi , in whose school were Anderloni and Jesi . Thus not only by his works , but by his famous scholars , did the humble gunsmith gain sway in art . Illustration : NAPOLEON I. ( Painted by Francois Gerard , and Engraved by Auguste Boucher Desnoyers . ) Among portraits by this school deserving especial mention is that of KING JEROME OF WESTPHALIA , brother of Napoleon , by the two Muellers , where the genius of the artist is most conspicuous , although the subject contributes little . As in the case of the Palace of the Sun , described by Ovid , Materiam superabat opus . This work is a beautiful example of skill in representation of fur and lace , not yielding even to Drevet . Sidenote : Longhi . Longhi was a universal master , and his portraits are only parts of his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on Stuart 's painting , but after a design of his own , which is now in the possession of the Swiss Consul at Venice . The artist felicitated himself on the hair , which is modelled after the French masters. 7 The portraits of MICHAEL ANGELO , and of DANDOLO , the venerable Doge of Venice , are admired ; so also is the NAPOLEON , AS KING OF ITALY , with the iron crown and finest lace . But his chief portrait is that of EUGENE BEAUHARNAIS , VICEROY OF ITALY , full length , remarkable for plume in the cap , which is finished with surpassing skill . Sidenote : Morghen . Contemporary with Longhi was another Italian engraver of widely extended fame , who was not the product of the French school , Raffaelle Morghen , born at Florence in 1758 . His works have enjoyed a popularity beyond those of other masters , partly from the interest of their subjects , and partly from their soft and captivating style , although they do not possess the graceful power of Nanteuil and Edelinck , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Rome ; himself scholar of Wagner , of Venice , whose homely round faces were not high models in art . The AURORA , OF GUIDO , and the LAST SUPPER , OF LEONARDO DA VINCI , stand high in engraving , especially the latter , which occupied Morghen three years . Of his two hundred and one works , no less than seventy-three are portraits , among which are the Italian poets DANTE , PETRARCH , ARIOSTO , TASSO , also BOCCACCIO , and a head called RAFFAELLE , but supposed to be that of BENDO ALTOVITI , the great painter 's friend , and especially the DUKE OF MENCADA on horseback , after Vandyck , which has received warm praise . But none of his portraits is calculated to give greater pleasure than that of LEONARDO DA VINCI , which may vie in beauty even with the famous Pompone . Here is the beauty of years and of serene intelligence . Looking at that tranquil countenance , it is easy to imagine the large and various capacities which made him not only painter , but sculptor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even predecessor of Galileo and Bacon . Such a character deserves the immortality of art . Happily an old Venetian engraving reproduced in our day , 8 enables us to see this same countenance at an earlier period of life , with sparkle in the eye . Illustration : GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO Firenze presso Luigi Bardi e C'Borgo degli Albizzi No 460 Raffaelle Morghen left no scholars who have followed him in portraits ; but his own works are still regarded , and a monument in Santa Croce , the Westminster Abbey of Florence , places him among the mighty dead of Italy . Sidenote : Houbraken Thus far nothing has been said of English engravers . Here , as in art generally , England seems removed from the rest of the world ; Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos . But though beyond the sphere of Continental art , the island of Shakespeare was not inhospitable to some of its representatives . Vandyck , Rubens , Sir Peter Lely , and Sir Godfrey Kneller , all Dutch artists , painted the portraits of Englishmen , and engraving was first illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1698 , was employed to execute portraits for Birch 's " Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain , " published at London in 1743 , and in these works may be seen the aesthetic taste inherited from his father , author of the biography of Dutch artists , and improved by study of the French masters . Although without great force or originality of manner , many of these have positive beauty . I would name especially the SIR WALTER RALEIGH and JOHN DRYDEN . Illustration : MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS . ( Painted by Federigo Zuccaro , and Engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi . ) Sidenote : Bartolozzi . Different in style was Bartolozzi , the Italian , who made his home in England for forty years , ending in 1807 , when he removed to Lisbon . The considerable genius which he possessed was spoilt by haste in execution , superseding that care which is an essential condition of art . Hence sameness in his work and indifference to the picture he copied . Longhi speaks of him as " most unfaithful to his archetypes , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among his portraits of especial interest are several old " wigs , " as MANSFIELD and THURLOW ; also the DEATH OF CHATHAM , after the picture of Copley in the Vernon Gallery . But his prettiest piece undoubtedly is MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS , with her little son James I. , after what Mrs. Jameson calls " the lovely picture of Zuccaro at Chiswick . " In the same style are his vignettes , which are of acknowledged beauty . Sidenote : Strange . Meanwhile a Scotchman honorable in art comes upon the scene  --  Sir Robert Strange , born in the distant Orkneys in 1721 , who abandoned the law for engraving . As a youthful Jacobite he joined the Pretender in 1745 , sharing the disaster of Culloden , and owing his safety from pursuers to a young lady dressed in the ample costume of the period , whom he afterwards married in gratitude , and they were both happy . He has a style of his own , rich , soft , and especially charming in the tints of flesh , making him a natural translator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VENUS and the DANAE after the great Venetian colorist , but the CLEOPATRA , though less famous , is not inferior in merit . His acknowledged masterpiece is the MADONNA OF ST . JEROME called THE DAY , after the picture by Correggio , in the gallery of Parma , but his portraits after Vandyck are not less fine , while they are more interesting  --  as CHARLES FIRST , with a large hat , by the side of his horse , which the Marquis of Hamilton is holding , and that of the same Monarch standing in his ermine robes ; also the THREE ROYAL CHILDREN with two King Charles spaniels at their feet , also HENRIETTA MARIA , the Queen of Charles . That with the ermine robes is supposed to have been studied by Raffaelle Morghen , called sometimes an imitator of Strange. 9 To these I would add the rare autograph PORTRAIT OF THE ENGRAVER , being a small head after Greuze , which is simple and beautiful . Illustration : JOHN HUNTER ( Painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds , and Engraved by William Sharp . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue . It is that of William Sharp , who was born at London in 1746 , and died there in 1824 . Though last in order , this engraver may claim kindred with the best . His first essays were the embellishment of pewter pots , from which he ascended to the heights of art , showing a power rarely equalled . Without any instance of peculiar beauty , his works are constant in character and expression , with every possible excellence of execution ; face , form , drapery  --  all are as in nature . His splendid qualities appear in the DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH , which has taken its place as the first of English engravings . It is after the picture of Guido , once belonging to the Houghton gallery , which in an evil hour for English taste was allowed to enrich the collection of the Hermitage at St. Petersburgh ; and I remember well that this engraving by Sharp was one of the few ornaments in the drawing-room of Macaulay when I last saw him , shortly before his lamented death . Next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STORM , after the picture by West , now in the Boston Athenaeum , and his SORTIE FROM GIBRALTAR , after the picture by Trumbull , also in the Boston Athenaeum . Thus , through at least two of his masterpieces whose originals are among us , is our country associated with this great artist . It is of portraits especially that I write , and here Sharp is truly eminent . All that he did was well done ; but two were models ; that of MR . BOULTON , a strong , well-developed country gentleman , admirably executed , and of JOHN HUNTER , the eminent surgeon , after the painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds , in the London College of Surgeons , unquestionably the foremost portrait in English art , and the coequal companion of the great portraits in the past ; but here the engraver united his rare gifts with those of the painter . Sidenote : Mandel . In closing these sketches I would have it observed that this is no attempt to treat of engraving generally , or of prints in their mass or types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stop now just as we arrive at contemporary examples , abroad and at home , with the gentle genius of Mandel beginning to ascend the sky , and our own engravers appearing on the horizon . There is also a new and kindred art , infinite in value , where the sun himself becomes artist , with works which mark an epoch . CHARLES SUMNER . WASHINGTON , 11TH DEC. , 1871 .
