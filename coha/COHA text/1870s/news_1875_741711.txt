txt New-York contains the largest population of any city in the United States . It has the greatest number of people who are to be amused or instructed by plays , operas , or other dramatic and musical performances Metropolitan audiences have a wide range from which to choose their entertainment . They are exacting , not easily captivated , and , to some extent at least , critical . New plays and new actors , accordingly , usually receive the stamp of approval here before they are expected to succeed elsewhere . This is , not an anomalous state of things . Generally speaking , it is true of any country iu which . there is a large capital city . When a new play is produced at Glasgow , or Dublin , the opinions of London critics , rather than those of Liverpool or Manchester , would be quoted for the enlightenment of play-goers . We might as well be expected to go to Oshkosh to find the latest fashions in woman 's gear , as to inquire of any of the cities of the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing on the theatrical horizon . Such an appearance outside of New-York might well be regarded as a phenomenon . But some American cities seem restive under the imputation of " provincialism " which this condition of facts imposes upon them . Chicago , for example , that brightest , busiest , and most self-asserting city of the North-west , chafes not a little under its quasi dependence upon New-York . ? Even so genial a paper as the Chicago Tribune is disposed to rate its home readers soundly for their " slavish tendency to ape the opinions of the biggest city . " It calls upon Chicago people to decide for themselves whether a play is good or not , and to cease professing to like a play because somebody else has said it is good . We have heard something like this before . It is a common complaint . The corrective which Chicago proposes for itself is certainly radical , as well as peculiar . The managers of two Chicago theatres are to produce plays written by local authors . If these succeed , not only will " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " according to the Tribune , but the example of Chicago will be generally imitated , " and a better day will dawn for the American dramatist and . the American stage . " Let us add that actors and managers will then flee from New-York to secure the plays which they can not find here . Now , the fact is that good American plays are greatly desired by theatrical people . It is not true that the country is " full of mute , inglorious Sheridans and Goldsmiths " because of the limited capacity for production in the theatres of the Metropolis , as New-York is called . If our Western or Eastern friends are hiding inglorious geniuses who should be writing great plays , they are wronging the whole country . One such man , or a dozen such men , will find welcome and a market iii New-York , though Chicago hesitate to applaud , and Boston turns a cold shoulder . The same is true of actors . No " star " will be satisfied with his stellar brilliancy until he has shone in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called provincial theatres ever discover such a luminary , they are not satisfied ; until he has added Metropolitan approval to his cap-sheaf of success . Similarly , the painter who has charmed . Steilacoom or Miami with his works , comes straight to New-York , if he would be quite sure of his being a genius . Whose fault is it The fact is that the market for literary and . artistic products establishes its own standard of criticism . , It is not surprising that Chicago , for example , should happen to defer involuntarily to the criticism of New York , rather than set up its own . It is a saving of mental labor ; many a man asks his neighbor , " What do you think of this book I " before he buys it for his own reading . But we can not believe that a really good . play would fail , in Chicago , or elsewhere , because it had not first passed the ordeal of a production in this City . We should prefer to retain faith enough in the intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play on its own merits . If it did not succeed in Chicago , it ought not to succeed anywhere else . On . the other hand , it is not uncommon for " star " actors to try a new play : in some of the smaller cities before bringing it out here . The verdict of the " provincial " audience is accepted as almost conclusive . It may not increase the equanimity of our provincial friends to learn that this sort of experimenting is called . " trying it on the dog . " There is more activity in criticism as well as in production in any great central community , as ' compared with smaller places . Here and there one finds a lesser city , like Boston for instance , which makes art a special study . It is Boston which says that it has outgrown GILMORE and . his music  --  since that musician has come to New-York ; and it is Boston which complains that the delicate strains of THEODORE THOMAS are " wasted on the large , coarse ear of New-York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall probably be obliged to let Boston keep the opinions , while we selfishly absorb all the good music . It is not our fault that we have a great and populous City , and that depositaries of art attract hither so vast a proportion of our native candidates for national recognition , nor can we blame these ambitious people if they come .
