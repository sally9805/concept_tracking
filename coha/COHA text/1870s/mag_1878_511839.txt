A YEAR OF AMERICAN TRAVEL . ( CONCLUDED . ) WE were in the most delightful season of the year ; no rains , no heavy Jews ; the wild oats were ripe , and gave the soft look of ripe wheat fields to all the hill-sides ; the wild cattle were feeding about or resting under the evergreen oaks , which looked so like orchard trees that one was disappointed not to find the apples on the ground beneath them ; the sky was a deep blue , without a clond . We were all young and full of health , and in all the exhilaration of sudden wealth which would enable us to realize all onr greatest wishes . This continued life in the open air night and day in this balmy climate completely healed my lungs . Mr. Fremont knew the country thoroughly well , and we made our camp each evening at some place where he was sure of good water , as well as trees and a good view . I am very sorry that in the burning of my father 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing else : one can not give afterward the freshness of impression that belongs with the actual day 's experience . But I was charmed with every detail of my camping life . To be sure , it was in an unusual form , with most unusual people , in a most unusual country and climate . Knight , one of Mr. Fremont 's old guidesa man almost the equal of Carson in fine qualities-came down from his ranch to see him again , and we took to each other so kindly that it was nearly two months before he left us . Like Captain Tucker , he had thought I would prove a fine lady , and unable to live in the unusual way ; but he too gave me his hearty approval . These , with myself and my little girl , made the party . We had the two Indian men , Juan and Gregorlo , who knew exactly what to do , as they had crossed and recrossed the continent with Mr. Fremont . They were Indians , but they were men , and the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in their best clothes and best behavior . The old California dress was very like that that we know in Spanish pictures ; they looked like figures out of the scene of an opera . They rode well ahead , following Mr. Fremont ; then came the carriage , all its curtains rolled up , freighted with youth and health and happiness and hopefulness ; after us , at a little distance , was our baggage train- a string of mules packed with our cooking apparatus , our grass hammocks , and such clothes as we could pack in square leather paniers , which the Spaniards call alfoinjas . The general andMr . Knight-Old Knight , as we called him-rode ahead , looking out the best road for the carriage , or going back to ride beside it . We used to make a very early start . My early cup often was brought to the carriage to me at dawn . We always camped by the side of a brook , and a dressing tent was quickly made for me with a pair of blankets ; I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French soap aud Cologne-water , and running water in plenty . Diana never had such advantages . We were usually on our way as the sun rose , and we travelled along , very often at a good gait , until eleven , when we always stopped for the long noon halt . Then was our breakfast , and this we made exceedingly good , notwithstanding the scarcity of fresh provisions in the country . " An army travels on its stomach . " Many years of camping experience taught our little party how to provide for this . From the ranches we passed near would be procured half a sheep and green corn , some of the large Spanish onions , and such vegetables as could be had , and always an abundance of sweet red pepper ; of these the guisado of the country would be made , which answers to the pot an feu of the French , only more warmly flavored with this pepper . The grass hammocks would be spread out on the ground , on them the morocco carriage enshions piled into a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the result of all the other 's preparations  --  to eat with all the appetite I could gather , to grow well , and be happy . After some hours of rest we would go on , stopping before sundown to make our camp for the night . This was always well chosen in a4vance . Here the carriage made an admirable sleeping-place for myself and my little girl , while the gentlemen stretched their hammocks to the trees , and the supper was a duplicate of the breakfast . They had excellent claret and coffee and tea , and the best French sweet things for the little one . The camp fire lit up the whole scene with a beauty that only those who have seen it can realize . What talks we had around those camp fires ! Knight was a mighty hunter , and Mr. B eale , midshipman as he was , had the same vocation . Each of the three had had large experience of a kind only known to me through hooks : from Indians , from wild animals , and from war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About nine o'clock all would be still ; only the sounds of the logs and boughs as they crackled and burned , and the steady munching of the animals over their feed , with occasionally a disturbance from a coyote that would come and try to steal his supper ; but a coyote is only a little wolf at best , and though they would stay off at a little distance and howl and bark , yet the noise was only laughable , not like the strange howl of the wolf of the prairies ; nor were the circumstances the same . I was left at San Jos6 for a week at one // time , as it was found that each visit to San Francisco renewed the irritation of the lungs . It was here I saw something of the local life of the people . Before we brought taxes and litigation Upon them , the Californians were a wholesome and cheerful people , going al ) out their pleasures not sadly , as is the inherited wont of our nation , but making a joyful noise . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama street people ; in the swift yet plaintive airs so characteristic , which the Spaniards kept , together with many other things belonging to the Moors-irrigation , for example , which they did not originate , but for which they get credit . The voices of the Panama street people had a slow , almost melodious , accent that was very agreeable . They used to collect on the square in the nights and sing , accompanied by a sort of tambourine , which kept up a low drumming rhythmed movement . One air and some of its words I heard so frequently that they fixed themselves in my memory as part of Panama. , evidently of Moorish origin , coming through Spanish channels across to this people . In the Trariata Verdi has introduced a Spanish folk-song , which is the polished twin of my Panama street song . I only know the words of one verse , for I could get no one to give me the rest , the servants saying that it was not for a lady to know the words.5 ( Evidently there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a minor key , and its abrnpt turns and vague unterminated effects are eminently Oriental . Even the educated people in South American countries drop much of the Castilian nicety of pronunciation , giving the hard sound to the d and c , which so altered the language to me that I had almost to acquire another in order to feel at home with the Spaniards I met there . In addition to that , the illiterate people drop and misplace the s exactly as a London cockney does the h ; for example , the first line of this verse , " A los frailes no me quiere confesar , " they give , " A lo fraile no me quiere confear . " This was evidently their favorite song , to which their strongest expression of excitement fitted itself . The night the two steamers got in together , not only the Americans flocked to the ramparts , but the whole ludian population were out in the bright moonlight , and the sound of the deep rub-a-dub-dub and that constantly recurring ehorns of " Cumaila ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A los frailes no me quiere confesar , Porque se enojan quo me gusto bailar , Bailar ! Bailar ! Con Francico , ml Francico , Francico CumaCa . " VOL . L'VI. - No. 332. -i 8 Another of these Moro-Spanish airs , not so vivacious or clean in its outlines , had grafted itself among the Californians , and had , as all gypsy music has , the governing qualities of swiftness and sadness combined . This last I could not choose but learn : I heard it whistled , sung , played upon guitars and violins , wherever Californians were . During this time I was in San Jos6 I saw in perfection the good riding of the country . From my hammock , swung under the open gallery of the house where we were fortunate enough to have a room , I heard and saw the festivities of a California wedding . These lasted three days . It was a wedding among the vaqueros , and attended , therefore , by good riders . The bride 's house was not much of a building , but extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with green boughs-a ramada . " But the point of rivalry among the guests was more in riding than in dancing , the ugh after riding all day they would dance all night ; and all day and all night that one air was repeated by violins , guitars , and voices , until the drone of it got into the air , and made as much part of it as does the whir of locusts in the autumn months . The first day the procession started for the church where the marriage was to take place  --  to go down and along the Alameda , a beautiful double avenue of willows , three miles in length , planted by the early fathers . The first day was to go to the church for the marriage ceremonies ; the second , to take out the bride for a general pasear through the town ; and the third , a series of contests and rivalries in feats of horsemanship . There were about five hundred horses ; the riders were more . In many cases they had with them a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's saddle , while behind her , with his arm around her waist , and holding the reins , sat the man-just the reverse of our country habit . They advanced in regular order , eight abreast , the musicians , also on horseback , playing their violins and guitars as calmly as though they had a floor under them . The bride sat alone on her horse , under an arch of . flowers and ribbons , which was carried by a groomsman on either side , the ends of the arch resting on their saddles , and on either side of them her bride-maids ; the bridegroom , on an exceptionally fine horse , surrounded by his friends ; and then the rest of the company , most of the men riding singly , but many riding as I have described , with a girl on the saddle  --  a bright glittering mass of ribbons , flowers , bright beads , gold-lace ; the women slippers , the men in the dress of the time in California , which is exactly that we see in Spanish pictures-short velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet trousers open over full white drawers , while a string of bells down the seam jingled even more than do the bangles of ladies in church . The starting-point was almost facing my place of observation . They would form in great order and quiet , the horses knowing the order of the proceedings evidently as well us their masters , and the signal for starting was the exploding of fire-crackers by the hundred boxes under the feet of the horses . What with the sparks and noise , it looked as if the whole thing had gone up like the end of a pantomime . It was a point of honor to show which horse behaved best under these circumstances . The horses were trained in the way that has always been favorite with Spanish people , to make any number of dancing movements in imitation of progi'ess , while in reality they do not go forward at all . I think they are trained to this by having weights tied to their legs . Each one was a perfect horseman . Each man did not simply ride his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and upon it , and was consequently in perfect rapport . Each one of these put in force every art known to him to exhibit the spirit and the beauties of his horse . As they passed down the one street of the town the correct thing was for people from the side to advance and throw fire-crackers in mass under the horses ' feet ; the firing of pistols was of course ; no end of little shrill screams , laughter , voices in every varying intonation , couplets sung to the air which was being played , and taken up with shouts of laughter ; the chorus by every one who took the local allusions . With all this the musicians played with as much steadiness and animation as though seated on a platform instead of the saddle . The third day I feel myself incompetent to describe . They had their field-sports for that day on the large open green just by my perch in the hammock . And here the evolutions in a small space  --  the rush with which they would go , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bringing np all standing , with out any slack lug of the speed , leaving them motionless as an EnglishHorseguard on duty ; the continuous whirls in a small circle , winding nearer and nearer in toward the central point , nntil it seemed as though man and horse must fall from sheer dizziness ; the mounting of a vicious , screaming young horse , which would spring like a cat into the air , with all its legs stiffened out and its back bowed , making one jump this way , another that , until it would seem as though every thing would dislocate in its rider-were a part of the exhibition which perfectly fascinated me . We travelled about in this delightful manner , putting into San Francisco for news , or San Jos6 for soft weather . We made one halt at San Jos6 to get our clothes washed . We thought this could be done there because there were a number of emigrant families ; bat they were rolling in their own money , and none of ours was a temptation to them . Juan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for us . When these women brought the things back , they came in a body as a family , the relations and men of the family lounging in the rear and looking on ; they were evidently proud of the work , and wanted to see the impression it should make . It made a decided impression on me . Their only method of washing was to put the clothes in a brook and pound them between fiat stones , uslug as soap a native bulb called amole . Every thing looked very white and smelled fresh , but they had been merely washed and dried ; there was no starching , no ironing , and a very distortedlooking lot of garments they were . I made them my compliments , seeing that was expected , and asked when they would be ironed , and found that ironing was neither known nor would it be attempted . " Every thing was clean , * ' that was enough in their ideas ; nor could any bribe or persuasion make any difference . They accepted their fee and went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seliora " ( God will repay you , madam ) . Rough-dried lingerie is not comfortable , nor is it pretty . We looked so crumpled and askew that we could not forget the subject , and it was with delight that we accepted the offer of a negro woman to wash and iron for us ; but when with this was coupled the obligation to buy her , we gave her up . It required no thinking or effort to make this decision ; it was simply following out the habit of mind which came from my education and the example shown me at home . All the necessary thinking and deciding had been done a generation before , when my mother gave freedom to her slaves because of her conscientious feeling on the subject . I have always thought it one of the most unusual of the many unusual high qualities in my father , that while he did not share these ideas from the same religious and logical thoughts that made them obligatory on my mother , he yet made it thoroughly easy for her to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large inheritances because ho would have had to take the slaves with the lands . It was not an open question , but one that had been settled , and I merely followed in the home ideas and example ; and it was not merely as a domestic but a political question that I had often heard it gone over . The more intimate friends , John Randolph , Chief Justice Marshall , and many Virginia gentlemen of great estates , were united in their intention to // bring slavery to an end . Some , as the Fairfax family and my mother , put this intention into force , and not only gave freedom to their inherited slaves , but maintained thorn and their children until they were self-supporting , sending others to Liberia and maintaining correspondence with them . I go into this laundry incident a little fully because , simple as it seemed , it soon after became of political importance . The Convention had met at Monterey to settle the Constitution of the State , and the question whether slavery should or should not be admitted was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVith slave labor there would be no delay in opening up the mineral wealth of the country , and to the fabuIons profits of the owners . Slave-holders arid specnlators in slaves only waited the decision to bring them overland in great droves . Paid labor must necessarily be scanty in numbers , very expensive , and equally unreliable . There was also the consideration , which is strong when you are made to feel it , that it would put an end to the great discomfort of being without a class to attend to the daily necessities of life . The want of proper food , proper clothing , were the sonrces of ill health as well as discomfort , and there seemed no way to get at a class to attend to this where no one would work for wages , for they could be too independent in other ways . Of course , with time , this would be righted , but to people suddenly possessed with great wealth the impatience to enjoy it without care is equally great . These were a troublesome class in the Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , who lifted up her voice and wept over her discomforts . The government patronage was on the side of slavery . Every one knows the important part of a good dinner in diplomacy . The great Napoleon knew and acted on this . The very badly prepared food with which the members of the Convention had to be content during their work made them ready to cry out for cooks at the price of any principle . Here it was my good fortune to be of service , and come in aid to the serious work being done by men opposed to slavery . Our rooms in the Castro house were very pretty , with their French and Chinese fittings . My army and navy allies helped me to keep them orderly ; and although I had then only the two Indian men , we managed to be very comfortable . We had the grand wood fires ; every body sent me birds and squirrels of their shooting , and these are never so good as when broiled on the coals . Each of our travellers was capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish pot au feit " guisada . " We had every good thing in fruits , vegetables , and sweets that Prance puts up for transportation , and all served on beautiful Chinese and French china and glass ( I had to get used to Juan and Gregorio breaking a great deal of this ) . Old Knight , who believed in me , brought in his friends to be convinced from myself , by talking with me , that I really did not want slaves , and would never own them . Our house and table were open , after the hospitable fashion of a new country , to all who had been , or would like to be , friends , and they saw for themselves that it was quite possible for the most cheerful hospitality to exist without the usual working forces . Here , again , I got credit for what was no effort . I was not to do any thing that would fatigue me . Ideas and decorative touches I was allowed to give-draperies and " effects " were my department  --  and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every way . I should have liked my clothes ironed , otherwise I felt the need of nothing . In short , my pretty rooms were the headquarters of the antislavery party , and myself the example of happiness and hospitality without servants . I did not mind about the housekeeping , for all that would right itself , and I was really to have no cares and no fatigues . But we did think and consult over this question of slave labor because of a far greater which it involved . Our property was chiefly in mines , by this time proved to be of the richest quality . The difficulties of working them by paid labor or bodies of men working on shares had been experienced and were fully understood . Only a slight portion of the gold taken out could be counted on as ours in this way of working them . We could not often hope for such honor as our Sonorians had shown . With slaves in the mines , as our Southern friends constantly urged upon us , we would have certain and immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal of want of income . It had involved separation from each other , from home , exposure to many forms of danger to health and life . This was a subject for serious consideration . Our decision was made on the side of free labor . It was not only the question of injustice to the blacks but of justice to the white men crowding into the country . Here was a field where labor was amply repaid , where a man 's energy , his physical as well as mental strength , could bring him a great return . We were in the rebound from our own plan of patient waiting and slow gains to all the immediate happiness and power given by the new order of things . Slave labor would shut off this happiness from those who had only their labor to depend upon . It would have been a very poor return for the good fortune that had come to us if we had taken part in shutting it out from these . I wa* going over this with an // English officer whom I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in connection with our talks over the war . He was thoroughly English , thoroughly antislavery ; but when I finished , he sprang up and walked about the room , exclaimiiig , " He ought not to have done so ! He ought to have let the blacks wait another thirty years ; they were used to it ! " With Mr. Fremont it was the abstract idea of justice and equal rights , but with me only the following a habit of mind in which Iliad been nurtured . I think I may claim -- as I have said to our Northern friends  --  to belong to the " aristocracy of emancipation , " for with my people it has always entailed voluntary sacrificesmoneyed , political , and social ; not as with most emaneipationists at the North , where it was a local strength and advantage . We went into San Francisco shortly before the rainy season-about three months after I had first seen it . Already it was changed out of recognition by the crowds of people added , and the buildings which had gone up . Houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and Sundays the sounds of hammers never ceased . Ready-made houses were to he had , and some very pretty little ones from China . One of these was gotten and put up for me on a lot we had in what was then called Happy Valley , next to where is now the Palace Hotel . It was put up without nails , except the shingling on the roof , all the rest fitting in together like a puzzle , and was of pretty smooth wood , making a very good temporary lodging . Forty-eight hours at the chief hotel had convinced us that it was neither a pleasant nor safe place for a lady . The partitions between the rooms were only of thin cotton cloth stretched on a light frame . Thirty-six thousand a year was given as rent for this building . Our little house had but two rooms , but they were large and clean , and we had what were luxuries  --  a wood fire burning in front of the cottage , and clean food well cooked . We did not attempt furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two bundles of unused shingles made a very good table , while I was absolutely clear of unpleasant sights and pounds inevitable from such a crowd as there was in the town . A friend thought this was too rough for me , and much to my regret made us exchange it for a house lie had recently built and furnished in the usual expensive , commonplace way . Now my open fire was a luxury counterbalancing carpets , curtains , and finery , and our men , who knew exactly how to roast meat on sticks before the wood coals* or between hot stones , and in hot wood ashes , and who were at home in making guisadaswinging in its kettle from a tripod of green sticks in true gypsy style-were lost when confronted with a cooking stove . There was a great slamming and banging of the iron doors , and many a " caramba ! " So we fell back on supplies from a French restaurant . We were all pleased when the word was given for another start . The dlive back from San Francisco to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so familiar to San Francisco people as the San Matteo Road , was the last of our charming out-door life . After the rains began I had to remain at Monterey ; not only the rainy season , but the approaching elections , interfered with our ownership of our time . We lingered ever this part of our travelling , knowing it was to bethe last , for the political duties claimed now the first place . Biea n'arrive que l'impdi'ue . We had planned to stay in California about seven years , the world forgetting , by the world forgot , our first object to live our lives in independence , and with the animating motive and object , to me , that in about seven years I should return to my people . The " unforeseen " in this ease was the discovery of gold . That delightful factor changed our calculations , abolished all our plans , and substituted a power to live where we pleased and do as we pleased , when close upon this came another unforeseen force which made it impossible to put our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Monterey when the State Constitution was being framed there , had enrolled us on the antislavery side . It would have been desertinguot to go through with the work . Mr. Fremont could have been either Governor or first Senator from the State . As Governor he could have overlooked his private interests to the greatest advantage-in certain ways have been of most use to the State ; but , on the other hand , as Senator he could defend the interests of the State in Congress . To me the overruling consideration was that what I so much wished myself would be rendered obligatory , and that we should have to return to Washington , and our old home life be restored . It was foreseen that the antislavery clause would be opposed , and need a positive defender , but no one foresaw the prolonged opposition and bitterness of the contest which did follow , Mr. Calhoun leading the opposition . The first Legislature met in San Jos6 , but I was taken back to Monterey because of my comfortable rooms there ; they and the climate there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had already fallen , and the creeks were up on the broad plains , so broad that there would be scarcely an undulation in twenty miles , but occasionally seamed by a creek bed or " gulch . " Even in the dry season these dry creek beds and gulches had been a trial to nerves only ac // custorned to regular roads . The last camp we made was on the Salinas River , after crossing the Salinas plain . There was not much timber here , and we had wily a thicket of tall brush for shelter . The carriage was well closed with its strong leather curtains , and made an admirable shelter ; but they were wise in leaving me in Monterey , for camping in wet weather is very different from the summer travel we had had , and this was not yet heavy weather , only the gathering for rain . It had its own picturesque elements , too , and I remember giviu* them that night the substance of George hand 's Mare an Diable , of which the place reminded me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so swollen the Salinas River that it was found I could not remain in the carriage . The animals and the pole were taken out , the harness and cushions securely lashed on the roof , and strong ropes passed around the carriage to lower it properly into the stream . Other strong ropes were attached to it , together with the men 's lariats ; the men themselves , swimming their horses across , took their places on the opposite bank , which was nearly upright , ready at the word given to start the horses offi The carriage lowered , off galloped the horsemen , shouting and cheering their horses , and so the equipage was whipped through the stream and up the bank . So few horses swim level that I was not put upon one to cross . Our midshipman took soundings by walking across the river at a point that promised soniething of a ford , and found the water nowhere above his waist . Fortunately I weighed but little then , and Mr. Beale carried me across on his outstretched arms ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe in the comfortable rooms at Monterey before night , housed , dry , warm , and well fed-  --  the four luxuries of travellers . Our Englishwoman was a most efficient housekeeper : we had seat an Indian ahead , and she had had some hours to prepare . We found every thing thoroughly warm ; a great wood fire ; dry clothes laid out for each one ; the round table , with its gleaming damask and glass and china and delightful good food , ready for us . We thought this the best camp we had made yet . After a little rest I was left alone here ; politics and business belonged in the busy American towns to the north . The rains set in furiously , and I was completely house-bound ; but I could see the bay , and even through the closed windows I could hear the delightful boom of the long rollers falling regularly and heavily on the beach . Near by I had my wood fire , and plenty of reading , such as it was : a collection of the Merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the period of the Spanish marriages and the political history of Europe for as many years , and an " unabridged Byron " - the whole library of a great flour merchant , who said he " had no time to read himself , but thought I might find some of those interesting . " The Merchant 's Magazine was tough reading at first , but I did read it , and gained a great deal of knowledge that has since fitted itself into more than one occasion of my life . Also , I had the first solid experience in the more usual feminine pursuit of sewing . A large part of my wardrobe had been left in San Francisco at the company 's warehouse , all the heavier things that had been needed in leaving New York , and would be required again for the return voyage ; in one of the many fires this warehouse went , and while my loss was comparatively small , it was important to me , for it obliged me to make up some warm dresses . That I had never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things that I had never done *before that a new sense of power had come to me , and I had no hesitation in undertaking that . But the only stuffs to be had were Chinese satins and the harshest English merinoes . I got these in the darkest colors that could be found , and ripping up a faithful old black silk , made a fac-simile of it in the new stuffs . We knew an old lady at home who never shaped the stockings she knit , but knit straight in one size to the heel , saying it was a badly shaped leg that could not shape a stocking : I think my dresses were somewhat on this plan . I was in the happy age when figure graced the dress , and queer as they must have been , they looked very well when once on . And I gained another warm gown by cutting off the extra length of my riding-habit . But even with reading and sewing and writing , the time would have been too still , if there bad not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made getting about impossible , and I had practically no carriage , as there was now no one to drive me . Mrs. M'Evoy , my cook and prime minister , had lived in Australia with the wife of the Chief Justice ; it interested me very much to have her tell in detail the domestic life of that new country . She was an intelligent woman , who had been in a position to see a great deal , and when the evening closed in I made it a regular custom that she should bring in her own sewing , and her pretty , clean baby had its evening roll on the great grizzly bear skin that was stretched in front of the fire ; my own little girl played herself into early sleeps . The other wing of the house was occupied by Madame Castro herself , and her very nice little girls made charming play mates for mine . Some years before , I had read in LitteWs Liring Age the account of a trial before Sir // Joseph Forbes , the Chief Justice with whose wife my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge reviewed the case , and dwelt especially upon one statement of the man who was being sentenced , and whose own chief view of his crimes seemed to be that they were so easy to commit that therefore they were matter of course . We had talked this over at our dinner table at borne- " a table round " over which every thing of interest was discussed . Among us it was the family habit to keep for the dinner table subjects of interest , and equally forbidden ever to allow any disagreeable topic to come up ; this was a law of my father 's , to which we had complied so long that the mind obeyed it unconsciously . The man under sentence had committed eleven murders before being detected ; there was no escape for him , and he confessed , and described the first murder . He had a way-side stopping-place , and victims easily came in his way . He said that this first man he meant to rob only ; but he let him leave his house and get to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to stop and water his horse . He was there before him , in hiding , and as the man leaned over to get water for himself he gave him a blow on the back of the neck ; this quite killed him . He made no movement , and was dead . Then this murderer said he " had not known before how easy it was to kill a man ; lie did n't think it was so little trouble . After that he always killed them when he found they had money with them . " But eleven such murders brought on the investigation which terminated his career . Mrs. M'Evoy knew all about this case , and many iucidents belonging to it and to the great excitement it created . It is one of the odd things that come up in life that I should have found here a'living link with what had been heretofore only a matter of reading and family discussion . The time was monotonous , and seemed long . The Merchant 's Magazine is instructive , but not exciting or amusing when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were , as usual , around the fire , Mrs. M'Evoy , with her table and lights , sewing at one side , myself by the other , explaining pictures from the illustrated Times to my little girl , while the baby rolled about on the bear-skin in front of the fire , suddenly Mr. Fremont came in upon us , dripping wet , as well he might be , for he hal come through from San Jos6-sevcnty miles on horseback through the heavy rain . He was so wet that we could hardly make him cross the pretty room ; but " beautiful are the feet of him that beareth glad tidings , " and tbe foot-marks were all welcome , for they pointed home . He came to tell me that he had been elected Senator , and that it was neces sary we shouhl go to Washin*ton on the steamer of the 1st of January . At daylight the next morning he was off again , having to be back in San Jos6 . A young sorrel horse , of which Mr. Fremont was very fond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty miles within thirty-six hours , without fatigue to either . The few intervening weeks went by quick*-ly now , and we were all ready for the 1st . Mrs. M'Evoy grieved to lose me , but Saunderswas there , happy , with more than money enough to buy the freedom of his family and secure them a home also : When we heard the steamer 's gun , NewYear 's night , the rain was pouring in torrents , and every street crossing was a living brook . Mr. Fremont carried me down , warmly wrapped up , to the wharf , where we got into a little boat and rowed out . I have found that it changes the climate and removes illnesses to have the ship 's head turned the way you wish to go . hOMEWARD BOUND . We had on board some of our fellow-passengers who had made the journey up with me in June , six months before-Dr . Gwin , who was elected the other Senator from the State , and.Mr . Ward . Our first stop was at Mazatlan . At Chagres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anJ from the steamers was very unpleasant and even dangerous : queer boats with undisciplined boatinca , no wharves or steps ; but at Mazatlan we found the solid stone pier with proper steps , such as the English are sure to build wherever they establish themselves . Au English man-of-war was at anchor , and learning that the newly elected Californian Senators were on the steamer , she paid us the compliment of a salute of honor , and put the captain 's gig at our service . In place of the dangerous landing and heavy swell , as at the mouth of the Chagres , or being carried through the water on the back of an Indian over the reef as at Panama. , or in the same way up the mud bank , as at San Francisco-here the tide being so out that the boat could not quite reach the steps  --  the sailors jumped into the water and laid their oars in a compact bridge from the bow of the boat to the steps , standing on either side with their elbows out , making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had already returned to civilization . On the pier waited the barouche and fine horses belonging to the English consnl-gei*eral . His were orthodox harness horses , and I could enjoy my drive . His house was interesting . There were accumulations made during many years ' residence of beautiful things , modern as well as old Mexican curiosities , and interesting things from both shores of the Pacific . Eveim // the well-served dinner and trained servants had their own charm , from my long absence from such things . The house was of stone , an ( l the walls many feet thick , making it ( lelightfully cool . We had felt the heat before reaching Mazatlan , and to do honor to Mr. Forbes ( and also because I distrusted the effect of my Monterey gowns on ladies ) I took off waruier clothing , and dressed myself in one of my best white gowns , in which I felt orthodox , as my Englishwoman had put these and all my " frills " into lovely condition . We met a norther iu coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great discomfort-waves breaking on deck , every one having to remain below under closed hatches . Each of us had taken cold from the imprudent change of dress at Mazatlan . Added to this was the bad air from the necessarily closed hatches . As I am fortunate enough not to be subject to seasickness , I have the corresponding disadvantage of being awake to every thing that goes amiss ; in this case the consequence was an illness which took a form that put me in danger of dying . Here again my usual good fortune showed itself . There was a regular ship surgeon , for whom I could have no deference ; but among the passengers was a really good physician  --  a navy surgeon who had made his studies in Paris . Dr. Bowie had me immediately moved up to the captain 's state-room on deck , where his skill , aided by the great physician , pure air , kept me alive . There was no stewardess , and only one woman passenger ; no ice . Perfect quiet and freedom from all motion was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impossible ; but , against all disadvantages , I lived on , although when we reached Panama I was too exhausted to make the land crossing . There was only a monthly steamer at that time . No one would tell me that I should have to miss this and stay in Pana -- ma over the next month ; on the contrary , little sketches were made of ships ' hammocks on stretchers , and all devices forgetting me across without danger or fatigue were constantly talked over to me , and I believed that I should go straight through . " English Tom "  --  a big quiet-faced old manof-war 's man-carried me down the gangplank , and took me ashore without a rough motion . I noticed that Saunders was not about , nor Mr. Fremont , and asked for them ; but my physician had taken the precaution to give me an opiate , and I slept for a long time , waking to find myself again under the hospitable roof of Madame Arc6 , who claimed me as hers . Mr. Stephens ( generally known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of the future Panama Railway , of which he was vice-president . We had known him well in Washington . On learning that I was on board and so ill , he knew I would be unable to cross , and had at once told Madame Arc6 , who said that I belonged to her by right . When I waked it waa to find myself again on a sick-bed , with her kind face near me ; but in the next room was another sick person , over whom the doctor was standing ; and then I learned for the first time that Mr. Fremont was perfectly crippled with rheumatic fever . The thorough chilling he had received in Mazatlan had brought on rheumatic fever in the leg which had been frostbitten the winter before . This turned my mind from my own disappointment . Our good friend and physician remained with us until the last moment in which he could connect with the steamer at Chagres , and would have remained the month if we had needed him . It was hard every way to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good care , medical and personal . Madame Arc6 had moved into the house of a daughter who had recently died , and the views were quite different this time , looking across the garden of an adjoining convent to the open blue sea . The early church buildings in Panama were in keeping with the wealth of the Spaniards and their need for repentance ; but many were now roofless , and all except the cathedral itself in a state of decay . The roof and spire of this great building were completely inlaid with mother-of-pearl shells , which gave out wonderful colors under sunlight , especially when sunshine followed rain , and they had the added beauty of water in the shells* The convent buildings , which made the nearest foreground , were only the more picturesque from being in decay . The bell tower ; with its crumbling arch d opsuinga around the bell , through which showed the background of deepest hlue sky , made a beautiful frame for the picture one saw when the bells had to be rung , . especially at ye pers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery for ringing the bell was gone , and it was sounded by striking it with stones The laughing young Indian girls who went up to do this wore the usual fluttering loose ruffled garments of Panama , and they were near enough for us to see the glitter of their eyes and teeth as they were pounding away at the bell in their unorthodox and unmusical fashion . This was a picture of which I never got tired , and it grew to be a mixture of reading and realities which , when the fever was on me , would take shape ; the " unabridged . Byron " which had been lent me at Monterey had given me the story of Parisina , and the ' execution of Hugo framed itself in this convent tower . In California we were well off when we // had one room , and luxurious with two . Here Madame Arc6 had given ns the largest and coolest rooms in her house , and my cot was pli*ced in the large ball-room , which opened from the bedroom where Mr. Fremont lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ball-room was eighty feet long , and high and wide in proportion , and the chairs and sofas were set in compact rows around the room . The floor was of dark polished wood , and the walls and ceillug painted darkish blue , to which the furniture corresponded . There was one sofa , or rather a sofa-divan , on which I lay in the day , while a linen cot , with one sheet under and one sheet above , made all that was necessary for the night . There were no glass windows ; great doors , like barn doors , slid back and left huge openings which let in the view , and , from the height we were above the ground , I was in the neighborhood of the bell in its tower , and of the tops of the thicket of young cocoa-nut-trees , which kept waving and fanning to and fro between me and the waters of the bay . Stephens was the first to notice the effect of these trees upon me , seeing my eyes follow their balancing movements from side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day , to be with us ; sometimes putting his chair where he could command both of our positions , saying , in his cheerful way , " I have come to take my chill with you , " and proceeding to shake with those violent chills which he had contracted there , and which not long after killed him . I astonished them one day declaiming the execution of Hugo , which had gradually come out from its place in my memory , and embodied itself with the vesper ringing of this bell and the general sunset and tropical effect of the whole view before me : " The convent bells are ringing , But mournfully and slow ; In the gray square turret swinging , *Vith a deep sound , to and fro . heavily to the heart they go ! Hark ! the hymn is singingThe song for the dead below , Or the living who shortly shall be so My illness had taken the form of intermittent fever , as most things do in the ague climates , and regularly as the fever hour came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to sit up , we saw very pleasant people , among them the Goveruor of New Granada , and the officers of one of our men-of-war , while the old servants Narcissa and my former favorite , Candelaria , dosed and petted us and brought us imice things , as though we were babies that had to be brought back to life by unremittiug care . Every day the kind nuns from the convent sent me over some delicate preparation of fruits . AsmilingThdian girl , with soft drawling accent , would give the little message with it , which was always to the same effect , " that they prayed I might not die so far from my own country . " It was some delicate preparation of preserved fruit , and the pretty china plate on which it was sent was always surrounded by blossoms of some white flower , orange or jasmine ; from these they would take away every green leaf and stem , and set the flowers around thickly , one against the other . We saw here a flower called the " variable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , because it changed three times a day-in the morning pure white , at noon rose-color , and at sundown deep red , which a botanist once told me was nature 's mourninn . There was a man-of-war in the harbor , and its captain planned for me a palanquin in which I could be taken across in perfect safety from any jarring or the weather ; this was a ship 's cot swung to two poles , and carried by four men , with a light awning over a frame , and its white duck curtains could roll up or lower at pleasure . Stephens , the Governor , and Mr. Fremont had many talks over the Isthmus railway which was just then being built , and over the future railways across the continent , which are now completed , but which then were only believed possible by the few who were working for them . I had seen enough of the suffering of the emi*ration , when I crossed the Isthmus in going out , to be al ) le to realize the terrible loss of life required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over marsh gronn ( I which gave very poor foundation . The difficulty of planting the piles was just then the uppermost subject . I remember Stephens saying that as yet they stood only on human bones . This was not literally but figuratively true , for the climate cost many lives . The terms of agreement on which laborers came out were three months ' work , and their passage back to New York or to California free , as tbey chose . Only about thirty per cent . claimed this passage , and almost all of those went back to New York ; the rest were buried where they had fallen , from the climate ; and Stephens himself contracted such a deadly form of chills and fever that lie lived but a few years after this . He is best known by his writings and travels in Arabia and Central America ; but his fricuds knew also how far-sighted he was in practical matters . His was one of the impelling minds toward building the Croton Aqueduct . When we were first in New York , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country spot surrounded by trees and open meadows  --  the reservoir on Forty-second Street  --  and from the top of it pointed upward to the fields amid rocks that lay beyond , telling us that lie was so convinced that the near future of New York lay there that he had invested in lands which would make the fortune of some one else ; // that he Woiii ( l not live to see it , because , naturally delicate , his health was too broken for him to look forward to any length of life . lie told us of the contempt with which his idea was received by the wealthy citizens of his acquaintance , who scouted the idea of entering into any such " wild speculations " as that ; told us of calculations they had made how the interest on the money which he had expended would overbalance any profits before those lots could be built upon . He said that he had made his will , giving that property to young relations , who would certainly have the benefit of his foresightas they had . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably well long before the time for starting came . I was not strong eiiou*h to leave my room , but Mr. Fremont , in spite of prophetic warnings in regard to the influence of the climate , made daily excursions in the neighborhood with Saunders , searching about the country , with its new and interesting botany . We had not a bad time at all . February is one of the best months in the tropics . We had lots of books , and saw intelligent and pleasant people ; every thing about us was beautiful and comfortable , and our minds were entirely content with our own affairs , and it was a novelty to be quietly together , without a separation in prospect . My palanquin was ready and was brought up for me to see . It looked like the illustration to " Madagascar " in an old-fashioned geography . We had to time starting so as to avoid being detained in Chagres , and we had also to have a sufficiently strong party to meet a new danger which had grown up with the travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waylaid and robbed , and sometimes murdered , passengers ; this was recruited from California , Austrahia* and especially Jamaica . It had never come in my way to meet a man entirely without personal courage . It was such a matter of course to me that men took care of women , and could not be frightened by any thing , that it came to me , as a young friend of mine says , " A rev'lation , a perfect rev'lation , " to come upon such an instance of want of courage as we met at this time . Our party had been carefully chosen ; competent persons bad looked out for every belonging-good men to carry my hammock , and good reliable men for the baggage ; and , in short , a good fighting as well as travelling force had been put togetlier . The California steamer was in , and one of its passengers , having his gold with him in a small trunk , actually came to us not only to ask us to take him across in our party to protect this gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , when we were to start . He was an entire stranger to us , but was an educated man , and appeared to be , what he said he was , a physician . He said he heard of my ill there , and of the strength of our party , and that he thought he could go as my physician , and not be suspected of having treasure with him . He was in an anguish of terror about his gold . Mr. Fremont let lilni join us . We were only to cross the plain a few miles , and make our camp at the foot of the hills that first night . I was put in my hammock and carefully carried down into the street , after a leave-taking with our dear kind friend which left me shaken . Her hospitality and motherly goodness and care had been vital to me now on two occasions , and she herself was so intelligent and charming that it had been a pleasure to know her , apart from this . Mr. Fremont and herself had had long talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each to lose the other . My men were very proud of my new equipage , the first of its kind ever seen there , and the people flocked around to look at it as they would to any other show ; the men wouhdhalt to explain it , and expatiate up*u its merits , while equally free explanations of myself were asked and given at the same time . Among a colored race I would have seemed fair at any time , but now , whitened by long illness , they thought me dying , and said so . They hardly offered bets that I would not reach the other side , but something to the same effect , while time compassionate wonmen would make prayers over me that I might at least get to my own country before dying . " La pobrecita ! morir tan lejo do su pais ! " ( Ab , the poor young thing-dying so far from her own country ! ) . When we came to our halting-place for the night , I was already so excited that an opiate was given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dumb , but did not make me sleep . I lay in my haummock watching all things ; I wanted to rouse some one to take care of a white horse which had a great vampire bat upon its neck , fanning it with its wide wings and sucking its blood , so that next day we could not use it , but I was tongue-tied . The next day we had a longer pull , and here the physician who had asked our protection could in turn have been of some use by keeping near me , and seeing that I received at once any care that might be needed ; this he offered to do , and so was put nearest me in the file when we started . I fell asleep , and they made a little halt that I might have my sleep unbroken ; the baggage escort was at some little distance , so as not to disturb me . " The doctor " tlmought too much time was being lost , and that his dear truimk would be exposed to more evil chances as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to go on with the baggage ; and they , not doubting his authority , went on , // leaving us just the palanquin and its bearers , with Mr. Fremont and my little girl , to follow through the most dangerous l ) art of the route , all defiles and thickly wooded mountain-sides ; also , he carried off with him my medicines . Saunders had been charged not to lose sight of the baggage , and , suspecting nothing , was giving his whole attention to that , so was off with it . Our punishment to the doctor was not to let him have our care on the descent of the river . We left him to take his chance there . They told us at Gorgena of the recent murder of thirteen persons , the whole of a party , by the Jamaica negroes who had brought them up . We took care this story should be repeated , with details , to him , and then refused him the protection of our boat , which he shamelessly begged for . Going down the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to float , and keep the boat off from the sunken trees and points of land ; occasion ally the men used their long sweeps . It took but two days , as we went with the stream , and we had in that way but one night on the river . We took all the best precautions of thorough shelter from the night dews , and a great fire to purify the air about us , and kept to our quinine and coffee . The heat did not seem very great , and I was absolutely comfortable in my hammock , which made a sort of gondola of our canoe , and the Scotch l ) laid stretched over it made a cool shade beneath . We were in such content that the beauty of the tropical growth , with all its strange shapes and splendid coloring , its giant creepers and masses of blossoms , gave us the delight that we ongbt to have had in them , but which I could not feel fully when I was going up ihe river . I saw it all now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , as we neared the mouth of the river , across a bend which stretched before us , green and feathery with its palm-trees , I caught sight of a dark straight line pointing upward . If I had known what I was doing , it would have been unpardonable , but too much fever had unhinged me , and in my excitement at recognizing the mast of a steamer , I sprang up , crying , there was the ship that was to take me home , and so undid all the good work that had been done by the month of ( Inlet at Panama . This time the fever set in for good . The climate had told on us , too , and even the one night on the river was sure of bad results . But here I came on one of my best pieces of good fortune . At that time this steamer line was officered from our navy . The percentage on the treasure carried gave them each month more than their usual year 's pay , while the owners of the steamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable men to protect their property . After all , it was not so long since the Gulf had been the scene of a great deal of piracy , and with this new stream of gold pouring into that lonely region , there were rumors of a renewal of the old pirate business . Commodore Porter , father of the present admiral , had distinguished himself so much in the Mediterranean by his services in helping to put down piracy there that he was sent to the West Indies to stop it in those waters . Lafitte 's men were then ( 1824 ) the terror of conimerce . He succeeded in doing this thoroughly . There was more than suspicion that it was connived at by the Spanish authorities in the West India Islands , and at one of these ports-Porto Rico-the resentment for disturbing their profits took the form of an insult to our flag ; this Conimodore Porter compelled them to atone for . But even then we had a habit of studying Spanish feelings first , and our national feeling after ; so Commodore Porter was courtmartialed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finding of the courtmartial was against him . One can imagine the feeling of an officer who knew that he had performed unparalleled services , and been of greatest benefit to his country . He must have looked at this sentence by the light of the eighty odd whale ships which he had burned in the Pacific Ocean , inflicting hnmensc loss on British commerce , and making the streets of London " burn dark for a year , " as was said in Parliament ; there must have crowded on him the memories of years of isolation and separation from home , all the weary , unshared hours that go to make up the hardest side of a naval officer 's life , his joy and pride in his service to his country ; and then to strike , as it were , on a sunken rock in this cold , bloodless interpretation of a treaty stipulation discriminating in favor of the enemy ! It was no wonder that the old officer broke his sword and threw it away , vowing never to draw it again in defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . This was under the administration of Mr. Adams . Diplomatic relations were opened with Turkey in General Jackson 's administration . It was necessary to send some one who should be suitable in all respects . Commodore Porter 's name was already known there from his exploits in his young days ; it was synonymous with the power and the dignity of our flag . This led to looking into the reasons for his resigning from the navy , and renewed the indignation which those who had followed the court-martial at that time felt at its cold , ungemmerous treatment of one of the country 's most efficient officers . My father was a born redresser of wrongs , and General Jackson was not the man to bother over a technical detail where the honor of the flag was concerned . With him // the honor of the flag came first , after that the sensibilities of other nations . Commodore Porter , then living on the Me ( literranean , was old and broken with exile and many cares when there reached him the respectful and flattering request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made the long journey to the United States-by sail then  --  to give his thanks in person to those who bad done him this late act of justice . Finding that my father , who had never seen him , had most information regarding , and the keenest interest in redressing , this wrong , he gave him his warm friendship . During the time he remained in Washington he was constantly with my mother as well as my father , and in this way an intimacy was commenced which lasted through his life . It was his eldest son who had command of this steamer , with a staff under him of his young naval friends , among them a good surgeon , who said I must have at least some hours of absolute repose . The ship was light , and out of coal , and rolled heavily in the swell off the mouth of the Chagres . The coming on board of the passengers would necessarily make a great noise . The captain was not then , any more than now , a laggard in his decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were calm , and gained for me the freedom from all motion and quiet on the ship . The passengers were furious at being delayed , and having to come that distance on the little tender . After the fashion of our people , they immediately held a public meeting , passed a vote of censure on the captain , and adopted resolutions recommending the company to remove him , under penalty of the displeasure of the California travel . Having done this in their haste , they immediately undid it as soon as they learned the reason for the captain 's conduct , and followed another and better fashion of our people in undoing an injustice , and did all in their power to help him take care of me . In every part of my journey I came upon proof upon proof of this manly kindness and care for women among our American men . To travel alone in Europe is impossible ; even travelling with one 's children and a maid you do not receive the respect or attention that you have if there is a gentleman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . The need of attention or assistance draws out that instinctive sense of protection which seems to be innate in our people . To be in mourning , or look ill or sad , or to be encumbered with children , is a sure appeal to the exercise of this instinct . A part of the main cabin had been portioned off with sheets and table-cloths tacked to the ceiling and floor , and to keep me from being thrown off I was lashed to a sofa , for it was now March , and we were already in a norther , and continued in one gale after another until we reached New York . When I was able to understand again , I fo and myself tightly lashed to this sofa , the ship rolling and pitching tremendously . The officers would come to look after me often-sometimes in their " rain clothes , " icicles on their beards and eyelashes , and very glad at last to find me not only alive , but able to ask questions and understand every thing again . I have been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died then , but the greatest physicians maintain that there are more resources in nature than are yet dreamed of in their philosophy , and this was a case in support of that idea . Mr. Fremont also was extremely ill ; perhaps we had all been undermined by the month 's stay on the Isthmus and the river travel , and the anxieties about my illness added the feather 's weight . A beautiful English copy of Lane 's translation of the Arabian Nights , with fine English illustrations , was among the books that had been put up for my little girl . Grown people were very thankful for it on the ship going up from Panama , and then , and later in our camping life , when it was read aloud to her , fragments of it interwove themselves with our daily experience , and it was the child 's idea that when we reached home we should relate to her grandfather our voyage , as Siudhad related his ; we too had had our dangers by sea , and seeii strange beasts and birds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the alternations and sudden transitions in climates , languages , people of every varying rank and dress , our unusual modes of travel-all belonged nearer to fiction thak to the formal routine life to which we had belonged , niul which shortly before had been to us the only way of livh* . During the Mexican war , a Mexican who had brought through secret dispatches at great risk , in telling my father of the difficulties he encountered , said he bad to leave ordinary travelled routes , and make his way as he best could by mule or horse , or at times on foot , through to Vera Cruz-as he put it in his broken English , " On horseback or mule-back , and many times on footback . " We could include this last mode of travel among the many ways in which our year 's journey had been made . Starting by railway from Washington , then the ocean steamer , then the little whale-boat on the Chagres , then the mules of the land crossing , with again a steam-ship , followed by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking in hard troublesome places , and then with my ship 's hammock as a palanquin ; on the return across the Isthmus , together with the varied peoples we had seen , ranging from the highest // to the lowest in intelligence and cultivation , differing languages , color , and any number of new and startling phases . Of social ohservances and want of observances we had a great deal to tell-talks that were never to end , for we were not to go hack to California ; that was settled . The risks to health were too certain and too great ; the trial of separation unnecessary , now that Mr. Fremont 's place as Senator would keep bins in Washington through the winters . Having just gone through the experience that all our best-laid plans had gone agley , and that it was of no use for man to propose when the whole chapter of accidents lay open to dispose of you otherwise , I would lie contentedly making plans for the hng peaceful time ahead of me in Washington . This was early in March . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had again a touch of fever at the Isthmus in crossing , and it was three years before I again saw any of my home people . But it is only the luirnortals who read the Book of Destiny . Fortunately for us we live our lives only as we see the days . We were a sorry-looking lot when we landed ; even say little girl had had some of the fever of the Isthmus . Her splendid hair had been cat close , and its loss , with a silk handkerchief knotted about her head to take its place , altered her almost beyond my own recognition . When we reached our rooms at the Irving House , we laughed at our own appearance : we looked as though we had been taken off a wreck , so thin and haggard were we , and in such odd dress . Jenny Lind was in her progress through the country at that time , and we had the rooms that had been beautifully fitted up for her at the Irving House , then a fashionable uptown hotel opposite Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to regular things again !  --  the warm , carpeted rooms , the large bath , the white roses and my dear violets , with which Mr. Howland never failed to welcome me to New York . Of all my carefully prepared outfit , fire and the accidents of travel had left me only this ridiculous toilet which I saw reflected in the long mirrors on every side-my dark blue cloth riding-habit , cut short , and hanging as straight and shapeless about my ankles as the clothes on the women in a Noah 's ark ; black satin slippers ; a Leghorn flat , tied down with a China crape scarf ; doubled and folded about me , the faded Scotch plaid which had served as a carpet in camp and an awning on the river Chagres . Just opposite , at the door of Stewart 's , * saw a match girl dressed very much in this way , except that her shoes were better for the weather . We took two days of needed rest and refitting . There were not the resources in New York then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sent us on our way equipped like other people . As in the old ballads , I " had been gone but a year and a day , " when I was again back to soy father 's house .
