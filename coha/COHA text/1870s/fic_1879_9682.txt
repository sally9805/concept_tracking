I should be very sorry . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie Cheerfully and sweetly . Sit down , Alonzo , dear . You must n't guess things , darling . To Lid . There 's nothing he hates so much as paying visits . But I know what expecting company is . It 's just one run for days before , and nobody to help . My husband never helps a bit .

Alonzo , you can trust young Blum in the shop all day , ca n't you ? Gr . Groobie It 's risky . To Sp . I never saw a man handle deadly poisons like that young chap , and so overconfident ! He weighs out drugs , as if he were serving sugar , and a couple of lumps made no difference . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie Snappishly . Well , it do n't . To Lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city  --  it just reminds me  --  confidentially  --  how do they dress for a shooting dinner ? High neck or decollet . Lid . Lida Oh , very plainly . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie I 'm sorry for that . Low neck becomes me so ! What a bother dressing is , is n't it ? Lid . Lida It is , particularly when you expect a train every minute , and hav n't begun yet . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie I declare , we must go . Rises  --  all rise and shake hands . But I 'm so glad to have found you at home . There , I forgot the chief thing . Sits  --  they all sit . You must give me your advice . Of course we call on you , because Mr. Spencer 's people always had a place here , and you will come every summer ; so you  --  so to speak  --  are one of us .

We 'll talk it over quietly , to-morrow . Come , Alonzo . Gr . Groobie Shaking hands with Sp . All right , my dear . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie Returning , in confidence to Lid. , and bringing her front . Is n't Groobie a model ? SP. sits , GR. goes up angrily . Your husband seems just as obedient . But that 's the way for young wives : train your husband the first year , or you 'll never do it . Now , Alonzo . Rises . Gr . Groobie Are you quite sure you 're going ? Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other , dodges to get by . Good-bye , Mrs. Spencer . Shakes hands . Sp. and Lid . Good-bye . Mrs. G. Mrs. Groobie Volubly , as all go to door , C. Now do n't come to the door . We know you must be in a great hurry . Trains do n't stop for any one  --  and when the train 's in , the people are right on top of you . I tell Mr. Groobie that trains are like death . They come when you do n't want them , and they 're awful slow when you 're waiting . Now do n't come one step further . Alonzo , dear , your arm . Good-bye . Exeunt GR. and MRS . G.

Spencer Aside to Mim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it . Exits , R. 2 D. Mim . Mima Watching UNC. , who rummages about , searching , aside . He seems in a very bad humor . Aloud . Are you looking for anything in particular , sir ? Coming down . Uncle .. R. Am I looking for anything in particular ? Do I look as if I were looking for nothing in particular ? I 'm trying to find my hat . I could solemnly swear I put it down here . Looks . Mim . Mima No wonder it got lost . Unc . Uncle What 's that ? Mim . Mima Gets hat from behind stairs . I 've got it . Hides it behind her as she approaches him . What will you give me for it ? Unc . Uncle R. Come , come , no nonsense . Give me my hat . Mim . Mima You must promise what I ask . Unc . Uncle Mima , you 're too big to play spoiled child any longer . Mim . Mima What a fuss about an old hat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gave me something in return ? And besides , who spoiled me ? Did n't papa tell you a hundred times I 'd never grow up to be any good , if you did n't teach me to keep my place  --  and did n't you take me on your lap and tell him he could n't appreciate such a creature ? Unc . Uncle How the toad remembers ! Mim . Mima But he does appreciate me , and I 'm going home with him , and I 'll never set foot in this house again . Going C. Unc . Uncle Will you kindly leave my hat behind ? Mim . Mima I can not . I said I 'd give it on one condition . Unc . Uncle In the name of goodness , why do n't you say what you want , then ? Mim . Mima I 'm waiting to be asked . Please recollect you hav n't asked me yet . Comes down , puts his hat on his head , arranging it on his head , going up and down to adjust it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk reason . There ! that will do . Crosses to R. Now you are beginning to smile . How a smile becomes that hat ! It is n't a hat to get mad under ! Now , can I have your sofa ? Unc . Uncle L. My sofa ! Mim . Mima Yes , your sofa , out of the library  --  to put in there Points R. for company . Unc . Uncle Well , upon my word ! Mim . Mima Upon your word ! All right . Mind , I 've got your word on it . Remember your promise . Unc . Uncle I promised nothing . Mim . Mima Give me back the hat , then . Tries to get at it . He takes her hands . Unc . Uncle You shall have the sofa . It was not necessary to resort to stratagem . My nephew 's friends are welcome to all I possess . Mim . Mima Humbug ! Unc . Uncle How dare you ? Mim . Mima You know you do it all for my sake . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may kiss me . UNC. does so . She curtsies . Thank you . You 'll miss the sofa very much . Unc . Uncle Stage L. Never ! Do n't mention it . With a grimace . Mim . Mima It was very comfortable as a sofa , but as a good action , it will make you more comfortable still . Exits , L. U. E. Unc . Uncle The spoiled pixie . Going up . SPENCER enters , R. 2 E. Spencer . Going out , uncle ? How about your siesta ? Unc . Uncle How the dickens can a man sleep in a house upside down ? I 'll take a trot outdoors , and come back prepared to give up my bed , and sleep in a hammock . Exits , C. Sp . Spencer Calling after him . Do n't be long . Train 's overdue now . LIDA enters , dressed , R. 2 D. Lida . Oh , you 're there . Where did Mima go ? MIMA enters from library , meeting NAP and JOHN from L. C. Mima . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to library . We 'll have it here in a minute . Lid . Lida Poor uncle ! Mim . Mima We had a battle . I won it , and now I 'm going for the spoils . Exits , L. U. E. , with NAP and JOHN . Sp . Spencer Puts his arms around Lida 's waist . Now , everything is in order , take a moment 's comfort . Lid . Lida I ca n't . I 'm not nearly through . There 's somebody coming . Crosses to L. Sp . Spencer Holding her . No , there 's not . I 'm not nearly through , either . Lid . Lida Now , what do you want ? Sp . Spencer First  --  only a kiss . Lid . Lida I hav n't a moment 's time . Sp . Spencer Very well . Take your time . I can wait . JACKSON appears at L. C. Lid . Lida There is somebody . Breaks away , crosses to R. Good afternoon , Jackson . To Sp . I told you . Exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spencer Oh , Jackson . I sent for you to ask whether you found any partridges yesterday . Jack . Jackson Plenty , sir . Woods full of ' em . Sp . Spencer We shall have lots of company , and they 'll want the best sport we can give them . Jack . Jackson We can give them something first-rate , sir . Sp . Spencer You remember Mr. Laurens . He went out with us last year . Jack . Jackson Oh , he was a good one . I 'll be bound he 's come for fun . We made a good bag with him , sir . LIDA re-enters , R. 2 D. , as MIMA re-appears L. U. E. , followed by JOHN and NAP , carrying lounge , which they take off , R. 1 E. Return and exeunt L. C. Lida . Your daughter is really invaluable , Jackson . She takes all the trouble off my hands . Jack . Jackson L. Well , she 's been treated pretty well up here , ma'am , and she ought to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her home a bit , for to keep house for me . Lid . Lida R. I can give her an excellent character as housekeeper . Mima . Returns from seeing sofa off , R. 1 E. , pats Jack 's cheek . You dear old papa . Jack . Jackson Behave yourself . I 'm busy now . Sp . Spencer Have Peter and one or two boys ready at five to-morrow , Jackson . How is Juno ? Got over her trouble ? Jack . Jackson Famous , sir , and wild for the birds . Is that all , sir ? Sp . Spencer That 's all , Jackson . Jack . Jackson Now , come along , you baggage . Step out  --  one  --  two  --  one  --  two . Mim . Mima One  --  two  --  one  --  two . Exeunt , laughing and keeping step , R. U. E. Sp . Spencer Now , have you a moment to attend to your poor husband ? Lid . Lida R. Paul , you know I never neglect you , but so many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving you so much trouble , I could have invited one at a time . Lid . Lida Oh , it 's better to have them all at once , and be over with it . It would be all right , but for two things . Sp . Spencer Specify the difficulties . Lid . Lida First  --  Sister Barbie . That girl has such a will of her own . Sp . Spencer Your Aunt Cornelia comes with her , and may be safely trusted to manage the young lady . Your Aunt Cornelia knows what she 's about . She married you off , you know . Lid . Lida Oh , yes , but Barbie is not the weak-minded creature that I was ! She wo n't take the first man that offers , to oblige her aunt . Sp . Spencer Ahem ! let us pass on to the second difficulty . Lid . Lida The second difficulty is Aunt Cornelia herself . I 'm afraid of her . Sp . Spencer L. Why afraid of the harmless , necessary aunt ? Lid . Lida You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year 's experience stands in dread of these veterans . She 'll pick us all to pieces . Sp . Spencer Have no fear , darling , and all will be well . Lid . Lida Do n't you think I 've managed everything nicely ? Goes to L. D. This is for Mr. and Mrs. Laurens . Pushes door open . Sp . Spencer Decorated la chinoise . Very pretty . Lid . Lida The spare room up-stairs is for Mr. Flutterby , and these Goes to R. 1 E. are for aunt and Barbie . Sp . Spencer L. Capitally arranged . Lid . Lida Crosses to L. And that takes up every corner of the house . If a mouse were to pay us a visit , we hav n't a cupboard to put him into . Sp . Spencer I say , what if our friend De Rigby were to pop in on us ? Lid . Lida Mr. De Rigby ! Heavens ! you do n't expect him ? I thought he was n't coming ! Sp . Spencer I suppose not , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him down for the shooting . We do n't know what may happen . Lid . Lida Resolutely . If he comes , I give up . I sha n't know what on earth to do ! Sp . Spencer Poor fellow ! He was very fond of you  --  before our marriage , you know . Lid . Lida But think of our predicament ! Why , I had to give my dressing-room to Aunt Cornelia . Sp . Spencer Oh , a man can be stowed anywhere  --  on a billiard table . Lid . Lida But , my love , we hav n't another bed ! Would you like me to sleep in a trunk ? Sp . Spencer R. I was only joking . Rigby certainly wo n't come , without letting us know . Lid . Lida I declare you frightened me . I sincerely trust he 's safely back in England before this . Crosses to R. Sp . Spencer At this moment he is probably at the sea-side , making love to some fair mermaid , and just as I found him making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off before his very eyes . You know , making love is his weakness . It 's the standing joke against him . NAP enters quickly , smiling all over , L. C. Nap . Golly , Mass Spencer  --  He 's just a drivin ' up , sah ! Sp . Spencer Who 's just driving up ? Nap . Mr. De Rigby . Lid . Lida Sinks in chair , R. Oh , heavens ! Sp . Spencer Go down to the gate , and bring up his luggage . Nap . Yes , sah ! Golly , I'se glad Mass Rigby come ! Exits , L. C. Lid . Lida Anxiously , starting up . What on earth shall we do ? Sp . Spencer It 's awful , but it ca n't be helped . Rigby . Outside . All right , Nap . Lid . Lida There he is . Runs out , R. 2 D. RIGBY enters , followed by NAP , carrying gun-case , valise and hat-box , L. C. Rigby . Here I am , old boy ! What do you say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his hand warmly . I 'm glad to see you . Rig . Rigby Did n't write purposely . Wanted to spring it upon you . Sp . Spencer You have sprung it admirably . Rig . Rigby I 'm glad to hear it . Would have come to see you long ago , old fellow , but could n't manage to get off for longer than a day . Now I 've got two weeks at least , and can settle down comfortably with you  --  that is , if it 's no inconvenience . Sp . Spencer Glancing after his wife . Not in the least . Make yourself at home . Rig . Rigby Thank you . Takes off hat , gloves , etc . Nap . Whar shall I put de things , sah ? Sp . Spencer Hm ! ask Mrs. Spencer . Nap . She told me to ax you , sah . Sp . Spencer Confused . Well , put them down for the present . Nap . Yes , sah  --  dey is dere already , sah ! Exits , C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital arrangements . Sp . Spencer R. Yes , the house is unfortunately rather small . It 's all on this floor , except a couple of attic closets up-stairs . Rig . Rigby What of that ? Old friends do n't mind a little cramping ; so , if it 's all the same , I 'll take my attic at once . Goes to glass . Beastly driving over here . Jolly nasty climate you 've got ! Which way do I go ? Crosses to R. Sp . Spencer Well  --  ah  --  wait and see Mrs. Spencer before you go  --  to  --  your room . Rig . Rigby Surveys himself . I 'd rather make up a bit before I meet her . I 'm a little ruffled . Got out at the wrong station , and had to drive over in a wagon . Roads were damnable , as the theologians say . By the way , old fellow , I had quite an adventure . Sp . Spencer Indeed ! Was she pretty ? You 're as soft as ever . Rig . Rigby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot ! It was the first glimpse I had of her , as she got off the train  --  then her walk ! Not a vulgar , solid , female tramp , but a floating  --  a skimming  --  an undulating  --  Sp . Spencer C. Yes , yes , I know ! Rig . Rigby R. And that foot and walk belonged to a creature ! I  --  I never beheld anything so perfect ! Oh , my dear fellow , she was a corker ! What a woman  --  tall , slender , distingue  --  how shall I describe her ? I tell you , a being produced by nature regardless of cost . Crosses to L. Sp . Spencer Poor fellow ! Same Digby de Rigby ! Rig . Rigby No . I no longer fall in love with every pretty face . I have , however , acquired a true sense of the really beautiful . Sp . Spencer Same thing . Rig . Rigby Sits on sofa , L. To return to my adventure . I was absorbed in contemplation of her form and movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That settled you . Rig . Rigby To use a cant expression  --  I was " off . " Sp . Spencer Describe her matchless features ! Rig . Rigby She was a blonde . You know , I have a weakness for blondes . When she finally moved away  --  Sp . Spencer You followed . Rig . Rigby No , I was insensibly drawn after . Sp . Spencer Same thing , same result . Rig . Rigby I had the good fortune to pick up her satchel . She thanked me . I dexterously opened  --  Sp . Spencer The satchel ? Rig . Rigby A conversation . She talked with greatest readiness . Not a bit of diffidence . Wonderful , you know . I secured her a seat in waiting room  --  brought her a cup of tea  --  received the sweetest of thanks , and began to walk in the clouds . Sp . Spencer R. Your favorite walk . Rig . Rigby In the midst of my happiness , another party interposed . A threatening , fiery female bore down upon us  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , as the mariners say , a perfect piratical old hulk . Sp . Spencer R. I suppose you mean by that , a respectable , well-behaved , elderly lady , with no nonsense about her . Rig . Rigby Not a nonsense ! Of course , she thanked me for my attentions to her niece , and then engrossed the conversation . I could n't get another word with the angel . The aunt seemed bound to find out who I was , and where I was going . I paid her off with a plumper , told her I travelled for a champagne house  --  Duc de Montebello  --  and was drumming the neighborhood . Sp . Spencer Very neat and ready . Did she swallow it ? Rig . Rigby To use an ornithological expression  --  like a magpie . Sp . Spencer And dropped you immediately ? Rig . Rigby To borrow a culinary illustration  --  like a hot potato . She whisked her niece off , at the double quick . But here I am chattering , when I ought to be brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Rig . Rigby Looks at his clothes . It 's a capital suit for travelling , but it wo n't do for the ladies . So , old fellow , if you do n't mind  --  where is my room ? Up stage . Sp . Spencer R. Wait till Nap comes to carry your things . Rig . Rigby No , no , I 'm an old campaigner and help myself . Picks up all his things and stands waiting with his eyeglass in his eye . Sp . Spencer Aside . There 's no help for it , I must give him a place somewhere . Aloud . Well , if you will have it . Opens door , L. Here you are . Rig . Rigby Looks in . Charming ! It 's really too fine ! Bouquets , flowers ! Well , old fellow , this is what I call a reception ! Shakes hands . This is friendly ! Drops his hat-box . SP. picks it up , and pushes him off with it . Exits , L. 1 E. Sp . Spencer Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I possibly stow him , when they put him out of that ? LIDA enters , R. 2 D. Lida . I 'm so glad , dear , you 're alone .

Mrs. Partradge You admit , I suppose , that there should be a limit to jesting with ladies . Rig . Rigby There should be ! For instance , nobody would jest with you , not if he knew you ! If I had only remembered your niece 's kindness in the past  --  not this one , but the other ; or , in fact , perhaps remembered this one , and recollected that Miss Lida , or rather Mrs. Spencer  --  Paul 's wife in fact ; that is , I say , if I had only remembered that she  --  that is , that you  --  Emphasizes the latter part of his speech by pointing on his fingers and finishes with : You understand ?

She says I received too much attention this evening . Sp . Spencer Ah ! Bar . Barbie And that it is n't proper for a young girl . Now I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell on pedestal and back . Sp .

Barbie Old ladies ca n't , married ladies must n't , so there 's nobody but young girls left  --  and yet we 're scolded . Sp . Spencer What did she say to that admirable presentation of the case ? Bar . Barbie You should have heard ! But I know it 's all her prejudice against poor Mr. De Rigby . Now what did we do ? I leave it to you ! We sat together at table and laughed and joked , and afterwards we looked over your book of photographs together . Sp . Spencer And afterwards he handed you tea , and sat with you to drink it , and finally you sang and played with him . Bar . Barbie L. , pauses , then fixedly . Do you want to begin at me , too ? Sp . Spencer Oh ! no . I want you to enjoy yourself . Bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is so awfully jolly . Sp . Spencer So he is .

Barbie To herself . I can not understand why they are all so down on him . Jack . Jackson I 'll send the dogs on ahead of us , to the swale west of Melford ; and if you put Mr. Laurens just beyond the chestnuts , and Mr. De Rigby towards the bushes , they 'll all have some of the woodcock . The other gentleman , Mr. Flutterby , he do n't mind , I reckon , where he 's put . I guess he 's no sportsman . Sp . Spencer Looks at watch . We start at ten , sharp . Moon will be full up then .

Spencer Crossing and sitting beside her . Now look here , my dear child  --  Bar . Barbie Warningly . We are to talk in reason . Sp . Spencer Certainly . To begin , I know my friend Rigby thoroughly , and I must tell you , that his habit is to flatter all your sex indiscriminately . Bar . Barbie I think it is a very nice habit . Sp .

Barbie However , it 's just as well you warned me . I 'll be very careful . I 'll sit next to him at table for the last time to-morrow , and observe him carefully . Sp . Spencer You seem to take a great deal of interest in him . Bar . Barbie How can I help it ? First aunt warns me against him , and now you . Sp . Spencer I do n't warn you against him , but against yourself . Bar . Barbie Piqued , rises . That is quite unnecessary . Crosses to R. You need n't think that I can be caught as easily as my sister was . SP. looks blank and digs his hands into his pockets .

Mima Who has been nervously fussing with tea-cup . Heavens ! Drops it . It slipped from my fingers . Jack . Jackson It slipped from your bad conscience ! Mim . Mima I hav n't got a bad conscience  --  although I do sing with young Mr. Blum in church . Is that wrong ? Jack . Jackson Sing with him  --  no ! But I saw him squeeze your hand turning over the music ! The infernal , impudent , Dutch apothecary rascal ! He 's got more assurance than forty Yankees put together ! Mim . Mima Amazed .

Remember , we are not in our own house , and Mr. Blum do n't come here to see us . And , anyway , a person of his retiring disposition is easily hurt .

RIGBY and FLUTTERBY enter , C. , in hunting costume . Rigby . C. Nobody down yet . Sees Mim. , R. Ah , my young hostess ! To Flut . You have seen my wigwam ; let me present the fair squaw , who graces it with her presence . Crosses R. and sits at table . MIM. curtsies . Flutterby . Charming . She even curtsies . Quite an early English squaw . Crosses R. Mim . Mima Going up , C. I wonder how long they 'll keep Theobald in the closet ? Rig . Rigby Pretty creature , eh ? Flut . Flutterby I do n't much care for these children of nature . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for the uncultivated variety . Rig . Rigby The wild strawberry has a flavor of its own , very much to my liking . Flut . Flutterby Tastes differ . Rig . Rigby Yes . Have a cigar ? Offers case . Flut . Flutterby Thank you , I prefer cigarettes , Takes out small case . RIG . lights his cigar . FLUT. watches him without lighting his . They say he makes love to every woman he meets . He paid Mrs. Laurens marked attention this evening . I 'll find out his game , and what I have to fear in him . Spoken aside . Rig . Rigby Got a light ? Offers box . Flut . Flutterby Thanks . Lights cigarette . Mim . Mima At back . They are going to settle down . Oh dear ! BL . puts his head out and quickly withdraws it . Flut . Flutterby Sits . You had an enviable seat at dinner . Rig . Rigby Between Mrs. Laurens and Miss Barbie . I was set like a pearl in diamonds . Flut . Flutterby I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rigby Nice old lady . When I speak to her niece , her eyes become gimlets , and screw into my very soul . I tried to engage her in conversation during one of your frequent pauses . I said , " I hope we shall have a fine day to-morrow . " Flut . Flutterby Well , how did she take it ? Rig . Rigby She told me , I might as well have added that brilliant remark to all the rest I had bestowed on her niece . Flut . Flutterby Not bad that . Rig . Rigby No , and done like a flash . It quite stunned me . Flut . Flutterby We agree upon the aunt  --  so pass her over . Rig . Rigby Oh , I pass . Flut . Flutterby Which of the others do you like best ? Rig . Rigby That 's hard to say . Flut . Flutterby A connaisseur like you , must have an opinion . You paid them all marked attention . Rig . Rigby Flattered . You noticed it ? That 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of the literary faculty , expresses itself in general homage to the sex . Flut . Flutterby Very neatly termed  --  considering your want of the literary faculty . Aside . Conceited ass . Crash heard in closet . Mim . Mima Aside . Heavens ! he has stepped on something . Rig . Rigby What 's that ? Mim . Mima Running down L. , then up . That ? It must have been the cat . Rig . Rigby Sounded like two or three cats . Mim . Mima Aside . Oh , dear ! Aloud . Puss ! puss ! puss ! Exits , R. U. E. Flut . Flutterby Crosses to L. I see that you are too much of a diplomat , to show your hand . But , as we are the only bachelors in the house , suppose we confide in each other  --  just enough to avoid competition . Rig . Rigby R. Very sensible idea . Flut . Flutterby Offers hand . We will hold nothing back . Rig . Rigby Takes hand . Make a clean breast of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly . What do you think of Mrs. Laurens ? Rig . Rigby Mrs. Laurens ? Charming ! Harmony in face , form , voice , mind , dress and everything  --  a poem ! a rhythm of nature , metaphysically speaking . Flut . Flutterby Aside . I suspected it . But I 'll save her . Rig . Rigby You are silent . You do n't agree with me ? Flut . Flutterby On the contrary  --  it 's precisely my idea of her . Rig . Rigby Sighs . But she 's married . Flut . Flutterby You find that embarrassing ? Rig . Rigby Naturally . She 's an appropriated treasure . Laurens is a happy man . So is she . I mean they are a happy couple . Flut . Flutterby It is an obstacle . Rig . Rigby It 's an obstacle there 's no getting over . Flut . Flutterby R. Perhaps . Sending a curl of smoke out of his mouth . Did you ever speculate in stocks ? Rig . Rigby No , but another fellow did for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flutterby Well , sometimes your fancy is at a premium  --  sometimes it goes down to nothing . That 's the way with matrimonial felicity . If you think of investing your attentions profitably , watch the market . Rig . Rigby Eye-glass up , L. Investing your attentions ! That 's something new . Flut . Flutterby For instance . Last summer I went to Newfoundland with them . Laurens was out all day , hunting white porpoises . Rig . Rigby White porpoises ? Flut . Flutterby White porpoises . Rig . Rigby Oh , I know , those fellows that turn sommersaults in the air . Flut . Flutterby His wife sat for hours on the shore , watching for his return . Stocks were up . No time to buy . Rig . Rigby R. You mean the grapes were sour . That 's an equally suitable metaphor . Flut . Flutterby I waited for a change in the market . Rig . Rigby Indeed ! Aside . The fellow 's a dangerous character . Flut . Flutterby Aside . He takes it coolly . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' em . Loud . I think now , that stocks are going down . I predict a crash in the immediate future . Crosses to R. , takes lamp off and goes to staircase . Will you go to my room , till they are ready to start ? Rig . Rigby No , thank you . Flut . Flutterby Excuse the lamp . Aside . He sha n't have ten words with her , while he stays in the house . I 'll see to that . Goes up with lamp and exits at back up stairs . Stage darkened . Rig . Rigby I wish that young gentleman had n't confided his diabolical plans to me . I feel quite uncomfortable . MIMA enters , R. U. E. Mima . Are you going to the farm-house , sir ? Rig . Rigby No , I think I should prefer staying here for a chat with you . Mim . Mima Oh , I hav n't the time . I have to look after so much , and the wagon will be here presently . Why , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamp ? Rig . Rigby No . I 'll go and look for the comet . I shall dream of white porpoises for a week . Exits , C. BLUM emerges . Blum . Gott im Himmel ! Mim . Mima Retreating . What a noise you made . Bl . Blum Do n't go , Chemima . Mim . Mima I must . He 's coming back . Exits , R. U. E. BLUM runs back , but puts his head out again ; hearing no one , he comes out . Blum . Mima ! Mima ! That 's a nice idea ! If I can find my ways to the door  --  Stumbles over stairs . Where de deuce I leave those gardriges ? Gropes for them . RIGBY re-enters , C. Rigby . Cigar 's gone out . I left my matches here . Feels on table and catches Bl . ' s hand . Pull to and fro across table . Who 's this ? Bl . Blum Aside , and sinking under table , trying to pull his hand away . Jiminy Cripps ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you ? Who the dickens have I got hold of ? Bl . Blum If you will be so kind and let go my hand . Rig . Rigby Strange voice ! What do you want here ? Seizes him by the collar . What are you crawling about for ? MIMA re-enters with lamp , shading it with her hand . Stage lightened . Mima . He must have got away by this time . Sees the group . Oh ! Gives a little scream . Bl . Blum Please , Miss Chemima , tell him it was all right . Rig . Rigby Looks at both and releases him . I see . It 's the cat . I beg a thousand pardons . Do n't let me interrupt the feline concert . About to go . Mim . Mima Places lamp on table , up stage , and intercepts him . No , you sha n't go away like that . Rig . Rigby C. But , my dear  --  Mim . Mima L. , in tears and indignant . You must listen to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulations  --  but , as a third party is superfluous in such cases  --  Mim . Mima It 's not a laughing matter . Bl . Blum No , it was n't . It 's no choke . We are met for de last time . Her fader wo n't haf me . Rig . Rigby It 's growing tragical . Mim . Mima We first saw each other at the singing school . Rig . Rigby Getting musical . Just the place to establish harmonious relations . Mim . Mima Introducing . Mr. de Rigby  --  Mr. Blum . Rig . Rigby How do you do , Mr. Blum . I regret that our first acquaintance was made in the dark . Bl . Blum Dot 's right , I have to keep in de dark as much as possible . Her fader wo n't haf no druggist . It 's a good business , too . Rig . Rigby Very , for the proprietor . Takes a hand of each . Well , my children , and so you are wretched ? Mim . Mima Yes . Rig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bl . Blum Was you acquainted with them ? Rig . Rigby Not personally . But then , remember that poison party , Romeo and Juliet , and that water party , Hero and Leander ! Bl . Blum R. That 's so , Mima . If your fader separates us , we drown ourself , or we poison de lemonade . Rig . Rigby Let us look the matter calmly in the face . We have one thing on our side . You love each other . Bl . and Mim . We do . Rig . Rigby C. I 've been in love myself . Mim . Mima L. I 'm so glad ! Both take his hands . Bl . Blum You know how it was yourself . Rig . Rigby And I have learnt one lesson . If a woman loves a man she will have him . Mim . Mima Then she did n't love you ! Rig . Rigby Evidently . But , as you love him , we will succeed . I will be your friend , and , as the story book says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wagon and whips outside . Mim . Mima Hark ! There 's father and the dogs . To Bl . Run ! No , wait . I 'll go with you . The dogs might n't know you , and if they saw you running  --  Bl . Blum I might n't like it , neither . Mim . Mima Come with me . It 's all right . Runs back . Thank you , Mr. de Rigby , from the bottom of my heart . Bl . Blum Runs back . I dank you , doo ! Embraces him and is pulled back by MIM. , C. Rig . Rigby Lights cigar . This is too touching , and if it was n't for the white porpoises that keep continually leaping up in my head , I could enjoy the situation . Confound that young scamp and his quotations in the matrimonial market . Exits , C. Noise of whips . BARBIE runs in from her room , R. 1 E. Barbie . What 's all the noise about , I wonder . SPENCER entering from R. U. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the dogs . Jackson has just arrived with them in the wagon . Lida . C. At what hour shall we have dinner to-morrow , dear ? Sp . Spencer L. It 's very uncertain , darling , when we shall get back . It all depends upon the woodcock . Lid . Lida Well , about what hour , do you think ? Sp . Spencer Anywhere between six and nine . Lid . Lida Three hours ! Everything will be spoiled . Sp . Spencer We sha n't mind if we have a good day . Bar . Barbie Coming down R. You wo n't mind . But what are we to do ? To Lid . That just shows what men are ! But it 's the fault of the wives  --  they do n't manage right . Lid . Lida Indeed ! What would you call proper management in a case like this ? Bar . Barbie Firmly , crosses to C. I would say : My darling , we dine at six , so arrange to be punctual . Sp . Spencer To Lid. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. My heart bleeds for you , Lida , when I see how you submit to your tyrant . Lid . Lida R. But Paul is not a tyrant . Bar . Barbie Yes he is , and so are all the men , and yet they can be twisted around a woman 's little finger . Lid . Lida I thought so once . Get married , and you 'll find out the mistake . Bar . Barbie I 'll take precious good care not to . But I 'll prove I 'm right , all the same . I shall command , and I shall be obeyed ! Crosses to L. , she lays on sofa , her head resting on two cushions . Lid . Lida You 're a little goose . LAURENS in shooting dress and MERYL enter from their room , L. Meryl . Crossing to C. What do you think I 've been doing ever since dinner  --  making cartridges . Laurens . Patting her cheek . You could n't spend your time better . BAR . shrugs her shoulders , and curls herself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst of it was , I had to listen all the time to accounts of my liege lord 's wonderful shots . Lau . Laurens Instructive , as well as amusing . To Sp . Did I ever tell you about that remarkable shot  --  Mer . Meryl To Lau . There , there ! that 'll do . Spare me any more of it . Brings him down front . Did you remember , dear , that to-morrow was mother 's birthday ? Lau . Laurens Is it ? I quite forgot . Mer . Meryl I hope you 'll write to her . Lau . Laurens Yes , I 'll send her a telegram to-night . Mer . Meryl No , no , telegrams always alarm her . You can just add a line to my letter . It wo n't take a moment . Do it now . Urging him off . Lau . Laurens I will , just as soon as I 've seen the dogs safe in the cart . Pont never stops howling till he sees me . Sp . Spencer I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solicitude for dogs is something touching . Mer . Meryl It 's a sad thing for us . Take my advice , and never let your husband become so infatuated with sport . Lid . Lida Oh , let them enjoy themselves . It makes them good tempered . Mer . Meryl What 's the use of their good tempers , if they are never home ? That 's the trouble with the sporting fever . It depopulates the fireside , and it 's all the worse because it 's apparently so innocent . The man who gambles or drinks , is open to reproach , but a man fond of yachting , or fishing , or shooting  --  it 's so harmless ! But it enables them to get away from us , and stay away all the same , I notice . Bar . Barbie Pretending to read , now looks over her book . This is very instructive , No fishing or shooting when I get married ! Lid . Lida To Mer . You exaggerate . Laughs . Mer . Meryl Oh , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of Europe in the dog days , so that Laurens could be back in time for the woodcock . Now I do n't laugh . I know that his dog and gun are dearer than his wife . Lid . Lida Oh , oh ! Crosses to C. Bar . Barbie Aside . I think myself that 's rather strong . Lid . Lida My husband can never get to that point . Mer . Meryl R. I sincerely hope that you are not cherishing illusions . Bar . Barbie Aloud . And so do I. Lid . Lida You shall see . I mean to ask him in your presence whether he prefers sport to his home . Bar . Barbie How green you are ! Jumping up . Of course he 'll say just what you wish , and go on and do exactly as he pleases . Lid . Lida No , he will not . It 's a question of honor with me now to justify him , and I 'll do it . I 'll ask him to remain at home to-morrow . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mer . Meryl It will be a great deal , certainly . Lid . Lida To Bar . Do n't you tell him what I want him to do . Do n't say a word . Crosses to R. Bar . Barbie I wo n't . I 'm here to learn , and the prospect looks very agreeable . Sits on sofa , L. Mer . Meryl Well , I 'll assist you with an experiment on my husband . I 'll ask him so stay home to-morrow . I wish I may get it . Lid . Lida If we unite our forces , success is certain . MRS . PARTRADGE enters , R. 1 E. Mrs. Partradge . Where 's Barbie ? Lid . Lida You 're just in time , aunt . We need you for a conspiracy . Crosses to her . Mrs. P. Mrs. Partradge Crosses to R. C.

MER. goes to Lau. , FLUT. to Mrs. P. , SP. and LID . come down . Lid . Lida I have a great favor to ask of you , Paul . Sp . Spencer Tenderly . What is it , darling ? Lid . Lida Give up shooting to-morrow , and stay with us . Sp . Spencer Both come down , C. Hey ! How you frightened me  --  I thought you were in earnest . You 're joking ! Lid . Lida No , I 'm not .

Laurens L. , to Sp . Stay at home in such weather ! It 's nonsense ! Impossible ! MER. pulls him back and talks to him . Sp . Spencer To Lid . Did you hear that ? Lid . Lida If you remain , none of the others will go . Do grant me this favor . Sp . Spencer But why ? Only tell me why ? Lid . Lida The reason do n't matter . I beg you  --  that ought to be enough !

MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , R. , with LAU . Mer . Meryl I ask it , as a proof of your affection for me . Lau . Laurens I can show my affection in a more sensible manner . It would be folly , to yield to a mere caprice . I say , Spencer , you would n't allow yourself to be coaxed , would you ? Sp . Spencer After a glance at Lid . Certainly not . We start at once ! Lau . Laurens That 's sensible . Lid . Lida Sinks on chair . I 'm an unhappy woman ! Mer . Meryl Goes to Lid . I pity you from my heart . Bar . Barbie Aside to Mrs. P. Now , auntie , your turn . Bring up your heavy artillery ! Mrs. P. Mrs. Partradge Rising majestically . Gentlemen ! LAU. and SP. turn respectfully .
