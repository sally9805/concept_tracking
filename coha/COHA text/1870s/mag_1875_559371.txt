OF SOME RAILROAD ACCIDENTS . THE assertion has a strange , at first , indeed , almost a harsh and brutal sound , and yet it is unquestionably true , that , so far as the * , eneral welfare , the common good of mankind is concerned , few lives are so profitably expended as those of the unfortunate victims of railroad accidents . This , it is true , may not be saying much ; for it is a melancholy fact that there are few things of which either nature or man is , as a rule , more lavish than human life ; provided always that the methods used in extinguishing it are customary and not unduly obtrusive on the sight and nerves . As a necessary consequence of this wastefulness , it follows also that the results which flow from the extin0uishment of the individual life are , as a rule , pitiably small . Any person curious to satisfy himself as to the truth of either or both of these propositions can do so easily enough by visiting those frequent haunts in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily by a careful study of the weekly bills of mortality as they are issued by the authorities of any c , reat city . Indeed , compared with the massive battalions daily sacrificed in the perpetual conflict which mankind seems forever doomed to wage against intemperance , bad sewerage , and worse ventilation , the victims of regular warfare by sea and land count as but single spies . The worst of it is , too , that if the blood of the martyrs is in these cases at all the seed of the church , it is a seed terribly slow of germination . Each step in the slow progress is a human Golgotha . It is far otherwise with the victims of railroad disasters ; they , at least , do not lose their lives without great and immediate compensating benefits to mankind . After each new railroad " horror , " as it is called , the whole world travels with an appreciably increased degree of safety . The causes which led to it are anxiously investigated by ingenious men , new appliances are invented , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inculcated . And hence it has resulted that each year , and in obvious consequence of each fresh catastrophe , travel by rail has become safer and safer , until it has been said , and with no inconsiderable degree of truth too , that the very safest place into which a man can put himself is the inside of a first-class railroad carriage on a train in full motion . The study of railroad horrors is , therefore , the furthest possible from being a useless one , and a record of them is hardly less instructive than interesting . If carried too far it is apt , as matter for light reading , to become somewhat monotonous ; though , about railroad accidents as about everything else , there is none the less an almost endless variety . Even in the forms of sudden death on the rail , nature seems to take a grim delight in an infinitude of surprises . With a true dramatic propriety , the ghastly record , which has since grown so long , begins with the opening of the first railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system into existence as a successfully accomplished fact , the eventful 15th of September , 1830 . DEATH OF MR. 1TUSKISSON . That day had opened upon Liverpool bright and warm ; the city was thronged with strangers , while gay and eager crowds lined the new thoroughfare on either side throughout its entire length , from the Mount Olives cut to Manchester . The arrangements were very perfect , and , during its earlier hours , the great gala occasion seemed likely to pass away unmarred by any mishap . A brilliant party , consisting of the directors of the new enterprise and their invited guests , were to pass over the road from Liverpool to Manchester , dine at the latter place , and return to Liverpool in the 1875. 571 // afternoon . Their number was large and they filled eight trains of carriages , drawn by as many locomotives . The Dnke of Wellington , then prime minister , was the most prominent personage there , and he with his party occupied the state cars , which were drawn by the locomotive Northumbrian , upon which George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car of one of the sncceeding trains was Mr. William iluskisson , then a member of Parliament for Liverpool and eminent among the more prominent public men of the day as a financier and economist . He had been very active in promoting the construction of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester road , and now that it was completed he had exerted himself greatly to render its opening day a success worthy an enterprise the far - reaching consequences of which he was among the few to appreciate . All the trains had started promptly from Liverpool , and had proceeded gayly along through an ovation of applause until at eleven o'clock they had reached Parkside , seventeen miles upon their journey , where it had been arranged that the locomotives were to replenish their supplies of water . As soon as the trains had stopped , disregarding every caution against their so doin * , the excited and joyous passen* , ers left their carriages and mingled together , eagerly congratulating one another upon the unalloyed success of the occasion . Mr. Huskisson , though in poor health and somewhat lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among the first to thus expose himself . Presently he caught the eye of the Duke of Wellington , standing at the door of his car . Now it so happened that for some time previous a coolness had existed between the two public men , the duke having as premier , with that military curtness for which he was famed , dismissed Mr. Huskisson from the cabinet of which he had been a member , and that , as was generally considered , without any sufficient cause . There had in fact been a most noticeable absence of courtesy in that ministerial crisis . The two now met face to face for the first time since the breach between them had taken place , and the duke 's manner evinced a disposition to be conciliatory which was by no means usual with that austere soldier . Mr. Huskisson at once responded to the overture , and , going up to the door of the state carriage , he and his former chief shook hands and then entered into conversation . As they were talking , the duke seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Rocket locomotive - the same famous Rocket which a year previous had won the five hundred pounds prize , and by so doing established forever the feasibility of rapid steam locomotion - came along upon the other track to take its place at the watering station . It came up slowly and so silently that its approach was hardly noticed ; until , suddenly , an alarm was given , and , as every one immediately ran to resume his place , some commotion naturally ensued . In addition to being lame , Mr. Huskisson seemed also under these circumstances to be quite agitated , and , instead of quietly standing against the side of the carriage and allowing the Rocket to pass , he nervously tried to get round its open door , which was swinging out across the space between the two tracks in such a way that the approaching locomotive struck it , flinging it back , and at the same time throwing Mr. Huskisson down . He fell on his face in the open space between the tracks , but with his left leg over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was moving , so that one of its wheels ran obliquely up the limb to the thigh , erushin* , it shockingly . As if to render the distressing circumstances of the catastrophe complete , it so happened that the unfortunate man had left his wife 's side when he got out of his car , and now he had been flung down before her eyes as he sought to re*nter it . He was immediately raised , but he knew that his hurt was mortal , and his first exclamation was , " I have met my death ! " He was at once placed on one of the state carriages , to which the Northumbrian locomotive was attached , and in twenty-five minutes was carried to Eceles , a distance of fifteen 572 November , // miles , where medical assistance was ob-. tamed . He was far beyond its reach , however , and upon the evening of the same day , before his companions of the morning had completed their journey , he was dead . Necessarily the accident to Mr. Huskisson threw a deep gloom over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , only with the utmost difficulty that the Duke of Wellington was prevailed upon not at once to return to Liverpool . The party did at last go on , but the day , which in its earlier hours had promised to be so bright and so auspicious , proved in its later hours sad and anxious enough . In the first place , the crowd which thronged alone the railroad track was so great as to be wholly beyond control ; neither was it a peculiarly good-natured or well-disposed gathering . For just then the public distress and discontent throughout England was greater than it had been within the memory of any man living ; and , indeed , even now , it may be fairly questioned whether England ever saw a sadder or more anxious year than that in which the railroad era at last struggled pain fully into life . Not unnaturally , in view of his official position and his hard , unyielding character , - set like a flint against any measure of sympathy or reform ,  --  the premier-duke was probably the most unpopular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excursionists approached Manchester , the eyes of the prime minister were offended by distasteful mottoes and emblems , while more than once missiles even were thrown at the train . Finally , the directors were very glad to get the ministerial party out of Manchester and back to Liverpool at the cost of a derangement of their entire schedule for the day ; nor did the duke subsequently hear Broughain 's famous speech , made at the dinner given at Liverpool in honor of the event , in which with such infinite oratorical skill he referred at once to the wonders of the system that day inaugurated and to the catastrophe which had saddened its opening observances . " When , " he said , " I saw the diffi 573 culties of space , as it were , overcome ; when I beheld a kind of miracle exhibited before my astonished eyes ; when I saw the rocks excavated and the gigantic power of man penetrating through miles of the solid mass , and gaining a great , a lasting , an almost perennial conquest over the powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , was it possible for me to avoid the reflections which crowded into my mind , not in praise of man 's great success , not in admiration of the genius and perseverance he had displayed , or even of the courage he had shown in setting himseh against the obstacles that matter afforded to his course - no ! but the melancholy reflection , that these prodigious efforts of the human race , so fruitful of praise but so much more fruitful of lasting blessings to mankind , have forced a tear from my eye by that unhappy casualty which deprived me of a friend and you of a representa-tive ! " Though wholly attributable to his own carelessness , the death of so prominent a character as Mr. Huskisson , on such an occasion , could not but make a deep impression on the public mind . The fact that the dying man was carried seventeen miles in twenty-five minutes , in search of rest and medical aid , served rather to stimulate the vague apprehension of danger which thereafter associated itself with the new means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage which called for no inconsiderable display of nerve on the part of those using it . Indeed , as respects the safety of travel by rail there is an edifying similarity between the impressions which prevailed in England forty - five years ago and those which prevail in China now ; for , when only last year it was proposed to introduce railroads into the Celestial Empire , a vigorous native protest was fulminated against them , in which , among other things scarcely less astounding , it was alleged that " in all countries where railroads exist they are considered a very dangerous mode of locomotion , and , beyond those who have very urgent busi Of Some Railroad Accidents . // 574 ness to transact , no one thinks of using . nals . On that occasion obstacles were si*naled to those in charge of the succeeding trains by a man on the pioneer locomotive , who used for that purpose a bit of lighted tarred rope . Through all the years between 1830 and 1841 , nevertheless , not a single serious railroad disaster had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemption , among other things , to very fortunate and narrow escapes ; and , curiously enough , the first accident which was at all serious in its character , which occurred after the death of Mr. iluskisson , was in its circumstances - except as respected loss of life - almost an exact parallel to the famous Revere disaster which happened in Massachusetts in August , 1871 . It chanced on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway on the 23d of December , 1832. them . " On this subject , however , of the dangers incident to journeys by rail , a writer of nearly half a century hack , who has left us one of the earliest descriptions of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester road , thus reassured the public of those days , with a fresh quaintness of style which lends a present value to his words : " The occurrence of accidents is not so frequent as might be imagined , as the great weight of the carriages " ( they wei*hed about one tenth part as much as those now in use in America ) " prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great is the momentum acquired by these heavy loads moving with such rapidity , that they easily pass over considerable obstacles . Even in those melancholy accidents where loss of life has been sustained , the bodies of the unfortunate sufferers , thou , *h run over by the wheels , have caused little irregularity in the motion , and the passengers in the carriages have not been sensible that any impediment has been encountered on the road . " Indeed , from the time of Mr. Huskisson 's death , during a period of over eleven years , railroads enjoyed a remarkable and most fortunate exemption from accidents . During all that time there did not occur a single disaster resulting in any considerable loss of life . This happy exemption was probably due to a variety of causes . Those early roads were , in the first place , remarkably well and thoroughly built , and were very cautiously operated under a light volume of traffic . The precautions then taken and the appliances in use would , it is true , strike the modern railroad superintendent as both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running of independent pilot locomotives in advance of all night passenger trains , and it was , by the way , on a pioneer locomotive of this description , on the return trip of the excursion party from Manchester after the accident to Mr. Huskisson , that the first recorded attempt was made in the direction of our present elaborate system of night sig nix RAINHILL COLLISION OF 1832 . The second-class morning train had stopped at the Rainhill station to take in passengers , when those upon it heard through the dense fog another train , which had left Manchester forty-five minutes later , coming towards them at a high rate of speed . When it first became visible it was but one hundred and fifty yards off , and a collision was inevitable . Those in charge of the stationary train , however , succeeded in getting it under a slight headway , and in so much diminished the shock of the collision ; but the last five carriages were notwithstanding injured , the one at the end being totally demolished . Though quite a number of the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one only , strange to say , was killed . This result was very different from that experienced by the Massachusetts corporation at Revere nearly forty years later , and , as the circumstances were much the same , it is necessary to conclude that luck varied . Indeed , the luck - for it was nothing else - of those earlier times was truly amazing . Thus on this same Liverpool &amp; Manchester road , as a first-class train on the morning of April 17 , 1836 , was // moving at a speed of some thirty miles an hour , an axle broke un ( ler the first passenger coach , causing the whole train to leave the track and throwing it down the embankment , which at that point was twenty feet high . The cars were rolled over , and the passengers in them tumbled about topsy-turvy ; nor , as they were securely locked in , could they even extricate themselves when at last the wreck of the train reached firm bearings . And yet no one was killed . Here the corporation was saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous good fortune received terrible illustration in a disaster which recently occurred on the Great Western Railway under almost precisely similar conditions , - that at Shipton-on-Cherwell , on December 24 , 1874 . THE SHIPTON-ox-dHERWELL AccIDENT . It was the day immediately preceding Christmas , and every train whichat that holiday season leaves London is densely packed , for all England seems then to gather away from its cities to the country hearths . Accordingly , the ten o'clock London express on the Great Western Railway , when it left Oxford that morning , was made up of no less than fifteen passenger carriages and baggage vans , drawn by two powerful locomotives and containing nearly three hundred passengers . About seven miles north of Oxford , as the train , moving at a speed of some thirty to forty miles an hour , was rounding a gentle curve in the approach to the bridge over the little river Cherwell , the tire of one of the wheels of the passenger coach next behind the locomotive broke , throwin* it off the track . For a short distance it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the locomotives noticed that something was wrong , and most naturally , and with the very best of intentions , they instantly did the very worst thing which under the circumstances it was in their power to do : they applied their brakes and reversed their engines ; their single thought was to stop the train . Had locomotives an ( l cars been equipped with the continuous train-brakes now so generally in use in America , this action of the engine drivers would have checked at the same instant the speed of each particular car , and probably any serious catastrophe would have been averted . With the train equipped as it was , however , had these men , instead of crowding on their brakes and reversing their engines , simply shutoff their steam , and by a gentle application of the brakes checked the speed gradually , and so as to avoid any strain on the couplings , the cars would probably have held together and remained upon the road-bed . Instead of this , however , the sudden checking of the two ponderous locomotives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which the unfortunate leading car , already off the rails , was crushed under the weight and impetus of the succeeding cars . The train instantly zig-za , *ged in every direction under the pressure , the eouplin* , s which connected it together snapping ; and the cars , after leaving the rails to the right and left and running down the embankment of about thirteen feet in height , came to a stand-still at last , several of them in the reverse order from that which they had held while in the train . The first carriage was run over and completely destroyed ; the five rear ones were alone left upon the road-bed , and of these two only were on the rails ; of the ten which went down the embankment , two were demolished . In this disaster thirty-four passengers lost their lives , and sixty-five others , besides four employees of the company , were injured . These two disasters , divided from each other by the lapse of more than a third of a century , were similar in every respect except loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect marked the first , the last ranks among the most fatal railroad catastrophes on record . Yet , upon the other hand , it may well be questioned whether the first was not wholly harren of results in so far as any increased safety in travel by rail was concerned ; for , like other mortals , railroad officers are apt after some hair-breadth 1875. 575 // escape to bless their fortunate stars for the present good , rather than to take anxious heed for future dangers . The English , also , are especially prone to conservatism . In this respect there is , indeed , something almost ludicrously characteristic in the manner with which those interested in the railway management of that country strain at their gnats while they swallow their camels . They have grappled with the great question of city travel with a superb financial and encdneering audacity which has left all other communities hopelessly distanced ; but , while carrying their passengers under and over the ebb and flow of the Thames and among the chimney-pots of densest London , to leave them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been able to devise any satisfactory means for putting the traveler , in case of disaster , in communication with the en*ineer of his train . It is , indeed , a fact which would be wholly curious were it not partly comical , that , after the ingenuity of all England had for a third of a century exhausted itself in vain efforts at the solution of this tremendous problem , it appeared at the Shipton-on- Cherwell investigation that the associated general managers of the leading railways " did not think that any such means of communication was at all required , or likely to be useful or successful . " So also as respects the application of the train-brake , which places the speed of each car under the direct and instantaneous control of him who is in charge of the locomotive ; for years the success of these brakes has been conceded even by the least progressive of American railroad managers , and the want of them had directly arid obviously contributed to the Shipton-on-Cherwell disaster , even if it had not wholly caused its murderous destructiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appeared that the authorities of the Great Western Railway , being eminently " practical men , " still entertained " very great doubts of the wisdom of adopting continuous brakes at all . " Such conservatism as this is open to but one description of argument , the ultima ratio of railroad logic . So long as luck averts the loss of life in railroad disasters , no occasion is seen for disturbing timehonored precautions or antiquated appliances . While , however , a disaster like that of December 24 , 1874 , may not convince , it does compel : incredulity and conservatism vanish , silenced , at least , in presence of so frightful a row of corpses as on that morning made ghastly the banks of the Cherwell . The general introduction of train-brakes upon the railways of Great Britain will date from that event . THE DEODAND . To return , however , to those earlier years during which wholesale railroad slaughters were as yet unknown . One curious illustration of this fact appeared in the quaint penalty which was , in case of disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon the corporations . It was a principle of English common law , derived from the feudal period , that anything through the instrumentality of which death occurred was forfeited to the crown as a deodand ; accordingly , down to the year 1840 , and even later , we find , in all cases where persons were killed , records of deodands levied by the coroner 's juries upon the locomotives . These appear to have been arbitrarily imposed and graduated in amount accordingly as circumstances seemed to excite in greater or less degree the sympathies or the indignation of the jury . In November , 1838 , for instance , a locomotive exploded upon the Liverpool &amp; Manchester road , killing its engineer and fireman ; and for this escapade a deodand of twenty pounds was assessed upon it by the coroner 's jury ; while upon another occasion , in 1839 , where the locomotive struck and killed a man and horse at a street crossing , the deodand was fixed at no less a sum than fourteen hundred pounds , the full value of the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be any circumstances rendering the corporation liable in civil damages . The deodand seems to have been looked upon as a species of rude penalty im // posed on the use of dangerous appliances , a sharp reminder to the corporations to look closely after their locomotives and employ*s . As , however , accidents increased in frequency , it became painfully apparent that " crowner 's quest law " was not in any appreciable degree better calculated to command the public respect in the days of Victoria than in those of Elizabeth , and the ancient usage was accordingly at last abolished . Certainly the position of railroad corporations would now be even more hazardous than it is , if , after every catastrophe resulting in death , the coroner 's jury of the vicinage enjoyed the power of arbitrarily imposing on them such additional penalty , in addition to all other liabilities , as might seem to it proper under the circumstances of the case . The period of exemption lasted eleven years , and , curiously enough , the record of great catastrophes opened on the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day which seems to have been peculiarly unfortunate in the annals of that company , seeing that it was likewise the date of the Shiptonon-Cherwell disaster . Upon that day in 1841 , a train , while moving through a thick fog at a high rate of speed , came suddenly in contact with a mass of earth which had slid from the embankment at the side on to the track . Instantly the whole rear of the train was piled up on top of the first carriage , which happened to be crowded with passengers , eight of whom were killed on the spot , while seventeen others were more or less injured . The coroner 's jury returned a verdict of accidental death , and at the same time , as if to give the corporation a forcible hint to look closer to the condition of its embankments , a deodand of one hundred pounds was levied on the locomotive and tender . TELESCOPING . The disaster in this case was due to the telescoping , as it is termed , of cars . That is , the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telescope , under the immense pressure of the instantaneous stopping of a t*ain in rapid motion . This is , upon the whole , the most frightful danger to which travel by rail is liable , and there are but two ways in which provision can be made to meet it . The occurrence of accident may be guarded against through an unsleeping and all - pervading vigilance ; or , where it must occur , an equipment may be provided so strong as to be capable of meeting and resisting it . Now , so long as trains go at great speed and depend for their safety on human precaution , it is inevitable that they will occasionally run upon some unexpected obstacle . The simple wonder is that they do this so infrequently . Were it not an accomplished fact , the security in this respect which has been attained would be deemed simply impossible . Though sometimes inevitable , the occurrence of acci ( lents of this description may , however , in the vastly larger proportion of the few instances in which they must occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a train can reduce its speed , or as the train itself , through its more perfect construction , can resist the pressure of a sudden shock . Improved brakes and stronger and heavier car construction are , the great safeguards against telescoping , and the advance made in these respects of late years on the American railroads has been little short of wonderful . This has been due to two inventions , both of which have only recently been brought into general use : the atmospheric trainbrake , and what is , from the name of its inventor , known as the Miller platform and buffer . By the first the velocity of the whole train in its every part is placed directly and immediately under the control of its en*ineer ; and by the last the cars of a train are practically converted into one continuous body , in which there are no separate or loosely connected parts to be crushed into each other , or piled on top of ach other . had the train upon the Great Western Railway at Shipton-on-Cherwell , in 1874 , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of that catastrophe would 18Th. 577 // certainly have been averted , and it would have been passed over unnoticed as a simple , ordinary ease of derailment . Had the cars of which that train was composed , or those of the other train on the same road just thirty-three years before , been built with the Miller platform and buffer , their strength , converting them into substances too hard to be crushed , would in both cases have resisted the shock caused by the sudden stopping of the locomotives . THE FOXBOROUGH ACCIDENT . A very apt illustration of what might have been the result in these cases was furnished in an accident , not dissimilar to that at Shipton-on-Cherwell in character , which happened in Massachusetts on the Boston &amp; Providence Railroad upon July 1* , 1872 . As an express train was running up to Boston about noon of that day , and at a rate of spCC ( l of some forty miles an hour , it came in contact with a horse and wagon at a grade crossing in the town of Foxborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipped with both the Miller platform and the Westinghouse train-brake . There was no time in which to check the speed , and it thus became a simple question of strength of construction , to be tested in an unavoi ( lable collision . The engine struck the wagon , and instantly destroyed it . The horse had already cleared the rails when the wagon was struck , but , a portion of his harness etting caught on the locomotive , he was thrown down and dragged a short distance until his body caine in contact with the platform of a station close to the spot of collision . The body was then forced under the cars , having been almost instantaneously rolled and pounded up into a hard , unyieldiug mass . The results which ensued were certainly very singular . Next to the locomotive was an ordinary baggage and mail car , and it was under this car , and between its forward and its hind truck , that the body of the horse was forced ; coming then directly in contact with the truck of the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus let the rear end of the car drop upon the track . In falling , this end snapped the coupling by its weight , and so disconnected the train , the locomotive going off towards Boston dragging this single car , with one end of it bumping along the track . Meanwhile the succeeding car of the train had swept over the body of the horse and the disconnected truck , which were thus brought in contact with its own wheels , which in their turn were also torn off ; and so great was the impetus that in this way all of the four passen*er cars which composed that part of the train were successively driven clean off their rolling gear , and not only did they then slide off the track , but they crossed a railroad siding which happened to be at that point , went down an embankment some three or four feet in height , demolished a fence , passed into an adjoining field , and then at last , after glancing from the stump of a large oak - tree , they finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at which they had left the track . There was not in this case even an approach to telescoping ; on the contrary , each car rested perfectly firmly in its place as regarded all the others , not a person was injured , and when the wheelless train at last became stationary the astonished passengers got up and hurried through the doors , the very glass in which as well as that in the windows was unbroken . Here was an indisputable victory of skill and science over accident , showing most vividly to what an infinitesimal extreme the dangers incident to telescoping may be reduced . THE DIFFERENCE . 1854 AND 1874 . The vast progress in this direction made within twenty years was a am even more forcibly illustrated by the results of two accidents almost precisely similar in character , which occurred , the one on the Great Western Railroad . of Canada , in October , 1854 , the other on the Boston &amp; Albany , in Massachusetts , in October , 1874 . In the first case a regular train made up of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // ing Detroit at a speed of some twenty miles an hour , ran into a gravel train of fifteen cars which was backing towards it at a speed of some ten miles an hour . The locomotive of the passenger train was thrown completely off the track and down the embankment , dragging after it a baggage car . At the head of the * ) assenger portion of the train were two econd-class cars filled with emigrants ; both of these were telescoped and demolished , and all their unfortunate occupants either killed or injured . The front of the succeeding first - class car was then crushed in , an ( l a number of those in it were hurt . In all , no less than forty-seven persons lost their lives , while sixty others were maimed or severely bruised . So much for a collision in October , 1854 . In October , 1874 , on the Boston &amp; Albany road , the regular New York express train , consisting of a locomotive and seven cars , while going during the night at a speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brimfield station , thrown by a misplaced switch into a siding upon which a number of platform freight cars were standing . The train was thoroughly equipped , having both Miller platform and Westinghouse brake . The six secon ( ls which intervened , in the darkness , between notice of displacement and the collision , did not ehable the engineer to check perceptibly the speed of his train , and when the blow came it was a simple question of strength to resist . The shock must have been tremendous , for the locomotive and . tender were flung off the track to the right and the bag* age car to the left , the last being thrown across the interval between the siding and the main track and resting obliquely over the latter . The forward end of the first passenger car was thrown beyond the ba&amp; gage car up over the tender , and its rear end , as well as the forward end of the succeeding car , was injured . As in the Foxborough case , several of the trucks were jerked out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person on the train was more than slightly bruised , the cars were not disconnected , nor was there a sug* estion even of telescoping . Such contrasts are their own best comment . THE VERSAILLES ACCIDENT IN 1842 . Going back once more to the early days , a third of a century since , before yet the periodical recurrence of slaughters had caused either train - brake or Miller platform to be imagined as possibilities , before , indeed , there was yet any record of what we would now consider a regular railroad field-day , with its long train of accompanying horrors , includin* in the grisly array death by crushing , scalding , drowning , burning , and impalement , - going back to the year 1840 , or thereabouts , we find that the railroad companies experienced a notable illustration of the truth of the ancient adage that it never rains but it pours ; for it was then that the long immunity was rudely broken in upon . After that time disasters on the rail seemed to tread upon one another 's heels in quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English catastrophe of December 24 , 1841 , there happened in France one of the most famous and most horrible railroad slaughters ever recorded . It took place on the 8th of May , 1842 . It was the birthday of the king , Louis Philippe , and , in accordance with the usual practice , the occasion had been celebrated at Versailles by a great display of the fountains . At half past five o'clock these had stopped playing , and a general rush ensued for the trains then about to leave for Paris . That which went by the road along the left bank of the Seine was densely crowded , and was so long that it required two locomotives to draw it . As it was m*vin* at a high rate of speed between Bellevue and Meudon , the axle of the foremost of these two locomotives broke , letting the body of the engine drop to the ground . lt instantly stopped , and the second locomotive was then driven by its impetus on top of the first , crushing its engineer and fireman , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadway and among the debris . Three carriages crowded with passengers were then piled on top of this burning mass , 1875. 579 // and there crushed together into each other . The doors of the train were all locked , as was then and indeed is still the custom in Europe , and it so chanced that the carriages had all been newly painted . They blazed up like pine kindlings . Some of the carriages were so shattered that a portion of those in them were enabled to extricate themselves , but no less than forty were held fast ; and of these such as were not so fortunate as to be crushed to death in the first shock perished hopelessly in the flames before the eyes of a throng of impotent lookers-on . Some fifty-two or fifty-three persons were supposed to have lost their lives in this disaster , and more than forty others were injured ; the exact number of the killed , however , could never be ascertained , as the telescoping of the cars on top of the two locomotives had made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hideous description . Not only did whole families perish together , - in one case no less than eleven members of the same family sharing a common fate , - but the remains of such as were destroyed could neither be identified nor separated . In one case a female foot was alone recognizable , while in others the bodies were calcined and fused into an indistinguishable mass . The Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to inquire whether Admiral iD'Urville , a distinguished French navigator , was among the victims . His body was thought to be found , but it was so terribly mutilated that it could be recognized only by a sculptor , who chanced some time before to have taken a phrenological cast of his skull . lli* wife and only son had perished with him . It is not easy now to conceive the excitement an ( l dismay which this catastrophe caused throughout France . The new invention was at once associated in the minds of an excitable people with novel forms of imminent death . France had at best been laggard enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed for a time as if the Versailles disaster was to operate as a barrier in the way of all further railroad develop-November , ment . Persons availed themselves of the steam roads already constructed as rarely as possible , and then in fear and trembling , while steps were taken to substitute horse for steam power on otlier roads then in process of constrnction . The disaster was , indeed , one well calculated to make a deep impression on the popular mind , for it lacked almost no attribute of the dramatic and terrible . There were circumstances connect0 ( 1 with it , too , which gave it a sort of moral significance , - contrasting so suddenly the joyous return from the country fete in the pleasant afternoon of May , with what De Quincey has called the terror of sudden death . It contained a whole homily on the familiar text . As respects the number of those killed and injured , also , the Versailles accimlent has not often been surpassed ; perhaps never in Europe . In this country it was suri ) assed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar to it . This was the accident at Camphill station , about twelve miles from Philadelphia , on the 17th of July , 1856 , which befell an excnrsion train carrying some eleven hundred children , who had gone out on a Sunday - school picnic in charge of their teachers and friends . THE CAMPILILL ACCIDENT . It was the usual story . The road had but a single track , and the train , both long and heavy , had been delayed and was running behind its schedule time . The conductor thought , however , that the next station could yet 1 ) 0 reached in time to meet and there pass a regular train coming towards him . It may have been a miscalculation of seconds , it may have been a difference of watches , or perhaps the regular train was slightly before its time ; but , however it happened , as the excursion train , while running at speed , was rounding a reverse curve , it came full upon the regular train , which had just left the station . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were but egg - shells , and the shock was terrific . The booOf Some Railroad Accidents . // motives struck each other , and , after rearm , themselves up for an instant , it is said , like livin , animals , fell to the ground , mere masses of rubbish . In any case the force of the shock was sufficient to hurl both engines from the track and lay them side by side at right angles and some distance from it . As only the excursion train happened to be running at speed , it alone had all the impetus necessary for telescoping ; three of its cars accordingly closed in upon each other , and the children in them were crushed ; as in the Versailles accident , two succeeding cars were driven on to this mass , and then fire was set to the whole from the ruins of the locomotives . It would be hard to imagine anything more thorughly heart-rending , for the holocaust was of little children on a party of pleasure . Five cars iu all were burned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred . Of this disaster nothing could be said either in excuse or in extenuation ; it was not only one of the worst description , but it was one of that description the occurrence of which is most frequent . An excursion train , while running against time on a single-track road , came in collision with a regular train . The record is full of similar disasters , closing with that at Far Rockaway on the South Side Railroad of Long Island , upon the 5th of July , 1875 , with its ten killed and thirty injured . Primarily , of course , the conductors of the excursion trains were at fault in all these cases ; nor should it be forgotten that the unfortunate man who had charge of the Camphill train destroyed himself the next day by swallowing arsenic . But in reality , in these and in all similar cases , - both those which have happened and those hereafter surely destined to happen , - the final responsibility does not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate ; nor should the weight of punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this late day no board of directors , nor president , nor superintendent has any right to operate a single-track road without the constant use of the telegraph ; and , if they persist in so doing , it should be under a constant and well understood liability to the penalties for manslaughter . That the telegraph can be used to block , as it is termed , double-track roads , by dividing them into sections , upon no one of which two trains can be running at the same time , is matter of long and daily experience . There is nothing new or experimental about it . It is a system which has been forced on the more crowded lines of the world as an alternative to perennial killings . That in the year 1875 , excursion trains should rush along single-track roads and hurl themselves against regular trains is sufficiently incredible ; but that such roads should be operated without the constant aid of the telegraph as a means of blockin* their tracks for every irregular train indicates a degree of wanton carelessness , or an excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal law . COLLISIONS CAUSED BY THE TELEGRAPH . And yet , even with the wires in active use , collisions like those at Far Rockaway and at Camphill will occasionally take place . They have sometimes , indeed , even been caused by the telegraph , so that railroad officials at two adjoining stations on the same moad , having launched trains at each other beyond recall , have busied themselves while waiting for tidings of the inevitable collision in summoning medical assistance for those sure soon to be injured . In such cases , however , the mishap can almost invariably be traced to some ( lefect in the system under which the telegraph is used ; such as a neglect to exact return messages to insure accuracy , or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates the work which can be properly performed only by a principal . This was sin*ularly illustrated in a terrible collision which took place at Thorpe , between Norwich and Great Yarmouth , on the Great Eastern Railway in England , on the 10th of September , 1874 . The line had in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Norwich , under the rule , 1875. 581 // had to wait at a station called Brundell until the arrival there of the evening express from Yarmouth , or until it received permission by the telegraph to proceed . On the evening of the disaster the express train was somewhat behind its time , and the inspector wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come forward without waiting for it . This dispatch he left in the telegraph office unsigned , while he went to attend to other matters . Just then the express train came along , and he at once allowed it to proceed . Hardly was it under way when the unsigned dispatch occurred to him , and the unfortunate man dashed to the telegraph office only to learn that the operator had forwarded it . Under the rules of the company no return message was required . A second dispatch was instantly sent to Brundell to stop the mail ; the reply caine back that the mail was gone . A collision was inevitable . The two trains were of very equal weight , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were both drawn by powerful locomotives , the drivers of which had reason for putting on an incieased speed , believing , as each had cause to believe , that the other was waiting for him . The night was intensely dark and it was raining heavily , so that , even if the brakes were applied , the wheels would slide along the slippery track . Under these circumstances the two trains rushed upon each other round a slight curve which sufficed to obscure their headlights . The combined momentum must have amounted to little less than sixty miles an hour , and the shock was heard through all the neighboring village . The funnel of the locomotive drawing the November , mail train was sw*pt away , and the other locomotive seemed to rush on top of it , while the carriages of both trains followed until a mound of locomotives and shattered cars was formed which the descending torrents alone hindered from becoming a funeral pyre . So sudden was the collision that tbe driver of one of the engines did not apparently have an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced from the track and disabled , yet remained some time in operation in the midst of the wreck . In both trains , very fortunately , there were a number of empty cars between the locomotives and the carriages in which the passengers were seated , and they were utterly demolished ; but for this fortunate circumstance , the Thorpe collision might well have proved the most disastrous of all railroad accidents . As it was , the men on both the locomotives were instantly killed , together with seventeen passengers , and four other passen*ers subsequently died of their injuries ; making a total of twenty-five deaths , besides fifty cases of injury . No more violent collision than this at Thorpe probably ever took place ; and yet , as curiously illustrating how rapidly the most severe shock expends its force , it is said that two gentlemen in the last carriage of one of the trains , findino themselves suddenly stopped close to their destination , supposed it was for some unimportant cause , and concluded at once to take advantage of such a happy chance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , and learned only the next morning of the catastrophe in which they had been unconscious participants .
