txt There is a bill now under consideration by the Legislature of New-Jersey which , after careful amendment , should be passed in spite of any opposition that may be developed against . t . It provides for the establishment of two district civil courts at Newark for the trial of civil suits . and . for the appointment , by the State Supreme Court , of two judges to preside in the same , each to have a salary of $3,000 per year ; that the judges shall hold office for three years ; that they shall be counselors-at-law and practitioners at the New-Jersey Bar when appointed , but that they shall not continue to do business as such during their terms of office ; that each court shall have a clerk , to be paid a salary of $1,000 , and a commission of five per cent . on all fees and . costs not going above the sum of $400 in any one case . There is certainly no city in NewJersey where a law of this kind is more needed . For several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justices of the peace , most of whom have had . a desire to put money in their own pockets at the expense of the litigants . The opportunities for exacting exorbitant fees were used by them in such a scandalous manner , that it was found . necessary to indict one of the number and . to bring him to trial . Each justice seemed to have the power to dojust as he pleased , and having received his appointment through political influence , he easily satisfied his own conscience that it was his duty to make all he could out of the of6 ce so long as he had . the power to do so . To get rid of this system permanently , the bill Neferred to has been prepared by certain legal reformers at Newark . The provision for the appointment of the judges is a good one , and is calculated to work well ; but we can not say as much for the provision which gives to the clerks a percentage on fines and costs of court , for the reason that it would leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrust clerks into positions where they would be constantly tempted to do wrong . It is much better to pay a fixed . salary , say of $2,000 , . and . let the fines be sent ? without deductions for any purpose whatever , to the city controller or public treasurer . If the justices of the peace had been paid regular salaries , and compelled to turn over all fees to the proper receiver , the temptation to do wrong would not have existed to the same extent , and these officials might have escaped the reproach which has been cast upon them . Considering the record of Justice Warm . of Hoboken , and the records of other justices of the peace in various parts of the State , it would be desirable to have the district civil court plan generally adopted . Most of those who are brought into contact with the men now holding commissions are persons of limited education . The system of exorbitant fees has educated them into the belief that " justice " is a merchantable commodity , and . that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out ahead . " The demoralizing effect of such an opinion on small communities is very great ? so great , indeed , that it will not be a very easy matter to check it . Considering this fact , the importance of the Newark bill can not be too highly estimated .
