Stoddard , Richard Henry , 1825-1903 : RIFLE AND BOW . from Rifle and bow ( 1878 ) The red man , whom our hardy sires Found in possession of the land ; Who built in woods his wigwam fires , And smoked his pipe ; or , bow in hand , Crept on the wild deer , or the bear  --  Or tracked the panther to his lair : Who , grim , and hard of heart at best , Daubed in his war-paint , stole away , With twenty devils in his breast , To where his hated foeman lay , Whom , if asleep he could not find , And his strong arms in pinions bind , To burn him at the dreadful stake , He would devote to sudden death ; As suddenly his scalp would take , And mock the rattle in his breath : Then , if pappoose and squaw he saw , Would massacre pappoose and squaw ! These bronzed barbarians of the Past , Cast in the moulds of hell , are gone ; Their world was wanted , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ay  --  and if future need should be , We 'll drown them in the western sea ! With iron nets we hold their trail ; They find us wheresoe'er they go ; Though fierce , they can not make us quail , Nor match the rifle with the bow . We 'll give them graves , and let them try The happy hunting grounds on high !
