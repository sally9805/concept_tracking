txt The great question that now agitates the minds of the discontented politicians of the country , both in and out of the Republican Party , who are trying to hatch a programme for the next Presidential campaign is ? " How to beat GnArrr ? " This appears to be the beginning and end of all their aims , the object of all their plots and counterplots , of all their combinations and caucuses . In order to accomplish it , we find the odds and ends of all political parties , cliques , and factions ? " old line " Democrats , and " progressive " Democrats , ex-rebels who have " accepted the situation , " and unrepentant rebels who refuse to accept it , sore-headed Republicans antkdit appointed office-seekers -- all putting their heads together , and devising plans by which they may present themselves to the country as one united opposition phalanx in the next campaign . Every week or two we have some new scheme proposed for bringing about a perfect union among these heterogeneous elements . A few months ago it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democracy , but a close examination of this scheme developed the fact that the " new departure " led directly into the Republican camp . We were next offered what is called the " passive policy , " whereby the Democratic Party was to " play possum " ? that is to say , it was to lie down quietly and pretend to be dead until after election , and then , in case of success , to jump up and crow over the result as a Democratic victory , and demand the lion 's share of the spoils . This plan , we understand , is still under consideration , and has recently met the approval of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS , who is beyond doubt the most sagacious man at present in the ranks of the Democrats . But a writer in yesterday 's World propounds still another scheme for " beating GRANT , " which he calls the " active policy . " The leading points of his scheme are , that there shall be no nominating Convention and no platform of principles ; but that the Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular man in their respective localities , leaving the Presidential electors of each State at liberty to cast their votes for either of the candidates , as they shall see fit , after the election . Although he would dispense with anything in the shape of a platform , yet he says it should be " tacitly understood " that in the event of GRANT 'S defeat , every man in the country now holding office should be removed to make way for the victors . This , he thinks , would enlist the active sympathy and support of all the " outs , " and would make success all but certain . As between the " new departure , " the " passive policy " and the " active policy . " we are inclined to favor the latter , The thing most to be dreaded is a dull Presidential campaign ; and , unless HORACE GREELEY should be the candidate in opposition to Gen. GRANT , of which we have little hope since the Sun has hauled down his name , something in the shape of an " active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , seriously , did . it never occur to these busy-bodies , who are racking their brains to solve the question " how to beat GRANT , " that they are affording the best proof in the world that GRANT ought not to be beaten Who ever heard before of a party , or a combination of parties . organizing for a Presidential campaign on the single issue of how they can best accomplish the defeat of a man whom their own acts show to be the choice of the people I If there were really any solid grounds of opposition to Gen. GRANT 'S Administration . founded on principle , there would be no necessity for all this scheming and plotting and wire-pulling to prevent his re-election . There would be no necessity for drumming up all the discordant elements and antagonistic factions in the political field , to form a respectable opposition . Even the Democratic Party , odious as it is , would be able to make an effective fight against Gen. GRANT if it had any ground to stand on , or any principles to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , as it now proposes to do . Every manoeuvre made by the opponents of Gen. GRANT thus far , affords the best proof in the world that no change in the administration of the General Government is needed by the country , or is desired by the great mass of the people .
