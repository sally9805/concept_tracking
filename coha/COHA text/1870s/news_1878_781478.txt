txt Most readers of standard fiction are familiar with FRANKENSTEIN 'S attempt to create a man ; and will doubtless be of opinion that he made a sad . bungle of his self-imposed task . But , hard as it may be to form an individual , it is tenfold more difficult to form a nation ; and this is really what the Berlin Congress has undertaken to do , and what it is now employed . in doing . The untoward reality may be disguised-under various wellsounding names , such as " reorganization , " " rectification of frontier , " " settlement of the Bulgarian question , " and the like ; but the fact remains unaltered . After the lapse of seven centuries , the corpse of Bulgarian nationality is to rise from its grave and take its place among independent States , under an acknowledged sovereign . Ours is an emancipatingage , and thelast eighteen years have witnessed three distinct experiments of the possibility of changing a community of slaves into self-supporting freemen at one stroke . In 1861 the subject-matter was the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1878 , it is the Bulgarian peasant , From one point of view , undoubtedly , Russia 's triumph may well seem to be complete . When she first began her progress southward , four great lines of defense barred her advance upon Turkey . The first was the boundless steppes of the Ukraine , which were given into her hands by the Cossack rebellion of 1647 . The second was the Pruth , which broke the assault of PETER the Great in 1712 , but fell before CATHARINE II . eighty years later . The third was the Danube , which , having foiled NICHOLAS in 1853 , has now been finally conquered by his son . The fourth is the Balkan , which , rescued . with difficulty from Gen. IGNATIEFF 'S audacious coup de main at San Stefano , alone stands between the Czar and his prize . These are great achievements ; but in this case , as in many others , the remedy threatened to prove worse than the disease . " I 'll put a bullet into him at twelve paces , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival , " and if it do n't kill him , I 'll extract it , and do for him that way . " In getting rid of the Turk , Russia has saddled herself with the Bulgarian , and not with the Bulgarian only , but also with the Servian , the Montenegrin , the Roumanian , and , in a word , all the " poor relations " of the Slavonian family . In fact , her present position is very much that of a last century doctor , who , in dissecting the body of an executed criminal , restored the suspended . animation of the supposed . defunct , who at once fastened himself upon him as a pensioner . " You 've got to feed me , you know , " said he , " ' cause it 's your fault as I 'm alive to want feeding . " But in order to appreciate the difficulties which must attend the task of Bulgarian reconstruction it is worth while to glance at the general character of the State thus suddenly launched into being . Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile country , somewhat sandy toward the Black Sea , somewhat flat and marshy along the Danube , but for the most part consisting of undulating ridges , which grow higher and more thickly wooded . as they approach the Balkan . This tract contains a population of herdsmen and agriculturists numbering about four millions , strong , patient , hardy , slow of speech , and heavy of aspect , with much of the gross superstition as well as the dogged endurance of their Russian brethren , and . even more than the Russian 's sullen ferocity lurking beneath their sluggish exterior . Only two short railways and a few ill-kept roads , almost impassable at certain seasons , traverse this primitive region , whose literature consists of a few national ballads and works of theology , and whose education  --  what little there is of it  --  depends almost entirely upon the village schools . Such is Bulgaria ; and the majority of critics appear to think its reconstruction a mere matter of shaping a certain regime , and . then driving the " reconstructed . " nation headlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - But this view of the case is a little too summary . To legislate for civilized . races , which can understand and . appreciate such legislation , is feasible enough . To legislate for savages is also feasible , after the simple practical method of the Western frontiersman , " Scalp ' em first , and talk to ' em after . " But when the two are indissolubly mingled , as in the ' present case , the task of legislation becomes somewhat intricate . With all the rudeness of barbarism ) ? the Bulgarian has likewise all the pride and esprit de corps of civilization. , This gaunt , sallow , ill-dressed man , who lives in a hollow that any Western tramp would despise , has a historic past equal to that of the proudest nations of EnpAnaanaatioriesa% it . ilk.g , , Quenianii has aptly shown , as onthusiastically as they . Centuries before the discovery of America , while England was still a hunting-ground for Northern pirates , and Germany a battlefield of half-clad savages , the " Bolgar Chagan " was holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lording it from the spurs of the Balkans , to the forests of Transylvania . So strong is this innate pride of race , that four centuries of bondage under the worst form of tyranny have left it as deeply rooted as ever . To this day the Bulgarian looks down upon the Greek as the Norman looked down upon the Saxon , or the Spartan upon the Helot . In 1870 , when . the news of Sedan reached . a little Bulgarian village in the Pravadi Valley , a ragged . fellow in the crowd exclaimed . admiringly , " What brave fellows those Germans are v .. they must have Bulgarian blood in them . " Nor is this strange race wanting in imagination , though of a grim and ghastly sort . It might test the strongest , nerves to see a gaunt , wildeyed peasant point through the fast-falling shadows of night to a lonely burial-ground on the distant meuntains , and tell you in a fearful whisper that " if you go there about midnight at the full moon , and lay your ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning and gnashing in their graves , far down below , like restless beasts of prey . " Such , then , is the subject-matter of the world 's new attempt at emancipation , This newly-enfranchised bondman , with all his barbaric virtues and vices , his quaint Old World superstitions , his latent fierceness and stubborn tenacity , his unreasoning dread of everything new , and intense attachment to his own usages , is to be compressed into the mold of a European citizen of the nineteenth century , and that , too , under a foreign ruler . Nor is it the least puzzling question of this extraordinary problem , who that ruler is to be . The Czarina 's nephew , Prince BA.TTENBERG , the first candidate suggested , has publicly repudiated any idea of the kind , and the throne of Bulgaria seems likely to find . as few claimants as that of Greece fifteen years ago , now that a coronation has come to imply the putting up of another Sing as a convenient mark for the target-practice of any socialist sharp-shooters who may happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
