Harte , Bret , 1836-1902 : A WHITE-PINE BALLAD . from East and West : poems ( 1871 ) Poem section Recently with Samuel Johnson this occasion I improved , Whereby certain gents of affluence I hear were greatly moved ; But not all of Johnson 's folly , although multiplied by nine , Could compare with Milton Perkins , late an owner in White Pine . Johnson 's folly  --  to be candid  --  was a wild desire to treat Every able male white citizen he met upon the street ; And there being several thousand  --  but this subject why pursue ? ' T is with Perkins , and not Johnson , that to-day we have to do . No : not wild promiscuous treating , not the wine-cup 's ruby flow , But the female of his species brought the noble Perkins low . ' T was a wild poetic fervor , and excess of sentiment , That left the noble Perkins in a week without a cent . " Milton Perkins , " said the Siren , " not thy wealth do I admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opal fire ; And methinks the name thou bearest surely can not be misplaced , And , embrace me , Mister Perkins ! " Milton Perkins her embraced . But I grieve to state , that even then , as she was wiping dry The tear of sensibility in Milton Perkins ' eye , She prigged his diamond bosom-pin , and that her wipe of lace Did seem to have of chloroform a most suspicious trace . Enough that Milton Perkins later in the night was found With his head in an ash-barrel , and his feet upon the ground ; And he murmured " Seraphina , " and he kissed his hand , and smiled On a party who went through him , like an unresisting child . MORAL . Now one word to Pogonippers , ere this subject I resign , In this tale of Milton Perkins ,  --  late an owner in White Pine ,  --  You shall see that wealth and women are deceitful , just the same ; And the tear of sensibility has salted many a claim .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
