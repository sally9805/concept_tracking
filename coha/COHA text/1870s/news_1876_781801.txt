txt The financial record of our candidate for the Presidency is a sound one . There is no repudiation of dollars or of dates in it . Twelve years ago , by one of his first votes cast in Congress , he declared that tile public debt is " sacred and inviolate , " and that any attempt " to repudiate or in any manner impair or scale " the debt should be promptly rejected . by Congress . In the years 1866 and 1867 , when a successful candidate for Congress and . for Governor , and in 1868 , when not a candidate for any office , he vigorously battled against the tide , in those years strongly setting in in favor of the captivating scheme of wiping out the war debt with an enormous greenback inflation . Gen. HAYES manfully maintained . his ground with all the Democrats in Ohio and part of the Republicans against him . Even Senator TuuuMAN , who bas since been ostracized by his party for his supposed . hard-money views , in a speech delivered at Marietta in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the five-twenties ' in greenbacks . In the canvass of 1869 Gov . HAYES fought and . vanquished . PENDLETON , the author of the greenback heresy , on the square issue of greenback expansion . In 1872 , in his Glendale speech of Sept. 4 , he said : " In the.present cendition of the country two things are of vital importance- peace and a sound financial policy . We want peace , honorable peace . with all nations , peace with the Indians , and peace between all of the citizens of all the Stated . We want a financial policy so honest that there can be no stain upon the national honor and no taint on the national credit ; so stable that labor and capital ana legitimate businh9s of every sort can confidently count upon what it will be the next week , the next month , and the next year . " Then again emerging from private life after a third . nomination for Governor had . been forced upon him , he reiterated his old faith , and with singular exactness sets forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marion , Ohio , July 31 , 1875 : " An irredeemable and inflated paper currency promotes speculation and extravagance , and at the same time discourages legitimate business , honest labor , anti economy . It dries up the true sources of individual and public prosperity , Overtratling and fast living always go with it . It stimulates the desire to incur debt ; it cantos high rates of interest ; it increases importations from abroad ; it has no fixed value ; it is liable to frequent and great fluctuations , thereby rendering every pecuniary engagement precarious , and disturbing all existing contracts and expectations ; it is the parent of pan . res . Every period of inflation is followed by a loss of confidence , a shrinkage of values ; depression of business , panics , lack of employment , and wide . spread disaster and distress . " In the same speech , with a clear comprehension of what ox-Secretary Bounvimr , and others seemed . confused about , he says : " The more promises to pay an Individual issues , without redeeming them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nations . The legal . tender note for five dollars is the promise of the United States to pay that sem in the money of the world  --  in coin . No time is fixed for its payment . his therefore payable on presentation  --  on demand . " The history of the great currency campaign of 1875 , is well known . In it Gov . HAYES was raised from a State leader to a national man . He had . to struggle against adverse majorities and demagoguery in its most dangerous forms . The Democracy had carried the State by 24,000 majority on their Congressional ticket the year before . His competitor was a popular many then holding possession of power . The aggressive inflation party fully expected to elect WILLIAM ALLEN Governor of Ohio by a prodigious majority and . then nominate and elect him President of the United States . That they were . paving the way with their inflation lunacy to elect his Republican competitor to both offices , never entered . their inflated . calculations . HAYES had . to encounter and cure this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress begged him to tone down , for the sake of success , his hardmoney views . His answer can be found . in his Marion speech , from which we have quoted , and in the Garfield . letter , written on the 4th of the following March . In that already-published. letter are as bold and as courageous expressions as any public man ever used. : " My opinion is decidedly against yielding a hair 's breadth . * * ' No stens backward ' must no something more than unmeaning platform words . * * * We are in a condition such that firmness and adherence to principle are of peculiar value just now . * * * To yield or to compromise is weakness , and will destroy us . " After what we have quoted , Gov . HAYES could . well say in his letter of acceptance : " On the currency question I have frequently expressed . my views in public , and I standby my record . on this subject . " What follows is familiar to every man who has been honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who has kept them . For more than ten years the ' financial faith of the Republican candidate has been known to the world . He believes that duty and interest alike require the earliest resdmption of specie payments . He is opposed . to repealing the present Resumption act , or unsettling the date , which is the vital point ? unless a better act is substituted . in its place . The only paper or leather dollar he believes in is one that is at all times instantly convertible into coin . The only promise to pay that can be safely used . as a measure of values , he thinks , is one that , at all hours , has a coin dollar behind it with which to redeem it . For the Government to promise every day to pay three hundred and . sixty millions of greenback dollars , and . refuse every day to pay a dollar , he believes is neither sound business nor sound . morality . To postpone indefinitely the period or date of payment or solvency , is to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolvent debtor . A private debtor who has the ability to pay his overdue debts , and . refuses to pay them , or to take any steps or to fix any date or time when ho will pay them , would be looked upon as lacking common honesty . And this is the precise way in which Mr. TILDEN and . his friends would . have the Government of the United States regarded .
