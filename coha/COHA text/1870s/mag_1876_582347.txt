LE COUREUR DES BOIS . " OUT of the beaver trade rose a huge evil , baneful to the growth and the morals of Canada . All that was most active and vigorous in the colony took to the woods , and escaped from the control of intendants , councils , and priests , to the savage freedom of the wilderness . Not only were the possible profits great , hut in the pursuit of them there was a fascinating element of danger and adventure . The bush-rangers or coureurs des bois were to the King an object of terrer . They defeated his plans for the increase of the population , and shocked his native instincts of discipline and order . Edict after e*lict was directed against them , and more than once the colony presented the extraordinary spectacle of the greater part of its young men turned into forest outlaws. " - Parkman 's " Old Regime in Canada . " CHAPTER I. IT was a cottage of the better class , but that is not saying that it was either elegant or very comfortable , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was still New France . The cottage was , however , a picture in its way , both without and within . Over the thick stone walls clambered a hardy vine , which was willing to be beautiful and thrive through the brief summer , and not become utterly discouraged during the six months its roots were covered with snow . It had pulled itself up to the roof , holding on to the rough stones ; though that was no great feat , for the children who lived in the cottage often did the same , and had even coaxed a gaudy scarlet bean up too , and together they waved in the summer wind and basked in the summer sun . Within there was a cheery homeliness , which obscured bare walls and scanty furniture . It was so late in the afternoon , that the slanting rays of the sun fell in through the door across the newly scoured floor , drying the white planks before a speck of dust found an abiding place there , and leaving the grain of the wood sharply defined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , and baby boy . The first was a woman of perhaps forty , whose face , though filled with lines drawn by care , hard work , and a bleak climate , still retained much of the beauty of her youth . Her dark eyes , clear and untroubled now , rested fondly upon the baby she rocked in her arms and softly sung to . He was not really a baby , or would not have been if another had come to take his place ; still , as he was the youngest , he had for two years reigned over the family absolutely . Even now , as his tired mother hoped to see the long lashes sink in sleep upon his rosy cheeks , the white lids slowly lifted from the merry brown eyes , and he looked saucily at her . She stooped over him , kissed his pretty mouth , then putting him down , said to her daughter : " He will not sleep , Marie , and I will not give any more time to the rogue . Take him with thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou canst weary him for once . " Marie looked at her mother with a dismayed face , and said protestingly : " But , maman , he wearies me the most ; he makes me carry him , and stoop with him that he may pick every marguerite he sees , and when I set him down he runs so close to the cows ' legs . " " Well , well , Marie , do as thou wilt , " answered her mother , with an easy indulgence , strange in those days when parents spoke to be obeyed . But between her and this only daughter was an affection almost like that existing between sisters . There had been five years of lonely married life before Marie was born , when the silent , hard-working husband had neither time nor thought to banish the gloom and homesickness of his young wife , who could not forget old France and the happy home she had left there . For she was one of the many peasant girls who had come out to Canada in obedience to the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their new home . And when the baby girl was born , the mother 's heart beat with a happiness it had not known at sight of the two boys who had come before . From the day the little hands had first offered themselves to assist with an irksome task , the mother looked upon her daughter not only as a help , but as a friend and companion . Marie had hurried through with her childhood , instinctively recognizing the want and need of her mother 's heart , and had long shared the cares of the house and the crowd of noisy boys . Happiness and contentment came more fully each year to the cottagers . They prospered , and their farm this afternoon was smiling to the river 's edge with swiftl* ripening grain // Marie took up her cap and looked toward the door , then , turning , she said : " I will take him , maman . " But her mother answered : " No , Marie ; thou art always a good , willing girl ; go alone . The walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly ; thy father and brothers will soon be in and hungry for their supper . " " Maman , " cried Marie , dropping upon her knees beside her mother and hiding her face upon her bosom , " do not call me good . The word fills me with shame . I am not so good a daughter as you deserve . " " Ah , little one , thou hast been a comfort to me all thy life , " said the mother caressingly . " Thou art a good modest girl . Now go . See ! little Jacques is wondering at thy tears , and so is thy mother . " Marie still knelt . " I have been thinking all day of my sins-of how often I have pained you and given you trouble . Maman , can you forgive it all , and believe that I sometimes sin because I do not know which of two things it is right to do ? And will you love me always , even if I should sometimes be far away from you ? " " Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing her , and thinking that her grief meant no more than that which had prompted a hundred similar confessions . " My sweet maman , " said the girl , as she arose . Patting the baby 's waving hair and kissing his warm cheek , she started across the fields toward the forest , a corner of which she must cross to reach the pasture . As she entered the dense shade , she began to look anxiously around , and as soon as she became accustomed to the dusk , she saw coming toward her , under the trees , a young man . She ran hastily to him , as if fearing that that which she had to say would be left unsaid , unless she spoke at once . " I can not go with thee , Antoine , I only came to say adieu . Oh , forgive me for disappointing thee , but I can not go . " " Can not go ! " he exclaimed , stepping back and looking at her angrily . " Thou art jesting with me , Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , I am not jesting , Antoine , dear Antoine . Forgive me , and try still to love me a little . I will always be true to thee , and never love , never marry , another , but I can not go with thee , " she said , laying her hand upon his arm . He shook it off impatiently . " Marie , I have risked my life  --  or my liberty , and that is more than life to me-to come here . I have waited day after day for thee to decide which thou didst love best , thy mother or me , and now , after keeping me here until thy vanity is sufhciently flattered , thou sendest me awaythou stayest behind to laugh at me-to " Oh , Antoine , how canst thou speak so cruelly ? Let me go back to my mother . Forget the forest and its wild life . Come back to us . Come back to the church and proper ways , and soon the dislike of my parents will vanish ; they will give their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to be treated like a forgiven outlaw . Come with me if thou wouldst save my soul . With thee-in another place-I will try to live as thou wishest . But if thou forsakest me now , I will go my own way ; I will live the life I prefer , " and Marie 's lover stood darkly regarding her . Standing together , they formed a picture , Rembrandtesque in its lights and shades . The girl , in the simple dress of her class , with the sunshine of the meadows seeming still to rest in the waves of her bright hair , and a broad expanse of golden light reaching into the forest after her . Facing her the hunter stood , picturesque at any time in his half-civilized , half-savage dress , but doubly so now , the centering point of the deep shadows . He , his dress and his manner harmonized with the forest ; his strong right arm was thrown impatiently up to keep back a green branch which would have swept against his handsome face , while his left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the little hard hands she held out to him . There was no sound except the summer wind , which was too languid to come far into the wood , and only stirred the berry bushes and tall grass which grew along its edge . His eyes never left her face , save when she turned her head to look back at the sunny meadow , the little stone cottage , whose roof she could see , and the shining river beyond . Then she turned to her lover again , and to the silent forest which stretched behind him , and her eyes drooped to the mosses and lichens which grew at his feet , while she tried to find an answer for him . But she was too unused to self-decision to find one , so she at last only looked up , and , reaching out her hands , said with a helpless sob : " Oh , Antoine ! " // He took her hands and said softly : " Come , Mane. ** " If I go with thee now , Antoine , when wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When thou hast made a good man of me , Marie , and that will not be long , I promise thee . For how could I be wicked or reckless when I have thee always with me ? Come , Marie , thy mother is good , she , does not need thee , While I-well , I have told thee often that without thee I can not and will not be good . Thy mother will perhaps weep " Oh , Antoine , I know how she will weep for me ! I know how lonely the long summer days and the dreary winter days will be for her without me , and poor baby Jacques , he will weep for me too . Oh , Antoine ! " and she clung to him as the tears overflowed her face . He pressed her bright head close to his breast , only answering for a time with his kisses . Then he said : " My own little one , I know how thou lovest thy mother , and how much she is to thee , but can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not think so badly of me as all the others do . When she learns that thou art with me , she will say , Poor Antoine , he has now some one to live for , some one to help him escape from hell . ' Marie , if I go away alone , " he continued , " I will return to men like myself , even worse , and then I will have no strength , while if thou art with me-with all thy purity and goodness-thou wilt keep evil spirits away , thou wilt in time teach me how to become good , and draw me back to proper ways . ' And then we will return and live as thy father and mother do . " " Ah , if I could know all that would come true . But , Antoine , how will my mother know what has become of me ? " " I will let her know . Not far from here at an Indian village is good Pare Geauteau , and , after he has married us , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And when shall we be married , An-tome ? " " As soon as our feet can carry us to the priest . Come , come . " " But it will soon be dark in the forest , " said the girl , drawing back . " Never fear the darkness , I know every foot of the ground between here and the great lakes . Come , my darling , and when thou art weary I will carry thee . " " And , Antoine , thou wilt love me well enough to keep all thy vows ? " " I swear by everything thou believest holy that I will , " and , holding her hand tightly , he hurried her away . The last dampness had dried from the white floor , little Jacques had laid down in a sunny spot and fallen asleep , the mother was commencing supper and wondering why Marie did not come . When the table was set , and still no Marie came , she walked anxiously to the door and looked across the meadow . The sun was sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain range , sending his last level rays across field and river . All was tranquil , warm , and fair , and yet over her heart crept such a chill as had never rested there before . She gazed steadily toward the forest , longing for the first glimpse of Marie when she would emerge with the cows . As she stood , the sun dropped behind the mountains , and the shadows deepened around the wood , and stretched out across the meadow . Where could Marie be ? She lifted the sleeping baby from the floor , and laid him on the bed , mended the fire , and then hurried out along the path which led to the pasture . It was useless to chide herself for her fears . Marie had never idled nor tarried when she had been bidden to hurry . Something must have happened . Perhaps one of the usually gentle cows had become unruly and rushed upon her , or perhaps she had sat down to rest in the forest ,  --  she was tired , poor child ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she paused and looked into its black depth for a sight of the familiar dress . She tried to lift up her voice and call , but there was such an oppression upon her that , as in a horrible dream , the sound was scarcely more than a whisper . She stood a moment irresolute , listening to the strange sounds that came to her . A bird darted past her , and made her heart leap until the blood thundered in her ears . Then she dashed forward , looking to the right and left , but breathing not a word . She had still one hope , still one fear , that when she reached the opening she would find the missing one . The way was short ; she was soon there . As she stumbled over the last fallen branch and reached the clearing , the soft lowing of the patient cows smote upon her heart with the dull , incomprehensible pain , that the unreasoning tranquillity of a dumb brute always has when every pulse is bounding and the brain is whirling with excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate and let the creatures through , then recrossed the forest . As she passed the spot where two hours before Marie and Antoine had stood , and caught sight of the river with its melancholy mists rising over it , she broke into loud sobs and cried out : " Marie , Marie , where art thou ? " But her voice only died away among the trees , and no welcome answer came . When she reached home little Jacques was still sleeping , and the father and tired boys were standing about the door , with that bewildered look which takes possession of the men of a family when they come home and find the mother gone . She rushed to them , breathless and frantic . " Marie is gone ! " was all she could say as she sank upon the step . But they soon gathered what little there was to tell . Each had his suggestion to make , which neither satisfied himself nor another , and , leaving the supper untasted and the cows unmilked , they started toward the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew dull , and from softest blue vanished into darkest purple ; banks of misty clouds settled into the valleys about their summits ; the light wind died away ; the river lay a silent roadway ; the vast forests took on a denser shade , and the whole world of nature slept as the mother watched . CHAPTER II . THE summer days dragged through their long hours at the little cottage . Every morning and every night , the mother looked toward the forest as she opened or shut the door . But the girl for whom she looked did not come . The summer ended ; the vine on the wall turned scarlet , and the gaudy bean fainted to the ground under a cruel frost , the fields were bronzed and the woods all aflame for a few glorious days , then the winter was with the cottagers . In the forest the summer had passed like a happy dream to the two wanderers . Marie 's fears that her mother would have no clue to her whereabouts , were quieted by the promise of the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would send a messenger to the cur6 of her parish , and thus clear away the mystery of her absence . And , not knowing that the message never reached her home , she , after her first hours of remorse and self-reproach , gave herself up to the happiness of wandering alone with the lover from whom she had been separated-save for a few stolen meetings-so long . And the days passed far more swiftly with them than in the saddened home . After leaving the Indian camp to which Antoine had first directed their steps , it seemed to Marie that they wandered aimlessly on . But the spell of the forest was upon her , and she did not care how long they lingered under the rustling trees , or darted in their bark canoe down flashing streams , whose rocky walls echoed the sound of the foaming rapids , and the wild forest songs of Antoine . They two , it seemed to her , were alone in an uninhabited world-a world into which they had come as from another life . So totally were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death seemed to spread between them and the home she had left . But the short summer burned itself out in the forest as well as in the fields . The rich , sweet fragrance of the dying leaves , and the melody of the busy departing birds filled the air* their happy , dreamy summer was over , and it was time to prepare for winter . There was a trading-post not far away , Antoine had said one autumn afternoon , as they sat talking of the coming winter , and to it he argued they had better go . There he could sell his furs to the traders , and there Marie would be secure from at least a part of the suffering the winter must bring her with its many hardships . But with the thought of the companions awaiting her there , came the fear that she would lose him if he once more felt the wild lawless influence that had drawn him from his early home . " Do not go , Antoine . Let us live here in this happy loneliness where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thou dost not know what the winter will be here , " he answered . " But I do know what it will be there . Oh , do not take me . I would rather freeze or starve here with thee , than have thee go with those men , " and she clung to him , weeping It was in vain that he reasoned , and at last she prevailed . Further up the stream was a hunting-lodge , comfortable for its rude build , but deserted by the trappers in consequence of a rumor that it was haunted by the spirit of a murdered Indian . To that they had better go , since Marie obstinately preferred cold , hunger , and disembodied spirits , to the company of the reckless band to which her husband had once belonged . // The hut stood a mere foot-print in the wilderness . It was belted around by a bounding stream that even the chains of winter could not fetter , and which now chanted loudly as they looked into its shady depths . In front of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of nature , which held back the slender thread of civilization which fringed its border along the great river . And here was to be their home , until Marie 's influence should bring under control the wild nature of the coureur des bois , and draw him back to ways of peace and prosperity . The hut was empty , save for a few pieces of roughly constructed furniture , which the hunters had left behind them . But , desolate as it was , it soon took on a look of homeliness under Marie 's skillful hands . Against the wall they hung Antoine 's gun and other hunting and fishing implements . A bed of fragrant pine branches was made in one corner , from the canoe Antoine brought an armful of soft furs , which he spread upon the floor , and when Marie had filled the empty fireplace with crimson and golden boughs , their home was furnished . It had not been too early chosen , for the leaves soon fell , the short , wonderful Indian summer was over , the bleak wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain combated for victory , and a six months ' winter had commenced . In the morning Antoine would go out to hunt and trap , and return at nightfall laden with game . Upon two or three occasions he had gone to the trading-post where he had exchanged his furs , and Marie saw her dress of civilization gradually replaced by the habiliments of a squaw , and her life sh4ing itself to the requirements of the present . They were far into the winter before any feet but their own had crossed their threshold . Antoine was on the eve of a visit to the traders , and had flung himself down upon a wolf-skin before the red fire which filled the little cabin with light and heat . Marie sat beside him , talking first of his journey , and then of the spring which was now but a few months away , and as ever urging her husband to return with her , as soon as the winter was over , to the old home , and turn forever from the forest . He listened with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pleasure of hearing her soft persuasive tones . The months she had been with him had wondeffully softened his nature , and made him long to live a life worthy of her love . Something of this he was about to tell her , when his purpose was arrested by the unusual sound of voices upon the clear night air . Starting up , he flung the door open wide , and saw in the bright starlight two hunters approaching over the glistening snow . The fire-light and the open door offered a welcome of which they availed themselves , without waiting for words to second it . And a few moments later they were unfastening their snow-shoes , and laying aside their guns within the bright room . As Antoine and his guests stood regarding each other , a look of recognition came into their faces , and with an exclamation of pleasure he clasped the hands of two old comrades . With a few words he accounted for Marie 's presence , and after the hunters had partaken of the supper their hostess provided for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marie listened silently , and watched her husband with troubled eyes , as , his face glowing with jAeasure and excitement , he recalled their exploits of danger and daring . And her heart grew heavy as she heard them plan their journey for the next day together to the trading-post . Next morning before day they were astir and preparing for their journey , and , as they were about to start , one of the hunt*rs said to Marie : " Do not be surprised if Antoine does not come back to thee to-night . He is too gay a cbmrade to lose , now that we have found him . We are going to take him with us , and perhaps thou'lt not see him again until spring . " " What wouldst thou do , little one , if I left thee here alone ? " asked her husband , taking her hand . " I would die , Antoine , " she answered , her eyes filling with tears . " But let me take thee to the settlement , and leave thee with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth for thee . I will go with Henri and Jules , where the furs are rich and plentiful , and by spring , Marie , thy husband will be a rich man . " " Ah , Antoine , thou dost but try me . I know thou wilt not leave me , " she said , laying her head upon his breast . " Why canst thou not consent , Marie ? " he asked , lifting her face and looking into it , while his own clouded with disappointment . For with the advent of his comrades the old passion had come back to him , almost too strong to be resisted . // " Oh , Antoine , thou dost not love me any longer , " she cried , as she interpreted the look his face wore . The impatience of disappointment and the galling sense of restraint were upon him , and he felt the jeering mood of his companions as he listened to her reproach . " Marie ! " he exclaimed angrily , " thou art a foolish child ! " " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thou art much too tender with this baby wife ; thou shouldst never have married , to be held a prisoner . What has become of thy brave spirit , which thou once didst boast could be controlled by no will but thine own ? " and he took up his gun and led the way to the door , looking back at the two as they stood together-Marie tearful , and Antoine flushed and baffled . " Antoine , do not let us part in anger , even if it is but for a day . " It irritated him that she should feel so sure of his return at night , and he replied : " How dost thou know it will be but for a day ? Thou demandest much of me . " " Do I require more of thee than thou hast required of me , Antoine ? " she asked , turning away from him . " But thou art unreasonable , Marie , " he said more softly , as he remembered her sacrifice . " Thou art childish , to weep when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou wouldst make a fool of me before my friends . " " Forgive me , Antoine , and go . I will trust thee , " she replied , brushing away her tears and throwing her arms about him . He kissed her in silence , and , catching up his load of furs , hurried after the others . " Which has conquered , Antoine , thee or thy wife ? " was the question as he joined them . " Never mind which , " he answered sharply , " and I want no more of thy ridicule , Jules . " When they reached the camp Antoine found a crowd of his old companions gathered there . They greeted him uproariously , and questioned him closely as to his long desertion of them . They listened to the story of his tyrannical wife as told by his late guests with many embellishments , and all joined their entreaties that he would bring his wife to the camp , and go with them upon a long expedition they were now planning . The temptation to yield was great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless , half-savage band , and the women who found them agreeable companVOL . XII. - 8. ions , and thought of leaving his pure , helpless Marie with them , even the fascination of the long , dangerous hunt failed . The day was almost done before he had disposed of his furs , and shaken off the last friend who followed to persuade him . And , when at last he lifted his purchases to his shoulders and slipped on his snow-shoes and turned homeward , the sun was sinking into its early bed of wintry clouds . He struck briskly out through the forest , caring not for the darkness , and breathing more freely as the last sound from the camp died away in the distance . His heart grew warmer as each step took him nearer to his wife , and he forgot the darkness and cold , as he pictured her joy when he would take her in his arms , and tell her that she had reclaimed him . At home Marie had spent a wretched day of fear and doubt . It was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had always been true to her ; she was forced to remember that he had never been so tried before . And , further , she knew that his vanity had been sorely wounded , that she had subjected him to the ridicule of his friends . Why had she not exercised more tact and shielded him from this ? Why had she , in short , shown herself to be a child , making him perhaps indeed feel her to be a burden ? She tormented herself with these self-reproaching queries throughout the day . But , when evening came , the hope that he might soon be with her , cheered her , and she brightened the fire , and tried to give the little cabin an air of welcome against the time of his return . But the dusk turned to darkness , and the darkness was in its turn dispelled by the late rising moon , and yet he did not come . Again and again she wrapped a blanket about her , and ran up the river bank in the direction he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not daring to lose sight of the light in her cabin , she would stand and listen , until , benumbed with cold and fear , she would fly back to her shelter , only to be driven remorselessly out again . During the early part of the night , the knowledge that his heavy burden would make his progress slow sustained her . But when time , and far more than time for his return had elapsed , and he did not come , the horrible fear that he had deserted her , and the dread that he was kept away by some terrible accident , by turns took possession of her mind . Midnight was passed , and the moon slid slowly along the sky , muffled in the heavy // snow which fell in feathery flakes . The last hours of the night were made endurable only by the resolve to go in search of him as soon as day came . When the east showed signs of dawn , something of the comfort which light always brings after a night of suffering came to her . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come , as she hurriedly made preparation for her departure ; he had not disposed of his furs until too late , or perhaps he had really been angry with her , and had stayed away just to give her this anxious night . She did not know her way to the camp ; all she could do was to go in the same direction he had gone the day before . Only the day before ! What an eternity lay between her and the time he had given her that halfangry , half-reconciling kiss , and hurried away ! CHAPTER III . FOR a time after Antoine left the camp , he made good progress . As he sped over the ground , absorbed in his thoughts and plans for the future , he found his way more by instinct than care , and before night was really upon him , he was several miles on his way toward his home . He whistled softly to himself as a picture of the bright , warm room , with Marie for its center , arose before him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had so nearly told her the night before . Yes , as soon as the spring opened , they would once more take up their wandering life , but this time with their faces toward civilization . During the last twenty-four hours he had seen how impossible a continuation of their present life would be for any time . The unsettled , homeless existence which they must lead in the forest , he now , for the first time , thought of as a wrong to Marie . To him , the forest meant wild , happy freedom-freedom from care , law , or duty , while the life toward which he was forcing himself meant prosaic virtue , and impulse forever controlled . And , although his every feeling rebelled against the change , the determined will which had always made him so uncontrollable , and the broad , generous nature which had once made him break away from all rule , now made him see a duty which he had brought into his life , and seeing which compelled him to perform it . The moon rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its light by turns fell through the naked boughs , or was intercepted by the shade of the pines . The silence of the night was unbroken , save by the low shuffling of his snow-shoes as he made his way through the trackless waste . Now and then he would pause for rest , and then press on , indifferent to the night and its loneliness . The way was long , he was tired from his day of excitement and travel , and he began to feel some misgivings about reaching home in time to save Marie from a night of watching . There was a different trail from the one taken by himself and companions that morning , which would cut off a mile or two of his journey , and into that he would turn . He shifted his course , and was soon at the stream which marked the new trail . Following its guidance a short distance , he came to a pine-tree which a late storm had uprooted , and which now lay across the frozen river . The sight of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . And , yielding to a desire to feel something more solid than crumbling snow under his feet , he shook off his shoes and climbed upon the fallen trunk . As he did so , he noticed that the ice had been shattered by the tough branches , and the water was running swift and cold through the green leaves . He strode forward along the ice-incrusted bark with a free , careless step . In. the middle of the stream , he sprang lightly past an interfering bough , slipped as he regained his footing , clutched at the branches overhead , crashed through the wiry tree , and an instant later felt the icy water sweeping over his feet . The fall , when he realized it , seemed only the interruption of a moment , and the slight inconvenience of a pair of wet moccasins which would soon freeze and cease to trouble him . He threw his arm up for a supporting branch by which to extricate himself , but it fell back powerless , and sent a sickening thrill through his frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be nothing serious , and he struggled up to free himself from the close-lapping branches . But the short struggle showed him how vain it was . He could neither rise nor sink . The heavy burden on his shoulders held him firmly down . Beneath , his only foot-hold was the rushing water , and he seemed bound about by a thousand firmly fixed cords in the slender , tough branches . More than the slightest movement was an impossibility , and by degrees the horrible truth that he was chained in a prison , in a spot which might not be traversed for years by human feet , and from which he could only be released by the hand of death , forced itself upon // him . He did not submit to the discovery quietly , for , with all the strength of his slender athletic frame , he struggled : but after each fruitless attempt he paused , only to find himself held more firmly in the pinetree 's embrace . The toils which encompassed him were seemingly so slight , that to be baffled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and beat wildly about him with his left hand to break them away . But the branches only gave out a bruised fragrance as they cut sharply through the cold air and swayed against his face ; and , after an hour or more of combat , he sank back hopeless , to wait . Save for the pain which his arm gave him when he moved it , he was not suffering ; or , if suffering , his mental anguish made him insensible to it . And , as he stood upright in his trap , his mind supernaturally clear , he thought until his imaginings became torture almost unendurable . Again the picture of his lowly home arose before him . Again , more vividly than ever , he saw Marie , pale and tearful , listening for the step she would never again hear . Oh , why had he parted from her so coldly ? Why had he not told her his partially formed plans that last night as they sat before the fire ? How plainly he remembered her answer when he asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Antoine . " As he repeated the words , they brought him a strange joy to know that without him she could not live , that they would meet again ere long , when he could tell her that he had always been true to her , that even when death came to him he was hastening to her . With the certainty of death came thoughts of the future . His life , in the sight of the church and the world , had been one of outlawry and disobedience to the laws of God and man . What hope was there for him now ? What a vast distance would separate him from Marie , even after they were both dead . Would they ever meet ? Or , would she look as immovably upon him from her saintly heights , as the cold moon now looked upon him from the wintry sky ? How could a dying man repent and be forgiven without the aid of a sanctified prayer ? If only he could see Marie ! She was his church , his priest , his heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there came an undefined feeling that if she , in her pure heart , could find him worth loving and saving , Godinfinitely purer , holier , and more pityingwould receive his blackened soul and make it white and clean . As the first gleam of light penetrated the darkness of her long night , Marie prepared for her journey . During the night she prayed as fervently as her distracted heart would allow , that her search might be successful , that the welcome sight of Antoine might greet her eyes before another night . She believed that she would be guided to him , wherever he was , and so she started out to find him , or perish in the wilderness . Through the slowly dawning day she passed toward the camp . The snow of the night still lay thickly upon the trees , obscuring the pale light and giving the forest a weird , gloomy aspect she had never seen before . Her wanderings of the summer had taught her some things necessary to know of forest travel . She had learned the signs by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without great difficulty , though her progress was slow and she often sank down exhausted and unhappy , to rest . But there was comfort in action , and she would soon spring up again and hurry forward . It was late in the afternoon before she reached the trading-post ; she found it deserted by the hunters , for they had that morning started on their long expedition . But the permanent settlers were there , and , although they could give her little news of her husband , they could at least relieve her of the haunting fear that he had gone with his old companions . They comforted her , too , with many reasons for Antoine 's disappearance . He had , perhaps , come upon the track of some valuable game , which he had followed , and thus been delayed . She had better return to her cabin and wait patiently for him . And there was a shorter trail than the one by which he had come , which she had better take on her return . She would probably find Antoine at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the camp , she turned away from it with a far lighter heart than that with which she had entered it . The dwellers there had laughed at her fears , and she felt that she was foolish to dread for him . He knew the forest as well as she knew the meadows at home . He was armed for any encounter with wild animals ; and from man , she knew he feared nothing . And in her short stay at the camp she had heard how it was believed that her husband bore a charmed life , that woodland dangers always faded before him , and foes always gave him the trail . // Upheld by these reflections , she followed the path which he had taken the night before . At first she flitted like a bird over the snow , thinking how in happy hours to come , she would tell Antoine of her adventurous search for him . But it was not long before she felt the depressing effect of weariness . And as she entered the new trail the day was done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon would show her the way . Wrapping her blanket around her and muffling her chilled face in it , she nestled beside a great tree for what warmth its shelter might give . The day and preceding night had been wonderfully mild , but now the n*ight was growing intensely cold , and she begrudged every moment of inaction . But to go forward she did not dare , for , if she once strayed from her way in the darkness , she was hopelessly lost . The chill air benumbed her mentally and physically , and she had not been long in her sheltered nook before she succumbed to the sleep which anxiety had banished the night before . XVhether she slept for a long or a short time she did not know , for her sleep was as heavy and dreamless as death . She only knew that she sprang to her feet , wide awake , after the first moment of confusion , hearing her name called loudly , as if from empty space . She listened breathlessly for a repetition of the sound , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unearthly voice which had called her , came over her and filled her with awe which made her silent . And , crossing herself and murmuring a prayer , she once more went forward through the moonlit woods . But all her buoyancy and hope were gone . It was hard to keep back the tears which loneliness , fear , and cold forced into her eyes . For the first time in her lif&amp; , she had to depend entirely upon herself and never before had she been so helpless , so defenseless . She walked heavily on , benumbed by the cold , with only consciousness sufficient to keep upon the river , which she had been told was her nearest way home . A short distance before her she saw her path obstructed by a fallen tree , and she was about to scramble up the bank and make her way around it when her heart gave a great bound of fear as she saw the green boughs suddenly moved . The certainty that she now had a fierce , starved animal to face , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods rang with a loud cry of despair . At the sound , the green screen was put swiftly aside , and a human face , haggard and pale , looked out at her . Looked blankly at first , then the eyes lit it up and the warm blood flushed over it , and her cry was answered by one of joy and triumph . " Marie , Marie , art thou here ? " Where was the loneliness and coldness of a moment before ? That cry peopled the world for her , and filled the forest with the glory of sumnier . In an instant she was upon the tree , her arms were around her husband 's neck , her kisses upon his lips . For some moments words were not needed ; it was enough that they were together once more . Then Antoine , with his head drooping weakly upon her breast , said : " Marie , I knew that thou wouldst come . I could not die without thee . " " Die , Antoine ! Do not speak of dying . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she looked about her for the cause . " I can not move , Marie . I have been here since last night . My arm is broken . These boughs hold me fast . " " Oh , Antoine ! " and the horror which he felt when he first realized his fate was now felt by her . Still she would not believe the hopelessness of his situation , and , seizing his bonds , tried with all her strength to sever them , and together they fought his strange captor ; but the struggle was short , and Antoine said : " It is hopeless , Marie . My strength is all gone . I can not aid thee . I must die here . Take the heavy burden from my shoulders . Sit down beside me , Marie . Let me feel thine arms once more around me , and with thee near me I will not be afraid to die . " Marie quickly undid the fastenings of his pack and laid it aside , and at once renewed her endeavors to release him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife from his belt began to cut the stronger ones . But just as her labor seemed about to succeed he called out to her : " Stop , Marie . The ice is broken beneath me . If you release me I shall fall . The current will carry me under the ice and I shall drown . Only let death come to me in thy presence* and I am resigned . " Once more she crept back to him , this time heart-broken and despairing . " Let me go back to the camp , Antoine , and bring thee aid . " But he only shook his head , and drew her more closely to him , saying : " Do not leave me . I should not be alive when thou wouldst return . The sight // of thee has given me a respite , but it will not be a long one . I am faint from pain and hunger , and the night is growing fiercely cold . Thou wilt only have to watch with me a short time , little one . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie ? " he asked once more , this time his voice full of love and tenderness , all the old impatience gone from it . " Antoine , do not ask me . Without thee I can not live . If thou diest here I will never leave this spot . I will stay with my arms around thee , and when death comes to thee it will come to me . " " No , my sweet Marie . Thou must leave me when I am dead . Go to the camp , and when spring comes some one will take thee to thy mother , for there are kind ' hearts among my wild comrades , and for my sake , as well as thine , they will be good to thee . " " Oh , Antoine , life without thee will be nothing . Do not bid me seek it ; let me lay it down with thine , " she implored him passionately . " I want to tell thee , Marie , all the good resolutions I was forming as I hurried toward thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the years to come . " Then he told her all , and told her timidly and falteringly of the hope that had come to him when he found he must die-of the almost assured belief which her love had taught him to dare to hope for through the infinite love of God . Sobbing wildly , she listened to him and comforted him . Then at last they were silent , she chafing and caressing his cold hands with her almost equally icy ones , and he watching her with happy , patient eyes . The breathless night grew colder and colder , and the far-off stars glittered through the trees . At length Antoine*s arm loosened its pressure ; he leaned heavily against Marie and slept . With a low , piercing cry which could not reach his dulled brain , the moon , stars , and trees whirled in a labyrinth around her , as she fainted from the consciousness of her woe . The snow was melting from every sunny slope when Marie looked at the world again . The scene upon which she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it all a dream , until a face bent over her which seemed to belong to the winter day , long , long ago , when she had gone in search of Antoine . She looked into the coarse but kindly face , and the past came back to her . With a groan , she turned away . " Do not tell me ; I know it all . Antoine is dead . " The girl leaned over her and said softly : " Joy is sometimes harder to bear than sorrow . Canst thou bear it ? " Marie turned quickly back . " Tellme ! Tellme ! " " I will let another tell thee , " and she hurried away . Marie fell back in silent happiness , and a moment more Antoine clasped her in his arms . Presently he told her how death had been frightened away . After Marie had left the camp that winter day , seeing how cold the night was growing , and fearing that she could not make her way alone , two of the settlers had followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its fatal sweetness , and while Marie was insensible to everything , the hunters fouyid them . It was short work for their strong arms to release the prisoner , and , before daybreak , rescued and rescuers were safe in camp . Antoine 's recovery was far more speedy than Marie 's , and for many weeks he feared that it was he who would have to go through the world alone . But now the two who had parted in death met in life , and life-whose other name is happinessbeamed with loving welcome for them . They watched the coming of spring , and when it burst upon them in its northern swiftness and beauty , they started out under the tender whispering leaves , and wandered toward the great river . One evening in early midsummer , as the mother stood at the cottage door looking toward the forest , she saw two forms emerge from its shade and cross the meadow . She watched them as they came along the path toward the cottage ; then she staggered down the little garden walk as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with outstretched arms , and Marie and her mother were together once more .
