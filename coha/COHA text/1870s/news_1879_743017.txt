txt Conversations with leading Democratic Senators failed to develop much specific inform . tion .

None of them were willing to have anything which they said printed with their names . They would talk freely enough , however , provided their names were not given . One prominent Southern Senator said THE TIMES 'S report of the out ? look for 1880 was a marvelous piece of journal . istie work . " I do not , " said he , " attach much significance to the expressions of opinion contained in that report . It is too early yet to get any trustworthy information from the Presidential question .
