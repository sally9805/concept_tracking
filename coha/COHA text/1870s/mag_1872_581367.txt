SHOULD THE STUDY OF THE MODERN PRECEDE THAT OF THE AN CIENT LANGUAGES ? IN the discussion concerning the position which the study of language should occupy in a general system of education , two main views have divided , in nearly equal proportion , the educators and the patrons of edu- ' cation in England and America . The advocates of one view would retain essentially the traditional classical curriculum , introducing into it , however , such changes as are demanded by the present advancement in philological science , and increasing the amount that must be read as a condition for entrance to college and for graduation . They hold that all who intend entering upon a professional life , or who aspire to a liberal education , should go through this modified and improved classical curriculum , as a necessary prehminary course of training . The advocates of the other view , including in their ranks the great body of business men ,  --  of those who arrogate to themselves the title of " practical men , " - hold that the ancient languages should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be replaced by the modern languages and the , natural sciences ; or that , if studied at all , the ancient languages should be left to that small class of useless , impractical men which infest every community , who prefer to alien&amp;te themselves from the living present and to live among the musty remains of past ages . In many of our colleges a practical solution of the question is sought by avoiding the issue , and admittin.g two parallel courses of study embodying these conflicting views , to which are given the conventional names of " classical " and " scientific " courses . The " scientific " course is generally made but three years in length , and the requirements for admission to it are much inferior to those to the " classical " course . In a few of the best colleges another solution of the problem is sought , in retaining the old classical course and adding recitation in one or more of the modern languages during a portion of the college curriculum . We shall endeavor to show , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above views and methods are fundamentally wrong , and that the true solution of the question as to the position which the study of language should occupy in our educational system is to be fOund in a method which is radically different from any of those at present in vogue . By the system which we shall propose , many advantages will be gained which . are unattainable under either of the present methods . A unity will be maintained in the entire academic and collegiate courses , making them the most profitable for the several classes of students : for those who , after finishing the academic course , shall enter upon the duties of active life ; for those who shall continue through the college course before entering upon their careers in business or professional life ; for those who shall complete the college course , as preparatory to special study in any of the learned professions ; and , finally , for those who intend to become professional linguists . Thus the socalled " practical " men and the scholastic party will be reconciled and will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are now doing , by their distracted counsels and conflicting efforts . To illustrate this reorganization of the linguistic part of our educational system , we will imagine one of our great cities or States having a complete system of graded schools , the whole being crowned with a post-collegiate university . The great need of such uni // ve*sities in America is now becoming so extensively felt that it is only a question of time as to how soon they shall be established . In all probability the next ten years will witness the founding of one or more such universities , which will soon rival , in the extent and excellence of their appointments , the largest and best universities in continental Europe . It is to be hoped that , in their l ) lan of organization , they will be in advance of even the great and time-honored European universities , all of which retain more or less of medileval tradition , both in their plan and their 51 ) irit . But the modification in linguistic instruction which we shall propose will greatly improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . According to the plan which we propose , the study of one living language will be commenced by pupils when between the ages of ten and twelve years . The method of instruction should at first be very simple , and adapted to the stage of development of the young child . As at this age the memory is more active than the judgment , and the mind inclines to details rather than to principles , the attention should be directed at this time to learning the names of the most familiar objects , and to gathering a store of familiar phrases and expressions , referring to the simplest physical facts and phenomena , and to the simplest operations and emotions of mind and heart . A body of linguistic material will thus be accumulated in this new language , as had previously been the case with the pupil 's own vernacular , to be subjected in his more mature years to rigid grammatical analysis and philological treatment . The pupil should also immediately utilize what he has learned , and should be taught to express his childish thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should also read juvenile literature in this language , of no higher grade than that which he is reading in his own vernacular . More rigid grammatical instruction will be added as soon and as fast as the intellectual development of the pupil will admit . As much time , or more , should be given to the study of this living language in the academy or preparatory school as is now given in them to the study of Latin . Upon entering college the student will be able to read common prose in this new language with considerable fluency , to converse with tolerable freedom upon ordinary topics , and to understand a simple spoken discourse . Two years before the close of the academic course , the study of a second living language should* be commenced . As this will be begun when the student is at a more mature age , and us the student will have had an exl ) erience of some years in the ' study of language , a less slow , elementary , and juvenile method will be necessary at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , upon entering college the proficiency of the student in these two languages will be nearly equal . These two living languages will thus take the l ) lace of Latin and Greek in the studies which are required for admission to college . During the Freshman year the classical literature of these languages will be read , and the rigid philological study of them will be taken up . During the remainder of the college course , one study at a time , in other branches of science , will be pursued from text-books in one or the other of these languages . During the senior year the history of these languages , their relation to cognate languages , and the history of their literature will be introducedas elective studies . The study of Latin will be commenced at the beginning of the Sophomore , that of Greek at the beginning of the Junior year . Latin will be studied two years and Greek one year or more . During one term will be pursued the formal study of the system of derivation from Latin and Greek of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English language . The modifications in form and signification which words of Latin and Greek origin have received , while passing through other modern languages before they came into the English , will be l ) Ointed out , thus showing the plexus of connections that binds the European languages together . The mutual relations of the Latin and the Greek* languages , and their relations to the other Indo-European languages will also be pointed out . It will then remain for philological faculties in ( post-collegiate ) universities , and for l ) professional schools , like the School of Philology which has lately been established in connection with Yale College , to give that high linguistic instruction , both in the ancient and modern languages , which is so lacking in America . Associations of linguists , like the American Oriental Society and the American Philological Association , have also a work to perform in the promotion of philological science , which is beyond the province and beyond the power of any school of instruction . Germany has attained , its high // position as the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its many local and specific , as well as national and general philological societies . It is only by these same instrumentalities that philology can attain , in America , a position - co-ordinate with that which it occupies in Germany , or even to that which medicine , law , theology , and the natural sciences occupy in this country . Having thus sketched the outlines of this system of linguistic instruction , we shall glance rapidly at the most prominent arguments in its defense . Language is the medium of communicating to others our thoughts , feelings , and desires through spoken words . It is of the highest importance that the young pupil should apprehend this nature and office of language at the very commencement of his studies . To the degree in which the first new language which he begins to learn , aside from his own vernacular , can be shown to him to be capable of performing this mission ,  --  to the degree in which he can be made to see that all his thoughts , emotions , and desires , which he expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their English dress , and can be enrobed in the garb of another language ,  --  to that degree will he apprehend the nature and office of the new language ; and , in return , to that degree will his studies in the new language aid him in understanding the nature and office of his own vernacular , and , finally , of language in general . This condition can be met in the highest degree only in the study of a living language , and of one which is the expression of a civilization that is not very different from our own , and of a grade not lower than our own . By no means can it be fully met in studying a language which has ceased to be spoken , and which , when spoken , was the expression of a civilization that was essentially different from our own , and in many respects inferior to our own . The difficulty with reference to the ancient languages , as the basis of a system of l.inguistic education , is also greatly aggravated by the fact that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is so luxuriant in the classical living languages , and which alone is adapted to the mental development of young students . Of necessity students who begin with Latin and Greek , are compelled to read the works of ancient classical literature , as the great epics of Virgil and 1-Jomer , at an age when no person would think them fitted for the study of corresponding classic works in modern literature , as I ) ante 's Divina Commedici , or Schiller 's U/al/ens/ein ,  --  much less of the Niebelnngenlied , the C*id , or the ( hanson de Roland . In order to impress most effectually upon the mind of the young student a clear idea . of the nature and office of language , and of the difference between his vernacular and other languages , it is important that he should continue the study of the single living language with which he commences , until he realizes that everything that he says in English can also be said in this other language . With this thought fully fixed in hi* mind , and fully realized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be acquired with increasing facility and in shorter time . It is of course far better that , when possible , the new language should be learned in the country where it is the vernacular . The learner is there surrounded by the atmosphere of the language , and takes it in at every breath . He absorbs it unconsciously as well as consciously . But this is within the reach of so few , that the real question is , how can the benefits of foreign residence be approximately realized in our schools ? This must depend upon the kind of text-books employed , the method of instruction a(1ol)ted , and the skill and ingenuity of the teacher ; much can be done , however , to remove the artificiality of learning a language away from the country where it is the vernacular . Phonetics form one of the most vital elements in language . Language comes from the tongue of the speaker , and goes to the ears of the hearer . Sight should play but a very subsidiary l ) art in the Stu ( ly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning the ancient languages . The ordinary college student would be perfectly bewildered UI ) Ofl hearing a new sentence in Latin and ( ; reek l ) ronounced . He must see it , in ortler to comnl ) rehen ( l it . But the phonetic structure of Latin and Greek is very im* ) perfectly understood ; a greater obscurity still rests upon the history of the l ) ho1*etic development of those languages . To make the matter worse for the student , a l ) erfect chaos l ) revails in our I ) ronunciation of Latin and Greek . After having learned to pronounce these languages by on* professedly arbitrary system , upon going to another school , or upon entering college , he is often compelled to adopt another and very different , though equally arbitrary system of l ) rOnunciation . Truly is not this the play of V // Hamlet , with Hamlet left out ? - dr with the part of Richard the Third , or of Falstaff , substituted for that of Hamlet ? What an accurate idea the Chinese would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and German languages , if , from their aversion to foreigners , they should refuse to admit English , French , and German teachers , and then should give their own pronunciation to all of these three languages ! - or , if different Chinese teachers should adopt different methods of pronouncing these lan-guages ! From the nature of the case , the study of phonetics can be applied , to any important extent , only to living languages . The exact pronunciation of French as spoken in Paris , of German as spoken in Berlin , and of Italian as spoken in Florence and . Rome , can be perfectly ascertained and perfectly taught . Good instructors in the modern languages very properly take great pains to secure from their pupils at the outset a correct , easy and elegant pronunciation . They meet with the greatest difficulty in students who begin the study of the modern languages during the junior or senior year of the college course . The organs of spe.ech of these advanced students are rigid and unpliable . Their ears are also slow to detect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not unfrequently their pride is touched at their ludicrous mistakes . And , what is worse still , having been taught to consider a knowledge of grammatical forms and skill in translating to be all that is essential in studying languages , they soon look upon pronunciation as a matter of secondary importance , and worthy of the attention of only young children . These advanced college students soon become restless if a good pronunciation is insisted upon . The professor generally finds himself forced to yield , though under mental protest , and to permit his class to rush on to reading the works of Schiller , Goethe , Racine , Moliere , Dante , and Tasso , though their pronunciation is yet so execrable , that it would almost make these classic writers wish to appear in the flesh , that they might seize the books from the hands of the students and cry out to them to stop murdering their productions . If these same American college students should visit a German gymnasium or a French lyc*e , and should there hear Milton 's Paradise Lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as execrable a pronunciation of French or German , as is usually heard in American colleges , they VOL . IV. - 27 would call the study of English in those schools a farce . The difficulty is inherent in our system ; it is impossible to acquire a good pronunciation of French and German , when only two or three hours a week is given for some months to the study of either of these languages , especially when most of the time is given to the study of grammatical construction and of classic literature . Only after the student has had long training in the study of . one or more living languages , is he even partially prepared to imagine the phonetic structure of languages , the l ) ronunciation of which has been lost . The study of phonetics is a most valuable means of mental discipline . It opens up one of the most important fields of psychological and physiological research . It treats of one of the chief means by which the body is made the interpreter of the spirit . It lies at the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only key to the vocal changes that take place in the history of a language , and to the vocal variations among related languages . In learning to l ) produce those sounds in other languages which do not occur in his own vernacular , the student will acquire a new and a wider view of the resources of his own vocal organs ; he will be struck with the fact that some of the most frequently recurring sounds in his own language do not occur in other languages ; and the whole study of phonetics , as applied to foreign languages , will induce in the student a more exact and elegant enunciation of his own language . After the rudiments of pronunciation have been mastered , the most rapid* and correct habits of analysis and synthesis are called into action in the practical use of a spoken language . The difference between the rapidity and precision of mental action which are necessary in order to understand a spoken sentence , and those which are required in order to pick out deliberately , when seated at one 's desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sentence from the printed page , is not unlike the difference in skill which is necessary for a sportsman to hit a bird on the wing , from that which is requisite in order to hit a painted bird in a shooting* gallery . There is an equally great difference between the rapidity and precision of mental action which are required in order to formulate a sentence in rapid conversation , and those which are necessary in order to be able to write out deliberately , when seated at a desk , with grammar and dictionary at . // hand , a sentence in Latin or Greek composition . Thus , in order to understand a spoken sentence , in the first place , the hearer must rapidly and almost unconsciously separate the succession of sounds in a sentence into individual words ; for in all spoken languages there is little if any more separation of sound recognizable to the ear between the words of a sentence , than between the syllables of a word . This difficulty is greatly increased in those languages where the final consonant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having recognized the separate words in the spoken sentence , . the hearer must recognize the sterns of the words and the influence of terminations , prefixes and suffixes , and the influence of syntactical laws . He must also consider whether the words are employed in their primary or with derived significations , and whether the sentence contains idiomatic expressions , ellipses and other figures of speech . And , finally , he must consider the relation of the sentence to preceding conversation . All of this must be done in a flash , like the taking of instantaneous photographs . Indeed , the rapid and complicated mental operations and exertions of even the young pupil , in order to understand very simple spoken sentences at their first enunciation , are none the less real and strength-giving , from the fact that the ) T are often voluntary and unconscious , or that the ferule , the demerit-mark , and the prize are not necessary in order to call them forth . The number and quickness of mental operations are correspondingly greater in a more mature person , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoken discourse . The study of the dead languages offers nothing analogous for the development of rapid and almost instantaneous analytic habits and power of mind . And , on the other hand , a person is required not only to apprehend sound rapidly and correctly by his ear ; he must also produce sounds with equal rapidity and precision with his own mouth . He must give to words the proper accent ; emphasis , and intonation . He must give them their proper inflections , and locate and connect them in sentences according to the syntactical laws of the particular language . He must decide whether to use words in literal or in figurative significations , and when to employ idiomatic constructions and ellipses , in.versions , or other figures of speech . The mind must perform the double work of directing the pronunciation , and of formulating the sentences rapidly and correctly . To converse with freedom and elegance in a foreign language presupposes long and continued practice and training , which have been as real if not as obvious and demonstrative as with a pianist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetic powers of the mind are brought into action in a manner and to an extent that are not even approximated in the study of Latin and Greek . While a language continues to be spoken , it can not remain stationary , but it must be subject to growth , development , and modification , or to change and decay . Those languages whose history can be most completely traced , are necessarily the most valuable for showing the nature of linguistic growth and change . In - this respect , no ancient or modern classical languages are superior to the German and the French . We can trace the growth of the German language through nearly two thousand years , from its primitive* stage as the rude language of a collection of barbarous tribes , through three distinct and well-marked periods , with several subordinate divisions to each period . The French language has a well-known history , extending through more than ten centuries , with two prominent and several subordinate periods .. These two languages are also yet endowed with the vital elements of growth . New words are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled questions concerning various linguistic features and elements in these languages are now under discussion , and will be settled in due time , a similar questions in l ) ast l ) eriods of the language have ' been settled . The French and German languages thus offer , within themselves , vastly more material for the illustration of the development of linguistic features , of vocal changes , grammatical *urms , verbal derivation and coml ) osition , syntactical construction , the absorption of foreign elements and the effects of foreign influences , than do the Latin and Greek languages . It would require but little reflection to lead us to anticipate what every teacher who has given the subject a fair trial has observed , that a far greater interest is awakened in the mind of the young student by the study of a living than of a dead language . He recognizes that it can serve to him all the purposes of a language . He appropriates it and incorporates it as a p*irt of his own mental furniture . He also utilizes it immediately , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , and thus is led early to form // a most valuable habit*tI*at of applying to his own individual use what he has learned theoretically . The value of this enthusiasm as a stimulus to study can hardly be overestimated . This interest will not be confined to the years of childhood . It will be sustained through all of the academic and collegiate courses , inasmuch as the student continues to realize that other languages than the English can be the vehicle of all the thoughts and feelings of his maturing and expanding mind and heart . Various means may be employed to sustain this interest . Thus , selections in prose and poetry in these languages may be committed to memory for declamation ; French and German periodicals may be introduced into the college reading-rooms , and may be occasionally used in the class-room instead of the text-book ; French and German books upon history , biography , travels , the sciences and arts , and in belles-lettres literature , can be introduced into the libraries ; during the latter part of the college course text-books written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various sciences ; resident French and German men of science and letters can deliver to the senior class lectures , upon French and German history and literature , and upon various branches of science . All these will serve the double purpose of giving information and entertainment to the student , and of keeping his knowledge of these languages fresh and ever advancing . These living languages , when thus acquired , will remain an unfailing and direct source of profit and pleasure during the subsequent period of study in professional *chools , and during all after life . They will not pass from memory within a few years after the close of the college course , as is too often the case with Latin and Greek . As to which *wo modern languages should be made the basis of linguistic education in English-speaking countries , the choice would undoubtedly be given to the French and the German . Besides the reasons which would have weight in England , in determining the precedence in order of time in the study of these two languages , there is a very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . America is fast losing the character of being a unilingual country . Already one-tenth of our population speak a foreign tongue . Should existing causes continue to act , before another generation shall pass away one-fifth of our entire population will be German-speaking people . German immigrants are already to be found in every village and city , an.d in most rural districts . American children hear the German l*-guage spoken in the streets , often by Qerman servants in their homes , or by German schoolmates in their schools ; they see German names and words on signs of stores and hotels ; they hear German newspapers cried in the streets ; they see German books and the center-table . All of engravings upon this gives unconscious but real education ; it impresses upon the mind of the American child the fact of the real , living character of the German language ; and it prepares him , even before he enters school , to commence with the study of this , rather than with that of the French language . Many arguments may be advanced , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By commencing with living languages and studying them in the method and at the time above proposed , the student will enter the sophomore or junior year of the college course with a much clearer view of the nature and office of language , and with much greater ability to master a new language and to understand its peculiar structure and spirit than is possible under the present system of beginning with the ancient classical languages . In a single year he could learn to read , but not to speak , Italian , Spanish , Dutch , or Swedish , as fluently as the German and French , upon which he has spent so much time . He will also have received that peculiar training which is necessary in order to study with profit a language from Which the vital characteristic of being a natural and living vehicle of thought and feeling has forever gone ; a language the pronunciation of which is but imperfectly known ; a language which has ceased to grow , but which stands before us in the crystallized form that it assumed many centuries ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of a civilization that has passed away ; a language of which the familiar , social , and domestic portions have perished , and of which the only remains extant are some portions of its artistic , classical literature . With the experience and training in the study of language which will thus be acquired , through following a natural and logical method , and with the maturity of mind which ordinary college students have at the begim*ing of the sophomore year , they will arrive at a more correct and critical apprehension of the character , the spirit , and the linguistic features and relations of the Latin and Greek languages by one year of well-directed study , if commenced at this // period , than most college students attain to , tlXrough the present method , by the end of their college course . If , during the one or two years which will thus be devoted to the study of each of the ancient languages , not as many Latin and Greek authors can be read as at present , those which shall he read will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general spirit of ancient literature , and of its relation to modern literature , as well as of the linguistic relations of the ancient to the modern languages . Such of the Latin and Greek authors , which are now read in college , as can not be pursued in the time that will thus be devoted in the college course to the study of the ancient languages , will be read more profitably under the instruction of philological faculties in post-collegiate universities , or in special schools of philology . Under these philological faculti*es of universities , all of the ancient and modern classical languages and literatures will be taught from the highest standpoint of modern philology , and after a method which is adapted to the intellectual development and linguistic attainments of colli*ge graduates , who will form the body of the students of the university . This modification of our system of linguistic instruction will produce many valuable results . In the first place , it offers the only feasible plan for the education of profes*ional linguists ; in order to meet the present deficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our colleges , and others in America who devote themselves to special branches of philological investigation , are forced to go through tedious years of undirected private study , or to seek , as almoners , in foreign lands advantages which are denied them at home . But , aside from this most important consideration , the plan proposed above Provides the best preliminary linguistic education for those who shall enter any of the learned professions ; it also gives the most profitable study to that large class , including indeed the great majority of stu dents , who , for various reasons , do not go beyond the academic course , or do not finish th' collegiate course . It is no small advantage , also , that a symmetry will thus be maintained in the linguistic part of our educational system . After having stated thus briefly some of the advantages which will be gained by the proposed system , we will consider some of the most prominent objections which will be offered against it . It is argued that we should commence ' . with the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient . Whatever force there may be in this argument with reference to French as derived from Latin , it has no bearing upon German and Greek , both of which are yet to be considered as primitive languages , or rather as sister languages , derived from a common , but undiscovered , Aryan language . But the argument proves too much . It proves that we should study Gothic , Old German , and Middle German before we study New German ; that we should study Old French before New French , and the older Sanscrit before the newer Latin and Greek . On the contrary , the natural order in the study of language , as of every other branch of knowledge , is to proceed from the nearer and the more similar to the more distant and the more dissimilar . The mutual relationship of the two languages will be as clearly discerned by the student , if , in studying Latin , he finds it to be the parent of French , which he has already studied , as though , in studying French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he has already studied . And a previous knowledge of French , if studied in the manner proposed , will facilitate the learning of Latin quite as much as a previous knowledge of Latin facilitates the learning of French . The fact that so many English words are derived from the Latin is often urged as an argument for the early study of this language . This is a valid argument for the study of Latin , but not , for beginning the study of language with Latin . Indeed a large portion of the words of Latin origin in the English language , especially of those which are most frequently used in ordinary discourse , have come through the French into the English language . The derivation and the present forms of most of these words can only be explained by refereice to the French first , and to the Latin afterward . But little practical application of the derivation of technical terms , which have come from Latin and Greek directly into the English language , is made by the student before he enters the sophomore year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient classical are more perfect in structure than the modern classical languages . In the summation of their grammatical elements and linguistic features , French and German are fully equal to Latin and Greek . In many respects they are indeed superior . Their vocabularies are very much larger and * // more varied . Their stores of idiomatic expressions are inexhaustible , and are necessarily greatly superior to the idioms which are extant in Greek and Latin literature . The number of words and idioms in these , as in all living languages , is constantly increasing . The phonetic character of living languages is perfectly understood . French and German offer more material and greater scope for illustrating the laws of linguistic growth and change than Latin and Greek do within themselves . The claim is often made that the study of the ancient languages gives a better mental discipline than can be derived from any other study . That better mental discipline is obtained from pursuing a long and systematic course of s.tudy of any kind , than from following a short , rambling , and fragmentary course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a person has graduated in the socalled " classical " course is equi*alent to saying , not only that he has studied Latin and Greek systematically and rigidly for six or eight years , but also that he has studied mathematics equally long , and that he has given the equivalent of two or three years of time to the study of other branches of science . It would indeed be a matter of great surprise if this course of study , extending thus through eight or more successive years , taking the student when his mind is most pTastic and retaining him till the character is mature and fixed , even if it be not the very best that could be devised , should not give better mental discipline than do the shorter and less systematic courses of study which are generally pursued by those who do not complete the classical curriculum . It is unfair , . however , to credit all the mental discipline that is gained by those who follow the classical course to the study of Latin and Greek ; a fair share of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other studies that are pursued with equal vigor with the ancient languages . In comparing the intellectual benefits to be derived from the study of ancient and of modern languages , we must not omit to take into account the interest that is awakened in the mind of the young pupil by the study of the latter , which interest is continued unabated through the whole course of study , and which remains active during the entire subsequent life , after leaving the academy , college , or professional school . It is not necessary for us to examine whether any portion of the mental discipline which is derived from the study of the ancient languages comes through the young pupil or even the maturer student forcing himself to a distasteful task , of which he does not realize the significance or the importance ; nor whether any of the distaste to the study of Latin and Greek which may now exist , would be diminished or removed by transferring these languages to the middle or the latter half of the college curriculum . Very often , also , sufficient importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not indeed unconscious , but still none the less real and strength-giving exertions of mind , to the clear and rapid analysis and synthesis that are called forth in learning to read , write , hear , and speak a living language ; nor to the fact that what would be considered extraordinary proficiency in Latin and Greek would be called very moderate proficiency in a modern language . When thus compared in all their relations and effects as a means of giving discipline to the mind , the preponderance is largely in favor of the modern languages . Some classicists attempt to break the force of the argument against giving the lion 's share of the time in the academic and collegiate courses of study to Latin and Greek , by asserting that these languages can be revitalized , and can be made to seem as natural to the student as his own vernacular , or as French or German ; and they . fortify their position by some striking illustrations . Thus , it is true that lectures were given in Latin in nearly all of the European universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important works on science and philosophy that appeared in Europe even down to the eighteenth century were written in Latin ; and Latin was the medium of correspondence and conversatk* between learned men of different nationalities during the same period . We may say that , in a modified sense , the Latin language ( rather an unnatural , factitious Latin ) has been a living language until the present century . In a more limited degree than formerly , it may be called a spoken language at the present day ; the proceedings of the late cEcumenical Council of the Roman Catholic Church were conducted in this modern factitious Latin ; many of the officials of the Roman Catholic Church all over the world , and some of the professors in the universities , gymnasia , and lyc*es of Europe speak t*is Latin with greater or less proficiency . But it can not be claimed that to the general student in America the practical advantages to be derived from learning to speak Latin , as a means* of intercourse , // are to-day at all commensurate with the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent for the time and labor , passing by the question of special genius , which are requisite in order to compose poems in Latin and Greek , as is done in the English universities and some other institutions which pride themselves upon the perfection to which they carry the study of the ancient languages . Lord Brougham learned French in his youth from an aged and highly cultivated French " gentleman of the olden style , " who in bearing , manners , and language seemed a crystallized relic of the age of Louis XIV. , and who had fled to England to escape the terrors of the First Revolution ; when Lord Brougham went to Paris , some forty years afterwards , his antiquated French called forth many a smile . Several years ago , a distinguished professor of the University of Edinburgh , who had learned German by reading standard German literature , went to Berlin and there conversed in the language as he had learned it ; his sentences were stately , cumbered , and formal , and often he was unintelligible ; " that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor . And no doubt , if the ghosts of Cicero , 1-brace , and Virgil could hear three modern professors from Germany , France , and America talking Latin in Rome , Pompeii , or Tivoli , they would be much surprised to learn that these three professors were speaking in the same language in which they themselves wrote . It is correct to apply the term factitious to all the Latin that has been spoken for the last thousand years . For , if it is impossible to learn to speak a contemporary living language from reading its classical literature , in which the expressions and idioms of familiar conversation do not occur , how much more is it iml ) ossible to learn to converse in Latin and Greek by the study of tlieir classical literatures ; most of the familiar expressions of these ancient languages are lost ; and , what is more fatal , words , expressions , and idioms never existed in those languages to represent the new features , the mechanical appliances , and the relations of trade , science , art , religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus we have no means for determining whether , if the Latin language had continued to be the vernacular in Italy , the Romans would have adopted a word analogous to the Italian s/ivale , or one analogous to the French bQ/te , as the name of the modern " boot , " or whether they would have adopted another word altogether ; we can not tell whether they would have applied the name gymnasium , lyceum , collegium , or some other name to a school preparatory to the modern university ; we can not tell whether they would have used an expression similar to the French ban que succursale , one similar to the Italian banca filiale , or another exi ) ression altogether to indicate a " branch bank . " It is as absurd to manufacture Latin words and idioms , or to give a Latin dress to English words and idioms , as it would be to manufacture French or German words and idioms , or to give a French or German dress to English words and idioms . All such work should be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such factitious Latin should be abandoned , as cultivating wrong habits* of mind , and doing violence to all correct ideas of the nature of language , and of its method o:f growth . But this part of the discussion seems almost needless in America to-day . For it is doubtful whether , if we except some of the best Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries , ten sentences of conversational Latin are pronounced in a year , within the hearing of students in all the colleges of the country put together . And probably there are not ten persons in Europe and America who can conduct for five minutes a free conversation in classical Greek . But still if Latin , even this factitious Latin , is not used as a means of intercourse by conversation and writing , Latin loses , to the apprehension of the young pupil , one of the chief characteristics of a real language . The importance of Greek and Roman culture , as the parents ( rather the grandparents ) of modern culture , is often urged as a strong reason for giving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in our educational system . But if , in viewing the question from the standpoint of the history of . civilization , we shall be compelled to admit that so great a predominance should be given to the study of classical antiquity , that will not justify giving the attention solely to the study of classical literature , which is but one element in clas sical culture . Architecture , sculpture , and painting are as important elements in civilization as their sister art , literature . The whole framework of society is held together by law . The influence of Greek architecture , sculpture , and painting upon the formative arts in all their subsequent periods , and of // Roman law upon mediæval and modern legislation , has been more extensive , direct , and intimate than has been the influence of Greek and Roman literature upon medfreval and modern literature . And yet what prominence is given , in our academies and colleges , to the study of Greek and Roman art and of Roman law ? Almost none at all . It may be remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the extraordinary fact that the Greeks reached their high culture , not by studying the languages of other older and more refined nations ( as the ancient Assyrians and Egyptians ) , but by " studying when boys what they would need to practice when men they studied their own history , their own government , their own literature and art ; being thus imbued with the spirit of their own civilization , they were prepared to promote and advance it ; they were not imitators and copyists , but originators and inventors . If America is to . rise to a high stage of culture by the same means by which Greece rose to its high culture , it will also be by " studyii*g when boys what we will need to practice when men , " which will not consist mostly in reading Latin and Greek . But it is not necessary , in order to understand the civilization of a people with tolerable accuracy , for the general student to study their language at all . Every person of ordinary intelligence to-day has a fair idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , Turkey , Madagascar , and the Feejee Islands , without knowing a word of the languages of those countries . Every child of twelve years of age in a Christian family , is better acquainted with the history of the ancient Jews than of his own nation , and this without knowing one word of Hebrew . Most persons of liberal education have as correct and intimate knowledge of the civilization of the ancient Egyptians , and Assyrians , and Persians as of the ancient Greeks and Romans , and this without deciphering a single hieroglyphic or cuneiform inscription . Humboldt 's Cosmos , Ranke 's History of the Popes , Martin 's History of France , and Cousin 's Lectures on Philosophy are as well understood in their English translation as in their original French or German dress . English translations of the writings of Plutarch , Pliny , Vitruvius , Strabo , and Pausanias convey as accurate information as their Latin and Greek originals . Most classical scholars even derive nearly all of their knowledge of the philosophical writings of Plato and Aris totle from English translations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend , of necessity , upon translations of the Holy Scriptures for information and stimulus , which they believe to affect their most vital eternal interests . With poetry and other kinds of imaginative literature it is somewhat different . Here so much of the genius and imagination of the writer is shown in his l ) eculiar employment of words , expressions , idioms , and figures of speech ; his style is so ingrafted into the vital elements of his own native language that much of the freshness , vitality , * and peculiar character of the original is necessarily lost in translation . Still , much of the force and sublimity of the majestic poems of Job , Isaiah , and Jeremiah , and of the beauty and pathos , and at times of the sublimity of the Psalms of David is retained in the English translation of the Holy Scriptures . Much of the poetic spirit is preserved , and all the development of the plot is presented in English translations of Goethe 's Faust , Auerbach 's Viii on tue N/zinc , Hugo 's Les Illisiral'ies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quixote ; the same is equally true of translations of the Iliad of Homer , the A3neid of Virgil , the Odes of Horace and Aristophanes , and the Ji'igveda . It is not necessary for the general student to read Latin and ' Greek at all in order to gain an accurate knowledge of all the facts recorded by the ancient historians and of the views of the ancient philosophers nor , indeed , in order to obtain a very tolerable knowledge of the spirit and scope of classical literature . It is to translations of the works of the classical writers , which have been carefully made by critical scholars , and to the masterly compilations of historians and arch*eologists like Grote , Merivale , Mommsen , Curtius , Winckelmann , MUller , Gerhard , and Rossi , that the great majority of even liberally educated persons are indebted for the chief part of their knowledge of classical antiquity . The primitive sources of civilization were not in Greece and Rome . They were in Egypt and Western and Central Asia . And modern history and civilization are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical history and civilization . Whatever time , therefore , in our general system of education is given to the stttdy of the history of civilization should be devoted symmetrically and equitably to all the im // portant features and to all the chief periods of history , without giving undue prominence to any particular feature or period . If , in the discussion concerning the position which languages should occupy in our educational system , the importance of the study of the ancient languages has been unduly depreciated by the advocates of the " new education , " this has been in a great measure the consequence of the exaggerated and indefensible claims that have been brought forward by classicists in defense of a traditional system , which was established in past ages , under circumstances that no longer exist , and before the rise of the many branches of natural , linguistic , and aesthetic science which have sprung into existence during the present century , and which now claim a place beside their elder , but not , therefore , more worthy sisters in the educational systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely from the course of study of any person who aspires to a liberal education , or who purposes to enter any of the learned professions , would be a serious error . The plan of reorganization proposed above does not require us to form an opinion as to whether it would not be a greater evil to reject the modern languages from the academic and collegiate courses , as has often been , and even yet not unfrequently is done . It is only just to assert that no person , at the present day , can lay claims to a ltberal education who has not an available knowledge of the French and German languages . Four-fifths of the literature containing the latest results of investigation in every department of human knowledge is in these two languages . The German language holds to-day very nearly the same relation to the English that the Italian did to the German during the sixteenth century , or that the Greek did to the Latin at the time of the Roman empire . In quantity and value of records of new and independent investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though far removed from it , then follow , at about equal pace , the English and Italian . With the command of these four languages a person has access to nearly all the valuable results of investigation at the present day in any department of human knowledge . No amount of acquaintance with Latin and Greek literature will supply the deficiency of a knowledge of either of these modern classical languages . The plan of study above proposed seeks to give to the old and the new their appropriate places , to harmonize conflicting influences , and thus to give a symmetry to the modern system of liberal education .
