txt If the statements made by a resident of Samoa , in a letter which we printed on Wednesday from the San Francisco Chronicle , are to be depended upon , the future of the newly self-elected monarch of the Navigator 's Islands is not very promising . There is only one reason - why we ought to take the slightest interest in the career of that personage . Under ordinary circumstances , the conduct of any individual in the wild islands of the Pacific would be a matter of very small importance . As it is , ' we do not think that many will trouble themselves about Mr. STEINBERGER 'S fate among his new subjects . If he lives with them to a good old age , and dies at last respected and beloved , the world will not go much out of its way to rejoice ; and if he meets a different fate , and dies by violence amid the execrations of the people , it is not likely that there will be much public mourning anywhere . But if we care little whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so indifferent about the treatment ' of the people over whom he has forced his authority . This is unfortunate , but it is true . Mr. STEINBERGER is not an ordinary filibuster . It may be supposed that he is an ambitious man in a very small way . Failing to attain the position in civilized life to which he has thought himself entitled , he is nevertheless satisfied with the prospect of domineering over a few thousand savages . All he wanted was to exercise authority somewhere , and he is content in the absence of any better chance to play the despot in Samoa . But while bent upon that project , ho had the sagacity to see the advantage at which he would be placed , not so much - with the native population as with foreign powers , if he could borrow the use of some foreign flag . Unhappily he selected the flag of the United States , and still more unhappily he has been allowed to use it . The consequences , then , are these : If Mr. STEIN/3E1MM be wise and prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reward in the good-will of the natives , and the American flag will be forgotten . But if his mission be a failure , and a source of disaffection , as it promises to be , Mr. STEINBERGER will probably lose his life , and perhaps not unjustly . But in the eyes of the natives , and this is of more importance , all the odium of his tyranny will be attached to the flag of the nation which he pretends to represent , and for many years to come Americans visiting Samoa - will pay the penalty . More harm will thus result to American commerce in that part of the Pacific than can be compensated for afterward by years of good diplomacy . One statement in the letter we have referred to has been true for some years . The natives of the Navigator 's , as well as of other islands in the Pacific , have been taxed to the utmost limit of their paying powers by the missionaries stationed among them . This kind of oppression has in some instances been felt ' severely . Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , it may be longer , the Samoans - were complaining of it . And . yet now we hear of Mr. STEL.NBERGER , under the folds of an Aniericafi flag , insisting that as he , too , must have revenue , the people must pay more taxes , and . that if they do not pay them willingly he will employ force to compel them . If disturbances or murder follow as will be thought extremely likely by those who know the Samoan character best , and if the name of the United States is thereby brought into disrepute , there will be no ground whatever for surprise . In a commercial point of view it is undoubtedly advisable , ? as we have often , urged , for American influence to be extended over the Pacific . The interests of our manufacturers in the East , of our farmers in the West , and of our merchants on'the Pacific ' coast , demand it . For this reason STEINBERGER 'S mission and his blundering policy are much to be regretted . The Samoan Islands are only nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque , they are of very small importance , compared with the great group of the Fijis . But if it be advisable , which we do not believe it to annex them to the United States , the annexation should have been Made openly and in the face of the world . Then the policy and position of this country would , have been plain . But , as the matter has now drifted , it is highly unsatisfactory . STEINBERGER is responsible to nobody . America has no authority in the islands he has seized , and yet he uses the American name to back up his authority , . and to cover his mieeeds with the natives . If he succeed , he will take the credit  --  and the taxes ; if he fail , America is to bear the blame . At present the prospect is that he will raise a rebellion in the place , that ho will undo much that a small , population of white men has , by patient perseverance over many years , succeeded in doing , and that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sama , ua , Bay Company did not benefit us in the West Indies , and it ought to have been a lesson that similar underhand attempts at aggrandizement are not likely to be successful anywhere . But if that lesson was not sufficient , there is every reason to think that it will receive a full indorsement at Samoa .
