costly than symbolic or specie currencies , it has supplanted them altogether . It is the only currency we have , and our people can not part with it without being forced to make exchanges in kind , - in other words , being remitted to a state of barbarism . Any plan , therefore , that assumes to provide for the retirement of our present legal-tender notes must at the same time provide another currency to take their place , and here comes in the chief difficulty in the case . How can we bring a more costly currency into use , when the one we have will accomplish precisely the same object as far as the payment of debts is concerned ? The idea almost universally prevails that this debased and depreciated currency can be brought to the specie standard without retiring it or providing any means therefor . " A people , " it is argued , " must have a certain amount of currency for their exchanges . If there be an excess , it will be at a discount ; if there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par . The true remedy in our case is to await the growth of the country , which silently but surely will soon absorb all the currency , and bring it in this way up to the standard of gold . " It would be easy to estimate the value of a currency of debt , not legal tender . It would equal that of gold , less the interest for the time it had to run . A plain note without interest due in one year would be worth six per cent less than one bearing interest at that rate . The amount of such notes outstanding would make no difference . If there were only one in a population of 40,000,000 , it would be worth no more than if there were millions of them . So long as the public were not compelled to receive them , they would take them only at their value . Now the mere declaration of the government that its notes shall be legal tender adds nothing to theIr intrinsic worth . They are paid no sooner , nor do they bear interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commerce and trade of the country shall be carried on by notes having a specified water-mark , these notes would command a higher price in the market than notes of the same tenor but without such mark , just as ships to which was given , by law , the preference in the transportation of merchandise from New York to // New Orleans would command a higher price than ships to which such preference was refused . It is a monopoly , to be sure , but the shippers must use them or be content to do nothing . The owners of the ships would reap the advantage , and the people , the producers and consumers , would suffer a corresponding loss . What one party gained the others would lose , and a great deal more , from the interference with the freedom of trade , and in the restraints and discouragement that would be put upon all kinds of industry and enterprise . All this is very plain . Legislation can do nothing to create the value of a currency . It may prescribe certain uses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , but this increase of price is bounded by the extent of territory over which it has jurisdiction . It makes no difference with a Liverpool merchant ( except to send to this country for sale ) whether a United States note offered him be legal tender or not . His first inquiry would be , " What can I do with it ? where can I get the money it calls for ? * ' One kind will pay his debt as well as another . If he took either , it would be at a rate that would make him good by its sale or by waiting its maturity . No matter how nearly the notes might approach gold in the New York market , he would sell his merchandise at a less price for the latter , as the taking of the former would always involve another transaction - sale and conversion of the note - before he could get the kind of money that would meet his case . In foreign markets , consequently , " debt of the United States without interest made into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a discount there , it will be at a discount here . If gold will pay for more abroad than United States notes , it will pay for more at home . The foreign market will always control the domestic one . Legal-tender notes , therefore , can never be brought to par anywhere unless they can be exchanged by the holder , instantly and at all times , for gold . The absurd notions that debt without interest can equal in value debt with interest , and that a promise without interest to pay gold at a certain day can be as valuable as gold in hand , are so ingrained in the popular mind as to render necessary these demonstrations , which ought to be as superfluous as teaching // the alphabet to adults . The plans to accomplish this object are of a piece with the notions themselves . The one most likely to be urged at the present session of Congress is that of Mr. John Sherman , chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance , fully detailed in that paper by the correspondent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1873 - " Mr. Sherman , " says the correspondent , " is in favor of a law which will authorize a convertible five-per-cent United States bond with the right in the government to an alternative redemption either in coin or bonds . iir . Sherman believes that i1 , as long ago as 1868 , when the subject was first proposed , Congress had authorized United States notes to be received for five-per-cent bonds at par , we should have long since been at specie payments . The notes , when received , could be paid out again to meet current expenses and for the purchase of bonds . It would be a similar reissue of notes to that which is practised by the Bank of England , our circulation being fixed at four hundred millions . In this way , when our five-per-cent bonds were worth par in gold , we should be at a specie standard . The increasing credit of the country would have brought currency to a par with gold , exactly as it has brought all forms of bonds to par , *nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be contracted would depend entirely upon the amount of currency necessary to conduct the business of the country . It seems certain , in view of the commercial conditions of the country , that all the currency now outstanding , and even four hundred millions , could be maintained in circulation on a specie standard . In view of the large reserves that are needed by the banks , and of the gold reserve of the Treasury , and of the confidence of the people in the credit of the government , it is improbable that , when the currency should have been brought to par through the advance of this new convertible liond , any considcrable sum , except in possible case of panic , would be presented for redemption " Mr. Sherman is confidcnt that such a plan would secure the elasticity of the currency which has so long been desired , and would provide for specie paymeiits without commercial embarrassments . . . " In connection with this plan , Mr. Sherman proposes no contraction of the currency . Indeed , he would seem to waive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Finance with regard to the amount of outstanding legal-tender notes , and in connection with the law authorizing the issue of this new fiveper-cent convertible bond lie would declare that the amount of the // legal-tender circulation should never exceed four hundred millions of dollars . He would m ke it lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury to issue the so-called forty-four millions legal-tender reserve , but would leave it unissaed except as necessities might require . " We had supposed magic to be an art " inhibited and out of date . " We coiifess to our mistake , for nothing short of magic - of the working of unseen agencies - could accomplish what Mr. Sherman proposes . These agencies are to be always present to inspire the government with the beneficent purpose of paying out at all times to its creditors just such money as they wish to receive ; and at the same time to inspire the creditors with a similar beneficent purpose of receiving , indifferently , just that kind which suits the convenience of government to pay , - whether it consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright shining and clear ringing coin . What a picture of perfect society is here presented ! - a society in which governor and governed are always eager each to sacrifice itself on the altar of the other 's good . The intercourse between them is a never-ending round of courteous " salaams , " with , " Sir , please take the precedence " ; or , in Oriental phrase , and with graceful and expressive wave of the hand , " All that you see is yours . " That nothing might mar this delightful picture , the currency is to be fixed at the exact maximum of $400,000,000 . Between this amount and the minimum that would be needed in dull tines there would be , like the tides , an eternal ebb and flow . If money happened to be too plentiful to command a fair rate of interest in the open market , then the government would kindly step in and pay such interest by issuing its bonds therefor . If scarce , then it would return this money to the needy holders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum . The wind would always be tempered to the shorn lamb . Our currency would always be at par , always be flexible , - just enough and never too much ; and , better than all , it would not , for the whole $400,000,000 , cost the country a penny , except the expense of turning the spit ! We are a great country ! Our territories extend from the source of the Father of Waters to its mouth ; from the cold of the frozen circle to the burning heats of the torrid zone ; from // the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean . On one shore , we salute the rising sun ; on the other , we catch its latest beams . These boundaries embrace 3,603,884 square miles , - 300,000 miles more than the whole area of Europe . Within them is every product known to man ; a wealth in the precious metals that figures can not count ; rivers that could their venue be changed would reach from the British Channel to the Sea of Okliotsk ; lakes in which England itself would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamed Greece and Rome in their palmiest days ; mountains that make Ossa a wart ; and a people , - the Corning Race ! Will any one have the hardihood to say that the promises , to the amount of only $400,000,000 , without interest , and payable at a distant day , of such a people , backed by such illimitable resources , are not worth their face in paltry gold ? Certainly it argues great presumption to differ from so many millions . Though silenced by the assembled wisdom of the past , Galileo muttered , " It still moves " ; and we must be allowed to mutter our disbelief that something can be made out of nothing , or that a promise never to mature , and without interest , to pay gold , can ever be made equal in value to gold in hand . The plan of Mr. Boutwell , late Secretary of the Treasury and now Senator in Congress , differs somewhat from that of Mr. Sherman . We prefer to let him state it in his own language . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1872 , " two efficient and certain ways of placing the country in a condition where specie and paper will possess the same commercial value . By diminishing the amount of paper in circulation , the difference between the commercial value of paper and coin will diminish , and by pursuing this policy the difference will disappear altogether . " All legislation limited in its operation to the paper issues of the banks and of the government , whether bearing interest or not , and which shall tend to diminish the market value of coin , will be found , on analysis , to contain a plan for contracting the value of paper currency , and all legislation so limited which does not contain such plan will prove ineffectual . " Accepting this proposition , and believing that the country is not prepared to sustain the policy of contraction , it only remains for me // to consider the means by which the value of the currency may be improved . " The basis of a policy of improvement must be found in a sturdy refusal to add to the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially , as coin . This being accepted as the settled purpose of the country , there can be no permanent increase of the difference between paper and coin , and an opportunity will be given for the influence of natural causes tending on the whole to a better financial condition . " We may count , first , among these the increase of population and its distribution over new fields of business . Secondly , in the South especially the number of persons having property and using and holding money will increase . Next we may anticipate a more general use of paper in Texas and the Pacific States , by which , practically , for the rest of the country , the volume of the currency will be diminished and the quantity of coin increased , - two facts tending to produce an equality of value . " The influences of these natural causes will be counteracted in sonic degree by the increasing facility for the transfer of money from one point to another , and the greater use of bank checks and certificates of deposit . The rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time of production is another agency of the same sort . Giving to these views their full weight , I am prepared to say that the experience of the last three years coincides with the best judgment I can form , and warrants the opinion that , under the influence of existing natural causes , our financial condition will gradually improve . . " I anticipate , also , that the burdens of assumption will rest upon the government . There are now more than nineteen hundred banks in the country , and I can not imagine a condition of things so favorable for a period of years as will enable them at all times to redeem their notes in specie only . Without proceeding to the discussion of the subject in detail , I think all will have been gained of value when the treasury shall be prepared to pay the demand-notes of the government in coin , and the banks shall be prepared to pay their notes either in ecia or in legal-tender notes ; and then our good fortune will clearly appear in this , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor exclusively of United States notes . " It is unnecessary further to dwell upon the absorption theory which Mr. Boutwell , in common with so many distinguished statesmen and financiers , holds . Neither will our space allow // us to enter upon the new field he opens before us in his report , and discuss the existence or extent of those " counteracting influences to an equalization of currency and gold which exist in the increased facility for the transfers of money from one point to another ; in the greater use of bank checks and certificates of deposit , and in the more rapid transit of merchandise , bringing the period of its consumption nearer to the time of its production . " The extent of these " counteracting " influences , however potent they may be , can , fortunately , be easily tested by the enactment of a law which shall forbid altogether the use of checks and certificates of deposit , and which shall prohibit money to move from point to point at a rate more rapid than twenty miles , or merchandise at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As no time should be lost in our present situation , we suggest that Mr. Boutwell , during the present Congress , bring in a bill with provisions which shall test the correctness of his views . If we do not fully coincide with him as to the existence or the extent of the " counteracting influences " urged by him as opposing the recovery of the country , we are most happy to concur with him in his opinion that " much will be gained when the Treasury shall be prepared to pay the demand-notes of the government in coin , and the banks shall be prepared to pay their notes entire , either in coin or legal-tender notes . " But when such a happy day shall come , we do not now see the reason that we shall then have to rejoice " that our paper currency is not exclusively of national banknotes , nor exclusively of United States notes . " Another mode of retiring the currency is that proposed by Mr. Sumner , and is what may be termed the squeezing process . It provides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government shall issue compound-interest legaltenders payable in three years ; the interest , in gold , to be payable at their maturity . These notes when first issued will , it is assumed , go into circulation , and for a time take the place of the plain ones that have been retired . As the interest accrues they will gradually be taken out of circulation , and the currency retired in like ratio . It is a sufficient objection to this plan that it covers only one half the ground . It seeks to retire our currency without any // steps for the creation of another in its place . Were Mr. Sumner 's bill to become a law , the public would be indifferent till the pressure came , when it would be too late , in the disturbance and disorganization which would follow , to take any such steps ; so that when the interest notes fell due , the country would be in a much more unfavorable position to enter upon the work of resumption than when they were issued . An inadequate attempt which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than none at all . Such arc three methods proposed for the resumption of payments . They are , however , the epitome of the whole , whose name is legion . The distinguished position of these gentlemen entitles us to consider their views as the most advanced thought yet reached in this country upon this subject . That they are utterly inadequate and futile has , we think , been fully shown . It is a subject the crust of which not a member of Congress or of the government seems to have penetrated . Even the history of other countries has been wholly neglected , - histories which , if properly studied , would have thrown abundant light upon our condition , and indicated the way out of the difficulties that surround us . The precedent that comes nearest to our case is to be found in the financial experience of England . From the accession of the Stuart dynasty , the coins which had been roughly executed by the shears and hammer had , by constant " clipping , " come to be reduced nearly one half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender at their nominal value , they worked an evil so serious as to threaten the disorganization of society . A remedy was sought by milling the edges of the coins , by which clipping was in a great measure prevented . But no matter how fast the mint worked , or how fast the milled pieces came forth , the latter obstinately refused to go into circulation alongside the debased pieces . They were *mi* ediately melted down , or transported to other countries , so that no progress whatever wa made in correcting an evil which had wellnigh become insupportable . rF1*c politicians of that agc , " s* ys Macaulay , in his graphic picture of it , " marvelled exceedingly that everybody should be so perverse // as to use light money in preference to good money . In other words , they marvelled that nobody chose to pay twelve ounces of silver when ten ounces would serve the turn . The horse at the Tower still paced his rounds ; fresh wagon-loads of choice money still came forth from the mill ; and still it vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; great masses were exported ; great masses were hoarded ; but scarcely one new piece was found in the till of the shop or in the leathern bag which the farmer carried home from the cattle-fair . In the receipts and payments of the exchequer the milled money did not exceed ten shillings in the hundred pounds . A writer of that age mentions the case of a merchant who in the sum of thirty-four pounds received only a single half-crown in milled silver . " The evils produced by this state of the currency were not such as have generally heen thought worthy to occupy a prominent place in history . Yet it may well he doubted whether all the misery which had been inflicted on the English nation in a quarter of a century by bad kings , bad ministers , bad Parliaments , and bad judges was equal to the misery caused in a single year by bad crowns and bad shillings . Those events which furnish the best themes for pathetic or indignant eloquence are not always those which most affect the happiness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and James , gros as it had been , had not prevented the common business of life from going steadily nd prosperously on . While the honor and independence of the state were sold to a foreign power , while chartered rights were invaded , while fundamental laws were violated , hundreds of thousands of quiet , honest , and industrious families labored and traded , ate their meals , and lay down to rest , in comfort and security . Whether Whigs or Tories , Protestants or Jesuits , were uppermost , the grazier drove his beasts to market , the grocer weighed out his currants , the draper measured out his broadcloth , the hum of buyers and sellers was as loud as ever in the towns ; the harvest-home was celebrated as joyously as ever in the hamlets , the cream overflowed the pails of Cheshire , the apple-juice foamed in the presses of Herefordshire , the piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces of the Trent , and the harrows of coal rolled fast along the timber railways of the Tyne . But when the great instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , were smitten as with a palsy . " Since the Revolution the state of the currency had been repeatedly discussed in Parliament . In 1689 a committee of the Commons had been appointed to investigate the subject , but had // made no report . In 1690 another committee had reported that iminense quantities of silver were carried out of the country by Jews , who , it was said , would do anything for profit . Schemes were formed for encouraging the importation and discouraging the exportation of the precious metals . One foolish bill after another was brought in and dropped . At length , in the beginning of the year 169* , the question assumed so serious an aspect that the houses applied themselves to it in earnest . The only practical result of their deliberations , however , was a new penal law , which , it was hoped , would prevent the clipping of the hammered coin and the melting and exporting of the milled coin . It was enacted that every person who informed against a clipper should be entitled to a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two clippers should be entitled to a pardon ; and that whoever should be found in possession of silver filings or parings should be burned in the cheek with a red-hot iron . Certain officers were employed to search for bullion . If bullion were found in a house or on hoard of a ship , the burden of proving that it had never been part of the money of the realm was thrown on the owner . If he failed in making out a satisfactory account of every ingot , he was liable to severe penalties . This act was , as might have been expected , altogether ineffective . During the following summer and autumn the coin went on dwindling , and the cry of distress from every county in the realm became louder and more piercing . " But happily for England there were among her rulers some who clearly perceived that it was not by halters and branding-irons that her decaying industry and commerce could be restored to health . The state of the currency had during some time occupied the serious attention of four eminent men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were politicians who had never , in the midst of official and parliamentary business , ceased to love and honor philosophy ; and two were philosophers in whom habits of abstruse meditation had not impaired the homely good sense without which even genius is mischievous in politics . Never had there been an occasion which more urgently required both practical and speculative abilities ; and never had the world seen the highest practical and the highest speculative abilities united in an alliance so close , so harmonious , and so honorable as that which bound Somers and Montague to Locke and Newton . " In whatever way the restoration of the coin might be effected , great sacrifices must be made , either by the whole community or by a part of the community . And to call for such sacrifices at a time // when the nation was at war , and was already paying taxes such as ten years before no financier would have thought it possible to raise , was undoubtedly a course full of danger . Timorous politicians were for delay ; but the deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hazarded , or that everything was lost . Montague , in particular , is said to have expressed in strong language his determination to kill or cure 1f indeed , there had been any hope that the evil would merely continue to be what it was , it might have been wise to defer till the return of peace an experiment which must severely try the strength of the body politic . But the evil was one which daily made progress , almost visible to the eye . There might have been a recoina*e in 1694 with half the risk which must be run in 1696 , and great as would be the risk in 1696 , that risk would be doubled if the recoinage were postponed till 1698 . " Those politicians whose voice was for delay gave less trouble than another set of politicians who were for a general and immediate recoinage , but who insisted that the new shilling should be worth only ninepence or ninepence halfpenny . At the head of this party was William Lowudes , Secretary of the Treasury , a most respectable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of his office than in the higher parts of political philosophy . He was not in the least aware that a piece of metal with the king 's head on it was a commodity of which the price was governed by the same laws which govern the price of a piece of metal fashioned into a spoon or a buckle , and that it was no more in the power of Parliament to make the kingdom richer by calling a crown a pound than to make the kingdom larger by calling a furlong a mile . He seriously believed , incredible as it may seem , that if the ounce of silver were divided into seven shillings instead of five , foreign nations would sell us their wines and their silks for a smaller number of ounces . He had a considerable following , composed partly of dull men who really believed what he told them , and partly of shrewd men who were perfectly willing to be authorized by law to pay a hundred pounds with eighty . Had his arguments prevailed , the evils of a vast confiscation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted the nation , public credit , still in its tender and sickly infancy , would have been destroyed , and there would have been much risk of a general mutiny of the fleet and army . Happily Lowudes was completely refuted by Locke in a paper drawn up for the use of Somers . Somers was delighted with this little treatise , and desired that it might be printed . It speedily became the text-book of all the most enlightened politicians in the kingdom , and may still be read with pleasure and profit . " // The pian for relief finally adopted provided that the money of the kingdom should be recoined according to the old standard of weight and fineness ; that all the pieces should be " milled , " and that the loss on the clipped pieces should be borne by the public . A time was fixed after which no clipped money should pass , except in payments to the government , and a later time after which no clipped money should be passed at all . To make up in part the loss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the security of the window-tax , to advance to the government ? 1,200,000 . This advance afforded only partial relief . Full relief could only be had when the new currency should come in sufficient abundance to fill up the vacuum made by calling in the old . " Saturday , the 2d of May , 1696 , " continued Mr. Macaulay , " had been fixed as the last day on which the clipped crowns , half-crowns , and shillings were to be received by tale in payment of taxes . rpj*0 Exchequer was besieged from dawn till midnight by an immense mu4titude . It was necessary to call in the guards for the purpose of keeping order . On the following Monday began a cruel agony of a few months , which was destined to be succeeded by many years of almost unbroken prosperity . " Most of the old silver had vanished . The new silver had scarcely made its appearance . About four millions sterling in ingots and hammered coin was lying in the vaults of the Exchequer ; and the milled money as yet came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthiest and most enlightened kingdom in Europe would be reduced to the state of those barbarous societies in which a mat is bouiTht with a hatchet , and a pair of moccasins with a piece of venison. rfhere were , indeed , some hammered pieces which had escaped mutilation ; and sixpences not clipped within the innermost ring were still current . this old money and the new money together made up a scanty stock of silver , which , with the help of gold , was to carry the nation through the summer . The manufacturers generally continued , though with extreme difficulty , to pay their workmen in coin . The upper classes seem to have lived to a great extent on credit , Even an opulent man seldom had the means of discharging the weekly bills of his baker and butcher . A promissory-note , however , subscribed by such a man , was readily taken in the district where his means and character were well known . The notes of the wealthy money-changers of Lombard Street circulated widely . The paper of the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible to procure silver to meet every claim which was made on them in good faith . They then bethought them of a new expedient . They made a call of twenty per cent on the proprietors , and thus raised a sum which enabled them to give pvery applicant fifteen per cent in milled money on what was due to him . They returned him his bank-note , after making a minute upon it that part had been paid . A few notes thus marked are still preserved among the archives of the bank , as memorials of that terrible year . The paper of the corporation continued to circulate ; but the value fluctuated violently from day to day , and indeed from hour to hour ; for the public mind was in so excitable a state that the most absurd lie which a stock-jobber could invent sufficed to send the price up or down . At one time the discount was only six per cent , at another time twenty-four * cent . A ten-pound note , which had been taken in the morning as worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds before night . " Meanwhile , strenuous exertions were making to hasten the recoinage . Since the Restoration , the mint had , like every other public establishment in the kingdom , been a nest of idlers and jobbers . The important office of warden , worth between six and seven hundred a year , had become a mere sinecure , and had been filled by a succession of fine gentlemen who were well known at the hazardtable at Whitehall , but who never condescended to come near the Tower . This office had just become vacant , and Montague had ohf&amp;ned it for Newton . The ability , the industry , and the strict uprightness of the great philosopher speedily produced a complete revolution throughout the department which was under his direction . He devoted himself to his task with an activity which left him no time to spare for those pursuits in which he had surpassed Archimedes and Galileo . Till the great work was completely done , he resisted firmly , and almost angrily , every attempt that was made by men of science , either here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his official duties . The old officers of the mint had thought it a great feat to coin silver to the amount of fifteen thousand pounds a week . When Montague talked of thirty or forty thousand , these men of form and precedent pronounced the thing impracticable . But the energy of the young Chancellor of the Exchequer and of his friend the warden accomplished far greater wonders . Soon nineteen mills were going at once in the Tower . As - fast as men could be trained to the work in London , bands of them were sent off to other parts of the kingdom . Mints were established at Bristol , York , Exeter , Norwich , // and Chester . This arrangement was in the highest degree popular . The machinery and the workmen were welcomed to the new stations with the ringing of bells and the firing of guns . The weekly issue increased to sixty thousand pounds , to eighty thousand , to a hundred thousand , and at length to a hundred and twenty thousand . Yet even this issue , though great , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when compared with the demands of the nation . Nor did all tbe newly stampQd silver pass into circulation ; for during the summer and autumn those politicians who were for raising the denomination of the coin were active and clamorous ; and it was generally expected that , as soon as Parliament should reassemble , the standard would be lowered . Of course , no person who thought it probable that he should at a day not far distant be able to pay a debt of a pound with t.hree crown pieces instead of four was willing to part with a crown piece till that day arrived . Most of the milled pieces were , therefore , hoarded . May , June , and July passed away without any perceptible increase in the quantity of good money . It was not till August that the keenest observer could discern the first faint signs of returning prosperity . " Great as was England 's peril , it was nothing to our own . A few millions sterling measured the whole amount of her currency , and more than half the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a currency of $ 700,000,000 , - all debt . How is the capital to take the place of this vast sum to be provided ? Have we a Somers and a Montague , exalted statesmen , to unite with a Newton and a Locke , philosophers of immortal fame , to devise the way , and guide the nation safely and triumphantly through its great trial ? Even if such men could be found ,  --  and who can believe it possible ? - can we hope for a government sufficiently enlightened , courageous , and stable to sustain them under the ol ) loquy , clamor , and opposition that is sure to be encountered , and of the terrible distress which must be created in passing from the old condition to the new ? In view of all these discouragements , does not the heart of every thoughtful man sink within him when he sees danger so imminent on one hand , with such ignorance , incompetency , and indifference on the other ? The first step toward reform is the education of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon this subject // the trapper at the sources of the Missouri is just as intelligent as are cabinet ministers , venerable senators , or merchant princes . The latter , in a solemn memorial just addressed by the New York Chamber of Commerce to Congress , have informed that august body that - " We have reached ( in the recent crisis ) the verge of success in bringing gold and currency to p r with each other ; and it apparently needs only the announcement of the Secretary of the Treasury that legal-tenders will he paid in gold , at an early day , to annul the difference between them . " When legal.tenders are made as good as gold , will the people be less tenacious of them than now l Is it not more improbable that they will leave the diversified channels of trade and flow into the Treasury for resumption , than it is that the blood will forsake our veins and remain in the heart l Are the people so ignorant of what concerns their welfare as to forget that all are embarked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our monetary system l If our people are rightly instructed by the press , and doubt and unbelief are not made to take the place of trust and hope , your memorialists are confident that the amount of gold required to perform the work of resumption is greatly overestimated , and that all calculations based upon the experience of small and thickly settled countries must necessarily be at fault . " It is pleasant to witness such faith in human nature . It is a sentiment shared in by the good alone . But currency it strikes us , is a question of science , not of morals . The worthy gentleman who drew the memorial makes - we beg his pardon , is competent to make - a good note . Let him make two , one for one hundred thousand dollars due in ninety days , with interest at seven per cent ; the other for a like sum , without interest , and payable at his pleasure , and see which will go best . We are prepared to wager a thousand dollars to a cent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better of human nature for knowing the difference between substance and sham . Does not the same law apply to the obligations of government ? Can it hope to make its notes without interest , and due at its pleasure , equal to notes with interest or capital in hand ? If it can , then are we on the high road to unbounded prosperity . If not , then are we certainly on the high road to utter ruin . // The hardest lesson in the world to learn is , that cost and worth mean the same thing . Ever since the creation has man been devising some method to get round this law . For ages alchemy did its best , but failed to make the connection between wish and fruition . Mr. Chase 's alchemy worked well up to a certain point . It gave the nation a plenty of " money made out of debt " ; but as this came in floods , " money made out of capital " fled from us in like ratio , leaving a sort of underlying consciousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the substance . Alchemy is again invoked to our aid , to invest this shadow with the attributes of reality . Mr. Sherman 's alchemy is considerate and forbearing relations between the government and the governed ; Mr. Boutwell 's , a less rapid movement of merchandise and money ; that of the Chamber of Commerce of New York , faith in human nature . These are the specifics of men in exalted positions . As we descend the scale every one in the line has his own , equally plausible , with alchemy of some sort as the groundwork of all . One of the most common phrases used iii the discussion of this subject is " credit currency . " There may be such a currency ; in fact , our own is such but a credit currency never was , and never can be , a convertible one . It is impossible for government to issue a convertible currency , for the reason that governments never were , and never will be , organized for the purpose of lending capital . They will never have capital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency it may issue to par is to accumulate sufficient means for its payment , - payment and retirement to the last dollar . There is no other way , and any attempt to find an easier one only serves to put off the day of reckoning and to aggravate the penalty that must certainly be paid . Another phrase in still more common use is " the necessity of a flexible currency " to meet the demand caused by the moving of the crops toward the close of the year . We have already shown that , were we on a specie basis , no such want would be felt , as we should have two currencies , one of symbols , rising and falling in amount with the amount of merchandise , and the other of specie in the hands of the people , always available for any emergency , like a balance-wheel whose accu // mulated power is always sufficient to carry the machinery over the dead point . Were an attempt made to render our *present currency " flexible " by an extraordinary issue at certain periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately adapt itself to the increase , so that any attempt to reclaim it would be attended by precisely the same consequences that would now follow an attempt to take in , say $50,000,000 of our legal-tender notes . Should an attempt be made to render the currency really flexible by retiring large quantities issued for this purpose , with the rapidity with which they were put into circulation , certain destruction , instead of the mitigated evil of au insufficient currency , would stare the nation in the face . Why can not the government now retire its outstanding notes ? Because the business of the country has adjusted itself to their present amount . It will be just as difficult , at any time , to retire an equal amount issued to render the currency " flexible . " Flexibility could never by any possibility mean contraction , but always expansion . People never talk of having too much currency ; it is always that they have too little . It is in the nature of things that the greater the amount of a currency of debt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the moment of its issue it appears to be plenty from the sudden disproportion of the instruments to the means of expenditure ; but prices will rise so rapidly under the new stimulant that the equilibrium between the two will be speedily restored . So soon as this result is reached , the whole effect of the issue is lost . As it is debt , the community is impoverished in a degree equal to its amount . As prices , so long as it is outstanding , will not fall , the means of the great mass , which are always nearly stationary , will purchase only two thirds or three quarters of the accustomed amount . In their distress , they remember the pleasant sen*ation caused by the last tonic , and see no relief but in more of the same kind . The next issue brings less relief ; but as it largely increases the disproportion of their means and their necessities , the cry of " scarce money " will become louder and louder , only to be satisfied by a new issue , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and frequency of his cups . // Another delusion , almost universally shared in , is that our currency of debt approximates in value to gold as it approximates in price . The near approach of the two at any one time is purely accidental . This currency has been issued twelve years . It was the instrument for making a forced loan , - a " benevolence " from the people . A person who twelve years ago took and held six-per-cent United States bonds has , by compounding the interest , doubled his money . If , at the same time , he took and held , in place of a bond , a United States note , he has received not a penny from it . If he shall be compelled to hold the note for twelve years to come for payment , it would he worth its face , less interest for that time , or thirty-eight per cent of its par value . The value at any time of a United States note is par , less interest to the day of its maturity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their enforced use gives them at home a fictiti&amp;us value . Their real value , however , is the same , whether they be at a discount of ten or of fifty per cent . Should government pass a law making them redeemable on the 1st day of January , 1884 , their market value would then undoubtedly fall one half , as such declaration would go far to disclose their real nature , - debt without interest . The public having one element for the calculation would not be slow to supply the other , and the notes would soon come to be regarded as government bonds without interest , and would sell at their real value , plus the accidental attributes due to them as legal tender . Gold and debt are as wide apart as the poles , and the idea that they can be made identical by any process but by payment is too absurd to be entertained by any sane man . Gold will always have the value of gold , while debt may not be worth the paper on which it is written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this uncertainty as to their value . They are never due . For a period of twelve years no steps have been made toward retiring them . None may be taken for the next twelve . Gold to-day may be at one hundred and ten ; no one would be surprised to see it at one hundred and twenty a month hence . For all purposes of trade and commerce , the value of the whole px*perty of the nation has undergone a similar change . The // worst possible standard of values is the degree of faith which is attached to the securities of a government . There might be some sense iii making a thirty-year United States six percent bond legal tender , because its fluctuation in price would be very slight . Every one would know that such a bond meant semi-annual interest , and payment at its maturity . There would be something solid and tangible about it . But what is the value of a bond without interest payable at pleasure , - a bond which no one believes will be paid in the next ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It defies all calculation . The more we speculate upon its value the more bewildered do we become , till at last there is no standard but a disordered imagination , surging with fearful violence till the patient becomes utterly exhausted , when the whole fabric of the currency falls in ruin to the ground . Of one thing we may rest assured , that in all matters of currency we are dealing with natural laws which we can neither circumvent nor overturn . As our currency is false in principle , the time will come when our people will refuse to use it , in spite of statute-books , Fourth-of July orations , or the size of our country . They will , in the end , select the best method in currency , as in the mechanic arts . The recent financial storm which has swept over the country is a warning which , unless speedily heeded , will be followed by others still more terrible , enfeebling and demoralizing our industries to such a degree that the reform will not come by payment but by repudiation . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will discover the seriousness of our present system and apply the remedies while they have the strength to carry themselves triumphantly through the crisis that awaits them . The currency issued by the government now amounts to $ 400,000,000 . There is nothing behind this but the pittance in the Treasury , which should not be reduced . The means for its retirement , therefore , must be provided wholly by taxation . Unfortunately our revenues are falling off so rapidly that a considerable deficit is probable for 1874 and 1875 . Any plan of reform , therefore , must be accompanied by increase of taxes in the very face of the difficulties and embarrassments that are // certain to arise the moment a reform of the currency is attempted . We have lost precious years of overflowing revenues . In the last four years $ 383,627,783 of debt in the form of bonds has been retired . Could a portion of this vast sum have been accumulated as a reserve , we might by this time have been far on the way toward specie payments . The banks have issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their retirement they have about $400,000,000 in government bonds , locked up in Washington . The payment of their bills receivable would retire their notes , but , under the present system , would leave them without any capital in hand but their reserved profits . Instead of being banks , they would be mere skeletons of banks . Any scheme for resumption , therefore , must involve a modification of our present system in all its essential features . As it stands it is the most cunning contrivance ever devised to render an issue of convertible currency impossible . The capital of our banks is now deposited in the public treasury , with a provision that it is to be used only to pay off their debts when they are in liquidation . One of the first steps toward resumption , therefore , must be to allow them to withdraw and use their bonds without the retIrement of their notes , in order to provide the means not only for such retirement , but for providing capital to lend . But unfortunately these bonds could not at present , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the very good reason that such capital does not exist . It is to be feared that their sale abroad , for the purpose of importing the means of resumption , would instantly array the whole commercial world against us , and precipitate the ruin already staring us in the face . Should an attempt be made to retire one currency without the provision of another to take its place , we may be brought to a dead lock and be compelled " to exchange a mat for a hatchet , and a pair of moccasitis for a piece of venison . " Goveminent , however , can supply no currency but coin to take the place of its notes ; and this coin , unfortunately , will not enter into circulation till its notes are in a great measure retired , or till they cease to be legal tender . The currency to take their place as far as any vacuum remains to be filled must be wholly // supplied by banks , both State and national . To encourage their organization under State laws , the tax upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as they can be realized upon , will give the national banks the means of supplying a convertible currency . These should be required to accumulate annually reserves in coin equalling at least ten per cent of their liabilities . Government should immediately begin the accumulatioii of similar reserves . It should also declare that its notes , at a certain day , should cease to be legal tender , except in contracts entered into up to that date . Such provisions would add immediately and largely to the value of money , - of capital . To meet this increased demand , industry and economy would take the place of the idleness and extravagance which have so long prevailed . We have for a long series of years expended beyond our means . We must make up the loss by earning more than we spend . This single sentence states the whole method of resumption . It is not important here to speculate upon the amount of coin necessary for us to possess as a basis of resumption . We shall ascertain the quantity after we have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right direction . We may be able to learn something from other nations , although we shall probably continue to make greater use of a currency of symbols than any other . M. Victor Bonnet , an eminent French authority in matters of currency and finance , in an article in the Revue des Deux Miondes for November 1 , states the amount of silver coin in circulation in France and in its mint to be $ 300,000,000 , while the coinage of this metal is going on at the rate of $25,000,000 annually . The gold coin in circulation he estimates at $ 800,000,000 , making a total metallic currency , for that country , of $1,100,000,000 ; and that , too , after the payment of the German indemnity of $ 1,000,000,000 ! The bids for the loan of $ 750,000,000 brought out in France in the summer of 1872 equalled $ 8,000,000,000 , a sum very nearly four times the amount of the public debt of the United States ! These figures , for quality , match Niagara and the Mississippi , and should qualify our conceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theme . // M. Bonnet also states that the silver coin in circulation in Germany equals $480,000,000 , while its recent gold coinage ( largely drawn from the French payment ) amounts to $296 ,  - -  000,000 . In England the amount of coin in circulation outside of the Bank of England , which holds $ 100,000,000 , is estimated at $ 500,000,000 . We shall need at least an equal sum . The amount now held in this country , in all hands , can not exceed $ 150,000,000 . We must accumulate , therefore , an additional sum of $ 350,000,000 before we can safely attempt a final resumption . Our mines annually produce about $60,000,000 . Could their whole product be retained at home , we could be sure of the required amount in six years . We have for the last ten years exported $52,604,278 over our imports. * This drain will be instantly stopped the moment the banks and the government commence , in earnest , the accumulation of adequate specie reserves . It has been our purpose , however , in this article , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convertible currencies , and the falseness of our own , not to set out skilfully drawn plans and methods for reform . The right ones will present themselves fast enough after we have acquired the means of resumption . The acquisition of such means will perhaps be found the easiest part of the whole matter . The great difficulty in the way , and it is an almost insurmountable one , is to teach our people that any reform is needed ; and secondly , that such reform is not to be gained by magic or sleight of hand , but by genuine hard work . It is astonishing * The imports and exports of coin and bullion into and from the United States for the past ten years has been as follows - Years Imports . *xports. 1863 $ 9,584,105 $ 55,993,561 1864 , 13,115,612 100,321,731 1865 , 9,810,072 64,618,124 1866 , 10,700,092 s2,643,374 1867 , 22,070,475 54,976,196 1868 , 14,188368 84,197,920 1869 19,807,876 42,915,966 1870 , 26,419,179 43,883,802 1871 21,270,024 84,403,359 1872 13,743,689 72,798,240 $ 160,709,492 $ 686,752,273 // to see a nation utterly lost to sense and reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obvious to the commonest understanding .
