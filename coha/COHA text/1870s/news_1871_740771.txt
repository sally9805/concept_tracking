txt The Court of Appeals has just rendered a decision that will very materially affect certain office-holders in this City . It has decided that the Legislature has no power to extend the term of office of any official elected . by the people beyond the time for which he was elected . The question came before the Court on the relation of N. HILL FOWLER , who , in 1868 , was elected Justice of the Eighth Judicial District of this City , and who was refused possession of the office by the then incumbent . W. H. BALL , who was . elected in 1860 for six years , but whose term of office had been extended three years longer by act of the Legislature . The Court of Appeals now decides that the Legislature has no power to extend the term of an elective officer ; that if it could extend the term three years , it could extend it ten years , or for life , and thus defeat the provision of the Constitution which guarantees to the people the right of electing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of officeholders , by act of the Legislature , has been . resorted to quite frequently of late years . and if it is unconstitutional , as is now declared , the corrective influence of the law can not be too quickly applied . The effect of the decision in this City is highly important : It will be recollected that the last Legislature extended the term of the Aldermen and Assistant Aldermen , which would have expired in May of next year , to the let of January , 1873 . It also extended the term of the Corporation Counsel till January , 1873 , after which it authorized . the Mayor to appoint that official . The term of the Surrogate was also extended , by the Legislature of 1870 , from three to six years . All these officials would now appear to be holding their positions on an illegal tenure , and will bo obliged to vacate their offices or to submit their claims to re-election to the people . With the exception of Judge HUTCHINGS , the Surrogate , who has administered his office to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelection will be very slim .
