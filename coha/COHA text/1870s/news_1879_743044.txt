txt This Spring is witnessing a brisk " movement in real estate " in this City and on the Lower Hudson , but it is a well-known fact that the large places above the Highlands are almost a drug in the market . Here , if anywhere in America , a country gentry class might be found . The houses are large n , nd roomy. with modern conveniences ; the grounds will often equal those of many well-known English country houses , with fine trees and.well-kept lawns , large groves , a wide sweep of meadow , and unequaled views of river and mountain . There is nothing apparently here to pre- vent the residence of a wealthy class of American country gentlemen , who could have much pleasant society among themselves , and create a kind of conservative element especially needed in our American life . Tho material conditions seem to be present . The distance to the metropolitan City is not too great to prevent guests coming . freely , and to permit a short season in town in the Spring months . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the country is to be found among the owners of these properties . The Schuyler and Van Rensselaer and Vorplanck families still possess , in certain branches , considerable tracts on the Hudson ; and the Livingstons , who have preserved or gained more wealth than most of our historical families , still retain largo estates on the river , as well as in other parts of the State . The houses and places of these families , as well as of many other wealthier , such as those of the Astors , would seem to form a good basis for a rural society of country gentlemen and ladies . Yet , with all this , there is hardly a locality on the river where there is , through the year , a really pleasant and lively rural society among wealthy families or people of much intercourse in the world . There are plenty of towns with more or less of social life , and villages with village life , and Summer giresorts with the visiting and gayety of the city transferred there during the Summer months . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and guests come and depart , and there is a genuine country life , such as the early chronicles of the Hudson describe , we hardly know of one . The grand places are almost unsalable . Several above the Highlands have been turned into brick-yards ; some will be cut up and sold in village lots ; the owners of somo have given up their parks for timber-cutting ; others are simply a burden of two or three thousand dollars a year on their proprietors for support . One superb place , looking into the opening of the Highlands , with grounds and views not surpassed in Europe or America , has just been offered for a mere fraction of its value$75,000 ? and will probably be swallowed up by that lover of rural scenery , Mr. JAY GO , IILD . The same condition of things exists in other parts of this State and in other States of the Union . That is to gay , anything like the life of the colonial country gentleman , - or of the English rural families now , has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise in the Western . The reasons are obvious . No political weight is acquired by a rich family . residing long in this country in a particular district . In fact , many a country gentleman would often achieve success sooner in a town , especially if he happen to belong to the party of the minority in the country . The local offices are of very little account , and are usually won by persons more familiar with the ordinary voters . Even if gained , they are thankless places , and are accepted as duties rather than as steps to honors . Then , a country life through the year on the Upper Hudson has its practical difficulties . There is usually a hegira of servants in the Autumn to town , and then begin the perplexities of housekeeping . After this come the troubles with lighting , water , drainage , roads , and the endless annoyances of a badly-administered village . Then , in the Winter , the fleeing away of most families to the City , and a somewhat solitary season . With this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching , society , galleries , and all the attractions of town . The Summer , too , is hot , and not stimulating to the health , and the Spring late and cold . The country-seat gradually finds a competitor in such resorts as Newport and Long Branch , and the families of the wealthy discover that they can have a cottage in such places , or oven take a trip to Europe , for about what it costs to keep up a largo establishment on the Upper Hudson . So , for those and many similar reasons , the old country-seats are one by one abandoned , left to gardeners and servants , or are sold at a sacrifice , and no new owners take the place of the old in the social life of the rural districts . Some of the families live abroad ; others spend the Winter in New-York and the Summer at Newport or in Europe ; and the representatives of the historical families gradually sink out of view in the counties where their fathers lived with honor , and at length are almost unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a similar transition is going on throughout Europe . The cities absorb society . Public life and the conveniences and pleasures of towns attract from the old quiet and regular country life . The country gentry are passing away .
