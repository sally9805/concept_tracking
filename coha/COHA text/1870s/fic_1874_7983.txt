Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : VI .  --  THE HAND , AND ITS WORK . from Manners ( 1874 ) The hand  --  what wondrous wisdom planned This instrument so near divine ? How impotent , without the hand , Proud Reason 's light would shine ! Invention might his powers apply , And Genius see the forms of heaven , And firm Resolve his strength might try ; But vain the will , the soul , the eye : Unquarried would the marble lie , The oak and cedar flout the sky , Had not the hand been given . The frost 's ice-breath the seas may block , And earthquake 's arm the mountains shake , The lightning 's eye dissolve the rock , The heaving breast of waters break A pathway through the solid land : No form that Nature 's force could take Such changes in the world would make As doth the human hand . Its slender palm the forest clears , And sows the nurturing grain ; The harvest springs , the vine appears , And pastures dot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowling beasts will venture nigh ; They feel their Maker 's stern command , And yield to man the cultured land . Then cities lift their stately spires , And orchards bloom , and household fires Are kindled up with song and glee ; And art and taste their riches pour ; And strong , swift ships have bridged the sea : While nations meet on either shore , Like neighbors stepp 'd from door to door ; And savage hands , whose work was strife , Now clasped in social compact , prove Justice and peace may govern life , If man his work perform in love . Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : While thus to ceaseless task-work doomed to make the world his own from Manners ( 1874 ) While thus to ceaseless task-work doomed to make the world his own , Lest , in the struggle , sense should drag the spirit from its throne , Woman 's warm heart and gentle hand , in God 's eternal plan , Were formed to soften , soothe , refine , exalt , and comfort man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fount above , And rule him , as the angels rule , by deeds of peace and love . And so the tender mother lays on her soft nurturing breast , With loving hand , her infant son , and lulls him to his rest ; And dries his tears , and cheers his smiles , and , by her wise control , She checks his wayward moods , and wakes the seraph in his soul ; And when life 's work commands him forth , no more to dwell with her , She points him to the Hand that saved the sinking mariner , And broke the bread for famished men , and bids him trust that stay ; And then her hands , unclasped from his , are lifted up to pray . But man could never work alone ; and , even in Eden 's bowers , He pined for woman 's smile to cheer his task of tending flowers ; And soon a fair young bride is sought and found to bless the youth , Who gives , for his protecting hand , her heart of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since she its blessing shares ; And oft her hand will roses strew where his would scatter tares ; And , like a light within a vase , his home enshrines her form , Which brightens o'er his world-tossed mind , like sunshine o'er the storm ; and , when she pleads in sorrow 's cause , he can not choose but hear ; And , when her soul with Heaven communes , she draws his spirit near . And thus they live till age creeps on , or sickness lays him low ; Then will she gird her woman 's heart to bear life 's deadly woe , And soothe his pain , and stay his head , and close his dying eyes ; Oh then , his work well done , his hand may rest in Paradise !

Ha ! the sea-serpents seize their prey ! Writhing in horror , Trembling in terror , Quaking and quivering , Striving and shivering ! And ever , thus ever , day after day , Rushing and dashing , away , away , Whirling aloft a storm of spray , The furious waters struggle and moan , Then leap , and are lost in the dread unknown ! And thus in troublous toil and struggling strife , Forever on had been the law of life ,  --  The doom of man , unceasing toil and care ; No freedom for the soul , no pause for prayer ; But urged by earth 's tumultuous flood away , Till death 's dark gulf received its shrinking prey ,  --  Had not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercy 's sacred chime , Sounding one day in seven the tidings blest , That God ordained the Sabbath 's peaceful rest !

The Prince of Righteousness , He came our world to bless , The glorious hymn of " Peace " On earth to raise . Angels the song began , And then to ransomed man The strain was given .
