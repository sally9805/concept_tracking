txt The legislators who are now engaged in devising a new tariff may mean well , but it is generally thought that they are not infallible ; hence they will very urobable omit to rectify many of the errors of the present tariff if left solely to their own devices . It is , therefore , a public duty to call attention to certain of the worst features of the increased tariff , and to point out the necessity of expunging them . Few people are aware that a very heavy duty is now levid upon imported saints . The other day , six large saints , averaging ' ten feet in height , and intended for niches in the new Roman Catholic Cathedral , arrived at the Custom-house in this City , and the importer was compelled to pay a duty upon them of about $400 . This incident apprizes the public for the , first time that the United States taxes imported : saints , ? a fact that ought to excite a widespread indignation . This duty upon saints is understood to be levied upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite , or bronze condition . It may have been originally levied either for protection for revenue , or out of awicked hatred of saints . Nov , it can very easily be shown that it is not a protective duty . We do not manufacture saints in this country , and , hence , have no need to protect ourselves from the competition of the pauper saints of Europe . So far , almost the only saint we have produced is our good President , and he is , strictly speaking , only a crude saint , who has not yet passed into a refined marble state . The six refined saints imported last week can not lessen his value , since they in no way come into competition with him . They wore therefore not taxed with any view to the protection of homemade saints , and there is no protectionist who will claim that the duty on imported saints needs to be retained out of regard . to American manufacturers . Neither could this duty have been imposed with the idea that it would be an important source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Treasury probably hat ; not received a thousand dollars from thi3 i ; ouree within the last ten years . There is no demand here for saints , whether crude or refined . l a a crude ; or fleshly state ; what : ' ew saints we now have are not regarded wth very inich enthusiasm . Mr. HAYES , example , is undoubtedly a fine specimen of a credo saint , and the speeches that he made last Summer were universally admitted to be thoroughly saintly in the willingness fo : orgive enemies and forget friends which they expressed . Nevertheless , such is the weakness of human nature ; they were generally called " tedious , " and there Vero not Wt ing bold bad men who professed that they deleted 7 lines true goodness . It is manifest that if there were any real demand for saints , a country so full of resources as is the United States would soon produce them . Mr. HAYES would not be our one solitary public saint , and Deacon SMITH our only editorial saint , There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported saints , and consequently the revenue can not be benefited to any appreciable extent by a duty upon the latter . Why , then , were saints so heavily taxed by the framers of the present tariff 7 . Evidently because they hated saintliness and were determined to keep saints , whether crude or refined , out of the country . We can easily . imagine what sort of men these haters of saints must have been , and without inquiring their names , we can feel perfectly . certain that , if now living , they are among the most bitter opponents of President HAYES . They may , be outwardly fair to look upon , but they are inwardly full of envy , silver bills , and all uncleanness . They hate the good andlove , the evil . Did those men impose duties upon imported sinners 7 Did they tax opera bouffe artists or put a prohibitory duty upon English capitalists imported for the purpose of grinding the faces of the poor by building . railroads ? Certainly not . They did not care to what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country , but they were determined that European saints should be kept out . This is a , manfest duty of the revisors of the ' tariff . They should strike out the tax on saints , and permit every mai ? to import , free of duty , as many saints as he may desire. ? This should be done , not merely in order that we may supply ourselves with cheap saints , but that the stigma of hatred to saintliness may be removed from the tariff . The more saints we may have the better , if not precisely the merrier , we shall be . The presenee of one crude saint iu the White House has already put an end to that unhappy spirit of* demonism in the South which led colored men to vote the Republican ticket , and thereby give.pain to their white fellow-citizens , and has infused such a saintly spirit of reform into our civil service that even the best of our public officials , such as Collector ARTHUR , have been threatened with removal . Let us have free trade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other faults we may have , a hatred of saintliness can not be imputed to us.
