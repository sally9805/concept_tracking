txt It appears that there is uo " fraud " in ascribing evidence to one man which was never given by that man . When the Tribune stated that Mr. W. E. DODGE , Chairman of the Republican meeting hold last week . had given certain quoted evidence against Mr. Mummy , we stated that Mr. DODGE had done nothing or the kind ? that the testimony quoted did not proceed from him at all . But the Tribune turns cheerfully round , and says it was a " son and partner " who gave the evidence  --  all in the family , you see , go where was the fraud 4 In reality , Mr. W. E. Dorms ; never said a word against the much abused Mr. MURPHY , of whom the Tribune delights to make a sort of scarecrow , attributing to him a thousand acts which he never committed , and influence which he never even aspired to possess . It Is a trumpery course to take , and one which an impartial observer would scarcely deem consistent with the Professor 's " code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preach honesty than to prat ties it . Good reading for the " Liberal Republicans "  --  the bitter articles which the St. Louis Westliche Post published in 1864 , on CARL SCHURZ , when be refused to support the nomination of Gen. JOHN C. FREMONT for the Presidency . The appeal of " the claimant " for money with which to defend himself from the charge of perjury has already brought him nearly eight hundred pounds . This amount has been subscribed chiefly in small stuns , and is in great part the gift of workmen , cab-drivers , and others of the poor . The givers . have usually withheld their names , and have signed themselves " A Lover of Fair Play , " " A Sufferer from the Common Law , " or " An Enemy of the Jesuits . " Quite a number of " enemies of the Jesuits " undertook to show that enmity , by giving money to a professed Roman Catholic . It would puzzle any ordinary man to comprehend what the Jesuits could possibly have had to do with the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are clearly unanimous on the subject of the Jesuits , to whose wickedness they Impute everything that goes wrong in this muddled world . The House of Commons is under extraordinary obligations to Mr. DISRAELI . if only from the fact that he relieved it of hearing election petitions . The inquiries which were in former days made by committees at Westminster , often at a ruinous cost of time and money , are now prosecuted before Judges sitting at the scene of the contest . The Galway election petition is at present on , and no novel of Mr. LEVER depicts a more extraordinary state of things than this trial reveals . That the local Press should do its utmost to keep up a keen conflict is explained by the circumstance that fifty dollars were paid for each editorial , and two hundred for an account of a meeting . Sir Trios . BURKE , a local magnate , admitted that he dismissed a bailiff for voting against Capt . TRENCH , and served notice to quit on the Roman Catholic curate of his own parish . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS got " a threatening notice . " Being-a prudent man , he beat a retreat to England , , and satisfied his political conscience by fulminating throats from his haven against recalcitrant tenants . It is quite clear that there is no such paradise for laudatores temporis acti as the " first flower of the earth and first gem of the sea . " It is not s hundred years since ARTHUR . Youbm found the enlightened inhabitants of Kerry plowing by attaching the cattle to the instrument by theft tails , and we see that an election in Galway maintains to the full the flavor of ancient days . Another remarkable incident recorded In recent advice , is that " at Fairyhouse races , Dublin , two gentlemen were galloping In opposite directions when the beads of their horses struoli full together , and both horses were killed , the riders being thrown in the air . " Surely this was a feat whim none but Irish horses and riders could by any possibility have achieved . There is every reason to suppose that we are to have au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather will come upon us suddenly . In spite of this , and in spite also or the danger of a visit from the cholera , no preparations have been made by the immaculate street-contractor . With the exception of Broadway , and a few of the leading avenues , the streets are in the most filthy condition ; and in that condition it is plainly Mr. BROWN 'S intention to leave them until the hot weather is upon us . It need not be supposed that BROWN really desires the pestilence which he is doing his best to provoke . His motive is simply a selfish one . He desires to make as much money , and do as little work , as possible . Hence he leaves the streets ancleaned , and cares nothing for the result of his misconduct . so far as the public health is concerned . How long are we to endure this fellow/ TWEED stole our money , but he sometimes made a pretense of doing something in return . Bkowsr takes the money of the taxpayere , and gives them nothing but foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bo found in royal speeches ; and , therefore , the recent brief and sensible speech of King AMADEO is in marked contrast to most royal utterances . The Spanish monarch said that he would not impose himself on the Spanish people except at the wish of the majority , but that he would not permit a turbulent minority to impose its will on the nation . This was spoken like an honest man and a bravo soldier ; both of which the young King has proved himself to be . It is probable that no better choice could have been made by Gen. Pais when he gave a King to Spain , than the young Italian prince . At all events , now that be is the lawful King of Spain there is no reason to suppose that anything could be gained by his overthrow . The friends of good government , and of law and order should , therefore , wish King A.M.ADEO all success in suppressing the turbulent factious who are perpetually fomenting disorder in Spain . The Tribune says that Mr. JOHN D. DEFREES , the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " Christian gentleman . " Of course ; but what we said was , and we repeat it , that tie is now found oheek-by-lowl with the very men whom he formerly stigmatized as " a contemptible set of Red Republicans and Goddefying infidels . " This was Mr. DEFREES ' language . Is there any justification for it ?
