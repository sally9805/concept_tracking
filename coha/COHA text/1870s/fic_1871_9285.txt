R means Right ; L , Left ; C , Centre . The performer is supposed to be upon the stage , facing the audience . Main text Scene .  --  Sculptor 's studio . At the back of the stage arrange a smaller stage , about four feet wide , three feet deep , and two feet high , having a drop-curtain . This should be " masked , " or filled in , on both sides with American flags . The curtain can also be made by arranging two flags , to separate in the centre , and draw up on either side .

On the rising of the curtain , Freedom , as a statue , is discovered on the small stage , with E Pluribus Unum , chisel and mallet in his hands , standing by her side in the act of working . After a moment 's pause , he drops the mallet and chisel . E Pluribus . E Pluribus Unum ' T is all in vain . My trembling , unnerved hand Moves not compliant to the mind 's command . In vain I seek to carve upon that face The beaming smile that Freedom 's lips should grace Long hours of toil by earnest heart and brain , A glorious dream of triumph to attain ; And now all vanished , wanting but a gleam To light the marble face , and bid it beam , And fire with eloquence of the sculptor 's art The love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slowly approaches table , r . ) O Art , my mistress ! why so insincere , Drawing thy subjects by thy teachings near To grand achievements , then , with cruel frown , Dashing their soaring powers relentless down ; Smiting the arm that would right nobly dare ; Transforming glowing hope to dark despair ? ( Sinks into chair , and buries his face in his hands upon the table . Music . Freedom , who is standing with right hand resting upon a shield at her side , the left upon her bosom , slowly turns her head first to the l. , then to the r. ; drops her left hand to her side , then drops the shield , and slowly steps from the platform ; approaches the chair , and stops with her hand resting upon the back of it . The music should be very soft , and cease when Freedom has arrived at this position . Drop curtain to small stage . ) Freedom . Freedom What , ho , E Pluribus ! why so downcast ?

Freedom I 'm pretty well , I thank you . How are you ? E P. E Pluribus Unum Pardon me , madam , you are standing there . Excuse the omission : wo n't you take a chair ? Free . Freedom Thank you , but not just yet : with your permission , I 'll first disclose the object of my mission . E P. E Pluribus Unum Ho , ho !

I see it all : You merely came to make an evening call . Such ardent feeling  --  Free . Freedom Pray do n't be a goose ! Your compliments are of no sort of use . I came on business ; for I 've tired grown Of standing there a sullen block of stone ; And so stepped down a lesson here to teach . Your silent figure 's now a figure of speech . E P. E Pluribus Unum My statue ! is it possible ? What magic art Can so endow with life a marble heart ? Free . Freedom No matter what the power . I 've waited long Your chisel 's touch to heal a fearful wrong ; And now I 've come to know why , all this while , You 've robbed me of my right : I want a smile . E P. E Pluribus Unum You want a smile ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise you may appear . Free . Freedom You 're very kind ; but I would understand Why I 'm neglected thus . ' T is my command That you explain this fearful glaring error , Which makes of Freedom but a mocking terror . E P. E Pluribus Unum Well , you are free ,  --  so free , I fain would own That ne'er before was marble such free stone . Madam , I 've sought , with Fancy 's aid , to rear An ideal goddess that should grandly bear To distant times the glory and the power That hover o'er our land 's victorious hour ,  --  Symbolic Freedom , that should , smiling , stand , Speaking the blessings of a rescued land ; But , ah , alas ! ' t is but a mockery now : Stern as blind Justice is her frowning brow . The sculptor 's chisel is outwitted here Whene'er he bid the glowing smile appear ; The magic spell which eloquently graced bach line of beauty on the marble traced Hath lost its power : the poor sculptor 's brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freedom Fancy , indeed ! To me ' t is very plain You 've had too much of Fancy on the brain . The ruling spirit of this happy land , With models strewn about on every hand , You seek to carve a symbol , grand and true , Of all that Freedom nobly brings to view , Out of mere shadowy forms , that basely stand As models of the blessings at command : Around your studio many a marble form Attracts your eye , and gains your homage warm . ' T is concentration that you need , my master , To make your lagging chisel move the faster . Fix all your thoughts on Freedom , and you 'll fine , To smile on you that she will be inclined . E P. E Pluribus Unum Why , really , madam , you are too severe . Your claims are paramount , that 's very clear ; But then I must not , can not , so disown All that with triumph my life 's path have strown . My soaring " Speculation , " dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all awaken passion , And claim my homage ; all a lesson teach ; Some attribute of " Freedom 's " drawn from each .

The hair and dress should be strewn with powdered isinglass to give the figure a sparkling appearance . ) Who boldly dares to mount where wise ones dread The path she bounds upon their feet to tread ; Who , soaring , grasps the richest , grandest prize , And to great conquests sends her gleaming eyes ; The very ( Curtain drops . ) Free .

O'er all the world her cursd witchcraft spells , And drowns men 's fortunes in her " sinking wells " ? So base , deceitful , she  --  I see you smile . E P. E Pluribus Unum I do , to think how neatly you " struck ile . " To Speculation you do n't seem inclined , And see no grace where others beauty find . Behold my dashing , radiant , beauteous " Fashion , " ( Curtains are drawn , disclosing Fashion , a young lady arrayed in a rich , flowing skirt , silk or velvet ; over her shoulders is thrown a mantle ; on her head is fastened a lace veil , which falls over her shoulders . Hair should be arranged fashionably . She is standing nearly facing r . Her right hand holds the veil gathered loosely under her chin ; her left holds lightly the skirt of her dress ; and she is looking back as though seeking admiration . The whole effect should be rich in dress , and graceful in position . ) Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately moves , the pioneer of life , With pleasure , beauty , and attraction rife . No fetters bind her feet : she rules the hour ; And all , submissive , own her conquering power . ( Curtain drops . ) You 'll own that Freedom there doth hold a place ? Free . Freedom Not in your Fashion with the senseless face . Your grand embodiment of beauty rare Is but a mockery : for no heart is there ; No Heaven-sent virtues from that face doth gleam , Where all doth but the outward semblance seem . From Freedom turn to Fashion , " what a fall is there ! " E P. E Pluribus Unum I thought you 'd have a pull at Fashion 's hair . I 've still another that may win applause , And gain e'en your approval for my cause ,  --  My glorious " War , " that fearless rides the storm ; In battle fierce , in quarrel quick and warm ; Who boldly strikes , relentless moves along , And wakes the echoes with victorious song .

She wears a long red skirt , an " armor " waist ( which can easily be manufactured , by fastening , upon the waist of a dress , scales made of silver-paper ) . On her head is a helmet ; she stands nearly facing r. , with right hand extended , holding a sword ; her left rests upon a shield standing at her side ; her head is turned toward the l. ; her hair hangs loose ; her whole appearance is animated , as though she were summoning her troops to follow her to battle . ) You 'll own there 's Freedom here ; that , undismayed , Throughout the world her broadened path she 's made . Free . Freedom Stern-visaged War , with cruel , darkened brow , Hath caused your roving , changeful heart to glow With fierce delight , forgetful that beneath Her glory-painted form is ghastly death . Her smiles dismantle Plenty 's glowing field , And Peace to her demands doth piteous yield ; With Speculation , Fashion , War  --  E P. E Pluribus Unum No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implore . From all you 've seen , I 've inspiration caught , To deck the outward form of inborn thought . For you I 've gleaned from out each marble form Some radiant beauty , and some virtue warm ; From Speculation caught the gleaming , hopeful eyes , That Freedom 's gaze should fix on distant skies ; From Fashion gained the power in lines to trace The flowing drapery Freedom 's form should grace ; From War have caught the grand , majestic power Should Freedom 's features bear in every hour ,  --  All but the smile which o'er that face should break , And speak the happiness her life can make . Free . Freedom And , would you find that , you must seek it where In living presence it doth bright appear ,  --  In earnest heart , that nobly seeks to teach By patriot deeds , true manliness to reach By sacrifice of self , of power , of place , That labors warmly for the human race : Seek for it here , and it is quickly found Spreading its cheering influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks ! for , at your words so clear , A model truly great doth quick appear , In one who nobly lived , and now doth stand The guardian genius of this blessed land : A towering form ; no fashion 's graces there ; In those deep eyes no speculation 's glare ; But from the rugged face doth gleam a soul That spreads an honest glory o'er the whole ,  --  Honest in every effort for his country 's weal , Honest the wounds of the enslaved to heal , Honest to honor ever duty 's call ; " With malice ' gainst none , and charity for all ; " Wise , earnest , true ; where will you find a greater Than he , America 's Emancipator ?

Her eyes are raised , and the whole expression of her face is that of devout thankfulness . The figures can be dressed to suit the taste of the performers . Music , dirge . ) Free . Freedom Lost , lost to earth ! an honored patriots gone , Leaving a nation fatherless to mourn A martyred hero , and affection 's tear To drop upon an earnest patriot 's bier .

E Pluribus Unum Ay , so I will : thy words of counsel stand Within my heart to guide the sculptor 's hand To grander triumphs ; dreams of glory rise , And Fortune woos me with her richest prize . Farewell , bold Speculation : thou no more Shall claim my knee ; thy glittering reign is o'er . Farewell , my idol Fashion : ne'er again Shall thy bewitching spell my heart enchain .

Models of greatness at her call have birth ; Models of truth , of goodness , and of worth . She is my mistress , and what she displays Shall be my study all the coming days . Rise , beauteous queen , and let me bask a while Within the life-light of blest Freedom 's smile .

At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as Speculation , the same expression on her face . In front of Freedom , and kneeling on one knee , is War . She has the sword in her right hand , as though about to cast it away ; her helmet in her left . She is facing the audience , but is looking up , and back at Freedom .
