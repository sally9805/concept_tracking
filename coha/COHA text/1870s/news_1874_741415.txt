txt In yesterday 's passenger-list of the Scotia we have the first intimation of the beginning of the Summer exodus to Europe . By Saturday next the departures will doubtless be much more numerous , and the annual migration will have fairly set in . Last year , the same exodus of population had assumed . largo proportions by the 19th of April . European tourists are , therefore , three weeks later in setting out than they were in 1873 . It is almost certain that fewer people will go abroad this year than usual , and their stay will , on the average , be shorter than has been the case for some years past . In this state of facts there is an obvious lesson for the American hotel-keeper , and . for those who let cottages or take boarders at the sea-side and at inland Summer resorts . The people able to pay for a change of residence for themselves and their families , are undoubtedly fewer than usual ; but , on the other hand , the members of this class whom considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more numerous . The proportion of persons who will be tempted to seek health and refreshment at American watering-places and . sea-beaches will entirely depend on the kind of inducements offered to them . Places like Newport , Saratoga , or Long Branch ? may , or may not , be able to disregard , the demand for lower rates of board . and a somewhat higher level of comfort . Minor holiday resorts certainly can not disregard that demand with impunity . The City is a very tolerable place to spend the Summer in , as ninety-nine out of every hundred of its population have had occasion to find out . During the heats of the most torrid season , the stoop of a New-York dwelling is a fair exchange , so fax as comfort is concerned , for the crowded parlors or piazzas of a fashionable hotel , and the sleeping apartments of a commodious home are luxury itself compared . with the stuffy bedrooms of three-fourths of the Summer hotels of the period . ? The calls of fashion , seconded by abundant means , may cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarce , and . economy for the first time in many years is becoming fashionable , such considerations will have an excellent chance of being heeded . To entice his guests , therefore , from the safe vantage ground . of their own homes during a season which promises to be more endurable than usual , the keepers of all descriptions of country board . must offer some extra inducements . Prices must be adjusted . to suit the times , and words and things must have a closer correspondence than usual . The " comforts of a country home " must be made to mean something more than vegetables not fit to send to the city , milk innocent of cream , and eggs of dubious age . Country air doubtless promotes digestion , but it takes more than one Summer to educate the urban stomach up to the level of the requirements of certain familiar types of rural beefsteak . As an article of domestic cookery , pie is capable of embracing a variety of edible materials , which do infinite credit to the inventive genius of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement of the culinary art , even - when eonlined to a few simple materials . A liberal use of fresh eggs and . new milk , together with some simple farinaceous element , may be made to show in the bright eyes of little children , and . a more elastic temper in grown-up folks , much bettor results than the everlasting pie or hash . Even such trifles as tea and coffee are not absolutely indifferent to the ordinary run of healthseekers , and . it is both discouraging and . depressing to find an entire inability to detect any difference between the beverages , so-called , as one of the earliest results of a change into country board . ' to manage a big hotel successfully is supposed . to require talents equal , at least , to those of a Quartermaster General in active service . From this professional altitude , down to the ranks of the keepers of little rural boarding-places , there is an extensive variety of gifts and . capacities . But throughout the whole scale may be detected the prevailing impression that the temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somewhat of military sternness rather befits the position than otherwise . People have invested all descriptions of capital and of talents in this business , and a good . many of them grumble at ite very inadequate returns . Suppose a general attempt were made to throw in also an unfailing courtesy , and an obvious and honest desire to please ; w ; we imagine that this cheap investment would yield a very handsome return . Summer boarders are often enough fretful , captious , and capricious , but a resolute good temper is a much better means of dealing with such people than the surly looks with which they are most frequently met . It may be more trying and difficult , and . some authorities may think it not quite so dignified a way as the other . But it certainly pays better in the long run ; and if a man will persist in thinking that some of the first requisites of his business are beneath his attention , he need hardly complain when it does not pay .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
