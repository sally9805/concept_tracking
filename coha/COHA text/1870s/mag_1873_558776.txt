As an historian of art and literature , M. Tame is known to all the world . His lucid and sparkling expositions of the characteristics of Italian and Flemish painting , and his brilliaiit delineations of the distinctive traits of English authors , are familiar to every intelligent reader . As a metaphysician , however , we fear that he has yet been hardly noticed . We // doubt if the work whose title we cite for our text has had already more than a handful of readers . And yet it is a book eminently worthy of study , exceedingly interesting , even to him who reads merely for entertainment . It is destitute of none of the charms of diction which lend such fascination to his more familiar works . His views come before us with an admirable order , whose perfect sequence seems almost a demonstration . Every idea is clear-cut . Every expression is a transparent medium through which the thought is seen as easily and surely as pebbles in a pure mountain pool . No technical , eccentric , or too abstract phraseology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual process of translation into common language before we can understand what is meant . Curious examples and striking illustrations clothe the argument with captivating draperies . In short , M. Tame in this , as in his other works , shows everywhere the genuine French esprit . His Gallic blood is the sufficient guaranty that , however solid and forbidding be the title and the subject of the work , the contents will not fail to furnish appetizing food , even to those who can relish nothing that is not light and well spiced . And to the serious student it is of great importance . M. Tame calls it himself " the work that he has most fully meditated . " In the determination of his rank as a thinker , he would doubtless prefer to be judged by it rather than by any of his more popular volumes . He looks , we imagine , to this , rather than to those , to establish his claim to a permanent and high place in standard literature . For it contains in full and reasoned form the principles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no settled standards . They praise or blame as they happen to fancy . Many historians app*ear to have no suspicion of any order in their department . They are content to trace down the line of events as a mere capricious succession , without grasping any underlying principles . They sketch epochs and their leaders , and pronounce their judgments without mistrusting any connection between the individual and his time . This was once thought entirely sufficient . But the demand at the present time is for the discovery of the laws of things . The modern critic or historian // must be a philosopher . He must tell us the rationale of every change . He must find some familiar law hid under every odd aspect . The reader of ilippolyte Tame knows him as emphatically a writer of this latter stamp . He has most evidently definite theories , and he is uneasy till he finds each phenomenon that he takes up conform to some of his established rules or favorite hypotheses . History , in his view , is but applied psychology . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total transformation presented by a particular human molecule or group of human molecules , and , to explain these transformations , writes the psychology of the molecule or group . Carlyle has written that of Cromwell ; Sainte-Beuve , that of Port Royal ; Stendhal has made twenty attempts on that of the Italians . M. IRenan has given us that of the Semitic race . . . . The task is invariably the description of a human mind or of the characteristics common to a group of human minds . " For fifteen years , as M. Tame says , he had labored at these special and concrete psychologies . In the present work he attempts general and abstract psychology . The principles which in his other works are hinted at and illustrated - which , when unexhibited , nevertheless guide his criticisms , mould his thought , supply the mental fibre for those ties which he believes he sees running up and down and out and in - are here formally stated , supported , and defended . He who would know their strength or their *weakness - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - may best determine it by an examination of this his fullest exposition of them . There are two great ways of studying the human mind , quite opposite to each other . One is to observe man from the inside ; the other , to observe him from the outside . The first method employs consciousness as its chief instrument . It fixes the attention upon the various operations of the mind as they take place within , and endeavors by a direct sight , as it were , to see what it is that actually occurs when we feel , or perceive , or recollect , or imagine , it seeks to discriminate between the nature of various mental processes and between the various steps of these processes . From the various mental states it derives the faculties in which they originate . From properties it deduces substances ; from effects , causes . // The facts of which it thus finds the mind directly conscious , and the deductions it makes from them , it takes as entirely trustworthy , and uses them to cut at a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , it believes that it penetrates to the very ultimate sources and hidden essences of things . This is the most natural and easy way of studying man . It opens at once a grand mine and a rich one . At first , apparently , it is the most fruitful one that could be worked . In it Socrates and Plato and Descartes fouud the precious jewels of knowledge which shine as diamond circlets about their names . While physical science was still indulging in the crudest fancies , entirely without organization or solid basis of laws , mental science , thanks to this direct view of the interior of the mind which consciousness gave , had already made discoveries so great that it has since been able to add comparatively little to them . Until the time of Bacon this method of psychological observation enjoyed almost a monopoly . But when the inductive method had shown in the fields of physical research what great conquests it was capable of making , it was natural that it should be applied to the investigation of the mind also . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects . Ethnographers noted the characteristics of races ; philologists , the manifestations of intelligence in language ; political writers , its play in civil construction . Anatomists patiently searched into the structure of the physical organism . Physicians watched the variations in human conduct produced by abnormal conditions of mind and body . By comparisoii and statistics , these results are generalized . By subtle analysis their results are disengaged . Passing by the profounder inquiries as to the essences and causes of things , it addresses itself directly to observing the succession of emotions and ideas , - remarking the constant assoc.iatiZn among them , and learning the outward conditions of mental phenomena , and the formation of the more complex from the more simple . Tbis method of studying the mind as a distinct and valuable process may be traced back , as we have already hinted , to the grand reformation in investigation which Bacon worked . In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , Locke and ilume , Berkeley and Condillac , used it with great effect . At the present // 1873 . Tame 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckle and Bain , Maudsley and John Stuart Mill , have reached , or pretend to have reached , such astonishing results , laying the axe to the root of the most accepted beliefs , and establishing as facts , so it is claimed , the most paradoxical of theories . Now in France , since the close of the Middle Ages and the decease of scholasticism , these two fundamental methods have been two opposite poles between which philosophical thought has swung to and fro . The metaphysical needle , vibrating from the theories of Descartes to those of Malebranche , then to those'of Arnault , and next to those of Condillac , was found in the eighteenth century pointing strongly to a pronounced sensationalism , and even to an undisguised materialism . The eighteenth century , therefore , naturally commenced with a reaction . Philosophy , having lived for three quarters of a century with no other food than matter , motion , and what the senses had to give , thirsted by this time for more solid food . It was weary of Condillac and the Encyclopedists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collard , and Maine de Biran proclaimed in opposition to them . These returned to the older method of studying the mind , - the internal . They replaced consciousness and common-sense on the seats of authority . They asserted for the mind an independent power or source of knowledge . Some first principles , some fundamental laws of belief , are necessary , they asserted , to give a basis to knowledge . These are discovered and established by the inward sense , especially by reflection . The mind knows itself directly , not only as a cause , but as a permanent cause . It has independent activity and durable unity . The mind recognizes a distinction between the affections of its causative energy and of its organism , and thus recognizes its organism as something different from itself . The muscular efforts of the organism meet resistance from without , and by induction , combined with the intuition of the principle of causality , the mind knows an external material world as the cause of the resistance . The ideas* of cause , substance , space , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivations from experience , but are fundamental notions , of which the intelligence // can not divest itself , - ideas which must be regarded as universal and absolute . These views , boldly and eloquently advocated , turned quite round again the current of French philosophy . Where not accepted and reasserted in their detail , they were in their principles and most important results .. Jonifroy did little more than apply their results in the sharp and well-sustained distinctions which he drew between physiology and psychology .. Cousin , starting forth under their impulsion , explored ancient and modern philosophy , culling whatever he thought would snpport or harmonize with them , and formed his famous Eclectic system , which , for a time , was popular . Philosophy had been living in a profound ignorance of the past , and with ardent enthusiasm betook itself to the newly opened door through which it was given such curious pictures of ancient schools and foreign systems . Cousin had perfect command of a rich and beautiful style , - a style full of rhetorical effects and poetic images as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the art of the great writer could mould all the forms of ancient and modern thought into a harmonious unity . He came before his scholars , not so much as an investigator or a teacher , as in the role of a magnificent orator , a commanding and inspiring preacher . Vague , incoherent , and superficial as was his system , improvised hastily out of elements borrowed from the Greek , German , Scottish , and French schools , and as intolerant in his conclusions as he was uncertain in his methods , he yet found it easy to win over the public . The great truths which he brought back to notice they were eager to embrace , no matter how crudely they were presented . In the absorbing taste for the novel revelations of history , erudition seemed to make science unnecessary . It was enough to give Eclecticism authority at that time , that it profoundly moved the feelings , whether or not it enlarged or purified the realm of ideas . If it could not maintain its positions before the analysis of severe'judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eloquence that for a time turned its judges into admirers , and made stern criticism an impertinence . But in the last few years the needle of French thought has shifted back once more to the opposite point of the compass . // The inevitable reaction has set in . The younger minds have felt the need of new solutions and surer methods . They have become tired , in their turn , of the continual intervention of consciousness , as a Deus ex machina , to solve every trouble- some question , and have become sceptical as to its legitimacy and its value . They are irritated at finding their exploring feet ever stopped by the same eternal blind walls , - self , substance , power , time , space , - beyond which they are denied further advance . They are unwilling to yield these up as belonging to the impenetrable arcana of faith . They will some way find out what is inside of them , or they will prove them to be but illusions . They are no longer willing to take the dicta of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of analysis and experience . They hav.e revived the critical spirit , - the criticism that judges not by prejudice and personal taste and varying moods , however fine , but by well-established laws and a clear discrimination of what conforms to them . Especially they have not believed that all scientific observation lay in the study of the past , as was imagined in the antiquarian fervor of Cousin 's day . They have devoted themselves with an ardor , oppositely directed , but similar in intensity , to contemporary science and exact observations of nature . They have introduced scientific methods and theories into all parts of philosophical speculation , - into metaphysics , psychology , logic , and even morality . Philosophy no longer looks for its allies to history , literature , or religion . Its destiny lies no longer in their hands . It is rather to science that the looks of the various schools are directed , here with fear , there with hope , as exhausted armies look to a newly arrived column as the arbiter of the contest . Theories of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon disclosures of physiology and natural history . No solution of an intellectual process is considered satisfactory that can not claim corroboration by physical facts and hypotheses . This scientific current is moving more or less all schools of thought . Spiritualists as well as materialists bear testimony to its influence . Even men like Janet , L6v*que , Ravaisson , seem to be possessed with one constant idea , - that of finding , // if possible , in scientific theories and authorities auxiliaries for a spiritual philosophy which may harmonize itself with the progress of the positive sciences. * Such is the changed phase which of late psychology in France has assumed . It is to this new school , full of what many would call the most revolutionary ideas , that Tame unmistakably belongs . He has a thorough contempt for orthodoxy . Educated in the Ecole Normale , - a school whose professional object is to train instructors for the University , - instructed strictly to respect the accustomed masters , the theories of the great French idealogists only aroused in him the greater repugnance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Cerebralists , and the older sensationalism which France herself had seen . It would be hardly just to call him a disciple of either Bain , Spencer , or Mill . His system has been worked out independently , from a basis of its own . Mr .. Mill , from whom he seems to have studied and learned the most , he distinctly opposes in several important points . Nor would it be quite fair , either , to call him a follower of Condillac . His work is too broad and too original to be set down as an imitation of any one else 's . And yet the powerful influence of those great English thinkers is very noticeable in M. Tame 's system ; and the theories of the famous treatise on Sensations , which for a century had lain dormant for want of satisfactory evidence , are plainly the quickening suggestions which have produced this so much more highly developed and more firmly knit work , strengthened by abundant proofs from the discoveries of modern physiology . In this last lies the most prominent trait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually derives from the investigations of natural science . Of the two great methods of studying the mind which we have spoken of , the second , i. e. observation from the outside , especially by scrutiny of the structure and working of the physical organism , is the only one that he trusts . In psychological inquiries he says that " consciousness is * For this sketch of contemporary philosophy in France , we are happy to acknowledge our indehtedness to an article of M. Vacherot 's in the Becue des Deux Mondes for July , 1870. // not sufficient in its ordinary state . It is no more sufficient than the naked eye is in optical inquiries . It is necessary continually to beware of it ; to test and correct its evidence ; nearly always to assist it ; to present objects to it in a brighter light ; to magnify them and construct for its use a kind of microscope or telescope . " Tame finds this means of correcting or magnifying consciousness in the discoveries of anatomists as to the mechanism which the mind employs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sickness , dreams , somnambulism , hypnotism , and lunacy . Havihg enjoyed several years of study in some of the famous Parisian schools of medicine , he has become fascinated with their marvels , and believes that in them lie the keys which will unlock all mental problems . He has studied diligently the great physiologists , the chief medical authorities , the records of hallucinations , and all kinds of mental eccentricities . He quotes profusely from such writers as Muller , Helinholtz , Baillarger , Brierre de Boismont , Maury , Longet , Gratiolet , Vulpian . These supply him with the materials for his system ; nay , we may say that these are the masters who have determined its character . The work is divided into two parts ; one analytical , the other synthetical . In the first , the elements of khowledge are determined . By successive reductions the simplest forms are reached , and the physiological changes which are the condition of their origin are considered . In the second part , the mechanism and general effect of the combination are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the formation , certitude , and range of the principal kinds of knowledge are examined . M. Tame commences with an examination of words and the mental process connected with them . The old nominahist controversy is not to him either foolish or antiquated . In the solution of the question it raised , - What is the import of an abstract word ? - is the basis of the philosophy , which shall not be iuisled by empty illusions . Tame maintains that the word is a mere sign , - a substitute for sensations or images which are too complex to be conveniently reproduced . He disbelieves entirely in the existence , even the mental existence , of any gen // eral idea . All that passes within , when from several perceptions we disengage what we call a general notion , is simply the experience of a tendency which urges an expression . To imagine the abstra&amp;t conception something apart from the word , to suppose that we can conceive ideal objects , is a singular illusion . We overlook the name which is the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admits , a common character , an extract of the essential qualities of the given clhss of objects . But of this extract , the detached and isolated fragment common to all the members of the class , we can not have either experience , perception , or sensible representation . Even the imagination can command only a varying and shifting image of it . The precise and fixed thing which we call an idea is therefore but a verbal sign , which suggests itself to the mind at the stimulus of the slightest observed point of resemblance , and enables us to carry on rapidly courses of reasoning and processes of communication . Having swept away the whole class of general ideas into the realm of nonentity , and having thus attached the abstract name directly to the sensible image or affection of sense as a mere sign , he has at one blow cleared the way to the pure sensationalism which he would establish . The further reduction goes on now naturally and easily . Taking up the image , he finds that to be but the echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in every important respect as the sensation itself . It is distinguished from the sensation only by being excited internally , by an antecedent sensation or a disturbance of the nervous centres ; while the sensation proper arises directly from a disturbance of a nerve extremity . The image is generally fragmentary , fugitive , and weak ; but sometimes , by exclusive attention or through strong emotion , it may acquire the energy and distinctness of the sensation . This excess may be corrected by the simultaneous feeling of an antagonist sensation . In short , as the word is the more convenient stibstitute which acts for the image , so the image , in the same way , is the substitute which replaces the sensation . By reduction upon reduction , Tame thus reaches the primitive fact , sensation , of which all the rest , whether images or ideas , are but repetitions more or less disguised . // This element appears irreducible . It is so to consciousness . But scieiice , however , can separate many of these apparently indivisible sensations into their elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenter , by such instruments as Lavart 's wheel or Latour 's siren , can demonstrate that sensations that seem wholes are really composed of parts . Small separate sensations , repeated in quick and regular succession , unite in a continuous musical note . Noises are composed of a number of similar separate and small but irregular sensations . When isolated , these small sensations are not perceived by the inner sense . They must be added together so as to make a certain bulk , and to occupy a certain time , but they still exist . A similar , though less complete , reduction M. Tame makes with sensations of the other senses . The same law , that every apparent whole of sensation is composed of smaller parts , and each of these parts of more infinitesimal sensations , imperceptible to consciousness , is true of them all . And the antecedents of these larger or smaller sensations are always certain molecular movements in the nerves , equally infinitesimal and imperceptible to the senses , known only by processes of reasoning . Of this physical , external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to the end of the psychological analysis , lie changes his route and turns to physiological examination . He considers the organism of intelligence . He finds the immediate condition of sensations in molecular disturbances of the sensitive centres , i. e. the encephalon . Images are occasione* by repetitions of these molecular motions in the cerebral lobes , on entering which they become capable of persisting and of indefinite revivals and interactions . Reflex actions are occasioned by nerve currents transmitted , not to the sensitive centres , but only to the spinal marrow , and exciting fragmentary actions analogous to those which excite elementary sensations imperceptible to consciousmiess . We find , then , that every mental event is accompanied by some physical change . What then is the relation of the mental and physical world ? Inseparably connected as they are , yet the two series have nothing apparently in common . And however closely we study the two , we find them no // more reducible the one to the other . The physiologist , relying on the constant connection of mental events with motions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of the second . The philosopher , resting on the irreducibility of the two , says that mental events belong to a separate mental being . Cautious on-lookers interpose and conclude : Here is an insurmountable difficulty , let us be content to remain in ignorance . M. Tame , however , is not content to pause here . He believes that he can press further into the mystery . He says that the incompatibility of mental and physical events is on our side , - not on theirs . It is due to the different channels by which we gain knowledge of them . One and the same electric shock , acting on the optic nerve , appears as a flash of light , on the acoustic nerve as a sound , on a nerve of touch as a blow . The different psychological appearances are due to the different routes by which the same event enters the mind . So when we examine the idea of a sensation and of a molecular movement , we find that they enter the mind by routes directly opposite , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from without , through many intermediates . Being *nowii in these two opposite ways , one and the same single event will appear double . The sensation and the molecular movement of the nervous system may be regarded , then , as at bottom one and the same event ,  --  opposite aspects of the same thing . The difficulty of two separate things occurring always simultaneously and in mutual dependence , to account for which the philosophers of the seventeenth century , Leibnitz and Malebranche , had to call in the hypothesis of a pre-established harmony , is entirely removed . Nature , then , has two faces . In the one the object is presented as it appears within , as it is known directly . In the other it is presented as it appears without , indirectly , by its effects , through its physical signs . Seen from the one side , nature has as elements events which we can know nothing of except when in extreme complication , and which in this state we call sensations . In the brain these are compounded into images and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower , simpler and simpler , forms . They are indicated by all reflex actions ; they may be traced down in rudimentary // form , the lowest point of the animal scale , nay , into the vegetable kingdom . There is no radical difference between animals and vegetables when looked at in this light . By pursuing analogies we may descend in the scale of beings . For the inorganic world is but a special case of the organic world , differing in degree , but identical in nature . When seen from the other side , - the physical , - nature has as elements events which we can conceive clearly only when in a state of extreme simplicity , and which in this state we term molecular movements . As from the level of sensation mental events descend , decreasing in complexity ; so from the level of molecular motion physical events ascend , constantly increasing in complexity , as we pass from the most elementary phenomena of physics to the highest operations of the cerebral lobes . Through the whole scale there occur , looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we term life is but a more delicate chemical action of more complex chemical elements . From base to summit the correspondence on either side is perfect . Phrase for phrase the physical event , as we represent it to ourselves , translates the mental event . ( Book IV . ch. 2 . ) And now that our events have been considered , what is the being they pertain to , which each calls himself . Philosophers usually conceive it as a subject or substance different from the various sensations , images , perceptions , recollections , etc. , which correspond to it , and having for its distinctive qualities certain faculties or powers . Every part of this conception Tame would throw overboard without ceremony . Power , force , faculty , substance , self , matter , - these are all metaphysical entities , pure phantoms begotten of words , and vanishing as soon as we examine rigorously the meanings of the words . Power and force and faculty denote no occult essence , but simply the perpetual connection between one fact which is antecedent and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has power to move a wheel , I mean only that when the stream falls on the wheel the rheel moves . This property of the one fact to be followed by another is , however , set apart by abstraction and kept in a distinct state by a separate name till the mind , forgetting its // origin , believes it to be independent and becomes the dupe of its own illusion . With the fall of this illusion falls also that of self . For the powers of the self are what constitute it . The self , the one permanpnt substance , distinct from events , is seen to vanish and re-enter the region of words . All that remains of us are our events , sensations , recollections , images , ideas , resolutions . These are what constitute our being . Each of them is an element , fragment , extract of the Ego . Our successive events , then , are successive components of ourselves . The Ego is in turn each of these events . At one moment it is nothing more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of suffering . These divisions , however , into different mental eveiits , are purely fictitious , for the convenience of observation . They actually form a continuous web . We can not say that it is the series of its events placed in succession , since it is not divided into events , except to observation . But still it is equivalent to that series . For if they were taken away nothing would remain ; they constitute it . ( Book IV . ch. 3 . ) Having upset this entity at the summit of nature , there remains at the foot another entity , matter , which falls by the same blow . When analyzed there remain but movements , present , future , or possible , connected with certain conditions and determined with relation to certain points . Thus in the physical and in the moral world nothing remains of what is commonly understood by substance or force . The notion of fact or event alone corresponds to real things . Chemical body , material atom , self , that which we term a being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the condition of another and having another as its condition . We have no difficulty , then , in comprehending the connection between the human and the physiological individual . All we have now before our eyes is a series of events termed self , connected with other events forming its conditions . The web of facts which make up our being is a distinct district in the aggregate constituted by the nervous functions , this aggregate itself being a distinct province in the entire living animal . This series is to our senses a series of molecular movements , // to our consciousness a series of sensations . In proportion as we descend the animal scale , we see it lose its domination and complexity and become reduced to the level of the others , while these in turn loosen their mutual connections and become insensibly degraded . To external perception , they have all for condition of existence the integrity and renewal of the nervous system , whose special activity they are ; and the beings more or less strictly bound together , which they constitute , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or literary illusion may clothe them , are subject to the same condition . ( Book IV . ch. 3 . ) Having thus disengaged and determined the primordial elements , the task is now , with their combinations , to construct the rest . We perceive , we recollect , we foresee , we reason , we form abstractions and ideals . How can we accomplish these things ? Philosophers commonly say that we do these things because we have such and such faculties , memory , imagination , reason , etc . These are but verbal explanations , inherited from the schoolmen . These various actions are properly to be explained as transformations , by association or conflict of these mental elements , signs , images , sensations . Two principal processes are employed by nature to produce the operations we term cognitions ; the one consisting in the creation of illusions within us , the other consisting in their rectification . As in his " History of English Literature , " treating of Hamlet 's madness , he maintains that all men are more or less insane ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledge of the mind , with the same itching after paradox he devotes himself to proving that the whole staple of the actions and knowledge of the mind is delusion . External perception , firstly , is essentially hallucination , - an hallucination generally resulting in truth , but still an hallucination . In every act of perception there are three steps : first , the antecedent , usually some external object ; second , by the sensation , an internal semblance or phantom of the object ; third , the affirmation or judgment . Now , for the third step , nothing is required beyond the presence of the second . Though usually excited by an external object , this intermediate element , sensation , may be excited by an image in the cerebral lobe , or // by some molecular disturbance in the nervous centres due to disease . The affirmative judgment - what we call the perception - none the less follows . We call it then a case of hallucination . But as in all cases the presence of this internal semblance is the immediate antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for an internal object , all perceptions are really hallucinations . The objects that we touch , see , or perceive are really nothing more than inward phantoms , precisely similar to those which arise in the mind of the dreamer . The only difference is , that in the case of the dreamer the phantoms do not correspond to external objects then present ; in the case of perception , they do . Again , every sensation that we experience we assign to a certain place , - in the foot , the hand , the cheek . But this is but an illusion , as is abundantly proved by surgical operations . When a foot has been amputated , tinglings will be felt for many years as if in the foot no longer there , clearly referred to distinct parts , the second or third toe , the sole of the foot , etc . Disease of the marrow excites tinglings in the extremities . When a new nose is formed by turning down a flap of skin from the forehead , and the nose is touched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead that is touched . Or again , when we hear a sound , we say that is outside of us , say a dozen yards to the right . When we see the red of a cloth , we situate that also externally to us . But science shows us that neither are outside of us . There are only three certain molecular movements which act as antecedents . By disturbing the acoustic irnrve by a blow on the head , a ringing sound is heard ; by setting the retina in action by pressure on the eyeball , or agitating the optic nerve by disease or by a cut , luminous figures , patches , or sparks may be seen . The real situation of every sensation , whether of sound , of color , of pressure , of pain , is never outside of us , nor even at the nervous extremity , but is always in the sensory centres in the encephalon . The localizing judgment that situates them in this or that spot of the surface , or even outside of us , is an hallucination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecular disturbance that is the antecedent condition is usually found to be there . // In the same way , the image , the second great element of intelligence , is hallucinatory in its nature . The image is the echo or revival of the sensation . The more complete it is , the more does it seem a veritable present sensation . In sleep , natural or artificial , when the xivalry and correction of true sensations are removed , the image develops a perfect hallucination . When we are awake there is a similar tendency of the image to excite an hallucination , but it is repressed by simultaneous sensations . As in every representation , conception , or idea , there is an image or images , and as it matters little whether the hallucinatory process be commenced or completed , the state of our mind when we are awake and in health may be defined as a series of hallucinations which do not become developed . " The hallucination which seems a monstrosity is the very fabric of our mental life . " ( Part II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the processes of rectification by which these hallucinations are corrected and reduced to proper order . Perceptions of one sense are corrected by contradictory ones of another . Images are repressed either by antagonistic sensations or by other images and convictions incompatible with them . Thus an hallucination by a stronger contradictory hallucination is repressed , and is made to constitute sometimes a recollection , sometimes a prevision , now an imagination , and again a perception corresponding to real things and events , and thus constituting cognitions . Thus by experience our senses are educated . Our sensations , originally simple states of excitation , telling nothing of place , gradually are referred to diferent localities , according to the places where the nervous disturbance which starts them is found to be situated . By the muscular sensations of the arm , foot , eye , we learn distance . By combinations of the idea of distance , and through simultaneous sensations of the hand or eye , which sensations by education of the senses seem to be situated in distinct and continuous points , we derive the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own sensation . From these ideas of distance and extension , combined with the sensation of resistance , are easily derived all the other properties of bodies , - solidity , figure , surface , mobility , divisibility . External objects are thus , when analyzed , only internal phantoms , // fragments of the Ego , detached from it in appearance and opposed to it by an illusion . This illusion , however , is not , as Kant taught , the effect of the innate and inexplicable structure of the mind , but of an acquired disposition instituted in us by experience . But with so many illusions , is there anything real corresponding to them ? What is left us in bodies when we have pushed our analysis to its farthest ? In the first place , we find that , though there is no sensation in the nervous extremity , still less any color or sound outside of us , yet that there are situated the starting-points of the molecular displacements which occasion the sensations . There are certain disturbances of the nerves , and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensations felt . The latter have an almost constant connection with the former . What we call a body , when examined , reduces itself to a collection of certain powers of exciting sensations within us , - sensations of heat , sweetness , figure , resistance , extension , etc . And when we say that a body has the power to excite a certain sensation in us , we mean simply that such a sensation is possible or necessary under certain conditions . The powers , consequently the properties , consequently the substance of bodies , Tame thus resolves , as Mill has done , into " certain permanent possibilities of sensations for ourselves or other sentient beings , " but he adds to this the element that these possibilities become necessities whenever the sensitive organism is brought into all the needed conditions for receiving such a sensation . But a body exists independently of our observation ; it precedes and survives us . It remains unchanged when we change , and changes when we do not . Certain of its events excite certain changes in other bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated stone evaporates water . Bodies come thus to be defined and considered , not in reference to our sensitive events , but in reference to their own , and in reference to those that they occasion in other bodies . But in these respects , also , bodies are still groups of possibilities or necessities of sensations , more or less permanent . All these properties exist in relation to events , of ourselves , the body in // question , or other bodies ; and all these events are defined in final analysis by our own events : they are more or less elaborated extracts from sensation . Among these is there any one , Tame next inquires , which we may legitimately ascribe to bodies ? Is there nothing intrinsic in bodies ? Or are bodies indeed nothing more than a simple collection of permanent powers or possibilities , of which we can affirm nothing except the effects that tbey excite in us ? Or indeed , as Bain and Mill , following Berkeley , think , are they pure nonentity , erected by an illusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idealistic path so unhesitatingly thus far , - having found nothing but hallucination in every process and result of the intelligence thus far , - the reader fully expects him to take the grand idealistic plunge through the empty shell of matter into the void inane beneath it . But here he suddenly and strangely pauses . He fears apparently to deprive science and physical knowledge of all solid foothold ; and out of the vast field of phantoms and semblances to which he has reduced the world , he would , therefore , save a little tract which he may declare to be real and permanent . Though every other quality may be stripped from bodies , we are justified , he maintains , in believing that one . quality , motion , still remains , and that it constitutes bodies independent existences . If all sentient beings were suppressed , bodies such as a stone , for example , would still exist . " And this does not merely mean that the possibility of certain visual , tactile , and other sensations would still subsist ; it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which make up the stone , would still subsist ; in other words , that the movable motive-powers of which the stone is the aggregate would continue to weigh on the ground proportionately to their mass , and would go through the same internal oscillations as they do at present . " ( Part II . Book II . ch. 1 . ) Thus do we gain our knowledge of body , and such is its reality . It is the same with the mind . Its unity and permanence is an appear'ince only . It seems to be fixed only because a certain common character , its inwardness , is constantly repeated . What we call self is but an extract from our // various successive events , isolated to the mind by the oblivion of its connection with them , but actually nothing apart from them . Illusory in the metaphysical sense , it is not , however , in the ordinary sense . There is something corresponding to it , something very analogous to that which , according to our analysis , constitutes the substance of bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under certain conditions , and the permanent necessity of the same events under the same conditions , with the addition of a complementary one , - all these events having a common and distinctive character , that of appearing as internal . ( Part II . Book III . ch. 1 . ) Our author next advances to the consideration , a second time and more fully , of general ideas and the process by which they are formed . They pass , he shows , through two stages . In the first the idea rises with the sign ; it is as yet incomplete and vague . In the second it is rectified , and , by addition and subtraction , is made to correspond to its object . There are other general ideas which correspond , not so much to actual things as to possible things , - the ideas which compose arithmetic , geometry , mechanics . These ideas we construct without having in view any real thing to which we seek to make them conform . These serve in arithmetic as preliminary outlines ; in geometry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next Tame considers how we form laws , general judgments , or propositions . They are formed by coupling together two general characters or ideas . Sometimes the two connected characters are simultaneous ; sometimes one , termed the antecedent , precedes ; the other , the consequent , follows . Laws concerning real things we learn by the various modes of induction , supplemented often by deduction . The laws of possible things are discovered by the deductive road . The propositions concerning them are not merely probable , hut certain beyond our little world ; at least , we are unable to believe or conceive that it is otherwise . The axioms and theorems of geometry , for example , are necessarily true always and everywhere . The contraries of them are not only incredible but inconceivable . // Here we have , then , the only kinds of propositions which are applicable to all cases , without exception . On their value depends the reach of human knowledge . What is their validity then ? This depends on their origin . There are two principal answers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , not a necessary connection of things , but simply a certain structure of the mind which does not allow us to conceive the ideas of these things except as so connected . Stuart Mill , starting from an opposite stand-point , arrives at a similar conclusion . These propositions are but truths of experience , - the summed-up impression left on our minds by things . Like all truths of experience , these laws then reach only to the establishment of a constant fact in the past , within the field of observation . Whether there is a connection between the things themselves , we are incapable of knowing . Tame differs , however , from both of these views . He shows that in axioms , and the consequences deduced from them , there must be a connection of facts as well as of ideas , because the two data are such that the first includes the second . The deduction is simply an analysis , which reveals parts and identities not expressly stated or clearly perceived , but which tacitly were included . Thus is established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas or hypotheses , but of the two facts or sets of facts , because the first , wherever it will be , will involve the second , since the second is a part of itself . Their connection , then , is not limited to the range of past or present experience , but is absolute and universal . ( Part II . Book IV . ch. 2 . ) From these considerations we may learn finally the nature of reasoning , the essence of laws , and the structure of things . When we have learned that a connection exists between two things , we are naturally led to ask , Why are they connected ? What link or intermediate unites them or explains their union ? In the discovery of this intermediate lies the secret of all demonstration , the key-stone of every law of nature . Now this intermediate may be of many kinds . Sometimes it is composed of but a single element , sometimes of many ; sometimes its components are successive ; sometimes simultaneous ; sometimes the component intermediates are similar in // kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary , the essential nature of the explanatory intermediate remains the same , i. e. that it is always shown to us as a character or a sum of characters included in the first datum of the couple ; more general than that datum when they are considered apart , and accessible to our grasp from being comprised in it , and separable from it by our ordinary processes of isolation and extraction . Take any law requiring demonstration . It is composed of two data . The first datum is more complex than the intermediate , and contains it ; the intermediate , again , is more complex . than the last datum , and contains it . Thus the mind is carried on from the first to the last datum , and the two are coupled by means of the quality found to be common to them both . In the sciences of construction , of pure thought , we can discern easily this essential nature of demonstration . Every theorem is an analytical proposition . The proof consists in a process of analysis by which in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is found included a character which , either directly or through the mediation of more intermediates , includes the other datum and couples them . In the sciences of experience it is the same , though the difficulties of the process are much greater . It is not sufficient here to consult simply our conception of the first datum of a couple , and by reflection analyze the group into its elements . We are obliged to go outward into nature , and by laborious and lengthy processes of nature learn what are the elements or factors of our first group , before we can find the intermediate character by which it is attached to the other group . But when induction has discovered the properties of the factors , we can go on with the work of demonstration as in the constructive sciences . Whenever we are able thus to isolate and observe the elements of a compound , we can from the properties of the elements explain the properties of the compound , and from a few general laws deduce a host of particular laws . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a full stop . When , in this progressive decomposition , we arrive at compounds in which our consciousness , senses , and instruments are unable to discover simpler elements , explanation is at a standstill // and is reduced to conjecture . Every science meets these limits . Such are the elementary sensation , the living cell , the chemical molecule , the ethereal atom . But though the explanatory intermediate is too minute or obscure for us , with our present means of observation , to detect it , we yet believe that it exists . There is , we are persuaded , a reason for every connection of facts , a reason for every law , - for the laws concerning mental compounds , as for the laws concerning real compounds ; for the formation as well as for the properties of a planet or of a species . Questions of origin are but questions of what combination of properties will produce a certain effect . Besides indicating the existence , we can indicate beforehand the position and principal characteristics of the intermediate which still escapes us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first datum of the couple ; it is included in that datum and appertains to its elements , and the properties of that datum , as well as its origin , have as their ultimate reason of existence the characters and previous state of its ultimate elements . On these indications the thought flies off to extend this structure of things beyond our world and history , throughout the two gulfs of space and time , beyond all the distances to which imagination can attain , beyond all the confines which numbers or quantities fruitlessly swollen and heaped together can denote to the pure reason . Are we justified in acting thus ? Tame boldly declares that we are . The further our extended experience drives back our horizon in space and time , the more explanatory reasons do we add to our store . Constantly we are filling up . Added to the probabilities *ffforded by these considerations is the positive proof given by the very nature of the relation of a subject to its attribute . The subject always includes the attribute , as a fragment , extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are connected together , there must be an explanatory intermediate more general in character than the first member of the couple and included in it . From this follows the proof of the principle on which induction rests , and also the axiom of causality . From this many other consequences flow , leading us , if we will pursue them , up // to the idea of existence itself and its elements and conditions . But as this would pass beyond the field of cognitions into that of metaphysics , M. Tame here ends his inquiries . Such is the substance of M. Tame 's philosophy . We have not been able , of course , to give any idea of the abundant illustrations and examples which at once enliven his exposition and sustain his argument . We have not been able to exhibit the width of his researches , or the polish of his style . We have been compelled to give in abstract terms a brief summary , which , despite the rigor with which we have compressed it , is still perhaps too long . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of each chapter the results therein reached , we are able to say that our account is given almost entirely in M. Tame 's own statements . Our readers can now see for themselves how subtle are his analyses , how bold , original , and ingenious is his system ; how logically his conclusions flow on from one fundamental assumption to another . In these respects and many others , it is admirable . His chapters on the nature of the reduction , revival , and obliteration of images ; on illusions and their rectification ; on the abstract ideas of geometry , arithmetic , and mechanics ; and on the laws of possible things , - are highly to be commended . We can but commend , also , his design of securing aid for psychology in her perplexities from that rich quarry of natural science where so many treasures of knowledge have already been found , and more still , we believe , are to be found . But having gladly said thus much of praise , candor compels us to say more of blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the sacrifice of what we deem the most precious truths . His boldness seems not seldom like the mental escapades of one who has thrown off regard for soberness of statement and the fundamental laws of thought . The assiduous attention which he has given to the observation of bodily conditions and external facts seems to have disqualified him from realizing fully pure mental or spiritual phenomena , as they exist in their simplicity , falling under the eye of consciousness . In his favorite IP*cole // de M6decine he has studied mental disease till he finds nothing but hallucination anywhere . Perception , imagination , memory , extension , - each of these is an hallucination . Abstract ideas , personality , force , faculty , - these are but illusions of the intellect , mental fictions which everybody foolishly constructs . Instead of M. Tame 's treatise being designated " On Intelligence , " it should be entitled " On the Illusions of Intelligence . " It is not so much a system of psychology that he gives us , as one of mental pathology . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable and dangerous penchant for paradox . Whatever will astonish , he longs to prove to be true . Whatever belief common-sense trustfully rests upon , he is filled with the most ardent longing to knock from under it . That a notion is repugnant to the general opinion of mankind or condemned by current authorities is enough to make him embrace it with open arms . This passion for paradox it is , more than any other one thing , which accounts for the various peculiarities of his system . This it is that renders every one of those ancient and fundamental ideas , self , matter , substance , cause , power , a 6*te noire to him . This it is that makes him labor to detect some delusion or mental phantom at the bottom of every intellectual process . This it is that , on the other hand , excites in him the ambition to restore to the external world that reality , to deduction that actual truth , and to the reign of law and reasons that universal empire , that the most eminent masters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader is strongly tempted to believe that , if M. Tame had happened to live in an age or a country in which his own views had long ruled , he would have attacked them as rigorously as he now does the opposite doctrines . It is easy for us to say in general that M. Tame 's views are unsatisfactory to us . The reader will desire that we show in particular where and why they are so . Let us take up , briefly , some half-dozen of his principal positions , and it will not be difficult to show that they are as objectionable to sound logic as to common-sense . // In the first place , let us consider M. Tame 's views of abstract ideas . He maintains that properly there are none , but merely abstract names , which present themselves at the stimulus of the slightest individual likeness . There is in the mind at most but a general tendency urging an expression . If this be so , we are at loss to see how an abstract name can be intelligently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , represents a precise and fixed character . There must be in the mind , then , something more than a general , vague tendency to expression ; there must be a precise and fixed idea , the inward counterpart of the outward character . M. Tame objects that of such a precise and fixed character , common to all various individuals of a class , we can not have either perception , experience , or sensible representation . We grant this . But though this general character can not be perceived or imaged as a separate thing , yet it can be conceived . The intellect can construct and determine it in thought through the various attributes , properties , or relations which are its elements . The name , it is true , is very important in rendering the idea permanent and helpful . After we have become familiar with the name , we may , to be sure , often use it without referring back to the idea which formed it . Without language it is difficult to reason either exactly or rapidly or lengthily . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and established its use as the nerve-current the motion of the tongue . If there was no mental operation to separate and fix the elements which the word stands for , the word would symbolize nothing , and hence be as meaningless as the chatter of a parrot . M. Tame 's position implies that there can be no thought without words . The fact is , however , that there can be . Experience with deaf-mutes who have acquired little even of the language of signs proves this . These show by their actions that they generalize , i. e. form concepts , to a limited extent . They classify and arrange observations ; they analyze and compare attributes ; they apply principles in deduction , infer them from data . Even infants , too young to talk , manifest the possession of general ideas . We have repeatedly seen one picking out // from a heterogeneous heap similar objects and placing them together . Once noticing a cat holding a mouse in its mouth , the child was asked where the cat had the mouse , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes , such as the dog and the horse , must have , it seems to us , general notions . How can we conceive , as a writer in the Spectator once asked , that a sheep-dog which did not know the species as well as the individual could get along at all in his professional life ? Secondly , in regard to sensation , we can not consider M. Tame 's analysis of the unit of sensation into minuter unconscious sensations as at all a logical deduction from the phenomena that he instances . We are aware that there is unconscious cerebration , that there is unconscious reflex action , but it was left for M. Tame to discover unconscious sensation . It seems to us a contradiction in terms . A sensation is essentially something felt . When it is not felt , it does not exist . There may exist the physical condition of a sensation , there may exist the nervous vibration which ought to excite a sensation ; but if these do not excite any conscious experience , there is then no sensation , properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are either not perceived at all or produce only noises , give rise , on being repeated iii very quick succession , to a continuous musical note , it is not necessary to infer , it seems to us , that these were unconscious sensations which were fused together into a larger whole capable of conscious experience . It is much more likely that the fusion took place among the nervous vibrations anterior to any excitation of sensation . M. Tame insists that sensation does not take place until the vibration has travelled along the nerve clear to the nervous centre . Here is place and time amply sufficient for such fusion , - place and time where it is more likely than not that it would take place . Thirdly , we fail to see the justice of characterizing the fabric of our mind as essentially hallucination . We do not deny that images often develop into hallucinations . We do not deny that there is more than one illusion connected with the process of perception . But NI . Tame himself shows how images are // always prevented when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that the practical results which perception attains are in almost all cases correct . It fails , indeed , only when its action is distorted by loss of limb or by some physical or mental disease . M. Tame admits also that these illusions which attend perception are nothing innate , but are instituted in us by experience . They proceed from the education of the senses . Moreover , the erroneous localizing of the sensation in the nervous extremity , instead of in the nervous centres , is not a thing properly to be laid to the charge of the much-abused perceptive faculty , the sphere of which is the knowledge of the non-ego , but it is due rather to M. Tame 's pet faculty , - sensation itself . Making the subtractions required by these considerations , there is little left , it seems to us , to justify M. Tame in calling perception fundamentally an illusion , at best an honest illusion , or in designating the image and all the rest of our mental operations as undeveloped hallucination . Such a characterization is defining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single step , - the essence of a thing , not by its original characteristics , but by its acquired properties . If we imitated it , we might , with equal justice , call man fundamentally an undeveloped idiot , a calf an immature monstrosity , a saint essentially an honest sinner . We are comparatively willing , however , to surrender the perceptive and . imaginative faculties to the yoke of illusion which M. Tame would hang round their necks . But when he proceeds to banish the substance both of mind and matter to the same limbo of unsubstantial ghosts and lying delusions , we must vigorously protest . The doctrine of substance is the keystone of every system which gives genuine reality to the inward and the outward world . Hence M. Tame hurls it down with contempt as a baseless fiction of the mind . Having pulled out the centre stone of the arch , it is very easy to demolish the rest . Power , cause , self , and matter , as they are each of them but substance of various kind or acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence ; air-castles which every mind , by some strange Nemesis , invariably builds up , and then becomes the dupe of that which it itself created . Now we would ungrudgingly grant that substance is not a // thing perceived by the senses . It is a mental apprehension . But it is not a fiction . It is an honest intuition . The fact that it is instinctively and universally believed in bespeaks its truth . On perceiving the various relations , properties , attributes , of an object , especially when perceiving these constantly repeated , the mind necessarily conceives a substance , a permanent being possessed of power , which holds these relations , to which these properties belong , in which these attributes inhere . For these qualities imply such a substance . We can not separate length from something which is long , nor color from something which is colored , nor thought from a thinking being . And the substance of an object does not signify merely an assemblage of certain attributes , a series of certain events , a group of certain relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and the bond of these various attributes , events , and relations . If there be no substance to mind or external body , but the one is a mere series of simple or transformed sensations , the other a loose group of possibilities or necessities exciting sensation , how are to be explained the constant connection and repetition of the same sensations ; the persistent association and endurance of the same possibilities of sensation ? Especially how is to be explained the fact that even when change in these takes place the permanence of certain elements is maintained amidst the greatest diversity ? We assert that this constant connection requires a constant bond ; that the permanence of these effects demands the presence of a permanent cause , an enduring being possessed of power , - in other words , a substance . If it be said that this necessary implication of thought does not implya necessary implication in fact , we answer that , whether or not this last plea is itself sound , it is not open to M. Tame , because , in his chapter upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas imply a necessary connection in actual fact . If it be said that this substance is necessarily a thing unknowable apart from its attributes , we answer , that , though in fact the substance is indivisible from its attributes , in thought it must be distinguished . Though it is not known apart from its attributes , it is known through its // attributes ; and the attributes and the substance stand in such a fixed and indissoluble relation that the knowledge of the one enables us to know the other . If the real existence of substance must be maintained , as we believe it must , that of mind , matter , force , and cause iiecessarily follow . For mind is spiritual substance ; matter , material substance ; force , the energy of substance ; cause , this energy producing effects . For the existence of the self as a permanent , indivisible , identical being , we have the direct testimony of consciousness . It is a travesty upon the nature of the Ego to call it nothing but a series of sensations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous centres . The mind is conscious of itself , not as a sensation or series of sensations , but as an existence present with every sensation , the being who exjeriences the sensation . The experience of the soul is not that at one moment it is an act , at another a pain , but that it is a being who acts and who suffers pain . Moreover , the fact is not merely that the soul , at the second moment , experiences a repetition of a similar effect , i. e. the inwardness of the state , but that the soul knows itself as still continuing one and the same being . Our states of course change , but the very conception of change implies the conception of an unchanged permanent element ; otherwise it would be no change , but the annihilation of one thing and the substitution of another . M. Tame , indeed , does not hesitate to advance to this conclusion . He unequivocally declares that when the series of our mental events ceases to exist , nothing remains of the mind or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness would actually be a new mental birth or creation . What makes us imagine , says Tame , that it is the one and the same soul that still endures through the variations or interruptions of our mental states , is the constant repetition of a similar mental quality or qualities , owing to the constant renewal of the same physical conditions . In answer to such an astonishing assertion , we can only declare flatly that this is not a true analysis of our mental experience . The testimony of consciousness is that after sleep we are no new existence , however similar , but the same identical existence . // If it be not , how can we rely at all upon the veracity of memory ? If there is no continuity between the self of to-day and the self of yesterday , how can I reason from the present recollections of the second self to the experiences of the first self , or from the past experiences of the first to the present experiences that the second would now receive ? And as we maintain the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known by the mind , so we would maintain the existence of material substance and of force . The mind directly knows material substance , as a permanent existence occupying space and causative of specific sensations in the sentient soul . The mind must know something more of matter than certain sensations excited in us , from which we assume the existence of certain possibilities or necessities of sensation . We should separate its agency from the agency of the mind , and assign to it its attributes of extension , solidity , action on the senses , etc . So also do we know force as a something more than a mere particularity of one fact to follow another . We are conscious , in our own exercises and receptions of it , that there is effort in it , causal efficiency ; that there is not merely an observed sequence of two events , but that there is an activity or energy , in the first of which the second is a necessary consequence , provided there is no preventive condition . We were quite surprised to see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea so fundamental to it , and of late so fruitful in its rewards to the physical investigator , as the idea of force . While Herbert Spencer would find no real existence behind phenomena but force , and Tyndall does not conceive he had reached an adequate explanation of phenomena until he has arrived at some permanent force ; while Biichner and his compeers on the other side of the Rhine are crying out that force and matter constitute the only infinite and suffice to explain the universe ; - Tame maintains that it is but a mental fiction . Perhaps we may leave to one party the task of answering the other . It is with a feeling of relief that the reader , having been led down and down , finding every foundation on which he would // rest his foot an empty bubble , is at last allowed to stop just as he is within a hair 's breadth of the abyss of total unreality and nothingness , and his footsteps are thenceforth directed upward . This latter part of M. Tame 's work , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have believed in , to try his own hand at establishing some realities , is much more satisfactory to the sober-minded thinker than the progressive iconoclasticism which constitutes the first part . But , unfortunately , the two portions fit ill together . The consciousness of the ruin which his analysis has already wrought among the fundamental ideas with which synthetic philosophy usually builds , prevents him from giving the best support to the positive reality and knowledge that he would vindicate ; and even the foundations on which he does lay them can be regarded as sound , only on condition that much of the destructive work which preceded it be pronounced unsuccessful . M. Tame seems to take great pride in this second part of his work , in his establishment , against John Stuart Mill , of the reality of bodies and the universal validity of deduction and the explanatory reason . He has seen , what Mill either did not see or did not regard , that scepticism of these things takes from physical science all its certainty and value . But Mr. Mill is plainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his premises with the same rigor that the English metaphysician did his , he would have ended in the same sceptical idealism . For instance , consider the objective reality which Tame vindicates for bodies . In addition , he says , to the possibilities or necessities of sensation for sentient beings , there exists in bodies such as a stone , and there would still exist if all sentient beings were destroyed , the molecales which make up the stone . But what does M. Tame mean here by molecule ? In the ordinary scientific conception of the word , it implies a minute quantity of matter and of force . But we may conceive it by either one of these attributes without the other . We may say that force is a mere quality or mode of action of matter , and hence a molecule is essentially matter ; or , on the other hand , we may say that the conception of a centre of force is entirely sufficient to explain all the phenomena of the molecule , and that to clothe it with matter also is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either that of matter or that of force , is essential to enable us to conceive a molecule . Yet M. Tame has rejected them both . What then is left to constitute this molecule which is the ultimate reality of the universe ? Tame explains it first by saying that he means by the molecules of a body " the movable motor powers which weigh on the ground , and which continue to go through with the same internal oscillations " ; and a little further on he designates as the ultimate objective realities " the motions of the body , " " the series of events which tend to accomplish themselves . " Power , weight , tendency , motion , - these , then , are what constitute the real world . But the first three of these , - power , weight , tendency , - are not these the old nonentity , force , under very thin disguises ? Finally ridding ourselves of him , let us see what we have left . Plainly motion , and motion alone . Motion , with nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no space in which it may occur . Surely , here is the most spectral and unsubstantial foundation on which philosopher ever attempted to base a world of real existence . Moreover , with what legitimacy or consistency does M. Tame refrain from driving the axe of his analysis through this last straw of the common-sense belief in objective reality , and showing it to be but illusion , as he has through all the rest ? He has already branded all the sensible properties of bodies , such as color , extension , form , solidity , as mere phantoms , extracts of the Ego more or less elaborated , altogether subjective in their character , and known only by a process whose essence is hallucination . But is not the idea of motion equally an extract from our subjective experience , an idea derived solely from our sensations and by that same hallucinatory process , - perception ? M. Tame admits it . Why then is this to be credited with objective reality , while the former are not ? The only reason that Tame seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some solid foundation for knowledge , and the very slight degree of subjectiveness and illusion that alone is left in the idea of motion . But logically the slightest tincture is as fatal as the fullest dose , and Tame ought no more to have granted objec // tive existence to motion any more than to matter , force , figure , or space . Indeed , the first implies the rest . Where there is motion there must be something to be moved , something to start the motion , some space or extended thing between two separate points of which the motion can take place , and finally some line or figure described by the motion . Logically , M. Tame ought to have gone on , and , with Mill and Bain , denied us any knowledge of an external world independent of us , or he should have halted while he still had something satisfactory to stand upon . A similar inconsistency M. Tame is betrayed into in his exposition of the explanatory reason and of induction . He essays to establish for them , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are connected , there is always a character included in the one which includes the other . Every subject includes its attributes . Therefore the presence of one general attribute which is known involves the presence of another as yet unknown one . Hence there is a reason , a law for everything , universal and invariable . Now , this proof seems to us valid only on one condition , i. e. that the various attributes of bodies have some real connection . If they are bound together by their inherence in a common substance , if tlzey are united by their origin as common effects of a common cause , if event is linked necessarily to event by some compulsive force , then it will of course follow that the presence of one attribute of a group or a series is a sufficient guaranty of the presence of the other . But if the ideas of substance and force be rejected as mental fictions , and cause be regarded merely as antecedent condition , as they have been by M. Tame , Then the attributes of a body become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere unconnected series of possibilities . There remains no longer the slightest reason why the presence of one of these discrete phenomena should at all involve the other . Possessing no deeper common being or inherent link to keep them together , but grouped by some chance , there is no reason why in another solar system , as Mill supposes , nay , in this present world at our very next observation , the qualities of bodies may not present a radically different association . // The fact is that there is no adequate foundation for the process of induction and the universal reign of law , except in the intuition of the principle of causality . Induction assumes the reality of causative power as necessary to explain the origin of all phenomena , and it implies that the various properties and events of bodies are necessarily connected together by underlying substances and forces . The process of deduction may perhaps l ) e explained by resolving the relations of content into those of extent , and taking as our guide the maxim , " whatever is a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir William Hamilton preceded M. Tame by many years in proposing this . But when it is sought to extend this method of proof to induction , it manifestly is unequal to sustaining the load laid upon it . Even deductive reasoning is not fully explained until the relations of quality and the distinctions of attribute and substance , cause and effect , are taken into consideration . As an acute thinker of our own country has remarked in a work which ought always to keep his name high on the roll of philosophical authorities , " We are able to give reasons and to support our knowledge by reasons , because we believe the various objects and phenomena of the universe exist and are produced in dependence upon one another . In cases of reasoning where actually existing things with their causes and laws are not concerned , it will be found that their relations , whether mathematical or logical , are treated or regarded as causal agents , constituting elements or operative laws , and as in this way involving necessitated or logical relations . " ( Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our criticism of M. Tame , we should say that his great faults as a psychologist were these three He slashes too freely with his undoubtedly keen analytic knife ; he relies too exclusively upon the external observation of physical science ; he distrusts too much the simple testimony of consciousness and universal spontaneous belief . rrhe lancet of the mental dissector may often discover many unsuspected elements , but for the most part dissecting consciousness is like dissecting the material brain . The most characteristic and vital qualities change and disappear before the bungling knife reaches them ; and often , while the operator // is cutting away , or thinks he is cutting away , some diseased or abnormal part , he destroys the most essential structures . We regard the discoveries of the anatomist and the physiologist as of great value to the psychologist . The mental philosophy which at the present day despises and ignores science marks itself as bigoted and absurd . The immense revolution which has takeii place in the prevalent theories of sense-perception since the application of physical investigation to the solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mental inquiries . But its proper place is a subordinate one . He who takes it as his sole or chief guide will fall into many errors . It is a general truth never to be ignored , that phenomena of one order can never be correctly interpreted by laws of an essentially different order . The physical inquirer , moreover , has this special disadvantage , that he can approach mental phenomena only from the outside . If our eyes could pierce everything , it would matter little at what point of view we took our station . But we have only a limited view ; we walk in the world as between opaque walls . And when with the microscope and the scalpel we seek to study the mind , we can reach only its dwelling or instruments , the nerves and brain . We may trace the course of afferent and efferent nerves , and time the vibrations as they pass along ; we may learn the varied structure of sensitive centres ; we may be-. hold the cerebral lobes contract and expand ; we may mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesion and disease ,  --  but still we are far from having entered at all the arcana of the mind . Even if , by some new optical instrument , we could gaze into the very centre of the brain , and instead of the inductions and probabilities , which are all that we now possess , we could behold every . minutest part and the phases of its daily history , the passage of every nerve current and the spinning of every molecule , we should still be on the outside of the mind , we should still have , not sensation but motion , not mind but matter . None of these physical facts are mental processes . They do not constitute them . They can not be found in them by analysis . There is no evidence sufficient to show that they even produce them . They are but their usual concomitants or conditions . The // physical antecedents might all be supposed to exist and act without the occurrence of a single conscious experience . The material and the mental events usually , indeed , stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that involves its necessity , still less the identity or equivalence of the two orders of events . Now , if this chasm which always separates the physical from the mental , and allows physiological observation only a view of the soul 's dress or tool-box , - never of the soul itself , - be borne in mind , much profit may be derived from such studies . But the tendency always is towards forgetting , or towards a bold push , such as M. Tame has made , to bridge the gulf . The higher ideas and faculties of the soul are traced down into the lower ; ideas into images , images into sensations . Able to perceive from the outside only the succession of events or their relation to their physical conditions , they are naturally led to regard these as constituting their whole character . The bond of personal unity will next be united by some analytical legerdemain , and the mind left a surface series unsupported by anything . The pillars of substance , force , extension , etc. , are next taken from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy oscillations performed and originated and taking place in nothing . Having thoroughly disorganized both the realm of matter and of mind , and having made the reader 's brain dizzy with contemplation of the universal motion which is all that is left of the solid globe , it is not difficult to slip him over the chasm before he perceives it , and persuade him that a motion and a sensation , an idea and a molecule , are only two faces of one and the same thing . Henceforth all is smooth sailing , inasmuch as the whole of psychology becomes now properly what Auguste Comte called it in his " Positive Philosophy , " " a simple subdivision of animal physiology . " If the one step , the identifying of motion with sensation , be legitimate , all the rest is sufficiently so . But if that step can not properly be taken , the chasm remains , the whole process must be con*Thmned . And we must say that M. Tame has failed in this one essential step . The only proofs that he offers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route that they enter the mind , and the existence of unconscious , rudimentary sensations which he had before essayed to establish . The latter we have already shown the illogicalness of ; the former merely suggests , but proves nothing . The words " mental " and " physical " mark the widest dietinction known to us in nature . Phenomena of the one order are entirely unlike phenomena of the other . Though constantly related in all human beings , they stand as constantly in sharp antithesis , as well in their simplest as in their most complex forms , at their nearest points of contact as at their most remote divergences . " Between the idea of a motion and the idea of a sensation , " says Tyndall , " there is nothing in common . " " No exertion of thought , " says Herbert Spencer , " can enable us to conceive either of these ultimate elements as convertible the one into the other . " But if , as Tame tells us , thought is but vibration seen from within instead of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its other side ? The fact is , that we can not study the mind successfully unless we take consciousness as our chief instrument . That alone gives us the inside view , the immediate vision . In its crude , unrefined form , as the ignorant , unrefiecting mind apprehends it , its testimony may perhaps mislead . It may need to be sifted . It may need to be tested , assisted , magnified , as Tame says ; but when its strict and pure deliverances are ascertained , we can never have too much of them ; we can find no source of information which can give us a more direct and more intimate knowledge of the mind . If consciousness needs the assistance and connection of physiology to attain a true knowledge of the mind , still more does the physiologist need the help of consciousness , and a firm trust in it . To find the very problems to be explained or the simpler mental elements which he would resolve them into , he must resort to the interspection of consciousness . No unconscious action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us anything of the conscious states of the soul . A true philosophy must not only start with consciousness , but will consult her at every turn ; and whenever it finds itself offending her deepest instincts , it will know that somehow it has missed the right path .
