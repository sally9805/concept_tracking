JEFFERSON 'S RETURN FROM FRANCE IN 1789 . N/I AN proposes , woman disposes. l**J- Such is often the way of this world . In the summer of 1789 , James Madison , who was the man of all others most solicitous for the success of the new Constitution of the United States , wrote to Jefferson asking him if he would accept an appointment at home in Generai Washington 's administration . " You know , " Jefferson replied , " the circumstances which led me from retirement , step by step , and from one nomination to another up to the present . My object is a return to the same retirement ; whenever , therefore , I quit the present , it will not be to engage in any other office , and most especially any one which would require a constant residence from home . " A few months after these words were written , he was in New York , Secretary of State ; and it was a maiden of seventeen that brought him to it . His situation in Paris had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What man was ever more happily placed ? In the most delightful city of the earth , he held a post which put all its noblest resources at his command . His mind was occupied with honorable duties which practice had made easy to him ; and the circle of his friends was among the most agreeable the world has known since human beings first learned to converse politely with one another . In the houses which he most frequented , - that of the Lafayettes , for example , - he found all that was truly elegant and refined in the ancient manners , joined to the interest in knowledge and in the welfare of man that distinguished the new period . High thinking was , as it were , in vogue . Every man , woman , and child in Paris , Jefferson said , had become a l ) Olitician ; so that wherever he went he met people ardently desirous to listen to him as a master in the science of human rights . Nobles caught something of the new spirit and rose superior to their rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manner . Jefferson , without thinking of it , was quite in the fashion when he finished a letter to Lafayette by sayin that in America people did not permit themselves to utter even truths when they had the air of flattery , and , therefore , he would say , once for all , " I love you , your wife and children . " He was on happy terms , too , with the diplomatic corps . Little as he had cause to love the realm of Britain , it was nevertheless with the British ambassador , the Duke of Dorset , that he was most intimate ; and his daughter struck up a girl 's friendship with the Duke 's daughter , that lasted beyond the term of their residence in Paris . The officers who had served in America were among the favorites in Paris society , and Jefferson 's house was their natural rendezvous . That prince of gossips and story-tellers , Baron Grimm , was among his familiar acquaintances . Madame de Sta*l , who was married during Jefferson 's second year in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant young wife of the Swedish ambassador . Among the lions who flourished in Paris at the time was De la Tude , who had been confined thirtyfive years for writing an epigram upon Pompadour . " He comes sometimes , " writes Jefferson , " to take a family soup with me , and entertains me with anecdotes of his five-and-thirty years ' imprisonment . How fertile is the mind of man , which can make the Bastille and the dungeon of Vincennes yield interesting anecdotes ! " That " family soup " of his played a great part in his social life . He lived in the easy , liberal style of Virginia , that harmonized as well with the humor of the time as with his own character and 547 // 548 habits . Few set dinners , but a wellspread table always open and generally filled ; no grand parties , but an evening circle that lured and detained the people fullest of the prevalent spirit . He had already the habit of mitigating business with dinner . If he had a difficult matter to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties interested to one of his light , rational , refreshing " family dinners , " and , afterwards , under its humanizing influence , introduce the troublesome topic . There were plenty of Americans in Paris even at that early day ; that is , there were perhaps as many individuals as there are thousands now . " I endeavor to show civilities , " he once wrote , " to all the Americans who come here ! " There might have been three or four in a month . Gouverneur Morris was there during the later ferments , shaking his knowing head at the French dream of a millennium , and arguing with Jefferson by the hour against everything that the plenipotentiary most believed ; full of talk , selfconfidence , and good-humor ; apt to be right in his predictions because exempt from the longings to which the heavyladen and anxious portion of the human race are subject . Hence , all his life as often as the millennium failed to come to time , he had the noble satisfacti9n of saying , " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , ruined by his endeavor to serve Virginia with Tuscan crowns during the Revolutionary War , and now often compelled to figure in Jefferson s memorandum-book for French fr , *ncs borrowed to supply his own necessities . Ledyard , the born traveller of Connecticut , came to the legation , poor and disappointed , incapable of remaining long in a place , plagued even from his boyhood with a mania to roam over the earth . He had sailed with Cook and revealed the tactless barbarity of that navigator ; had seen in the western coast of North America the richest of all fur-bearing regions ; and had come to Paris to set on foot the enterprise which Astor attempted twenty-five years after , when Astoria was founded . " But for the war of 1812 , " Astor used to say , " I should have been the richest man that ever lived " ; thus confirming Ledyard 's view . Failing in his object , he was helpless in Paris , and Jefferson chalked out a bold scheme for him worthy of his singular genius for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward from Monticello , wondering what there might be between his mountain - top and the Pacific Ocean . It was an inherited curiosity ; for his own father had felt it , and , indeed , all intelligent Virginians , from the time when Captain John Smith sailed up the Chickahominy in quest of the South Sea . He now proposed to Ledyard to make his way through Russia to Kamtchatka ; thence by some chance vessel to Nootka Sound ; and so , by one means or another , to what we now call Oregon ; and then strike into the wilderness , explore that vast unknown region , and endeavor to reach the western settlements of the United States . It was an audacious scheme , only fit for Ledyard , only possible to just such a man . He jumped at it . Through Baron Grimm , who was Own Correspondent in Paris to the Empress Catherine , Jefferson tried to obtain the requisite permission , which she , knowing the perils of the route , humanely refused ; and Ledyard started without it . Ragged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " kicked , " as he wrote to Jefferson , " from town to town , " and hoping " to be kicked round the world " until he was within two hundred miles of Kamtchatka , where an order from Catherine arrested him . He was brought back and turned loose in Poland . It was reserved for President Jefferson to get our first knowledge of the boundless prairie world , through the explorations of his neighbor , friend , and secretary , Captain Meriwether Lewis . Mr. Hawthorne has told us , in his sly , humorous way , something of the odd projects and eccentric characters // that solicit the notice of American representatives in Europe . Jefferson had his share of both . He saw , too , while living in Par is , how far-reaching the influence of the American Revolution was likely to be . He was among the first to hear of the agitation in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies of America , that has since led to their deliverance from all their oppressors , except those twin despots of the tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in October , iyS6 , from which he only learned that the writer was a foreigner , who had " a matter of very great consequence " to communicate , and wished him to indicate a safe channel . The plenipotentiary complied with the request . The letter arrived . " I am a native of Brazil , " it began . " You are not ignorant of the frightful slavery under which my country groans . This continually becomes more insupportable since the epoch of your glorious independence . " The Brazilians meant to rise , the writer continued , and they looked to the United States for support ; he had come to France on purpose to say so to the plenipotentiary of the United States , because in America he could not act in the matter without exciting suspicion . If Mr. Jefferson desired further information , the writer could give it him . Meet me at Nismes , Mr. Jefferson replied , in substance , whither he would go " under the pretext of seeing the antiquities of that place . " They met and conversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him his ideas on the subject as an individual , having no authority to utter a word on behalf of Congress . Those ideas were , that the United States were not in a condition to take part in any war , and that they particularly wished to cultivate the friendship of Portugal* a country with which they had an advantageous commerce . " But , " he added , " a successful revolution in Brazil could not be uninteresting to us " ; and " prospects of lucre might possibly draw numbers of 54.9 individuals to their aid , and purer motives our officers " ; and citizens of the United States were free to leave their country whenever they wished . With this cold comfort the Brazilian was obliged to depart from Nismes , and leave Mr. Jefferson free to gaze with rapture upon the Maison QuarrJe . A similar series of mysterious approaches brought him , about the same time , face to face with a Mexican , whose country was also preparing to rise against its oppressors. in dealing with this gentleman , the minister showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of the diplomatist 's craft . " I was more cautious , " he reports , " with the Mexican than with the Brazilian " ; and he threw cold water upon his hopes by saying that he " feared they must begin by enlightening and emancipating the minds of their people . " No revolutionist likes to be met with an observation of that nature . " I was led into this caution , " Jefferson explains , " by observing that this gentleman was intimate at the Spanish ambassador 's , " and that he was in the service of the Spanish government at the very time of making the communication . " He had much the air of candor , " adds the suddenly formed diplomatist ; " but that can be borrowed , so that I was not able to decide about him in my own mind . " All of which was reported at great length to Congress , with the additional intelligence that Peru , which had already lost two hundred thousand men in a failure to eject the hated Spaniards , could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in no other , Mr. Jefferson served Congress well ; he provided them by every l ) acket with long letters which , at that period , when journalism was but an infant art , must have been more interesting than we can now conceive , close packed as they were with information , curious , important , and new . It was not in far-off Peru , Mexico , or Brazil that he saw the most memorable proofs of the mighty influence of the " glorious Revolution " of which 14 // had been a part . Tie witnessed the " glorious " part of the French Revolution , having been present at the Assembly of the Notables in 1787 , and at the destruction of the Bastille in 1789 . His sympathy with that supreme effort of France to escape the Oppression of outgrown institutions was entire and profound , but it was also considerate and wise . Living in the most familiar intimacy with Lafayette and the other leaders of the preliminary movements , he knew everything and influenced everything they did ; for , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harmony , his official position was no restraint upon him ; and , to the last , his constant advice was , Save the monarchy ; France is not ripe for a republic ; get a constitution that will secure substantial liberty and essential rights , and wait for the rest . I suppose a good many of Mr. Carlyle 's readers were a little offended at Buckle 's sweeping assertion that no history of the French Revolution exists , and that no man had yet appeared who possessed the knowledge requisite for writing such a work . Mr. Carlyle 's French Revolution seems onljr to lack the form and cadence of poetry to rank with the great poems of all time , the " Iliad , " the " Inferno , " " Paradise Lost , " and " Faust . " Dickens might well call it a " wonderful work . " Its brevity and pictorial power are wonderful indeed , and a young reader who rises from its perusal penetrated and awe-struck may be pardoned for thinking that among his other acquisitions he has gained some insioht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight . Mr. Carlyle does not sacrifice the true to the picturesque : he gives us picture in lieu of truth . He has all a poet 's love for the picturesque , and is more guided in his selection of events for relation by their effectiveness than by their importance . Hence , as the antidotal Buckle remarks , we have a series of thrilling pictures , instead of that noblest and most difficult of all the products of the mind , a genuine history . The narrative of events written by Jefferson in extreme old age , brief , cold , and colorless as it is , taken in connection with his numerous letters , official and private , written at the time , will be prized by the individual who will , at length , evolve the French Revolution from the chaos of material in which it is now involved . Unfortunately , Jefferson went too far in extirpating his egotism . He was not vain enough ; he was curiously reticent concerning his own part in important events ; he instinctively veiled and hid his personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his busy retirement , to compose a history of the Revolution down to the taking of the Bastille , which would have been of imperishable interest . It was not merely that he knew the men and witnessed the events , but he preserved his incredulity , accepted nothing upon mere rumor , and personally investigated occurrences . If a rumor reached him that " three thousand people had fallen in the streets , " he and his secretary , Mr. Short , would go to the spot , and , after minute inquiry , reduce the number to " three. ? ' He was unwearied in sitting out the interminable sessions of the various assemblies , and thought little of riding to Versailles " to satisfy myself what has passed there , for nothing can be believed but what one sees or has from an eye-witness . " Occasionally his part in events was conspicuous , usually it was unseen , always it was such as became the representative of the United States . On the gathering of the No tables in 1787 , his advice to Lafayette was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing a recurrence of the Assembly ; to vote the king ample supplies in return for irreclaimable concessions ; to make the English constitution their model , not as the best conceivable , but the best attainable . " If every advance , " said he , " is to be purchased by filling the royal coffers with gold , it will be gold well employed . " In the interval be- // 1872. tween the Assembly of the Notables of 1787 , and the National Assembly of 1789 , he was guide , philosopher , and friend to the liberal leaders ; giving them numberless dinners and sound instruction in constitutional government ; furnishing them with American precedents and English law-hooks , as well as with summaries and elucidations of his own . One darling object of the Lafayette party was to introduce trial by jury . It was Jefferson who supplied them with a list of works on the subject , and added a brief discourse , in which juries were justified on two grounds : i . Because in every branch of government , legislative , executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the preservation of purity ; 2 . The chance of getting justice from a biassed judge was not as good as from a cast of the dice , but from a jury the chance was something better than from a cast of the dice . Hence , trial by jury was a good thing . The frightful winter of 1788-89 , when the mercury in Paris fell to twenty below zero , and the government was obliged to keep vast fires burning in the streets to preserve the poor from freezing , and every family that had anything to spare was called upon for a weekly contribution for the purchase of food , and long queues of hungerstricken women and children besieged every baker 's shop , and on cards of invitation to dinner guests were requested to bring their own bread , and the king himself was self-limited to his proper number of ounces , - this fearful season Jefferson was so happy as to be the means of mitigating to the people of France . In the autumn of 1787 it became known to the government that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American minister to make the fact known in the United States , in order to stimulate the exportation of grain to France . Jefferson wrote to Mr. Jay on the subject , and Mr. Jay caused the letter to be inserted in the newspapers . The result was that France received from America many thousand barrels of flour ,  - -  55 ' about thirty-five thousand , as it appears , - enough sensibly to lessen the distress , because the bulk of it arrived late , when the scarcity was extreme . Wild Mirabeau , acting upon imperfect information , and eager to make a point against the Ministry , charged M. Necker , in one of his harangues , with having refused an offer of American flour made by the American minister . Jefferson hastened to defend the government , and contrived to set M. Necker right with the public , without offending Mirabeau . The orator read Jefferson 's exculpatory letter to the Assembly , and apologized for the error . We have seen how susceptible Jefferson was to the spell of oratory , from the time when as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oration of an Indian chief in the Virginia woods , to the period when the eloquence of Patrick Henry charmed and amazed him in the House of Burgesses . And now in Paris he owned the resistless power of Mirabeau , of whose singular fascination he retained the liveliest recollection as long as he lived . William Wirt and Henry Clay both testified to having heard Mr. Jefferson speak of the peerless sway of that strange being over the minds of men of every class . " He spoke of him , " says Wirt , " as uniting two distinct and perfect characters in himself , whenever he pleased : the mere logician , with a mind apparently as sterile and desolate as the sands of Arabia , but reasoning at such times with a Herculean force which nothing could resist ; at other times , bursting out with a flood of eloquence more sublime than Milton ever imputed to the cherubim and seraphim , and bearing all before him . " At the supreme moment of the Revolution in July , 1789 , the National Assembly paid unique homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative . They appointed a committee to draft a constitution , the chairman being the Archbishop of Bordeaux ; and this committee formally invited the American minister 2/*fferson 's Re/urn from Fr*vzce in I 789. // to assist at their sessions and favor them with his advice . But , as it was to the king that the plenipotentiary was accredited , he was obliged to decline . He was not , however , to escape so easily . When the constitution was under discussion in the Assembly , article by article , differences of opinion arose which debate could not reconcile , because the opinion of one powerful faction was prompted and supported by interest . Two questions rent the Assembly , at length , into hostile parties : I. Shall the king have a veto ? 2 . Shall there be hereditary legislators in France ? The nobility put forth all their energies and used all their arts to have both these vital questions answered affirmatively . The popular party were not united on either question ; and hence there was widespread fear that the solid , small phalanx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their power . In the midst of this alarm , Jefferson received a note from Lafayette , informing him that he should , the next day , bring a party of six or eight friends to dine with him . The hospitable Virginian replied that they would be welcome ; and at the time named the party arrived , - just eight in all , including Lafayette . They proved to be leaders on the popular side , devoted to the cause , but unable to agree on the two dividing questions ; and Lafayette , taking a hint from the usual tactics of Jefferson , and forgetting his official character , had brought them together in this way for a friendly conference . The dinner passed . The cloth being removed , wine , according to the custom of old Virginia , was for the first time placed upon the table . First eat , then drink , appears to have been the Virginian order . Lafayette introduced the subjects upon which an interchange of opinion was desired , reninded them of the state of things in the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty of France so long as the enemies of liberty were united and its friends divided . " I have my opinion , " said he , " but I am ready to sacrifice it to that of my brethren in the same cause . " Some common conclusion , he said , they must reach and stand to , or the nobility would carry all before them and whatever They might now agree upon , he pledged himself to maintain at the head of the National Guard . It was four o'clock in the afternoon when Lafayette ceased to speak , and it was ten in the evening when the conference ended . During those six hours , Jefferson says , " I was a silent witness to a coolness and candor of argument unusual in the conflicts of political opinion ; to a logical reasoning and chaste eloquence , disfigured by no gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation , and truly worthy of being placed in parallel with the finest dialogues of antiquity . " The expedient was successful . Under the happy influence of Jefferson 's early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had personally sought among the vineyards of France and Italy , and with minds at once calmed and exalted by his silent , sympathetic presence , the deputies , at last , discovered ground upon which they could all stand . They agreed that the king should have a suspensive veto , and that there should be no hereditary legislators . France should be governed , thenceforth , by a constitutional king , and by one legislative body ; the latter elected by the people . Rallying upon these two principles , the liberal party presented a solid front to the aristocrats , and thus controlled the Revolution as long as it was controllable . During this conference the plenipotentiary had sat " silent " at the head of his table ; nor had he had any part in causing the meeting to be held in his house . Nevertheless , he felt that the etiquette of his position had been violated ; and , consequently , the next morning , he went to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and explained the circumstances . The information was superfluous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the confidence // 553 of the patriots , had already learned what had passed , and had approved the conference before it was held . He said that , so far from taking umbrage at the use to which Jefferson 's house had been put , he earnestly wished that he would habitually attend such conferences , because he was sure he would moderate the warmer spirits and promote attainable reforms only . Jefferson replied that he knew too well the duties he owed to the king , to France , and to the United States to meddle with the internal affairs of the country , and he should preserve carefully the attitude of a neutral and passive spectator , except that his heart 's desire would ever be for the prevalence of measures most beneficial to the nation . During these intense weeks , Jefferson had a foretaste of what he was to experience soon in New York and Philadelphia . He discovered that a man might be an American , a patriot , and a person of great ability and worth , and yet not sympathize at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two Gouverneur Morris dropped in at the legation for a dinner and a chat with the minister ; differing from him in opinion , in sentiment , in sympathy , yet glad of the information he obtained from him , and well affected toward him personally . Mark the difference between the humane and the tory mind ! Morris instinctively took sides with the hated aristocrats , associated chiefly with them , lamented their downfall , sympathized deeply with them in all their alarms and sorrows . When he saw the queen of France pass unsaluted by a single voice , he could not help calling upon the bystanders to give her a cheer , and only refrained himself from raising the cry because he remembered in time that he was not a Frenchman . He honestly bewailed the spectacle of the " high Austrian spirit " abased to the point of the queen 's bowing low in acknowledgment of one faint cheer . He exulted when the king showed for a moment the ferM which he deemed proper to " the Bourbon blood . " He sent a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later day , pressed upon the exiled Duke of Orleans a loan of fifteen hundred pounds . Such men as he are so constituted that the brief and shallow distress of a wealthy and picturesque family brings tears to their eyes , while they can calmly accept as inevitable doom the desolation and hopeless anguish of whole provinces of unornamental people . Their sympathies are genuine and acute , but limited . Burke , doubtless , was sorry that France was unhappy ; but the downfall and death of one picturesque woman tore his heart and unsettled his mind . " What is the queen disposed to do in the present situation of things ? " Jefferson supposes some one to ask in this same summer of 1789 . He answers the question thus : " Whatever rage , pride , and fear can dictate in a breast which never knew the presence of one moral restraint . " Again he writes : " The queen cries and sins on . " That is , as Madame Campan explains , she had a woman 's passion for deep play , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , no one who could keep her from squandering thousands at a sitting . Ministers lamented that , at such a crisis , France for the first time in ages should be cursed with a king who had the mania to live without a mistress , - a thing extremely inconvenient in a despotic court , because it makes the queen king . A virtuous man has no chance whatever with such a wife as that . Let him be neglectful , contemptuous , dissolute ; let him put upon her the ignominy of an avowed mistress let him be a Louis XV. , instead of a Louis XVI. ; and she is as submissive as a lamb . " This angel , as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke , " wrote Jefferson , forty years after , " with some smartness of fancy , but no sound sense , was proud , disdainful of restraint , indignant at all obstacles to her will , eager in the pursuit of pleasi*re , and firm enough to hold to her // desires , or perish in their wreck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count d'Artois , and others of her clique , had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury , which called into action the reforming hand of the nation ; and her opposition to it , her inflexible perverseness and dauntless spirit , led herself to the guillotine , drew the king on with her , and plunged the world into crimes and calamities which will forever stain the pages of n*odern history . I have ever believed that , had there been no queen , there would have been no Revolution . No force would have been provoked or exercised . " He adds that he would not have voted for the execution of the sovereign . He would have shut the queen up in a convent , and deprived the king only of irresponsible and arbitrary power . Morris , on the contrary , throws the blame of the subsequent horrors - including both Robespierre and Bonaparte - upon the destruction of the nobility ; and in this opinion he lived and died . He wrote thus in his diary , after getting home one evening from Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of politics . He , with all the leaders of liberty here , is desirous of annihilating distinctions of order . How far such views may be right respecting mankind in general is , I think , extremely problematical . But with respect to this nation , I am sure it is wrong , and can not eventuate well . " On the 4th of July , Mr. Jefferson entertained a large party of Americans at dinner , among whom and of whom were M. and Madame de Lafayette . Morris , after dinner , urged Lafayette to preserve , if possible , some constitutional power to the body of nobles , " as the only means of preserving any liberty for the people . " Happy the Morris who records in his diary such a remark as this , on the eve of such a period as France was entering in the summer of 1789 ! Placed in the midst of all this stir and effervescence , while as yet every . thing wore a hopeful aspect , - the Bastille in ruins , the people easily triumphant everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight ,  - -  we can not wonder that Jefferson found his situation , as he said , too interesting to abandon . He had no thought of abandoning it . Nevertheless , an event had occurred in his household which made it necessary for him to visit Virginia for a short time ; and while the Bastille was tumbling , he was impatiently waiting for the arrival of a six months ' leave of absence for which he had applied . And there was a member of his family who was waiting for it , perhaps , more impatiently that himself . When he left Virginia , in 1784 , he had three children , - Martha , twelve years of age ; Mary , six ; and Lucy , two . The eldest he took with him to Paris , where he placed her at a convent school ; and the two others he left in Virginia under the care of their aunt , Mrs. Eppes . A few weeks after his arrival in Paris , the intelligence reached him that his youngest daughter , Lucy , a strangely interesting child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week of acute suffering . After this cutting stroke he began to long for the coming of her sister , whom he wished to have educated in Paris . But she was one of the most clingingly affectionate of all children ; resembling those vines that we sometimes find in the woods , which cast adhesive tendrils round every object they touch , and can scarcely be disengaged without breaking . She could not hear of leaving her Virginia home without such distress as made her aunt shudder at the thought of sending her away . Her father tried to accustom her mind to the idea of leaving ; telling her that he and her sister Martha could not live without her , and that he would soon bring her back to her uncle , aunt , and cousins , whom she was so sorry to leave . " You shall be taught here , " he wrote , " to play on the harpsichord , to draw , to dance , to read and talk French , and such other things as will make you more worthy of 554 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a temptation more alluring : " You shall have as many dolls and playthings as you want for yourself , or to send to your cousins . " He concludes with all the good advice that tender and thoughtful fathers give , with some items less usual : " Never beg for anything , " and , " Remember , too , as a constant charge not to go out without your bonnet , because it will make you very ugly , and then we shall not love you so much . " The little girl could not be tempted . She scrawled a brief reply , in which she said that she longed to see her father and her sister , but , " I am sorry you have sent for me . I do n't want to go to France ; I had rather stay with Aunt Eppes . " In two postcripts she strove to impress the same lesson upon her father 's mind : " I want to see you and sister Patsy , but you must come to Uncle Eppes 's house . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his reason told him that the dangers were not great , and the advantages to the child would be considerable . But she must not sail till just the right vessel offered , a good ship , not too new and not too old ; nor until the right person was found to take charge of her . " A careful negro woman , as Isabel , for instance , if she has had the small-pox , would suffice under the patronage of a gentleman . " When he had mentioned every precaution that the most anxious fondness could suggest , he was still tormented with visions of new dangers . His long and fruitless negotiations with the Algerines called up the most horrible of all his numberless apprehensions . Suppose she were taken into captivity by those pirates , who had already driven the American flag from the Mediterranean , and menaced American commerce in every part of the ocean ! The thought preyed upon his mind to such a degree , that he wrote one letter to Mr. Eppes for no other purpose than to beg him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , but " to a French or English vessel having a Mediterranean pass . " The possible 555 peril of his daughter was a stimulant to his diplomatic exertions , and he told Mr. Eppes that if a peace were concluded with the Algerines , he should be among the first to hear it . " I pray you , " he added , " to believe it from nobody else . " These precautions were not needless ; for while the child was upon the ocean , in the spring of 1787 , a Virginia ship going to Spain was attacked by a corsair . After an action of an hour and a quarter , the Virginians boarded and took her , bound the pirates with the shackles themselves would have worn if the battle had gone the other way , and so carried them to Virginia . Well might the father say , when he knew that she had sailed , " I shall try not to think of Polly till I hear that she has landed . " He did think of her , however , constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties which the coming of so young a sister would devolve upon her . " She will become , " he wrote to her , " a precious charge upon your hands . The difference of your age , and your common loss of a mother , will put that office upon you . Teach her , above all things , to be good , because without that we can neither be valued by others , nor set any value on ourselves . " In his advice to his children and nephews , this truth is often repeated : " If ever you find yourself in any difficulty , and doubt how to extricate yourself , do what is rzgh , and you will find it the easiest way of getting out of the difficulty . " And , again , to his nephew , Peter Carr : " Give up money , give up fame , give up science , give the earth itself , and all it contains , rather than do an immoral act . And never suppose that , in any possible situation or any circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin o* ' She was really coming at length , though to the last moment she clung with all her little heart to her home . No promises , no stratagems , availed to reconcile her to going away . The ship lay at anchor in the river . Her cousins all went on board with her , and re // mained a day or two , playing about the deck and cabins , and making the ship seem like another home . Then , using the device by which Pocahontas had been taken prisoner in the same waters a hundred and seventy years before , they all left the ship one day while she was asleep ; and she awoke to find the sails spread , the familiar shore vanished , her cousins gone , and only her negro maid left of the circle of her home . Her affections then gathered about the captain of the vessel , to whom she became so attached that parting with him , too , was agony . Mrs. Adams received her in London , where she remained two weeks , and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of her age I never saw , " wrote Mrs. Adams . " So mature an understanding , so womanly a behavior , and so much sensibility united , are rarely to be met with . I grew so fond of her , and she was so much attached to me , that , when Mr. Jefferson sent for her , they were obliged to force the little creature away. ** It was a strange meeting in Paris between father and child , and between sister and sister . Martha , then a tall and elegant girl of fifteen , had a week 's holiday from the convent to meet her sister . The little girl did not know either of them , nor would they have known her . But they were both enchanted with her . Besides being a girl of singular and bewitching beauty both of form and face , she was one of the most artless , unselfish , and loving creatures that ever blessed and charmed a home . Her father was abundantly satisfied with " her reading , her writing , and her manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Eppes for the patient goodness which had borne such fruit in the character and mind of his child . During the week 's holiday , Martha took her sister occasionally to the convent , showed her its pleasant gardens and inviting apartments , familiarized her with the place which , as they all thought , was to he her abode for some years . At the end of the week the new-coiner went to the convent to reside , where as " Mademoiselle Polie " she soon became a universal favorite . Both sisters learned to speak French almost immediately , and soon spoke it as easily as they did English ; while the three adult members of the family , Humphries , Short , and Jefferson , when they had been two years in Paris , got on in speaking French not much better than when they landed . So , at least , Jefferson says in one of his letters . It does require about two years to begin to be at home in a foreign language ; but when you have reached a certain point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who keeps a daughter at a good specimen of a convent school for more than two years , may count upon her having a fit of desire to become a nun ; unless , indeed , the girl has much more or much less understanding than the average . These daughters of Mr. Jefferson were conscientious , affectionate , and sympathetic , lovers of tranquillity , of strong local attachments ; but they were not exceptionally endowed with intellect . One day in the spring of 1789 , he received a letter from Martha , in which she informed him of her wish to pass her days in the convent in the service of religion . At any time this would have been a startling announcement to such a father ; but particular circumstances greatly increased its effect upon him . Among the young Americans who had been studying in European universities during Jefferson 's residence in Paris , was a cousin of his own , Thomas Mann Randolph , known to the public in later years as member of Congress and governor of Virginia . In 1788 he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made the usual tour of Europe , lingering several weeks at the legation in Paris , where he renewed his acquaintance with Martha Jefferson . The little playmate of his boyhood had grown to be a beautiful girl of sixteen ; and she , on her part , saw the black-haired boy of her // early recollections transformed into a tall , alert young man , fluent in conversation , and of distinguished bearing . From slight indications in Jefferson 's letters of this year , I infer that the youth proposed to the father for the hand of the daughter , and that Jefferson , while approving the match and consenting to it , had not disturbed the school-girl 's mind by making the offer known to her . Young Randolph sailed for Virginia in the fall of 1788 , and the plenipotentiary , a few weeks after , applied for leave of absence , for the purpose of taking his daughters home . But at home the old government was going out and a new government was coming in ; and this was the reason why the leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris till late in the summer of 1789 . During this interval it was that iVir . Jefferson received the letter from his daughter which notified him of her desire to espouse the Church . He managed this difficult case with prompt and successful tact . He allowed a day or two to pass without noticing the letter . He drove to the convent on the third morning , and after explaining and arranging the matter with the Abbess , asked for his daughters . He received them with somewhat more warmth and tenderness than usual . Without uttering a word of explanation , he simply told them that he had come to take them away from school . As soon as they were ready , tney entered the carriage , and were driven home , where they continued their education under masters ; and neither then nor ever did a word pass between father and daughter on the subject of her letter . The dream of romantic and picturesque self-annihilation was soon dissipated in the healthy air and honest light of her father 's house . She accepted her destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-abnegation of the convent , so easy and so flattering , she led a life of self-denial which was not romantic nor picturesque , but homely and most real . 557 Late in August , 1789 , the tardy leave of absence arrived , and the family hastened to conclude their preparations for the voyage . There was not much to do . Everything at the legation was to be left unchanged , in the care of Mr. Short , who was to be the official chargi till Mr. Jefferson returned . To the last hour of his stay , this most zeaPus , faithful , and vigilant of ministers continued to render timely and fortunate services to his country 's commerce with France , which had grown under his fostering touch from next to nothing to something considerable . It had been happy for him , perhaps , if he had not gone to America then . In Paris , he was in harmony with the prevailing tone . In Paris , his fitness for his place was curiously complete . In Paris , he was sole of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beloved . In Paris , with an ocean between him and New York , he might have said No to the invitation the acceptance of which changed the current of his life . But it was in his destiny to go , and go he must . His five years ' life in Paris had done much for his general culture , and more for his particular training as a public man . He had become a swift , cool , adroit , thoroughly trained , and perfectly accomplished minister ; and this , without ceasing to be a man and a citizen , without hardening and narrowing into the professional diplomatist , without losing his interest or his faith in mankind . We have seen how deeply he was moved , on his arrival in Europe , by the condition of the peoile ; nineteen t*ventieths of the whole population , as he rashly computed , being more wretched and more hopeless than the most miserable being who could be found in all the length and breadth of America . These first impressions were never effaced . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political system - hereditary rank and irresponsible power - remained passionate and unspeakable . Whenever , in his letters or other writings of the time , he touches that theme , his style 7cfferson 's Retzt , ' ; z from France in 1789. // rises , intensifies , warms ; his words become short and simple , his similes homely and familiar , every phrase betrays heart-felt conviction . In his numerous contributions of material for the EncycZoj56fdie and similar works , he had evidently tried to get into them as much of the genuine republican essence as the censor could be expected to admit . It had been his delight to explain the state of things in America , where , as he said , no distinction between man and man had ever been known , except that conferred by office ; where " the poorest laborer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest millionnaire , and generally on a favored one whenever their rights seemed to jar " ; where " a shoemaker or other artisan , removed by the voice of his country into a chair of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws ascribe to his office " ; where , " of distinction by birth or badge , the people had no more idea than they had of the mode of existence in the moon or planets " ; having merely heard there were such , *. nd knowing they must be wrong . Hence , he said , that due horror of the evils flowing from that barbaric system could only be excited in Europe , where " the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions , where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation , where the many are crushed under the weight of the few , and where the order established can present no other picture than that of God Almighty and his angels trampling under foot the host of the damned . " Such utterances as these - and they abound in his Paris letters - were penned before Buncombe County in North Carolina had been " laid off . " They grew from the native elevation of his mind . They attest his highbreeding , as well as his humanity and good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizen ; for to be an American citizen and not feel so , is to be of the Vulgar . But , in those days , no American could boast of his country 's freedom , without laying himself open to a taunt . Did Jefferson forget that the laborers of his own State were slaves , when he vaunted the equality of its people ? Not always . He confessed the shame of it ; he foretold the ruin enclosed within it . " - What an incomprehensible machine is man ! " he exclaims , " who can endure toil , famine , stripes , imprisonment , and death itself , in vindication of his own liberty , and , the next moment , be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him through his trial , and inflict on his fellow-men a bondage one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose I " But , then , he threw the burden of delivering the slaves of Virginia upon that convenient resource of self-indulgent mortals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , would at length effect what the masters of Virginia ought at once to do . When the rheasure of the slaves ' tears should be full , then , " a God of justice will awaken to their distress , and by diffusing light and liberality among their oppressors , or , at length , by his exterminating thunder , manifest his attention to the things of this world , and that they are not left to the guidance of a blind fatality . " To the moment of his departure from Europe , we find him still a warm lover of France , and devoted to the alliance between the two countries . The last letter which he wrote to Madison in Paris contains a passage on the alliance which , coming from the placid Jefferson , we may almost call fiery : - " When , of two nations , the one has engaged herself in a ruinous war for us , has spent her blood and money to save us , has opened her bosom to us in peace , and received us almost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has moved heaven , earth , and hell to exterminate us in war , has insulted us in all her councils in peace , shut her doors to us in every port where her interests would admit it , libelled us in foreign nations , endeavored to poison them against the recep // tion of our most precious commodities ,  --  to place these two nations on a footing is to give a great deal more to one than to the other , if the maxim be true that to make unequal . quantities equal , you must add more to one than to the other . To say , in excuse , that gratitude is never to enter into the motives of national conduct , is to revive a principle which has been buried for centuries with the kindred principles of the lawfulness of assassination , poison , and perjury I know but one code of morality for men , whether acting singly or collectively . " Such was his feeling with regard to France and England in 1789 , before there were " Gallicans " or " Anglicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " among his countrymen . And since I am endeavoring to show what manner of mind Thomas Jefferson brought back with him to his native land in 1789 , I must allude to another matter . He carried his view of the rights of the individual mind to an extreme which , in that age , had few supporters in his own country . His moral system was strict ; his " doxy " was startlingly lax . The advice he gave his nephews on these points when they were college students might be summed up in words like these : Perfect freedom of thinking , but no other freedom ! To do right and feel humanely , we are bound ; it is an honorable bondage , and he is noblest who is most submissive to it ; but in matters of opinion it is infamy not to be free . These sentences , among others , he addressed to Peter Carr in college in 1787 : - " Religion . In the first place , divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty and singularity of opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . On the other hand , shake off all the fears and servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched . Fix Reason firmly in her seat , and call to her tribunal every fact , every opinion . Question with boldness even the existence of a God ; because , if there be one , he must more approve of the homage of reason than of blindfolded fear . You will naturally examine , first , the religion of your own country . Read the Bible , then , as you would Livy or Tacitus . For example , in the Book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still for several hours . Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus , we should class it with their showers of blood , speaking of statues , beasts , etc . But it is said that the writer of that book was inspired . Examine , therefore , candidly , what evidence there is of his having been inspired . The pretension is entitled to your inquiry , because millions believe it . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary it is to the law of nature . You will next read the New Testament . It is the history of a personage called Jesus .

Of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth , of a benevolent heart , enthusiastic mind , who set out with pretensions to divinity , ended in believing them , and was punished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted , according to the Roman law , which punished the first commission of that offence by *vhipping , and the second by exile , or death in furca . See this law in Digest , lib. 48 , tit. 19 , 28 , 3 , and Lipsius , lib. 2 , de cruce , cap . 2 . Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences . If it ends in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you will feel in its exercise , and the love of others which it will procure you . If you find reason to believe there is a God , a consciousness that you are acting under his eye , and that he approves you , will be a vast additional incitement ; if that Jesus was also a God , you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love . Your own reason is the only oracle given you by Heaven , and you are an1872.1 559 // swerable , not for the rightness , but uprightness , of the decision . " Such sentiments as these , which he cherished as long as he lived , were familiar enough then to the educated class of the United States , as of Christendom generally , but they were seldom stated with such uncompromising bluntness as in the passage from which these sentences are selected . He disposed of subtler questions in the same letter with equal abruptness : " Conscience is as much a part of a man as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings in a stronger or weaker degree , as force of members is given them in a greater or less degree . It may be strengthened by exercise , as may any particular limb of the body . " His long residence in a metropolis had not freed his mind from some provincial prejudices . He shared the common opinion of that age , that virtue was a product of the country , rather than the town , and that farmers were better citizens than mechanics or merchants . He spoke occasionally of mechanics as a class disposed to turbulence , as if he had derived his knowledge of them from Shakespeare 's Julius C*-sar , rather than from the workshops of his own time . He hoped the period was remote when many of his countrymen would be employed in manufactures ; which he evidently regarded , with Franklin , as a kind of necessary evil , or last resource of an over-populated country . But his special aversion was merchants . " Merchants , " he wrote , " are the least virtuous citizens , and possess the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island was so difficult , and Connecticut so easy , to be brought to consent to reasonable measures , he thought was this : In Connecticut there was scarcely a man who was not a farmer , and in Rhode Island almost every one was a merchant . All this , which savors of the country gentleman , seems to us of the present day crude and erroneous . Rhode Island might well pause , in 1787 , before surrendering control over the business to which she owed her whole subsistence . Observe a oneeyed man , when splinters are flying , with what anxious vigilance he guards the organ which alone saves him from a lifetime 's darkness. - Rhode Island 's commerce was like that last charge in David Crocj*et 's rifle , when he and the bear were eying one another across the brook . Such a man was Thomas Jefferson on his departure from France . He had his limits , of course ; he had his foibles ; he had his faults . But the sum of his worth as a human being was very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the glory and hope of America than any other living creature known to us . American principles he more than believed in : he loved them , and he deemed their prevalence essential to the welfare of man . What a plague it was to get across the sea eighty years ago ! With trunks packed ( and their trunks , as Jefferson intimates , were of American number and magnitude ) , the little family sat at home waiting a whole month for a ship ; and , after all , they could do no better than charter one in London to take them in at the Isle of Wight . It was a month of alarm in Paris . The harvest had not relieved the scarcity of food ; long queues of hungry people streamed still from every baker 's shop ; and the government itself , perishing of inanition , was obliged to spare a million a week to keep down the price of bread in Paris . Even in that dire extremity , the Protective System shut the ports of France against the food for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last days , and even his last hours , in Paris , in trying to persuade the Ministry to perml ! the importation of salted provisions from the United States ! Salt beef , objected the Count de Montmorin , will give people the scurvy . No , replied Jefferson ; we eat it in America , and do n't have the scurvy. * The salt tax will fall ofl said the minister . Jefferson could not deny that it might a little ; but , on the other hand , it would relieve the government from the ne 560 // cessity of keeping the price of bread below its value . But , resumed the Count , the people of France will not buy salt meat . Then , replied Jefferson , the merchants wo n't import it , and no harm will be done . And you can not make a good soup of it , urged the Count . True , said Jefferson , but it gives a delightful flavor to vegetables . Besides , it will cost only half the price of fresh meat . He convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure to M. Necker . But , as he was summoned to join the ship , he could only argue it briefly in a letter to M. Necker , which he left for Mr. Short to deliver and enforce . August 26th , the day on which this letter was written , he and his daughters left Paris for Havre . He might as well have waited awhile longer . They were detained at Havre ten days , during which he was so fortunate as to effect another practicable breach in the Protective System . American ships bringing cargoes to Havre found nothing to take from France , sometimes , except salt ; but salt could only be bought " at a mercantile price , " at places on the Loire and Garonne , away round on the Biscay side of France , involving six or eight hundred miles of difficult and perilous coasting . He now obtained from the farmersgeneral a concession by which American ships could load with salt at Honfleur , opposite Havre , paying only mercantile rates . It made a nice finish to his diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his country . Ten days ' further detention at Cowes gave the young ladies an opportunity to ride about the Isle of Wight , to peep into the deep well at Carishrooke Castle , and stare at the window in the ruins out of which Charles I. looked when he was a prisoner there ; perhaps , with comments on the character of the decapitated from their father . Mr. Pitt , it appears , had the politeness to send an order to Cowes exempting the baggage of the voyagers from search ; an attention which Miss Jefferson reVOL . XXX. - NO. i8i. 36 membered with gratitude , she being the member of the party who was most obliged . Twenty-three days of swift sailing and perfect autumn weather brought the ship into a dense fog off the coast of Virginia . For three days the thick November mist clung to the shore , preventing the captain from getting a glimpse of either cape . At length , trusting only to his calculations , in which , doubtless , a mathematical plenipotentiary had taken part , he stood in boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graze and a scare , just in time to avoid a storm that kept some companion vessels a month longer at sea . This , however , was but the beginning of mishaps . In beating up to Norfolk against the rising gale , they were run into by a , vessel rushing seaward before the wind , and lost part of their rigging . At Norfolk , two hours after the passengers had landed , and before any of their effects had been taken ashore , the ship caught fire . The flames gained such headway , that the captain was on the point of scuttling the vessel . But , at last , through the exertions of every sailor in port , the fire was got under , without damage to the papers of the minister or the daintier effects of his daughters . Nothing saved them but the thickness of the trunks , for the heat was so great in the state-rooms that the powder in a musket standing in one of them was silently consumed . Norfolk , which had been burned to the last house during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shanties , when Jefferson and his daughters landed there , November i8 , 1789 . They would have been puzzled to find shelter , as the only inn in the town was full , but for the generosity of its inmates , who insisted on giving up their rooms to them . On the very day of his landing Jefferson read in a newspaper that President Washington had appointed him Secretary of State . " I made light of it , " he wrote soon after to a lady in Paris , " supposing I had only to say No , and there would be an end of it . " // In all Virginia , there was scarcely such a thing at that time as a public conveyance . Friends , however , lent the party horses , and they journeyed homeward in the delightfully slow , easy , social manner of the time , stopping at every friend 's house on and near their road . They were ten days or more in getting as far as Richmond . The Legislature was in session , many of Jefferson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the capital of his native State without some mark of their regard . On the 7th of December , 1189 , the House of Delegates appointed a committee of THIRTEEN members ,  --  sacred number ! - with Patrick Henry for chairman , to congratulate him on his return , and to assure him of their esteem for " his character and public services . " The committee waited upon him and communicated the resolution of the House . His reply was in the taste of the period - " I RECEIVE , with humble gratitude , gentlemen , the congratulations of the Honorable the House of Delegates on my return ; and I beg leave , through you , to present them my thanks and dutiful respects . Could any circumstance heighten my affection to my native country , it would be the indulgence with which they view my feeble efforts to serve it , and the esteem with which they are pleased to honor me . I shall hope to merit a continuance of their goodness , by obeying the impulse of a zeal of which public good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . Permit me , gentlemen , for a moment , to separate from my general thanks the special ones I owe to you , the organs of so flattering a communication . " Resuming their journey , they arrived early in December at the mansion of Uncle Eppes in Chesterfield County , the happy home of Mary Jefferson 's childhood . Here they halted for many days . It was at this l ) lace that Jefferson received the official announcement of his appointment as Secretary of State . A gentleman from New York overtook him at Eppington , bearing his commission signed by the President ; also a letter from the President cordially inviting him to accept the place , yet giving him his choice to return to Paris if he preferred to do so . It was evident that . General Washington expected him to accept . Mr. Jefferson 's reply was such as became the citizen of a Republic . He told the President that he preferred to remain in the office he then held , the duties of which he knew and felt equal to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult and much more extensive . " But , " he added , " it is not for an individual to choose his post . You are to marshal us as may be best for the public good . " Therefore , if the President , after learning his decided preference to return to France , still thought it best to transfer him to New York , " my inclination must be no obstacle . " They were six weeks in reaching home . Two days before Christmas - a joyful time of year everywhere , but nowhere , perhaps , quite so hilarious as in the Virginia of that generation - all was expectation at Monticello . The house had been made ready . The negroes , to whom a holiday had been given , all came in from the various farms of the estate , dressed in their cleanest attire , and the women *vearing their brightest turbans , and gathered early in the day about the house . Their first thought was to meet the returning family at the foot of the mountain , and thither they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , long before there was any reason to expect them . As the tedious hours passed , the more eager of the crowd walked on , and these being followed by the rest , there was a straggling line of them a mile or two in length . Late in the afternoon , the most advanced descried. a carriage at Shadwell , drawn by four horses , with postilions , in the fashion of the time . The exulting shout was raised . All ran forward , and soon the whole crowd huddled round the vehicle , pulling , pushing , crying , cheering , // until it reached the steep ascent of the mountain , where the slackened pace gave them the opportunity they desired . In spite of the master 's entreaties and commands , they took off the horses and drew the carriage at a run up the mountain , and round the lawn to the door of the house . It was no easy matter to alight . Mr. Jefferson swam in a tumultuous sea of black arms and faces from the carriage to the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet ; some cried , others laughed ; all tried at least to touch him . Not a word could be heard above the din . But when the young ladies appeared , when Martha , whom they had last seen a child of eleven , stepped forth a woman grown , in all the glorious lustre of youth , beauty , and joy , and when Mary followed , a sylph in form , face , and step , they all fell apart , and made a lane for them to pass , holding up their children to see them , and uttering many a cry of rapturous approval . The father and daughters entered the house at length ; the carriage rolled away ; the negroes went off chattering to their quarters and there was quiet again at Monticello . " Such a scene , " wrote Martha Jefferson , long a fter , " meyer witnessed in my life . " As late as 1851 , Mr. Randall heard a vivid description of it at Monticello from an aged negro who was one of the boys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first visitors from beyond the immediate neighborhood was James Madison , who was about starting for New York to attend Congress . General Washington , it seems , had requested him to call at Monticello and ascertain more exactly the state of Mr. Jefferson 's mind with regard to the appointment . " I was sorry , " Madison wrote to the President , January 4 , 1790 , " to find him so little biassed in favor of the domestic service allotted him , but was glad that his difficulties seemed to result chiefly from what I take to be an erroneous view of the kind and quantity of business . " To the foreign department alone he felt equal ; but he dreaded the new and unknown duties which had been annexed to that . Upon receiving this information , the President wrote again to Jefferson . The new business he thought , would not be arduous , and if it should prove so , doubtless Congress would apply a remedy . The office , in the President 's opinion , was very important on many accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute it . He added a remark sure to have great weight with Jefferson , as , indeed , it ought : " In order that you may be better prepared to make your ultimate decision on good grounds , I think it necessary to add one fact , which *s this , that your late appointment has given very extensive and very great satisfaction to the public . " Still the President would not urge acceptance . He merely said , with regard to his own feelings , " My original opinion and wish may be collected from my nomination . " Jefferson yielded without further parley . " I no longer hesitate , " he wrote , February ix , " to undertake the office to which you are pleased to call me . " So Mr. Short had to break up the establishment at Paris , and send home the accumulated treasures of five years ' haunting of Paris bookstalls and curiosityshops . The day after accepting office , a. committee of his old constituents of Albemarle arrived at Monticello , and presented an address of congratulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched his whole public career with approval , and felicitated themselves upon the fact that it was they who had introduced him to public life . Above all his other services they extolled " the strong attachment he had always shown to the rights of mankind , and to those institutions that were best calculated to preserve them . " Much as they should like to enjoy his services again , they assured him that they were too much attached to the common interests of their country , and too sensible of his // 564 merit , not to unite with the general voice that called him " to continue in her councils . " In his reply , he again seized the opportunity to recall attention to first principles . The favor of his neighbors , he said , was indeed " the door through which he had been ushered on the stage of public life " and , after becoming reference to this circumstance , he added these words , which contain the chief article of his political creed - " We have been fellow-laborers and fellow-sufferers ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stru ( r ( Yles. lt rests now with ourselves alone to enjoy in peace and concord the blessings of self-government , so long denied to mankind ; to show by example the sufficiency of human reason for the care of human affairs ; and that the will of the majority , the natural law of every society , is the only sure guardian of the rights of man . Perhaps even this may sometimes err ; but its errors are honest , solitary , and short-lived . Let us then , my dear friends , forever bow down to the general reason of the society . We are safe with that , even in its deviations , for it soon returns again to the right way . ' ' The lovers , meanwhile , were improving their time . February 23. 1790 , the wedding occurred at Monticello . The clergyman who performed the ceremony was Mr. Maury , son of Jefferson 's schoolmaster . Young Randolph was heir to large estates , and the pair , after living awhile at Monticello , settled on land in the neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his children and then , in obedience to General Washington 's urgent desire , he set out for New York . The President had already kept the office six months for him ; business was accumulating ; he might well be a little impatient to see his Secretary of State . What a journey Jefferson had of it in the wet and stormy March of 1790 ! Twenty-one days of hard travel , including brief rests at Richmond , Alexan dna , Baltimore , and Philadelphia ! Delightful as old-fashioned travel may have been to a home-returning plenipotentiary , leisure being abundant and the season propitious , it was misery to a Secretary of State overdue , in chill and oozy March , at a point four hundred miles distant . He sent his carriage round to Alexandria in advance , intending to go in it the rest of the way . At that ancient and flourishing port , where he paused one day , he re-. ceived an address from the mayor and citizens ; from which we learn that his labors in behalf of commerce had become known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions in " the sacred cause of freedom , " had a word of thanks for " the indulgences which his enlightened representations to the court of France had secured to their trade " ; adding these words : " You have freed commerce from its shackles , and destroyed the first essay made in this country towards establishing a monopoly . " The last remark was aimed , probably , at British merchants and their resident agents , who still had a tight grip upon Virginia estates , and did not want any Virginia ships to go to Havre . Jefferson waived this compliment with his usual excess of modesty , but did not refrain from a sentence or two upon general politics : - " Convinced that the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind , my prayers and efforts shall be cordially contributed to the support of that we have so happily established It is , indeed , an animating thought that , while we are securing the rights of ourselves and our posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wish , like us , to emerge from their tyrannies also . Heaven help their struggles , and lead them , as it has done us , triumphantly through them ! " All this was cordial to the people of that day , who had scarcely heard , as yet , that there were Americans who felt otherwise . No one could say , in // March , 1790 , that it was the partisan who spoke such words . During the night of his stay at Alexandria , a late winter storm covered the ground with snow to the depth of eighteen inches . He therefore left his carriage to be sent round by sea , and took a place in the stage , his horses being led and ridden after him by his servants . So bad were the roads that the lumbering vehicle , as he wrote back to his son-in-law , " could never go more than three miles an hour , sometimes not more than two , and in the night but one . " During the few hours of his stay at Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was then on the bed from which he was to be borne , a month after , to his coffin . The old man , whose mental faculties seemed to remain undiminished to the last , listened with flushed face to Jefferson 's narrative of all that had occurred lately in France . He asked eagerly what part his friends there had taken , what had been their course amid the torrent of events , and what their fate . Jefferson had volumes to impart to him , and Franklin was almost exhausted by the intensity of* his interest in what he heard . Sunday , March 21 , 1790 , " after as laborious a journey as I ever went through , " Jefferson reached New York .
