txt We have described elsewhere this morning the character of the news which comes from New-Orleans , but there is one point in connection with the recent events upon which public attention is so greatly fixed that nothing can diminish its importance . We refer to the conduct of Gen. SHERIDAN . There seems to be a fixed belief in this distinguished officer 's mind that he is dealing with a community iu a state of insurrection , and that martial law is the only kind of law which can properly be applied to it . If there are any facts in possession of the Federal Government which justify this theory , they ought to be made known to the people without delay , if only in justice to the Government and its agents . At present , no such facts are before us . The State of Louisiana has long been ' in a disturbed condition , and civil brawls are frequent , but they are not at this moment of a character which places them beyond the reach of the civil law . We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is quite clear that party feeling runs very high , and quite possible that a violent outbreak may occur at any moment . But it is only a few months ago that the people ousted the Governor of the State , and only submitted to his reinstatement upon the interference of Federal authority . Now this state of things is not conducive to good order or good feeling , and while KeixoGa remains in office there is no probability of peace being restored . But such a dispatch as that which Gen. SHERIDAN sent to the Secretary of War on Tuesday is not warranted by any facts known to the public  --  could scarcely be warranted under any conceivable circumstances . We have never published such a document before , and we must say that nothing like it has ever been seen in a country under a constitutional government . It almost induces one to believe that the world has gone back two or three hundred years iu the theory and practice of government . CROMWELL did , indeed , servo Ireland pretty much as Gen. SHERIDAN proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that that system of government had been definitively abandoned . We are at a loss to make oat what are Gen. SllertinAN 's ideas of the Constitution under which he lives , or of the functions of Congress , or of the powers of the Executive , to say nothing of the powers which may rightfully be exercised by a Lieutenant General in the Army . He first of all suggests that Congress should pass a bill declaring a certain class of the people of Louisiana , Arkansas , and Mississippi , " banditti . " How many he would include in this class does not appear , nor does he explain since what date in our history it has been usual for officers in the Army to presume to dictate to Congress as to the legislation it should adopt . But a moment afterward a still better idea strikes him , and he says , " It is possible , . that , if the President would issue a proclamation declaring them banditti , no further action need . be taken except that which would devolve upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gem SHERIDAN would forthwith proceed to hang or shoot as . many persons as he chose to bring under his own description of " banditti . " We have , then , a plain proposal that the President shall " declare " an indefinite number of citizens " banditti , " and . that . Gen. SHERIDAN should then deal with them without benefit of Judge or jury . ? This would certainly be resolving government into its primitive elements , but there is a shorter cut stall which Gen. SHERIDAN might have recommended . It is for the President to declare the Constitution and all its amendments annulled , shut up Congress , put down all the newspapers , and then proclaim himself Dictator , with Gen. SHERIDAN as his sole Minister and chief executioner . If Gen. SHERIDAN had advised this course at once , he would scarcely have shown a greater ignorance or disregard of law than he has done in his most extraordinary , and we must add disgraceful , dispatch of Jan. 5 . We are sorry to find the Evening Post identifying the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many thousands of persons who have not yet had even an opportunity of expressing any opinion on Gen. SHERIDAN 'S blood-and-iron message , and who can not in any way be held responsible for it . It would be a strange thing to condemn a ' great party for the wild production of one fevered brain . We believe that the Republican Party would resent any violation of law , either on the part of Gen. SHERIDAN or of any intemperate or treasonable class at the South . And even though the President himself and some members of Congress approved of Gen. SHERIDAN 'S indecorous language , it would not show that the Republican Party was in fault , but only that at the moment it was unfortunately represented . The people will certainly not tolerate any revival of secession projects at the South , and they would support the President in any efforts he might be called upon to ' make to preserve the peace of the country . They have shown no evidence of any desire to go beyond that . But Gen. SHERIDAN proposes to place three States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Presidential proclamation . We should . be loath to think that the Republican Party would support such a project as that , and we think we may venture to say that it will do nothing of the kind .
