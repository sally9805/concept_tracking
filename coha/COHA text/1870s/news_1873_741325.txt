txt The conference , which met on Thursday , of the representatives of the various benevolent associations to consult in regard to the best methods of dispensing charity , had no result of much practical value . This was due partly to the meeting possessing no definite information as to the real amount of poverty and suffering at the present time , and partly to the inherent difficulties of the subject . In fact , some of the recommendations of gentlemen whose hearts were touched , but who were somewhat new to the complications of the question , were peculiarly child-like and . innocent  --  as that of a new Commissioner of Charity who was in favor.of turning an old market into a grand receptacle of the poor , where every vagrant and destitute person could have his separate bed , his breakfast , and his boots blacked , and . then return to these comfortable lodgings at night ! The truth is , that to the administrative world the problem of pauperism is , like that of the " origin of evil " to the theological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing herself to it since the time of ELIZABETH , and is apparently further from its solution than she was then . The difficulties result from an unfortunate tendency of " poor human nature " to prefer help from others to self-help , and from the growing pressure of population on subsistence in crowded communities . There is , unfortunately , always a considerable number of persons in every society who live , during the Summer of their prosperity , like the butterfly of the fables , and who find themselves shivering at the approach of every Winter at the doors of the industrious ant who had worked while the others played . The improvident and the lazy are always ready to fall back on the saving and hard-working who have accumulated . These two classes belong to all countries and civilizations ; and the weak and self-indulgent are a class peculiarly ready to increase if there is any sudden pressure upon them . The grand good fortune of this country is , that its economical conditions are the most favorable ever known in the history of the world . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without labor ; but in those man degenerates . There are lands where the utmost industry can not extract a , suitable support for a family . In these , want and weakness diminish human force . But we lie between . We have land enough , but it requires severe labor , and with that , it gives abundant reward .. The wages of rural labor are a good measure of our prosperous condition . Precisely a century since , the bushel of wheat brought a dollar , gold , in England , while the daily wages of the laborer was twenty cents , or one-fifth of a bushel . In Minnesota to-day the bushel brings its dollar gold , while the daily wage is $1 60 , or *a bushel and a half of wheat ! Or , in other words , the American laboring rural class receive eight times the share of production the English did a century ago . Now , where such a state of prosperity exists , there must be the greatest caution about interfering with natural laws . In this country , industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , but commence the accumulation of wealth . If great crowds of laborers are at this moment without food . or money in New-York , it will be found that the immense majority of them spent too freely when they had money , or joined in strikes and unions , or preferred the excitements of the City to quiet labor in the rural districts . It may seem unfeeling to say so , but sober truth compels the remark , that a moderate measure of want will not injure our working classes . They have been carrying a very high hand for some time . They have had enormous wages , and many have worked few hours a day . They have joined in very unreasonable strikes and oppressive unions . They have prevented the instruction of apprentices , and have often violently compelled other workmen to submit to their strikes . A little feeling of the necessities of labor will not hurt them . They will come out of the Winter wiser and more sober men . An injudicious charity among them is , in fact , sustaining strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that our decent and . honest working classes can tide over several months without much assistance . Then there is another class which will abound this Winter in our City  --  the professional " bummers , " vagrants , and beggars , who will drift in from all the surrounding country , even from hundreds of miles away , hearing of warm quarters , " free breakfasts and boots blacked for nothing . " These already begin to swarm in the station-houses and to besiege the charitable . The harder the charity ministered to these people the better for them . The truly needy , those who suffer in silence , who find cold and hunger and bitter penury stealing on them each day , and no friend near to aid , the helpless women , deserted widows , and homeless children  --  these are those whom our community would gladly help , but can not discover . The committee selected by the conference , of whom Mr. SCHULTZ is Chairman , would . do well to consider - whether there is not some way to protect the community from imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practical mode which occurs to us is to secure an office , say in the Department of Charities or in the Cooper Union , to be used simply as a " Bureau of Charities , " with , perhaps , a female clerk at moderate salary . Here a citizen wishing to know whether he is relieving a deserving case or one who has no help elsewhere , will furnish the name and address of the case , and the duty of the clerk shall be to write to the appropriate charity , inquire whether the applicant receives aid already , or whether anything is known . there of the case . Such letters of inquiry could be mainly printed letters . The practical working of the bureau would be as follows : Mr. Smith , a wealthy householder , is applied to by a poor woman representing herself as a widow with a family of small children , living near Eleventh avenue and Fifty-second. street , sick and nearly starved . He applies to the bureau for information . The clerk sends at once her printed missives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widows ' Society , to the Sick Relief , to the Industrial School in the quarter , to the Children 's Aid Society , and whatever other societies could give information or would be likely to yield relief . Within twenty-four hours the clerk is perhaps informed that the widow is a beneficiary of each of these societies and of a dozen others , or she learns that none have provivsly aided . her , but are willing to do so if means be supplied ; or that the case seems entirely deserving , and one of bitter want . The householder , then , is able to proceed intelligently , ? and . either visits the woman herself and relieves , or furnishes some one of those charities with the moans to do so . Imposition is prevented and want assisted . Manifestly soon such a " bureau " would need a considerable clerical force , and therefore more expense to carry it on . Still its workings would be invaluable .                   @ @
