txt The tailed men have been found at last . Ever since the days of HERODOTUS there have been people who believed in the existence of a nation decorated with tails , although no traveler ever succeeded in penetrating into their country . This want of success was due to the vague and wandering character of that country . At one period it was popularly supposed to be in the region of the frozen ocean ; at another it was confidently located in China , and during the last century the tailed men were believed to reside in the heart of Africa . Just as soon as an explorer reached their alleged country , they silently flitted away to some more distant land , and thus uniformly succeeded in eluding all pursuit , and in preserving their privacy unimpaired . At last , however , a Wesleyan missionary who has beau engaged in a professional tour through the South Sea Islands has run the tailed men to the earth on the Island of New-Ireland . He found that they corresponded closely to the description given of them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage race , inhabiting dark and difficult forests , but they kept up the good old custom of their forefathers by piercing small holes in their aria-chairs and piano-stools for the accomodation of their tails . These tails are described as being not more than from three to four inches in length , and are hence of little use in point of flies . Still that they are true  --  not to say ower true  --  tails , no anatomist can honestly deny , and we are thus compelled to admit that the venerable legend of the tailed nation has a substantial basis of fact . It will not do for skeptics to assert that these tailed men are nothing more than a new species of ape . Their humanity is conclusively proved even by the few facts that we know about them . Do apes carry about with them camp-chairs with perforated seats ? Do apes distill illicit whisky , and beat their wives with real clubs 1 Do apes practice tobacco-smoking as a profession , and compel their females to cut kindling wood and carry in all the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men is an unanswerable proof that they have risen above the plane of the brute , and developed the most characteristic attributes of man . No doubt they are the connecting link between apes and men , but only blind prejudice can ignore their essential humanity , and class them with the orang-outang or the gorilla . It was the opinion of Lord Mosnrippo that originally all men possessed tails , but that they gradually wore them off by persistently sitting on hard substances , such as the rural district-school bench . The new discovery shows the soundness of Lord MONBODDO 'S judgment . Why is it that one race of people alone has preserved the primeval tail ? Evidently because they have cherished it with the utmost care , and designed their household furniture with a constant aim to its accommodation . Had our immediate ancestors used perforated chairs , and steadfastly refused to sit down upon anything else , Lord MONBODDO would never have had occasion to trace the decline and final falling off of the luxuriant tails of prehistoric times . Now that it is demonstrated that tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty fancy , it is not impossible that unexpected revelations of the existence of contemporary tails may be made by bold and honest scientific men . It has been frequently suggested that Lord MONBODDO wrote with a degree of earnestness only to be fully accounted for upon the hypothesis that ho was writing of matters within his own personal knowledge . It ' we can imagine a man secretly possessed of a tail , and writhing under the belief that he was in that respect a tuna naturcr , we can understand why he should write a book to prove that the tail is a proper attribute of humanity . If such was Lord MON BODDO 'S condition , he might naturally have become a sort of reversed fox , anxious to impress upon his fellows that tails should be worn by all intelligent and cultivated men . If he really had a tail , his conduct is easily explicable , and the intense earnestness with which ho wrote is seen to be entirely natural and appropriate . A similar train of reasoning explains the ardor with which the Darwinian hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the habit of wearing surreptitous tails , which they dare not openly acknowledge , they would naturally seek to educate public opinion up to the point of recognizing the tail as a manly and honorable appendage . In order to do this , their most efficient plan would be to convince us that we are descended from the apes , and that the loss of our tails is a matter to be regretted , since it places au obstacle in the way of readily dedionstrating our simian origin . When every one should have been induced to adopt this theory , the time would be ripe for the discovery that Professor So-and-so has a well-developed three-inch tail , and is thus entitled to be regarded as a special authority upon all questions connected with the descent of man . It is by no means certain that the tall is a rarity in modern society . Being , as it is , under the bau , no man with a tail would be willing to confess its existence . Such a peculiarity would admit of easy concealment among all civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading advocates of Darwinism , but even our best and most intimate friends , may have secret tails . The world may think them gay and happy . but the heart of him who has a concealed tail knows its own bitterness . For such the discovery of the tailed men of New-Ireland is the dawn of hope . As our intercourse with this strange tribe becomes closer the prejudice against tails may vanish , and the day of which Lord MONBODDO dreamed , and for which the Darwinians have sighed ? the day when tails shall become the bridge to social distinction  --  may arrive even during the lifetime of the present genera-. tion . It ought , perhaps , to be added , that the traveling Wesleyan missionary has not actually seen the tailed people with his own personal eyes , but has gained his knowledge of them from intelligent natives of the usual South Sea pattern . There is no doubt , however , that these natives told the truth , for ho expressly asserts that they are cannibals . Let us , then , give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for whatever beneficent results may tiow therefrom .
