Damask I remember our Hebrew professor 's daughter . JACK . We exchanged sighs , glances , smiles , letters , and vows of love for several months . DAM . Damask ( L. ) . You had got as far as that when I left the University . JACK . And I stopped there . It appears I was only tenant at will of her heart  --  subject to a month 's notice to quit . I was ejected .

( Looks over the packaged . ) JACK . Mostly . They were the cause of our separation . The governor refused to send me any more money . It affected her so deeply that she wrote to me that we must part ; that she was resolved to bury herself from the world .

But he thinks the world of you , for you were the best and soberest of all my college friends . So if you will only write to him  --  DAM . Damask ( taking his hand ) . Certainly . I 'll do it at once . I 'll send him all these documents with a strong personal letter , and if you will add a few lines of contrition at the end , you 'll be sure of forgiveness .

That woman is invaluable for expedients . You could n't corner that woman if you were Shakespeare himself . She found a way out of the difficulty immediately . Instead of Tullia , a female slave , we make it Tullius , a male slave , and there you are . PROF . Professor It 's impossible ! ( Crosses to C. ) I ca n't make her a male slave .

No , I wo n't submit to have the part cut down like that . SNAP . It 'll add to the piece immensely . My youngest boy , Tom , will take the part , and make it the hit of the performance . PROF .

Damask ( L. ) . Is there a parrot in the play ? SNAP . No , no ; but the second act is set in a grove of pines , and she thought it would look realistic to have the parrot discovered on one of the pine-trees . Bit of realism  --  see ? These things take immensely . DAM . Damask Have you got a pine-tree ? SNAP . Not exactly a pine-tree , but my wife has hit on a capital substitute . She saw an orange plant in a tub at the drug store , and got the loan of it for the run of the play . We give the druggist a line on the bills for its use .

We had n't anything for the Sabine warriors to wear . DAM . Damask And how did you manage ? SNAP . My wife did it . When we went to sleep last night , there were all the Sabine warriors before our minds ' eye without a rag on .

Nisbe ( nods , and then squeezes close to his arm ) . I wo n't . Will the performance be very good , papa ? PROF . Professor I do n't know . I ran away from rehearsal to-day in misery .

Yes , but my wife has just remembered that everybody 's on the stage in Tullia 's scene , and we want him to do the tumult of citizens behind , and to ring down the curtain . We have n't another soul to spare . PROF . Professor ( in despair ) . Then what 's to be done ? JACK . Awful fix , is n't it ? SNAP . Do n't lose your head . My wife 's got an idea . ( Checking off on his fingers . ) You see Tullia can not be a female slave , because we have n't a young woman left ; it ca n't be a child , because he has got his hands full with the tumult . JACK . And the curtain . SNAP . So there 's nothing left but to condense the whole part into a letter . PROF . Professor A letter ! ( Crosses to R. ) Are you mad ? SNAP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a letter .

Ai n't that a warning ? JACK ( laughs ) . Is the nine of spades fatal ? SUSAN . Do n't laugh , Mr. Chumley ! Miss Nisbe used to laugh at the cards once , but you should see her now .

JACK . My dear fellow , it is not a question of leave of absence . I wish to tender my resignation , and say good-by to the stage forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that was the only thing wanted . ( Starts up , but with difficulty , on account of his tight dress . ) You ca n't go  --  you are indispensable . ( Crosses , L. ) I do n't refer to your talent , but to your unapproachably aristocratic wardrobe , and your nationality . I tell you , I 've been a manager for twenty-five years , and I never had a leading man before with eight suits of clothes . How can we give a society play if you go off with your dress suit and your crush hat ? JACK . My dear Snap  --  SNAP . No false modesty ! Your things fit every one of the company like gloves . Even my wife made an immense hit as Nan , the Good for Nothing , in your velvet jacket . JACK . We can easily settle that objection . I 'll leave you my theatrical wardrobe as a souvenir . SNAP ( with feeling ) . Mr. Chumley , you have not only a true society manner , but a genuine respect for art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is not all .

It has been the dream of my life to manage a theatre in London  --  or anywhere , for a whole season . You are discharged on the spot . JACK . Well , then , it 's settled ? SNAP . I should say so ! But you must come with me to my wife ; you must be there when I tell her about the theatre . You 'll see what joy means . That unapproachable woman has borne our privations with resignation and courage , but I know that it has long been the secret hope of her heart to be able to stay in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll go to her together . JACK ( hesitating ) . I 'll follow you later . I 'd like to say good-by to this family first . SNAP . Very proper . The Professor is in there . ( Points , L. D. ) JACK ( crosses to L. ) . Thank you . I 'll knock . ( Goes to door and is about to knock , when he hears NISBE 'S voice . ) NISBE ( outside ) . This way , Susan . In here . JACK ( aside ) . Oh , there she is . SNAP . Well , why do n't you knock ? JACK imposes silence by a gesture as NISBE ENTERS , L. C. , with a large valise , SUSAN following with a basket . NISBE ( resting , C. ) . Put the basket down yonder .

The Professor is in that room . ( Points L. ) NIS . Nisbe I suppose you are waiting for him . I 'll knock at his door . ( Goes to L. , and sees JACK . ) O Mr. Cassius !

Wait here a little while  --  I mean  --  that is  --  you might disturb your father just now . ( Comes from door . ) SNAP ( officiously ) . Oh , no ! He 's only packing up . I 'll knock . ( Crosses to C. ) As he goes to door , JACK and NISBE get R. and L. of him , and keep him back . JACK ( L. ) . No , no ! NIS . Nisbe ( R. ) . It 's not at all necessary . SNAP ( C. , comprehends the situation . Looks at both , chuckles , and then goes ; aside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scene two  --  the lovers meet ! Everything in this house is as good as a play . ( Aloud . ) All right ! ( Crosses to R. ) Do n't be afraid . I wo n't disturb the Professor . It would be downright rude of me when you two are decidedly opposed to it . JACK ( confused . Waves him off , and takes NISBE 'S hand ) . The fact is , Miss Nisbe , I have something very important to say to you . NIS . Nisbe Is it very important ? JACK ( warmly ) . I think so ! NIS . Nisbe ( warmly ) . Really ? JACK ( looks at his watch ) . And time is pressing . The train leaves in two hours . ( Crossing C. ) I must leave for New York with my father by the twelve o'clock express . NIS . Nisbe ( crosses to C. ) . And I start for Boston with mamma at 12.20 . JACK ( looks at SNAP impatiently ) . Who knows when we may meet again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNAP impatiently , then says sadly ) . Perhaps never . SNAP ( bluntly ) . Then I should say the best thing would be to speak right out now . JACK ( crosses to C. ) . But , my dear Snap , what I have to say to this young lady must be said without witnesses . SNAP ( crosses to C. ) . Then all I 've got to do is to exit centre , and leave you together . NIS . Nisbe ( innocently ) . No , no ; that wo n't help us . Even if he goes ( crossing to C. ) we may be interrupted . Papa may come in any moment . SNAP . She thinks of everything , just like my wife . NIS . Nisbe ( to JACK ) . I do n't suppose you could write to me ? JACK ( eagerly ) . No ; that 's quite impossible . SNAP ( wickedly ) . Quite impossible . There are some things that can only be settled by one 's own lips . NISBE crosses , R. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , to enter L. D. JACK . Of course ! NIS . Nisbe ( navely ) . It 's a dreadful plight , is n't it ? And I 'm sorry I ca n't help you out , I have to go and pack up now in there . ( Points R. ) This valise . ( Goes towards R. with valise , and turns . ) Is there anything so fatiguing as to have to pack a big valise all by yourself ? JACK ( goes to her eagerly ) . If you would allow me to help you  --  NIS . Nisbe I should be delighted . You know it 's ever so much easier to put in things while somebody holds the valise open for you . JACK ( takes the bag , and presses it to his heart ) . Let me hold it . I 'll do it with all my heart . NIS . Nisbe ( crosses to SNAP ) . I hope you will excuse us , Mr. Snap , but you see we have n't a moment to lose . JACK ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SNAP . Oh , yes , I know . Well , if you lose no time , you may catch the train . NIS . Nisbe That 's so  --  come ! ( EXITS , R. D. ) JACK . Oh , yes . I 'm coming . ( EXITS after her . ) SNAP ( sighs ) . Ah , I guess he wo n't need any prompter in the part he 's playing now . READY ANGELICA and MRS . BABBITT , to enter L. C. The PROFESSOR ENTERS , L. D. , in shirt sleeves , with a valise half full . PROFESSOR .

Professor In there ? No , no . SNAP . I 'm glad of that . The fact is , I 'm on guard , and nobody must go in here for fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only take my place  --  PROF . Professor ( beginning to pack ) . Yes , but  --  SNAP . The fact is , there are two people in there who are preparing a surprise for you . ( Aside ) I 'll run over to the hotel , and send his lordship . If those two in there are firm , they may get his consent on the spot . If they ca n't get it , they had better know the worst at once . The Professor sha' n't have more than one tragedy on his hands at the same time . ( EXIT , L. C. ) PROF . Professor ( sighing ) . I do n't believe anything will surprise me now . ( Goes up into alcove to get some wearing-apparel , which is placed there . ) ANGELICA ENTERS , L. C. ; speaks back . ANGELICA .

Mrs. Babbitt I do n't see the necessity . Attend to me . I have given you the keys of all the other rooms . Keep them until your father demands them ; that is , if he ever has the face to communicate with you . You may lock up this room when we leave . I merely wish to take my portrait out of it .

MRS . B. Mrs. Babbitt ( to ANGELICA ) . Did you speak ? ( PROFESSOR totters to his feet and buries himself on sofa at fire . ) ANG . Angelica ( L. ) . Do n't be so harsh , mamma . I have forgiven Harry . MRS . B. Mrs. Babbitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an explanation , and made it all up . To be sure , he was guilty in deceiving me ; but as his deception was in trying to make me believe he was worse instead of better , I could easily forgive it . He is a perfect angel . He has no past . He never had a past . I think I like him that way best . READY MULBERRY , to enter L. C. MRS . B. Mrs. Babbitt ( L. C. ) . Really ! So he 's got you to believe him again ? Poor lamb ! But your husband has youth as an excuse . He has n't played the clown at sixty , PROFESSOR groans. and disgraced a gray-haired wife and grown-up children . He has n't descended to the meanness of plotting with your domestics behind your back . PROF . Professor ( coming down ) . But , Zippy ! I only tried to give you a pleasant surprise . MRS . B.
