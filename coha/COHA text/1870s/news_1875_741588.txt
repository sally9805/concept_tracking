txt Grace Greenwood never said a better thing than when , in explaining that she was not the wife of one of the publishinghouse of LIPPINCOTT &; Co. , of Philadelphia , she added , " and . I hereby warn all persons not to trust me on his account ? It was a sharp , . humorous retort from the woman 's aide of a certain question ; but a retort , however sharp , is not an argument , or even a rejoinder ; and after the crack , and the flash , and the smoke have passed away , it leaves the point at issue just where it was before . A certain Mrs. ABORNS , in California , has recently taken up the subject much more seriously , and with mach more apparent effect upon the other side . Mrs. ABORNS ' husband " advertised " her ; that is , he announced that she had left his bed and board without just provocation , and that he would pay no farther debts of her contracting . Whereupon Mrs. ABORNS issues a " card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what human being has the right to do so . She then states her case , - which is , summarily , that she had been Mr. ABORNS ' wife ten years , which " makes 3,650 days , " during which she had cooked about ten thousand meals , set the table as many times , cleared the table , and washed the dishes ; she had cleaned and . swept the house more than ten thousand times , made her own clothing and that of her children , besides doing some sewing for others , the payment for which went into the common stock . ' She had , moreover , milked three cows twice a day , making about seven thousand milkings , taken . care of the milk and butter , fed the poultry , and even helped Mr. ABORNS in the barn upon a pinch . For all this she says she has had nothing . She had nothing when she went to Mr. ADORNS , and she has nothing now . She has been housed , fed , and clothed , and when ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use her own phrase , " something after the way that a farmer would hire a horse if his own was sick and unable to work . " In ? the midst of all this she mentions one matter which deserves to be considered by itself : she has had six children , of ' whom five are now living , the youngest being two and a half years old . After this setting forth of the facts of her case , she asks : " What mail is there who would do the work that I have done for the same compensation 1 " She admits - that her husband . " is in many respects a good man , " that he is " industrious and  --  like hundreds , yea thousands , of othere  --  honest with everybody except his own family . " She declares that she chooses to live with him no longer , her reasons being " her own ; " and she solemnly protests against his " publishing " her , and asks what right he has to do so ? Mrs. ABORNS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so put her case that it is likely to make an impression . The multiplying all the cookings ; and table settings , and milkings , and the rest , was adroit . They sound very imposing when they are set forth by the thousand . Aud in sober and candid consideration of the subject , it is very plain that Mrs. ABORNS has not had a very easy life ; and it is also quite true that Mr. ABORNS could probably not have got a man to do the same work that she has done for the same pay . But is her case therefore one of hardship peculiar ' either to herself or to her sex ? Let us see . She admits that she had nothing when she was married , in which she is like most women ; and because she has nothing now , after all the thousands of chores that she has done , she proclaims to the world that she is underpaid . But why has she nothing more now than she had when she began her married . life ? Simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she has , or had before she left him . For herself and for her children she had a claim , enforceable by law upon any property that he possessed , and upon all the money that he earned . In every acre of ground that he may have acquired she had a vested right of one-third , her title to which is not abrogated . even by this desertion . Her husband was plainly an industrious farmer : suppose he were to enumerate by the thousand the plowings , the diggings , the hoeings , the hewing of wood and the drawing of water , and all the various toilsome labors of a not rich farmer 's life , the exposure through " 3,650 days " to the Summer 's heat and the Winter 's cold , and all his thousands upon thousands of unmentioned chores  --  what would seem the profit of his life , in every day 's labor of which she had a direct interest ? Was he any better clothed or better fed than she it Did he hire help for himself when he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may be sure that he did not . And what then becomes of her formidable statement 7 It is a cipher ; it is at least equally balanced by one upon the other side . But it is worthy of notice from the way in which it is set forth . ? She says , for example , " I have cleaned up and . swept his house for kim over ten thousand times . " This regarding of a wife 's household duties as so much work that she is doing for another person , who ought to pay her for it , is one of the most unreasonable as well as one of the most repulsive phases of the " advanced woman " movement . It not only ignores the fact that a wife has , by her very wifely relation , a claim upon all her husband 's property and earnings , and . that she always shares  --  must share  --  his prosperity , but it seeks to reduce the relation of woman to man to one of mere greed of gain . We wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being paid so much apiece for her babies . Now as to the question , What right has a man to advertise a wife who deserts him ? Setting aside considerations of taste , which will have a different operation in different social circles , a man has the right to do this , for the very sufficient reason that while his wife is not at all responsible for his debts , he is responsible for hers . Women , and . sometimes those who are not " advanced , " are too apt to forget this  --  that all the responsibility of married life falls upon the man . No one except the husband can call the wife to account , or look to her as responsible for money or otherwise . This is as it should be , and as , for woman 's sake , it must be ; but it carries with it rights which are not to be set aside by thousands of chores , or even by half-dozens of children .               @ @ @ @ @ @
