txt Mr. ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS is a thorn in the side of - the modern Democracy , which can neither be plucked out nor endured in silence . He is an earnest and sincere man , who not only . believes what he says , but insists on saying what he-believes . He condemns the recent amendments for what they contain , repudiates them for the way in which he declares their adoption was procured , and distrusts and . despises the Northern Democrats , who , while at heart . agreeing with him , are willing to cloak their feelings " for the spoils of office . " He says , quoting the language of the Ohio platform : " We say in advance that we shall never recognize as a political friend or ally , let lnm hail from any quarter he may , any one who maintains that the openly-confessed usurpations attending the Reconstruction acts have all been settled ' in the manner and by the authority constilutionally appointed , ' and who shall deprecate any arraignment of either of these acts or their authors before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such are no friends of ours ? - of our cause or the liberties of this country . " In this declaration , it is not probable that Mr. STEPHENS will find a large following among the Southern leaders . The politicians in the South are generally less bold . or more discreet than he . But it is plain that in the sentiment of the declaration he will receive the sympathy of the Southern people . It is but putting in definite shape the feeling which the Democratic leaders have boon laboring for years to awake . It is the logical outgrowth of the attitude of that party toward the principles involved in the amendments , ever since the war . The significance of such words as those of Mr. SrErnms lies in the fact that they present the sharp contrast between the real and . pretended position of the Democracy , between what they now think is safe to profess they will do and what they would do if they dared . This contrast is made the stronger by the manner of Mr. STEPHENS ' reception at the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneers bitterly at him . It insinuates that he is secretly allied to Radicalism . It points to the action of the Ohio , Pennsylvania and Iowa Democratic State Conventions , and contemptuously declares that no paper of any force or character in the country expresses itself as Mr. STEPHENS does . The Alabama Advertiser 4 Mail , published at Montgomery , presents the charges against Mr. STEPHENS ' political integrity much more strongly , whilei it passionately accuses him of aiding . " voluntarily or involuntarily , in retaining the Radical Party in its hateful and . dangerous supremacy . " Neither of these papers , nor any other Southern Democratic journals , deny their agreement with Mr. STEPHENS ' premises , or dispute the logic of his deductions. - They simply protest against the expediency of his course . To sacrifice their convictions for success has become with them the first principle of Democracy . If Mr. STEPHENS can not do the same thing , he is false to his party , and there is an end of it . Some of the Northern Democratic Press , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hearts of the Southern people , recognizing also his great abilities as a thinker on the political questions now directly before the South , undertake to explain away his position . One paper thinks Mr. STEPHENS accepts the Thirteenth Amendment , and will agree that in neither of the others is there ground for the Election law or Kuklux law , and that , therefore , he ' is in practical tconcurrence with the Democracy of the North . But Mr. STEPHENS will have none of their palaver . On the 1st of July Mr. STEPHENS , in a long and vigorous article , refuses to budge an inch from his position . He designates the amendments as " so called , " denounces them as " usurpations , " and declares that to affirm that they have been settled is a piece of " unblushing effrontery . " It is clear that before the Democratic leaders have whipped the malcontents into their ranks , a display will have been made of their real convictions and purposes sufficient to make their false pretenses off very little avail .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
