txt The political campaign which will be opened to-morrow by the Republican Convention which meets hero is generally regarded as one of the most interesting and . important of the contests that have occurred in this State for many years . This opinion is entertained and expressed by all the political leaders with whom I have conversed , and . they advance many reasons for the importance which they attach to the battle about to begin . In the first place , it will be remembered that the next Legislature will have in its hands the redistricting of the State . Should the Democracy be successful there is no doubt that they will so cut out and arrange the Senatorial districts as to make it next to impossible for the Republicans to ever again get control of the upper house . The Democrats openly boast that from New-York City , Kings County , Albany , and Bu.ftalo alone they will be able to secure thirteen Senatorial representatives . In addition to this it may be stated tnat six of the nine officers having control of the canals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican Party now assembled here ' are fully alive to these facts , and they , in Common with non-partisan citizens everywhere , urge that , for the good of the State , it is essential that the policy of reform in the administration of the finances which was instituted by the last Republican Governor be continued . It is not forgotten at this time that during the Hoffman reign the sinking fund of New York State was robbed of $6,500,000 , or that , under Gov . Dix , this sum was replaced . in two short Years , and the credit of the State fully restored . DEMOCRATIC COALITION WITH THE CATHOLICS . While these facts make the Republicans alive to the necessity ? which exists for victory this year , they do not for a moment lose sight of the many difficulties which they have to overcome . Chief among these difficulties . ' as I am reliably informed , is the coalition with the Catholic Church which the Democrats are making in all parts of the State . Since the passage of the-constitutional amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Republican Legislature , forbidding the appropriation of money in aid of sectarian schools , the Catholics have become aware that their only hope was in a union with theDemocracy . Ipallthe interior towns of the State they pre making this union Closer than ever before , hoping by this means to effectually change the common school ayetem now existing . During a conversation upon this subject had . this evening with one of the best known men in the State , he said : " The Catholic question is already a vital one in the politics of New-York , and we may as well meet the issue boldly . " He stated further that in.many of the interior cities and large villages of the State the religious sect in question were building sohool-houses at their own expense and demanding . that the general school boards ? should accept teachers designated by them , and that the expenses of maintaining such schools shall be paid out of the common school fund . That this Catholic issue exists is deeply deplored by Republican leaders here , but they all acknow- ? ledge its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with . It is strongly urged here to-night  --  that a moderate but explicit resolution on this subject be inserted . in the platform . THE BOGUS CLAIM OF CANAL REFORM . It is generally stated by all those with whom I have spoken that the Democrats , particularly those of the interior , are preparing to go into the coming contest with reform for their motto and watchword , claiming particularly that the canal reform movement originated with their party . The falsity of this claim is apparent when it is remembered . that a Republican Legislature originated the amendment to the Constitution which made it practically impossible for further frauds to be committed in canal work . There is not the slightest desire here to . rob Gov . Tilden of any credit which he may be entitled . to in this matter . On the contrary , the Republicans , without questioning his motives , are quite willing to accept bun as an ally in their attack upon corruption . At the same time , they claim that the reform movement inaugurated , to be successful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to bend all their energies in this direction is evident from the character of the delegates here . Not one man in any way tainted by or mentioned in connection with canal frauds has been sent to the convention , while on the other hand it may be mentioned that several notorious members of the canal Ring have been elected to attend the Democratic gathering to be held in Syracuse , that head-quarters of all canal thieves , THE KIND OP MEN TO BE NOMINATED . It is generally believed here that the results of the election this year more than over before will depend upon the personal character of the men nominated for office . As a reason for this it may be stated that there is a largo and growing class of citizens in the interior of the State who are opposed to supporting any man for the sake of party , but who will give their votes to any honest and capable candidate , irrespective of politics . They want reform and an holiest Government , and they care very little under what political name it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the nominations which will be made by the convention to-morrow will be in every way acceptable to the class mentioned , as they certainly will be to all good Republicans . There is an evident desire to forget all personal , political . friendships , to throw overboard old political hacks , to think only of the good of the State and the party , to select only such men as can stand before the people . now their own merits . All the delegates ow here express their determination to act in this way , not only in the convention tomorrow , but in their local meetings . I am assured that the character of the nominations for Assembly to be made this year will be above all reproach , and . the Senatorial nominations will be , if possible , stronger than those of two years ago . Of late years the Republican Party have not always used proper discretion in their nominations for mifior county offices . This lack has done much injury in some quarters and drawn many votes from the candidates for State offices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been determined by several of the delegations from Central and Western New-York that ? this Fall none but men of character and position shalt be places in nomination for even the most insignificant offices . Every delegate hero is determined to use his best efforts for the general good . The feeling among them is even more harmonious and cordial than usual . They are earnest and honest in their desire to redeem the State . They will place none but good names before the people , and they are confident of success . DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION .
