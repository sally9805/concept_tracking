FRENCH AND GERMAN.1 The state of mind of Benedix towards Shakespeare , as shown in his Shakespearomanic , does not differ materially from that of the youth in Leslie 's caricature , who regarded " Shakespeare as a very much overrated man . " He professes to attack nothing but the absurd exaggerations of unwise enthusiasts , who look upon every word in every one of Shakespeare 's plays as the product of direct inspiration , and who , from various ulterior motives , look down upon the writers of their own country ; but in point of fact he finds very little to approve in the great poet ( as he is still popularly considered ) , and for one word against the empty phrases of Shakespeare 's defenders , he has ten against the empty phrases of Shakespeare himself . The cause that he has taken needs only more defenders to make it part of a controversy which in time might do more towards defining the exact merits of the poet in question , than can thousands of books filled with nothing but re&amp;hoing praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a wholly unbiased opinion of Shakespeare 's worth ; we can not discriminate what we have felt ourselves fi-om what we have heard preached to us since we were children , and if we try to be independent we are likely to fall into whimsicality . One should not be too sure that this form of superstition is harmful . There would seem to be no reason why we should not profit by the critical experience of our forefathers , as well as by their skill in carpentering , tilling the earth , eschewing poisonous food , or in painting , building , and the other arts . The world is too large to be made wholly over again by every young man . At times , it is true , tile world worships false idols , but , on the whole , literary taste shows an excellent record for impartiality . At any rate , when the time for examining an idol comes , a great deal depends upon who the person is that attacks the prevailing belief . In this case it is a German playwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar with the German 1 All books mentioned under this head are to be had at Scheenhof and Moeller 's , 40 Winter Street , Boston . stage , by the paraphrase of his Aschenbriidel , which was performed very often in this country under the name of School , as by any other of his pieces . We believe that the friends of the late English dramatist , Robertson , claim that he was innocent of any plagiarism from the German ; if that is true , the resemhlance of their two pieces is one of the most remarkable eases of coincidence on record . None of Benedix 's plays are of the highest merit , hut almost all are entertaining , and carefully fitted for the stage . The Shakespearomanie is a posthumous work of his ; what the editor of the hook calls " a legacy to the German nation . " A great deal of the book is written for the Germans alone ; he uses , for instance , nothing but the German translation , never once referring to the original , indeed , pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plays have won their position in their new dress , and so must be jud*ed in that form . Again , he has a very strong feeling of patriotism in his criticism of Lessing 's , Goethe 's , and Schiller 's plays , which forbids his judging them with the severity the English poet must . In general , however , his attack goes much further than that , and he tries to show that the plays , in whatever language they are expressed , are full of faults , and , more than that , radically undeserving of the highest praise . The form he has chosen to express his views in is the one best adapted for an easy victory on paper , that , namely , of having the different sides defended by different men , whose colloquies compose the book . They are three friends : Hellmuth , who is hostile to Shakespeare ; Reinhold , who supports Helimuth in his apostacy with the learning a wider culture has given bins ; while the opposite side is taken by Oswald , a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first attack , or after making only a sham defense by quoting souse stock phrase from the most laudatory pages of the copious Shakespeare literature of Germany . This is manifestly unfair , for we can not imagine that Benedix supposed no one really enjoyed Shakespeare , that his worship was only a fashionable superstition , which his so-called admirers only wanted an excuse to drop . Between them Hellmuth and Reinhold have an easy victory . There is hardly a play of Shakespeare 's Die Shakespearonmanie . Zur Abwehr . Von Da . Reoaamea &amp;xmuex . Stuttgart . 1873. // which escapes their hostile criticism ; those which get off best are Romeo and Juliet , Macbeth , King Lear , and Midsummer Night 's Dream . They charge Shakespeare with faults of construction , bombastic use of language , pompous and ahsnrd metaphors , lack of invention in his plots , ignorance of what he was proposing to himself to write , and manifold violations of psychological laws . If there is any reason in the book , one wonders why we do not at once hurl our Shakespeares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wasted enthusiasm . At times , their , or rather Benedix 's , criticism is of the narrowest sort ; for instance , in what is said about the Tempest , he finds fault with the first scene in the sinking ship ; he says it can not he represented on the stage , that on hoard of a ship in such a storm no talking could be heard , that it is a piece of the absurdest folly for the passengers to ahuse the sailors on whose efforts their lives depend , etc. , etc . He has never read anything more miserable in the way of poetical narration than the next scene between Prospero and Miranda , and he compares it unfavorably with Schiller 's attempts in the same manner , and Goethe 's in the Iphigenia , and Nathan the Wise with his story of the three rings . He shows us how , if Shakespeare had only been a Benedix , Prospero might have described his being driven out of the palace , his agony on the water , etc. , and then , surpassing almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were really a magician , did not detect and withstand the attack made upon him ! Oswald , and this is a good example of that young man 's force , suggests that he acquired his knowledge of magic upon the island , which Hellmuth refutes , and Oswald says no more . So the criticism runs on , and we . need not wonder that Hellmuth says he never has taken any pleasure in the piece . We can be sure he would vastly prefer Crossing the Quicksands , or The Stranger . Of Hamlet he says it is absurd to speak of the mysteriousness of his character ; it is not that which makes the play hard to understand ; he has , on the contrary , a very simple , transparent character ; it is the numerous episodes that have caused all the trouble ; if you cut them out , you have the key at once . The superfluous episodes that have wrought all the confusion are the embassy to Norway , Laertes ' journey to Paris , the march of Fortiubras through Denmark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out , and there is no trace of Hamlet 's indecision ; he had good grounds for delay : if he had killed the king at once at the bidding of the ghost , we should have had no play ; and so he doubts the ghost , and all the episodes are willfully thrust in to spin out the play after Hamlet has made sure of his uncle 's guilt by the device of the play he has represented before him . Shakespeare , he says , is inconsistent in his delineation of character , and here , between following the tradition which makes Hamlet return from England victorious and oust his uncle , and his own invention , he falls to the ground . He acknowledges the play has its merits , but they are mainly dramatic effects , such as the fei , , ned madness of Hamlet , and the real madness of Ophelia . The ghost , too , makes the play attractive . Besides these charms , there are the play within the play , the grave-yard and the funeral , a fight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous language . For Antony and Cleopatra he has also nothing but abuse ; Shakespeare has followed Plutarch with slavish fidelity ; battles , even naval battles , are begun and ended in a few minutes . Cleopatra was a woman unworthy to be writtenabout ; the principal characters repel us ; and if the greater part of the minor characters were removed , the play would be only the better for it , etc . Othello has perhaps some merits . To be sure , the whole of the first act is superfluous ; in the second act the scene changes to Cyprus ; and here we are offended by another impossibility , the speed with which the ships arrive . At last , in the third scene of the third act , the action fairly begins and goes on with energy . The delineation of character to be noticed in this play did not please Benedix ; to he sure , Othello 's jealousy is well represented , but the reason of his growing jealous is insufficient . In this way the criticism , or rather , the commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convicting him of all manner of inaccuracies and errors , and the final conclusion reached is that Shakespeare has produced no characters to be compared , in respect to the pleasure to be derived from them , with Karl Moor , Philip II. , Stauffacher , and Wallenstein , of Schiller ; Faust and Orange , of Goethe ; and Lessing 's Nathan , The Cloister - Brother , Saladin , etc . Benedix says the Shakespeare-maniac will shrug his shoulders at that statement . He was right ; he will . Recent Literature . // That Benedix should prefer Schiller 's simpler creations to the characters of Shakespeare is not surprising when one reads his critical remarks , and especially when one makes out the apparent animus of half his hostility , which is his strong unwillingness to praise foreign poets . Schiller is more truly a national poet than Shakespeare ; he represents that quality to be found among the young of all nations , and , more or less , among the Germans of all ages , namely , a certain generous enthusiasm which is very different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In general , as indeed Benedix 's hook shows , there is among the Germans a deeper love of Shnkespenre than even among the English ; they discovered him at an important time in the intellectual development of their nation , and they have certainly devoted to his study that immense research of which they are such wonderful masters , and which , it may be safe to say , is only now rivaled among his fellow-countrymen . Benedix does his best to moderate what Lessing said in his praise , but with little success . Of course there has been a tendency among later Germans to exaggerate what was the popular feeling , and there has often been indiscreet and foolish praise lavished on Shakespeare , for which he least of all is to blame ; but these excesses , which are the nominal object of Benedix 's attack , get very little blame from him . It is Shakespeare whom he really dislikes . The unfairness of his attack we have tried to show without sharing his fault ; no one , it would seem , who starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not speak an intelligible language ; he gets no pleasure from The Tempest , and yet he asks us to prefer what he is fortunate enough to be able to comprehend . He is always pained in reading Othello by the feeling that Othello can not fairly be jealous without being something else than Othello , - this sounds much like prejudice seeking some excuse for its bitterness . No one would for a moment maintain that Shakespeare stands on a pinnacle which makes it blasphemy to criticise him , that he is wholly without flaws ; even his admirers are obliged to confess that ; but Benedix , starting to show he is not perfect , leaves him with hardly a leg to stand on ; one mi , , ht judge that he thought that in a dramatic point of view , there was no play of Shakespeare 's to be compared with Lessing 's didactic Nathan the Wise , which is a moral tale in dramatic form , with much beauty , it is true , hut void of even any theatrical merit . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a conscientious piece of work , but it fails of its object . It merely shows how a man who has written really very good plays , can entirely misunderstand the theory of the stage . It seems impossible that one who has studied his kind , as every successful dramatist must , could he so ignorant of human nature . He only saw the trifles . What he says about the general ignorance of Shakespeare that exists among the Germans is something that he should know better than any foreigner , but the way in which , every winter , many of Shakespeare 's plays are performed iu almost all of the best theatres , would seem to argue against his remarks . The Germans certainly have excellent and frequent opportunities of judging the English poet , and it is their own fault if they do not take advantage of them . If they do not , why are the plays given l Then , too , it is to be remembered that the highest fame does not always accompany the greatest popularity . Benedix*s plays are oftener given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Shakespeare . We remain Shakespearemaniacs in spite of the book . 120 July , // ART . IT appears that in New York the Academy has at last succeeded in selling some pictures from its exhibition-rooms . If such a thin , , could be effected in the galleries of the Boston Art Club , we might hope to see collections of pictures formed there which should comprise always the best that our painters have , and constitute nurseries of fresh and constantly progressive effort . As it is , we are provided at stated times and seasons with assemblages of paintings , of which a third , perhaps , are the productions of foreigners , copies from the works of European painters of former times , or antique products of early American genius . In the last exhibition , for example , were a cartoon by Mengs , and one by Overbeck ; a fine group of portraits by Angelica Kaufmann , a charming Calame , and some finely modeled and wonderfully colored Italian children , by Bonnat . The exhibitions thus acquire an historically illustrative value to students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do not yet , fulfill l Is it well that the only organized body among our artists should expend its energies upon the formation of exhibitions which do not especially and forcibly bear upon the development of a vigorous native art l The phrase " development of native art " is , we confess , discouragingly vague . Yetwe believe it could be made to mean something , if sympathetically accepted and acted upon . All movements towards its realization , however , to be successful , must be mutual on the part of painters and the patrons of art . And it strikes us that the artists of Boston have hardly done their part in endeavoring to make the exhibitions of the Art Club representative of them at their best . Several of those painters to whom the public looks with special eagerness for fresh pleasures have become very guarded in ' their contributions to the club exhibitions . The name of William Hunt hardly appears at all on the catalogues ; Frank Smith has not been represented during the past season ; J. Appleton Brown has dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hunt , it is true , contributes , this time , an interesting river scene in Florida , but only vicariously - the picture having passed out of the artist 's hands . What we stand in need of is a determina tion among all prominent or energetic young painters , to put some of their best strength and skill every year into a picture or two for the Art Club ! There is no lack of skill in one department , at least - that of landscape-painting . Even as the case stood this spring , the few contributors made a fair show in that branch . W. E. Norton contributed a noble Midnight on the Grand Banks , containing what we might call an elegiac passa , , e of moonlight , glittering mournfully on the great deep ; with a fine contrast of ship-lights , a cloud of spectral canvas on the large vessel " head on " to the spectator , and wonderful gradations of light throughout , contributing to a sombre , pervasive harmony of the whole . The drawing was perfect ; the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the vessels rock as they would upon waves really passing under them . The clouds around the mr*oon were masterly ; the whole was a clear , profound poem , of a strong naturalistic flavor . E. Baxter 's Marsh near Providence , a capital performance , gives notice of a real genius for landscape ; the varicolored mist and moist ground being felt out with delicate sympathy , and artistically converted into a delicious web of color . F. P. Vinton displayed an honest study of a walnut-tree , and a pleasing Sheep Pasture , showing a nice sentiment for a simple meadow on a gray morning . A view of land and water , - Eanle Head ,  --  by 11. 5 . Fay , was a good bit of water-color ; and Miss Beckett 's Coming Home , - a twilight sky gleaming through a lonely wood , and crows flying westward , - was very poetically rendered . Other smaller performances we can only mention , namely : Cranch 's dreamy Glimpse from J. II . Lowell 's Window , and two Venetian subjects ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good appreciation of the pale minor color-chords characteristic of our sea-shore . Some landscapes by Miss M. J. Beckett ( a name new to us ) are not without promise . The human figure , however , is nearly ignored by American contributors . We have three or four portraits by Long* fellow , Healy , Miss Reed ; and a cold and hard Priscilla by Miss Knowlton . Miss Boott contributes a Mother and Child sympathetically imagined , - the child 's head // Art . worked out with some skill and much tenderness . Besides this , there is only an agglomeration of false , gymnastic , elocutionary figures , by J. W. Carter , called Death of Warren . So far as we know , there is no cdoperative effort whatever made by the artists of Boston , to procure models for the figure and to work systematically from the life . Until such effort is made , we can not , of course , look for any satisfactory achievement in that direction . But at least we may ask that our painters should fairly let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what they are strong , and in what weak . The compact being once formed that every individual shall put forth all his strength in a fair representative picture , we shall soon know the status of art in this locality . On all accounts it would be better to know this ; for , in discovering deficiencies , we should also be made aware of strength sometimes unsuspected under the present lackadaisical mode of procedure . The painters themselves would be the first to profit by a change of policy ; and the public , instead of being subject to a fortuitous conjunction of circumstances , as at present , for the boon of an agreeable exhibition , would always have the interest attaching to collections which really indicate the rate and direction of progress among the painters who live among them . Amon , , the European pictures there was a piece of grape-painting by Giordano of Rome , in which the luxurious branches were executed with great truth and wonderful relief- the grape leaves hardly so good . Constantinople , by Fdlix Ziem of Paris , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white houses and minarets gleaming across fields and a strip of very blue water and under a row of large trees , beneath which were grouped in picturesque confusion crowds of gayly dressed Orientals , feastin , , , talking , and making music . The picture is eiIi*ctive , but the colors are too crude . The blue sky especially , which takes up a large part of the canvas , is quite unworthy such a colorist as Ziein , being very hard and opaque . The old trees are very sketchily treated , and are steeped in an afternoon light a little too hot to be quite agreeable . A certain French exaggeration characterizes the work . It is artistic , perhaps poetic ; everything is managed with a remarkable chic . The bit of blue , yellow , and red drapery on the greens under the shadow of the trees , are July , dashed off with a telling vigor* and effect . But the whole picture has too much of a stage-scenic look , and as if it were painted for the market . There were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialistic school of art , by which we mean the school that believes in emphasizing all the externalities , bestowing more love and labor on a bit of tapestry or wallpaper or ormolu , than on the action of a figure or the expression of a face , and troubles itself very little about an idea , or an imagination , or a feeling , in comparison with mere mechanical execution . Every gallery of high-priced pictures is afflicted with such gilded traps to catch the unthinking public . Their name is legion . Europe exports them , and America imitates them . Here is one of them - probably one of the imitations - by E. H. Blatchfield , with a glass over it , as though it were too precious to be exposed to the vulgar air . The title thereof is Rejected . But the subject might be anything else . How often have we seen this same characterless young lady in white satin , standing in her elegant boudoir , posing , with her costly furniture and bric-h-brac around her , every inch of which is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye , as the maiden herself ! The young lady takes various poses . Sometimes she is looking into a mirror , dressing , sometimes holding a love-letter , sometimes a book , or a flower , sometimes fondling a parrot or greyhound . Like Queen Elizabeth she is semper eudem . We very soon get through with our admiration of the handsome objects by which she is so artistically surrounded . Mr. Blatchfield introduces her anew with as much circumstance as if she were a stranger . She has even less expression than usual . We hardly look at her face - it is her satin robe we admire . She is posing with her hand on an exquisite little cabinet of yellow and black wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl , behind which are two rich old china plates . The cabinet stands on an exquisite table of black wood of highly ornamental pattern , with hanging silver chains . Beneath her feet is a rich and expensive carpet . Behind her is a highly elegant and aristocratic chair ; and the wall-paper is of the most approved artistic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more r*cherch* in selection , more faultless in execution l What labor , what skill - but alas , what vapidity ! // Art . Here is another young lady by M. Becker , a disciple apparently of M. Hamon , but without Hamon 's poetry . A Pompeian Lady , she is called . Her chief attraction is a piece of gorgeously figured drapery . She is looking at some images and masks , and other objects of virtu supposed to be Pompeian . How nicely painted , - but how without meaning or motive ! And here is M. Merle , a popular French painter , who finishes up everything with such wonderful neatness of brush . This is a moral French tableau , called The Right Path ; a more ambitious subject , and a larger picture , than the last two we have commented upon . It is a young artist of the old Italian time , looking like Masaccio , with portfolio and palette in one hand , the other hand raised theatrically to his chin , while he looks steadily away from a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow , in the front of the canvas , with red cap and thick black curls , red robe relieved with green drapery and exquisite embroidered yellow sleeves , and red tightfittin , , hose on his legs , - altogether an expensively dressed youth for a painter . But then he is only posin* , like the young lady models ; and so long as he is posing , why not drape him in the handsomest style ? The improper young ladies in the background are not real enough to be alluring ; but make a pretty enough tableau , with the conventional columns , flowers , inlaid mosaic floors , and all that . These were perhaps the most noticeable pictures of the materialistic school , in this exhibition . And before leaAng the gallery we turn with a certain feeling of refreshment to two or three pieces of natural painting : a Zouave eating his Broth , by M. Pils , a French battle-painter of some note , is finely touched ; an Italian peasant girl with a fat , good-natured baby in her arms , is deserviug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; aud M. Scbmitzberger 's family of cat and kittens is charming for all who appreciate ' truthful and characteristic portraiture of the feline race . - Dr. Franz Reber has published the first number of a History of Modern German Art from the end of the last century down to the Vienna Exposition of 1873 , with a side glance at the contemporary art-history of France , Belgium , Holland , England , Italy , and Russia . The present number contains 128 octavo pages printed in fair , open type , on good paper , and the book , 123 which the publishers say will be completed in the course of the present year , is to consist of five numbers , each of about the same size as the one before us . The work promises to be a useful one , supplying a want much felt by persons interested in the modern development of art ; it gives us more amply and completely the history too slightly sketched by Kugler in his band-hook ( Hand buch der Gesehiebte der Malerei seit Constantin dem Grossen ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write at once learnedly and interestingly on art-matters ? They take the ripe vintage , and , having pressed it in their mill , present us with the pulp , skin , seeds , and stems , and ask us to warm the cockles of our hearts with that . Perhaps this statement hardly does them justice , but the best we can say for the most of their writing on art is , that feeding on it is like feeding on bran-bread . We know it is nourishing , and we wish it were nice . It is often said that the French writers are indeed more entertaining , but then the Germans are the more lastingly useful because of their greater accuracy . However this may be true in science and history , we can not say that it is true always in art , - at least in the case of modern writers ; witness Passavant , Wangen , Woltmann , and Liibke . It is not safe to depend upon either of these writers in his statements of facts , as many a student must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their facts ; Woltmaun and Liibke least to be depended on in their deductions : the reader may judge which of these counts is the greater disparagement . Liibke 's short-comings have already been exposed in The Atlantic . How little Woltmann is to be leaned upon , witness his dancing back and forth on the subject of the Dresden and Darmstadt Madonnas , and his treatment of the Dance of Death in his Holbein und seine Zeit , with reference to Holbein 's authorship . This book is a useful one no doubt , and represents a vast amount of plodding industry , and abounds in dryasdust detail , but it is not easy , for all that , to understand why Mr. Ruskin should call it , as he has lately , a very valuable book . Perhaps he has been vainly trying to read Mr. XVornum 's lumpish and futile work on the same subject , and after the effort , any book on Holbein might seem valuable . Perhaps it only comes from the difference between the two men . Woltmann 's book is all facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no facts to speak of . Dr. // Waagen 's principal work , Art-treasures of Great Britain , is useful as a guide-book , but as an authority his reputation has gone steadily down . lie tells us where the Titians , Vandycks , and ilolbeins are said to be , and , to be sure , that is something , but unfortunately his decision as to authenticity in any case makes nothing either for or against the work in question . As for Passavant , he is the least worthy respect of the four , though stran , * , ely enough he has the highest popular reputation of all of them for learning and accuracy . He is being slowly found out , however , and it is risking little to prophesy that when he has been examined in detail , the result will be in each case what so careful an observer and so conscientious a writer as Mr. G. E. Street found it in his own field of study . In the preface to his Gothic Architecture in Spain , second edition , 1869 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish architecture , he says of Passavant , " Passavant who has published some notes on Spanish architecture ( Die Christliche Kunst in Spanien , Leipzig , 1853 ) is so ludicrously wrong in most of his statements that it seems probable that he trusted to his internal consciousness instead of to personal inspection for his facts . " But we did not mean to make Dr. Reber 's book a text for fault-finding . After all , the short-comings we complain of are such as must , we fear , always be counted on in reckoning with human work , and the student of any subject , if he be really a student , will never buy of these middle-men , but will go to original sources ; while the general public , that insists so in these days on having everything made easy , must look to be often served by journeymen.
