txt A terrible disaster occurred on Lake Michigan early yesterday morning , which has just been reported here . The propeller Equinox , on the way from Chicago to Bay City , Mich. , with a cargo of salt , and towing the gehobner Emma E. Wayes , loaded with lumber , was overtaken by the storm about 2 o'clock Friday morning , near Point au Sable , 280 miles north of Chicago . Capt . Woodworth , of the Equines- , came to the stern of the propeller at that time and called out to cut the lines . This was done , and the propeller careened and sunk in a few minutes . The Post and Mail publishes the following account of the disaster : A most terrible disaster , arising from the great storm of Thursday night , comes to light this morning , a disaster involving the loss of the propeller Equinox with all on board , twenty-two persons iu all . There were two passengers on board , and the Captain and crew , consisting of nineteen men . The drowned Captain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ironsides S. D. Caldwell and Governor Cushman , tee last named having been blown up at Buffalo three years ago . The two passengers were Miss Minnie Scott , the Captain 's daughter , aged nineteen years . going home from a convent where she was being educated , and Miss Hattie Scott , aged seventeen , a granddaughter , who lived in Cleveland , and was traveling for pleasure in the Equinox . Capt . Scott was about sixty years of age , and had a , son in business at Cleveland . The names of the crew are not yet known . The Equinox started from Saginaw. bound for Chicago , Sunday evening last , laden with salt , consigned to Mr. Stewart , of the Exchange Building . She was near Point au Sable , about 180 miles from Chicago , when she went down . The story of the disaster is told by Capt . Lusk , of the schooner Emma A. Wayes , which arrived off the harbor at 8 o'clock last night , and was brought in this morning . His schooner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes before sho went down . The storm struck the lake with great force . but the two vessels plowed their way without misfortune until 2 o'clock Friday morning . The crews of both vessels were ready for duty , and that of the schooner was constantly engaged about the sails and rigging . The fury of the storm was terrible , and it seemed several times as though certain destruction awaited them . No signs , however , came from the Equinox that all was not right on board . Her speed was very much retarded , but she held to her course and steamed ahead . The night was pitch dark and the water was running high . The storm created such a fearful din as to make it almost impossible to hear anything , while the lightning flashing athwart the sky afforded the only possible glimpse of the dread scene . They were off Point au Sable at about 2 o'clock on Friday morning , when Capt . Lusk heard a voice from the propeller shouting , " Cast off your line , " which was immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds all was still , and . the crew of the Wayes were meanwhile loosing the line , when the voices of women from the propeller were again beard , sounding to those on board the schooner as though they cried , " We are drowning . " The line was already loosened , and the connection between the two vessels thereby severed , when suddenly , as Capt . Lusk was peering through the darkness at the receding propeller , it appeared to tip , and almost before he could move the immense craft had disappeared from sight beneath the hissing waters . The action was so sudden that no one on board of the schooner seemed to have an idea of the position . For a moment It seemed as though it might be that the propeller had steamed away , and was lost to sight in the darkness ; but the spectacle of the sinking vessel with its living freight was too plainly impressed upon his mind , and there could be no doubt but that the steamer bad been swallowed up without warning . Capt . Lusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and last evening arrived in harbor , considerably the worse for wear . He said to a reporter , that he had known of the propeller but a short time , and considered her seaworthy , or he would not have kept in tow with her so long . She gave no sign of distress either by whistling or , showing lights . " I had scarcely noticed her careening , when Capt . Woodworth shouted to me , ' Cast off your tow line . ' As soon as I had done this , I noticed she was sinking . It was five minutes , from the time the Captain told mo to oast off before she disappeared . We could render no assistance , as our small boat could not live in such a sea . and to bring the schooner alongside would have been certain destruction . It was tall could do to weather the gale as it was ; my foresail was badly split and my cargo was shifting . Tho Equinox went down so quickly that there was no chance for any escape . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been literally swallowed up by the great suction caused thereby . I have no doubt at all but every one mot with almost instant death : although the vessel was an old one , I do not think the Captain had any idea she was going down until he ordered the line cast off . There was plenty of time to have signaled me. if ho bad realized . his danger ; a signal , however , could have done no good , as it would have been impossible for me to lay alongside . The wind was blowing a perfect gale from the northward , and the sea was running so high as to make it impossible for anything but a clever sailor to weather it . The night was dark , and I could hardly make out the propeller , but could see her as she swung over on her side . There was nothing but complete darkness about us , and the night was the most horrible I ever passed . I hope to God I will never have another such experience . I managed to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by the tug Protection about 9 o'clock last night . " The Equinox , which met such a terrible fate , was owned by the Grand Trunk and Sarnia Line . The vessel was very old , and rated very low in point of safety . In 1873 the company overhauled her and put work on her to the amount of about thirteen thousand dollars . She was probably worth $26,000 to $30,000 . The insurance , if any , is not known . Besides the large cargo of salt , nearly 6,000 barrels , there was a deck load of lumber , more than she was capable of carrying . Her engineer had . protested against the overloading , but was , induced to go with the vessel in Spite of his conviction that she was unsafe . The cargo is valaed at $8,000 , and is insured in the Facial ) Mutual ' arine. of . New ? ' York , for $7,000 . There were , it is stated this evening , either twenty-four or twenty-five persons on board , and it is believed that not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN OF A SCHOONER DROWNED. ?
