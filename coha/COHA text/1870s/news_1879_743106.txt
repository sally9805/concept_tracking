txt The Vicomte DE LESSEPS is reported as expressing himself " highly satisfied " with the Burnside resolution regarding the establishment of a ship canal across the isthmus under the " protection and domination " of the powers of Europe . He thinks the canal should be entirely independent ? of the control of any Government . At the same time , one of the leading organs of French opinion , the Republique Francaise , takes occasion to remind us that the undertaking which M. DE LESSEPS heads is independent of official support or control , and to contend that we have no ground for disquietude . Notwithstanding these comfortable assurances , it becomes us to take a long look ahead , and , by , the light of experience and of present events in other parts of the world , endeavor to discern the possible entanglements of the far-off future and to guard against them , if possible , before it is too late . We do not aspire to that kind of ? wisdom that waits for the stable to be robbed before looking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose-colored view of this gigantic project of connecting the oceans , and of its practical and political consequences , which so delights the mind of M. DE LESSEPS . It is true that the Governments of Europe have nothing to do with the enterprise in its inception , and there may be no intention of calling upon them for material contributions or for protection in the future . The United States as a nation has no concern with any private undertaking , wherever located , provided there is a reasonable certainty that it will permanently remain a private affair , in all its operations and relations . But we can not forget the colossal proportions of this work , and the inevitable relation it must hold , if completed , to the commerce and material interests of the world , and the likelihood that Governments may be called upon to intervene for its protection . It is a work of vast difficulty and enormous cost . The circumstances attending the preliminary investigations , the concession of rights , and the selection of routes make it a French enterprise from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how far it may become so depends on the extent to which the citizens of other nations may be induced to invest in the securities by which the , Universal Stock Company that is to be formed will raise its funds . The work may be begun any time within two years , and it may last any time within the limits of eighteen years . The cost is not susceptible of accurate calculation , and what difficulty may be encountered at any stage of progress in obtaining needed funds no man can foresee . Who can give an assurance , upon which confidence can be placed , that no European Government will be called upon to lend a helping hand , or will bay up shares , and acquire a direct interest in the enterprise 7 Besides , on what do the guarantee of protection and the promise of neutrality depend ? The Universal Stock Company , yet to be formed , is to be " under the immediate protection of the Colombian Government . " The agreement of the projectors with that Government declares that the canal shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit shall not be interrupted in time of war ; it prohibits discrimination and preferences , and contains various requirements and guarantees . South American Governments have not a high reputation for strength or stability ; and suppose , at any future day , the United States of Colombia should fail ; through inability or unwillingness , to enforce the 1 guarantees and make good the declarations of its compact , who is to do it 7 In such a case , would . nots'the holders of the stock and bonds of the company call upon their own Governments to intervene for their protection and the enforcement of their guaranteed rights ? And would they be refused ? The nearest approach to an answer to these portentous inquiries is to found in Egypt at the present moment . On what pretense has the Khedive ' slum been deposed and his son set up and made the instrument of European Governments , with the almost inevitable result to come of a European protectoratei over the land of the Pharaohs ? Englandr-is incited by her interest in the Suez Canal and the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pecuniary claims of their citizens . The water-way from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and the pecuniary obligations of Egypt to the citizens of Europe afford the only ground for intervention and have given predominance to Western power in the old dependency of the " sick man . " Should the Darien project be carried to completion , interests more vast are likely to centre , in time , at the American isthmus , and still stronger incitements to intervention may arise . It behooves us to guard , so far as we may , against the possibility of a result which would be fraught with such serious consequences to ourselves . For ourselves , we owe our immunity from international broils , our peaceful prospects , our freedom from the paralyzing burden of standing armies to the'doctrine that nations , as well as men , should mind their own business . Europe is an armed camp , and . military expenses sap the resources of her various nations , because each insists upon a concern in the affairs of the others , and all have common or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are extremely jealous . It would be an evil day when any such conflict of international interests should be permitted . to obtain a foothold on this hemisphere . The United States is especially concerned to prevent it . The isthmus canal looks much like an ' entering wedge to cleave a place ? for European interests , with all the contention in which they are continually involved . As a French enterprise or a European enterprise , it will be a menace ; as ah American enterprise it might be a blessing . Our commercial concern in it is far greater than that of any other nation , our political concern in it dominates all others . The present project under existing auspices , and with the prospects distinctly foreshadowed , is opposed . to our interests in every way . We should ! give it no countenance , and should not fail to provide ourselves with a distinctly-defined and strongly-fortified vantage ground from which to meet the questions of the future if it goes on .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
