THE MINERS OF SCRANTON . I SPENT recently some time at Hyde Park  --  a mining division of the youthful city of Scranton . Besides boarding in the family of an operative , I talked with citizens , from miners to ministers , and took notes of these conversations . Upon the information thus obtained the following article is founded . There hangs in our house a large map of the State of Pennsylvania of the year 1851 . Scranton is not marked upon it . A little village named Providence is , indeed , to be found , which is now an inconsiderable part of consolidated Scranton . Nine years after the date of this map , by the census of 1860 , the population of Scranton is given at 9000 , and in 1870 at 35,000 . This very rapid increase was caused by the working of the immense coal beds which underlie the narrow valley of the Lackawanna , in which the city is situated . Forty-five per cent . of the population is given as foreign , or 15,887 . The miners are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous , next the Welsh , then the Germans , and lastly the English and Scotch . Among the Welsh-speaking population there are , however , natives of Monmonthshire , not now a portion of Wales , but belonging to England . Among the miners there are some Pennsylvania Germans . With the exception of these , there is scarcely to be found at Scranton a native of this country working under-ground , either as miner or laborer . Gaelic is extensively spoken by the Irish here , there being women , I am told , newly come over , who do not speak English . The Welsh language is more extensively employed . There are seven churches of which the services are in that language , a Welsh newspaper , and a literary or scientific society . But as the Pennsylvania German employs many English words in speaking " Dutch , " so does the Weishman introduce many into his vernacular , as " all right , " " exactly , " " you know , " " twenty per cent. , " " mortgage , " " explosion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Wales treat the letter h as the English do , and speak of Mr. Iggins , and of picking uckleberries , or say , " That 's a hodd name , " " I have a hell kitchen to my house . " The Welshman frequently emphasizes a statement , as , " Yes , sure , " " Yes indeed , man . ' * He says , " Dear to goodness ! " " I o n't do it whatever , " etc. , etc . The Welsh have been accused of bearing malice , and of being clannish , or of " keeping together . " " I think , " says a Scotchman , " that that is why they keep up the Welsh language . " For themselves they claim that they were never subjugated They are Republicans almost to a man , and // qwq posed to have occurred thus . Over each of the mining shafts is erected a breaker or cracker-an immense wooden structure-to the top of which the loaded cars are drawn up and then " dumped , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of it broken , sifted , and delivered into the cars beneath . The mine at Avoudale was ventilated by means of a furnace or great fire , causing a draught . From this it is generally supposed that the breaker took fire , and this in turn set to burning a great body of coal , and as there was at the Avondale mine only one way of egress-that is , up the shaft  --  the men perished below . At Scranton I saw a sad though simple ballad upon this disaster : " But all in vain . There was no hope One single life to save , For there is no second ontlet From the subterraneons cave . 1*o pen can write the awfnl fright And horror ti t did prevail Among those dying victims In the mines of Avondale . " The Ventilation Act passed by the Legislature of Pennsylvania after this great disaster forbids the working of any mine without two outlets . In one that I visited , instead of a fnrnace for ventilation , there was employed an immense fan , worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure air per minute . Great precautions are also taken to prevent the explosion of fire-damp . Nevertheless , accidents do still occur from this cause , and , as we have said , from the falling of the roof : , and this although one-third of the coal is left in for support for the rock above . Some companies will not insure the lives of miners , and when they do insure , they demand a very high rate-about like that charged for those engaged in the manufacture of gunpowder . Besides the more fearful sufferings to which the miner is liable , it is not uncommon to see him working in water , perhaps up to his knees , and at the same time water may be dropping upon him from above . Sometimes , on account of powder smoke from blasting , he must feel his way rather than see it . Yet it is a general impression that the miner 's health is good . It must be accounted one of his hardships that he has not regular employment . At the time of my visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rest only on half time . The miner 's luxuries are those of other poor men-his pipe and glass of ale or beerthough I must acknowledge that the Irishman has not dispensed with whiskey . " I do not think , " says Father , " that he drinks more than the Welshman , but perhaps he is more frequently seen intoxicated in public . " The Welshman , it has been said , does not drink so much here as at home , for he has bidden his native laud farewell with the intention of making money . The use of malt liquors is very common in this region , and beer is abundant in the hardest times . The Irish are fond of singing , dancing , and carousing . The saloons on Lackawanna Avenue have two rooms , the front one for drinking , the back for dancing and general amusement . On the contrary , dancing is generally considered a heinous sin among the Welsh . Says a friend , " The ministers denounce balls and dancing parties as they would manslaughter or murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a gun and dog , and on a Sunday or other holiday , or when there is a breakdown in the mine , he goes hunting on the mountain , and brings home partridges , rabbits , or perchance a deer . Nor does he have to go far to find his hunting ground . The valley of the Lackawanna is only about two miles wide , and lies in the Moosic Mountains , a part of the Alleghanies . The Germans are fond , too , of fishing . Their picnics and musical festivals generally begin on Saturday afternoon and conclude on Sunday evening . About two-thirds of the Germans go to church on Sunday morning , and many visit the beer gardens in the afternoon with their wives and children . They observe the church holidays Good-Friday and EasterMonday . No Irish miners will work on St. Patrick 's Day . They generally go to church in the morning , and immediately after service , or about half past nine , organize and form processions composed of their various beneficial societies  --  the Father Matbew , St. Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . They do not have a ball on St. Patrick 's Day , considering it to be somewhat a desecration . On the parade day of the Miners ' Union the different branches frequently have balls in the evening , and often with a charitable object , as for the relief of a poor woman whose husband or son has been killed in the mine . But since the unsatisfactory termination of the great strike in 1871 the parade day of the Miners ' Union , August 1 , is not generally observed . Our national holiday , July 4 , is kept with great zeal by the Irish . It is an outlet for the expression of their animosity to England . In 1874 there was a great parade of several thousand persons , about two-thirds of whom were foreigners . The Welsh have only one national holiday-St . David 's Day , March 1 . On this day , in Wales , they form processions and carry the leek , the national emblem . I saw it growing at Scranton , very much like the onion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings for literary pursuits and for vocal music , being a great singing // nation . St. David 's Day is still observed in some American cities , but among the people at large the celebration has died out here . Christmas is a great day among the Welsh , and is observed by meetings of the Ei8teddfoci , avery ancient national gathering , which can be traced back for nine hundred years . The word means an assembly , and is pronounced Ice-teth-vod , the cid being like th in thee . These gatherings are literary and musical . At Hyde Park it is announced in the Welsh paper , in the spring of the year , that the Philosophical Society will , at the ensuing Christmas , give prizes for the best essay or the best poem on given subjects , and the best piece of original niusic for given words , also for singing and recitation . But although , as I have stated , these meetings are generally held on Christmas , yet sometimes a neighboring town may prefer to fix upon New-Year , thus enabling parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes celebrated by an eisteddfod . From the exercises of these gatherings women are not excluded . The eisteddfods are very generally attended by the Welsh , and are held in some large public hall , the greater part of the performances being in the Welsh language . Some of the observances are described to me in simple language by one who has been a miner . He says that church choirs attend the eisteddfods , and some very difficult piece is selected for them to sing , the prize being about sixty to eighty dollars . Then there are singers alone , and in parties of three . " They get their poets there ; they meet on Christmas morning about ten , and adjourn about twelve , and then give out subjects for the poets-likely the Lackawanna River , or some subject they had never thought of before . At two o'clock these poets will be called upon to recite their verses-two , perhaps-and a small prize is given ( about a dollar ) , principally for amusement . Again , they call for compositions in music on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two weeks before the eisteddfod , with the proper name under a seal , the judges being allowed only to see the fictitious name . Also they read , and the best reader gets a small prize , the piece being given out at the meeting where it is read . Another thing causes a good deal of laughter-they ask who will volunteer to sing a musical composition from the notes ; some half dozen will throw in their names ( fictitious ) , and then one will be called out-perhaps Greenhorn ; ' the other five will retire from the room , While he picks up the difficult piece , and begins to clear his throat and show his embarrassment , which is a subject of amusement to the spectators ; then the second comes on , perhaps equally unskillful ; and when all have finished , the remarks of thej udge upon eachperformance are 919 also very amusing , the prize being only about fifty cents . In order to avoid the singers being previously acquainted with the piece , sometimes a person may be sent out half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally one very difficult to siu* . They hold these eisteddfods in Wales . The Welsh bards have for centuries back been accustomed to poetry , and so forth . In London they invited , I think , nearly all the musicians in Europe to sing on a certain day , all nationalities , for a prize of ? 1000  --  a silver cup . There came a choir of singers from Wales to compete with the best talent they had in England . The lords and members of Parliament were there . The English selected some of their most cultivated people , and the Welsh singers were miners and men of very little education , and they had to go from their own country ; but they won the prize by a great distance , and then sang through different towns and cities in England . There was money raised here in Hyde Park to support them while they were training , and to take them up to London . " A minister at the Welsh Congregational church in Hyde Park gave me some explanation of this subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crystal Palace offered a prize for competition for vocal choirs , the reward being a silver cup worth ? 1000 . In 1872 a choir of 500 persons from South Wales , called the South Wales Choral Union , men , women , and children , principally miners and their children , appeared , and took the prize without competition . The next year , 1873 , a trained band of English musicians , 350 in number , appeared to compete for the prize , but without success , for the Welsh won it again . The English were from London , and were called the Tonic Sol Fa Association . I heard nothing at Scranton , however , of the harp , once thought indispensable to the bards , two men on the street at Hyde Park with pipe and bagpipe being the only peculiar instrumental performers that I remember . It might be supposed that so dangerous a pursuit as mining , with the horror of beholding accidents sometimes mortal , the uncertainty of obtaining regular employment , and , more than any of these , the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would repress the buoyant spirits of the Irishman ; but , says . " A German also says that he does not think that working in the mines makes the Irish and others less fond of jokes , for they get together more . The mine is cool in summer and warm in winter , and if there is a lull , from want of cars or other cause , the men will squat down , miner fashion , and tell stories and crack jokes . // On a like occasion the little blackened slate-pickers swarm out of the cracker , like children let loose from school or like bees from the hive , and play at boyish games . Sometimes they get hold of an empty truck car , and ride down grade full speed , having the labor afterward of getting the car up again . When a loaded car is coming up the shaft , they can hear the warning whistle of the steam-engine , for soon the coal will be running down the chutes , and their labors recommence . When the circus comes to town there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules and perform like labors . They will come to the mine in the morning and gather together , and unless the " boss " is on the watch , they may be off in a body , and all work be at an end for the day , as the men can not get on without them . On the contrary , if they are separated and started at their work , they will stay . But even the little fellows lately spokeii of , " the boys in the cracker , " who pick the slaty refuse from the coal , have been known thus to stop mining operations . The Welsh ave not a humorous and jocose people like the Irish , though I am told that they are inclined to mirth when speaking together in their own language . A faint smile was caused at the Congregational church by a remark of the preacher . Translated , it amounts to this : " Some men drink a quantity of beer , which does not affect the brain , as they have so little brains ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner the trials and vicissitudes of life affect some men little , as they have but little sensibility . I am told that among the works of the Welsh poets are many epigrammatic stanzas . Of one of these , an epitaph , I received the following prose version : " In this life she told all the untruth that she could . Be careful not to wake her : if you do , she will say that she has been to heaven . " The late hours which are kept by our Pennsylvania Dutch when " Fanny has a beau once " do not prevail among the Welsh at Scranton . A gentleman who leads a large church choir , of which all the men are miners , and not half of these church members , tells me that the young men wait upon the young women home before nine , chat a while on the front porch or steps , and generally leave at ten . A physician says that most of the courtship of the Welsh is begun , and often finished , while walking the streets after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , " on Sunday nights in summer . At first the young men walk behind ' but after a while one step is quickened or the other slackened , or both , and they come together , and form lively parties , until ten or after . Courtships are brief , and the marriages early and happy . " I asked a Welsh acquaintance whether his son married young . " No , he did n't marry young ; he was twenty-three . " Says another , " Young women among the Welsh miners marry from eighteen to twenty-two . At the latter age they are joked about being old maids . " Miners ' wives generally hold the purse . As soon as he gets his pay and his fill of beer , the miner hands his wages to his wife , who actsas treasurer with much discretion , making all the purchases of the house and transacting the business of the family . A miner 's wife says to me : " My husband is a good workman . He never lost any time by drinking or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own sewing and by taking boarders . Ever since I have been married I tried to keep our own table , and could generally do it unless I was sick . I most always had a good deal of my own way , but I always consulted him . He always gave me his wages . I think when a man gives his wife his wages she feels more interest . I 'd kick up a big fuss if he did not give me his wages . Whenever he was going away , I 'd remind him , ' Charley , have n't you got any money in your pocket P He knew where the money was , you know . We always had one purse . My purse was his , and his was mine . We have always lived in good unity together . " This is not always the way with miners . We have a neighbor who must always go to the office on pay-day to get her husband 's money . He 'll go and take the pay , and hand it over to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she did not go and get it , he 'd go to the saloon and spend it . " It looks to me as if a man was so weak-minded , to do the like of that ! " The Welsh boys , too , hand their wages over to their mother . Germans , on the contrary , do not give their pay to the feminine head of the family ; and , alas ! a physician says that Germans are the best pay . The Welsh woman is ambitious for her husband 's shoes to shine , and on every Saturday evening she blacks the shoes of the family ( all set in a row ) , until the girls are old enough to relieve her . Another corrects this statement , saying that by the old Welsh rule Monday is the day for cleaning and putting away the Sunday 's shoes . Mrs. - says that she sets a tub of warm water for her son when he comes home from picking slate at the mine , and gives him soap and a woolen cloth , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this manner is almost a universal rule with the men on leaving the mine , and a physician says that he considers the duily bath beneficial to their health . Saysanacquaintance : " Manythink , I would not have miners to sleep in my beds , they look so black and dirty . ' But there is scarcely one in five hundred that // does not wash all over when he comes home from his work ; the general rule is , before he eats his supper . He washes his head , and puts on his clean clothes , and looks more like a clerk in a store than a miner . " When first I attended a Welsh church at Scranton , I was surprised at the nice appearance of the congregation , and I afterward inquired whether there were any miners there . But on my late visit I learned an almost invariable means of discovering who have worked in the coal mines . On the back of my host 's hands were many blue spots , looking like faint tattooing . These were marks where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more of these blue scars upon the face . The coal dust doubtless remains in the wounded place , like Indian ink in tattooing ; and by these marks you can perceive that men have been miners , though their occupation now be quite different . The Welsh have three suits of clothes , one for work , one for evening , and another for Sunday . Their children look very neat when going to church or Sunday - school . The Irish mother , too , loves to see her children look fine on these occasions , but she does not show so much taste . Both are much attached to their churches and Sunday-schools . The Germans are not so devotional . The education of miners ' sons is often much neglccted . The law does not permit them to enter the public schools before the age of six ; and although the Ventilation Act prevents children from working within the mines under twelve , yet no such prohibition exists as regards the breaker , or " cracker , " above the mine . A superintendent says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their mothers with them , to get them taken on . " Most of the recent Welsh emigrants , and those who are still poor and have large families , send their boys to work at the mine . But very few that have been in this country ten years are so poor as to be obliged to send them at an early age . We except those of dissipated habits , who spend their money in the saloons . A German tells me that the children of German miners are generally sent to school , but so great is the demand for boys to pick slate in the breaker , that they generally go there at about eight or ten . Boys ' wages in the breaker begin at thirty-five cents per day , and go up to seventy-five or eighty-five . A mule driver gets from seventy-five cents to a dollar . Even the little boys in the breakers are proud to receive their month 's wages , not to spend themselves , but to take home . A friend says that as soon as the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to earn seventy-five , and then to be a driver . From driving one mule his desire is to drive a team , then to become a laborer , and then a full miner . To be a " boss , " or superintendent , is a distant object of ambition , like being President " Alps on Alps arise . " Almost every one has to work for some time as a laborer , loading coal , before he becomes a full miner . The sons of miners generally follow in their fathers ' footsteps ; but those who have been here many years often look higher for their boys , and give them trades . I met a lawyer , an intelligent young man , whose father is a miner . For the benefit of the boys in the mines here , the Catholic Church has organized night schools , open during the six colder months of the year . The boys , if able , pay from twenty-five to fifty cents a month . A Catholic clergyman estimates that over two-thirds of the boys attend these schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school buildings has been granted them , but the rooms are often overcrowde*l . Though principally organized by the Catholic Church , none are refused on account of their belief . But after working all day , the boy can not bring so much animation to the night school as if he were not fatigued . The girls have better opportunities , but they are often put out to domestic service at twelve or fourteen . The fare of the miner is from necessity simple , not luxurious . He breakfasts at about five or six o'clock on bread , butter , and tea . In a little tin can he carries his dinner of bread and cheese , perhaps with the addition of a bit of pie or cake , and in a tin bottle cold tea without milk . Even this simple luxury is sometimes discarded , and water taken in its place . The miner proper finishes his work about four o'clock , and finds his best meal at home , often a " good cooked meal " of meat , potatoes , etc . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A miner tells me , however , that he has often brought his food uneaten out of the mine from want of time ; for he must have his car loaded when the driver comes for it , or lose one of the seven car-loads which form his daily work . It is the Welshman who eats bread and cheese . His companion or laborer is generally Irish . He is detained longer in the mine , and wants meat for his noon-day meal . Late in the fall , if the Irishman has not a pig , he generally buys from the country farmer a part of a beef , which he salts . Fresh meat from the stalls is too dear for him . When his beef runs out , he buys mess pork from the store ; but I fear that he is not always able to take his bit of meat to the mine . Rather than cheese , he will take a couple of boiled eggs , for he is very fond of what he calls " a fresh egg . " He . carries // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a cow . Cows are often seen pasturing upon the commons or the unfenced land belonging to the companies , the surface of which is not yet sold for building lots . The Irishman is very fond of keeping geese and ducks . When he has a lot , he raises potatoes and cabbage , for here , or at home , he dearly loves cabbage with his boiled bacon . The German takes for his lunch bread and butter , and perhaps a " chunk of sausage , " and piece of pie or cake . His tin bottle holds coffee . The miner 's dinner kettle and bottle are slung on a rope over one shoulder , and on entering the passages of the mine are hung on one of the props that support the roof . The men often play jokes on each other by stealing pie or cake . Of course the German makes sauerkraut . He keeps pigs , and sometimes buys a quarter of beef which he smokes . Great simplicity in food seems to exist among the mining people in Wales , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheese at once ; they would think it sinful . Mr. E- , of Scranton , says that he offered cold ment to an old Welsh lady who was visiting him , and she thanked him , but she had bread and butter . And Mr. J- , of Welsh birth , a miner from fourteen years to forty-six , tells me that if the streets were lined with meat , he could not eat it oftener than once a day , though he admits that he sometimes takes an egg or two for breakfast . The Welsh miners who come to this country almost invariably bring one or two feather-beds . The German who can afford it sleeps in cold weather on one feather-bed and under another ; if he can not , he sleeps on straw and under feathers . At his work the miner generally wears a woolen shirt , pantaloons of bed-ticking or stout linen , and heavy boots . I have seen the sole studded with iron lest the coal should cut the leather . As to the number of miners who own their houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one - third upward , the highest estimate being in one district seven out of ten of the married . The German 's house is a good one , painted or whitewashed . Germans cultivate flowers and vegetable gardens , principally worked by the women , who carry produce in baskets for sale . The Welshman , too , when he . has a home , has a comfortable one , lookin gquite pretty with its surroundings . But though the Irish often own their homes , these are of a ruder kind .. Has the miner aspirations ? This question has been put , and I have been tempted to reply by another , Is he a man ? Mr. L- , of Scranton , came to this country when about twenty . He worked a few months at Carbondale , in this Lackawanna region , and afterward in Ohio , mining bituminous coal by the bushel-120 bushels a day , at two cents each . Here he laid by $130 , which he sent to Wales to bring his parents over . " I was , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At twenty-five he married , and soon after took a contract in a mine in Schuylkill County , Peunsylvanin .. Here the failure of his employer threw him into debt , from which he was not clear until about thirty . He took contracts on coal slopes , working always as a miner himself but hiring hands to help him . For twenty years he was a foreman , a foreman 's salary averaging $1200 . He also went to California , and mined gold to profit . He bought , too , a farm in Pennsylvania for $3500 , and tried farming himself for two years , but found it harder work than mining . " Some eight of us , " he says , " all miners , bought some years ago about five and a half acres of ground here for $8050 . We sold it out in building lots , in about two months , for nearly the cost , and retained the mineral , which we value at $20,000 . " By mineral is meant , of course , the coal , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. L- continues : " Another company of us , all miners and all poor men originally , have bought a tract of 4000 acres of coal lands near the centre of Alabama . I have been down twice to see them . " He has now retired from active business , and lives in a neat house surrounded by a large garden , which he cultivates with pleasure and profit . Another instance of success in a more intellectual field is Mr.- , editor of a Welsh paper . When he was eight years old his mother was left a widow , with nine children , froni three years of age to sixteen , and with nothing but a few household goods . By putting her children to work early at the mines she kept her family together . She herself spoke nothing but Welsh . Mr. - was a precocious laborer , if I may use the expression , he being well grown , and becoming a driver at ten years , and a miner at sixteen . He never had but thirty-two days ' schooling ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Arithmetic , and went through it twice , and found some one to set him copies for writing , making use afterward of copper-plates . One great advantage which he had was the leisure which the miner often enjoys . He says : " When I was working at Carbondale two years , I could generally get my day 's work done by noon . When a miner , I wrote essays three times for the eisteddfod , and two of them drew prizes . These were each $25 ; but the pecuniary reward was not what we aimed at-it was the honor . I gave up mining in 1869 , and have been connected with a newspaper ever since . " // The miner occasionally attains to great wealth . Such , at least , was the case of Richard Care , of Miners*il1e , of whom I hear that he came to this country a poor man , and died worth a million and a half . But all these cases are exceptional . The chief ambition of the miners in general is plenty of work and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says one , " as the last suspension showed . " As to their desiring to improve their condition , a German tells me that there is always such a desire among his people . " I can take you up , " says he , " to Elmira , New York , and show you , I guess , a whole township of farmers who have been miners . The Germans who work here are very rarely from the mining districts of Germany , but from the agricultural . The German will take his boys into the mine to lay up a little capital , and having done this , he will buy a farm , or go into merchandise , or open a saloon . " What provision has the miner for times when he is out of work ? I might answer after the manner of another-credit , credit , credit . The miner is paid monthly , but by the smaller companies not always so often . Could he once tide over the first month , and enter upon the cash system , he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the credit system . Should any trader advertise that lie would sell goods for cash twenty per cent . lower , I am told that the other store-keepers would throw their influence against him , and also that several cash stores have been tried in Scranton that did not succeed in the long-run . One of the main provisions against misfortune is the Beneficial Society . The miners do not , however , often join the Freemasons . Many of the Welsh belong to the following societies : Odd-Fellows , Foresters ( a secret society of foreign origin ) , Ivorites ( named for Ivor Hael , the Welsh founder ) , Red Men , and the " Philanthropic Institution . " There are other societies , Irish and German . As for the miner who does not belong to any of these , and who has no other means , if he meets with a serious accident or a protracted illness , he mast go to the poor-house ; but if I may credit good authority , he very rarely goes there . Father says : " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a miner to get there . The Irish have a horror of it ; but occasionally some aged , dependent person goes . The law here forbids out-door support for the poor . " A young lawyer says : " No Welsh miner ever goes to the poor-house . He has a son or daughter , a brother or sister , a nephew or niece , who will not intrust him to the cold charities of the public . If his wife is industrious , she and the children can take care of him . " Mr. L says : " Veryseldom does a miner get to the poor-house , unless lie be a drunkard ; for ifhe be sober , his fellow-workmen in the mine , in case of accident or long sickness , make a collection for him . " And Dr. Hsays : " A kinder set of men never walked the earth . When one of them meets with an accident in the mine , the men put in their hands and raise a little purse for him . They will divide their last dollar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widow of their unfortunate companion , whom they frequently set up in a little saloon , where she vends candy , pea-nuts , and various drinks . " Since , however , the beneficial societies have become popular , there is not so much need of resorting to succor by subscription . When urged to insure his life , the reply of the Irishman almost invariably is , " What do I want to insure my life for my wife for ? When I am dead , I do n't want another man to spend my money. ** In these dull times , when so many were out of work , I frequently saw quoit-pitching , which seemed to be a favorite amusement ; some leap and some play marbles with the boys ; but neither men nor boys spend their time in play . Some work for farmers , some pick berries , some " fuss about their gardens , " or one , perhaps , has a sickly wife , and will stay at home and help . A young Cornish man whom I met was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited a young Scotchmnn , a foreman , who was employing himself in another manner . In the middle of his sitting-room stood a surveyor 's compass upon its high tripod , and upon the table lay a book-A Conversation on Mines , by WILLIAM HOPTON : Manchester and London . I said to him that he was differently situated from other miners , because he was interested in books , and could study in an idle time like the present . He replied that it was the fault of the others if they did not want to read and study ; be had never heard of any one in any profession who could say that he had become perfect , and in his own case the more he learned , the more he found that there was to learn . Among the Welsh , however , I learn that there is considerable culture besides that of which I have already spoken . In the Welsh Baptist church at Hyde Park a society meets once a week for reading and debating . They read the Bible and discuss its history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for six the New . In reading the Book of Samuel , the question arose , " Did the witch of Endor raise Samuel from the dead ? " After some discussion the debate was found to take up too much time , and it was referred to disputants , two upon each side . The question brought up spiritualism , in which very few of the Welsh believe , but they love to dis // cuss subjects of general interest . After an evening*s debate , the chairman put the question , and it was decided that Samuel was not raised . With this decision the preacher does not agree . About six years ago the same society argued the question whether the world was created in six days , and decided that the days were not periods of twenty-four hours . After the decision , they had a lecture upon geology from a former preacher , in which he took the same view . The Welsh , without sectarian distinction , support the Philosophical Society at Hyde Park , its proceedings being in the Welsh language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . By voluntary contribution they are establishing a free library . Some of the Welsh miners also have considerable private libraries , of three hundred volumes and over . The miners in this region are generally peaceable . Order is preserved in the mines by very strict rules . If one man strikes another , he is immediately discharged . If one insults another , the latter is to complain to the foreman , who acts as a justice of the peace , and reports difficult cases to the general superintendent . Properly speaking , however , there are two foremen to a mine , one above and one below . On an average , there are about 150 hands employed at each mine . Even in idle times there is very little disorderly conduct . " The men , " says R- , " will sometimes get tight , two or three of them , but as for getting up big rows , there is nothing of it . In the time of the great suspension there were threats of burning some buildings belonging to the Lackawanna Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ; but we never saw any body . " To this general good order , however , there seems to be a notable exception . One evening my landlady sent her son to escort me with a lantern , the lamps along a principal street being " smashed . " They had been broken , it appeared , for some time . I asked the boy why there was not a reward offered for the discovery of the persons who had done it . * said he , " the Molly Maguires will kill men ! " The Molly Maguires are the " Ancient Order of Hibernians , " of Whose doings in the coal regions dreadful stories have been told . Although when I was at Scranton it was said that the priests had broken up the society , yet I saw , one Sunday , members of the " ancient order " in handsome green and white or silver regalia , who seemed prepared to take part , with many other persons , in laying the corner-stone of a church near Scranton . Hence I inferred that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have obliged them to give up their pledge of secrecy . After I left Scranton , however , a man was killed in that region , of whose murder I understand that the Molly Maguires were suspected . But so great at one time was the fear of the people at large of the Mollies , that 200 or more revolvers were sold in one day . There remains to be considered a subject of more general public interest than perhaps any other in which the miner is concerned , namely , strikes . Suspension is the genteel name among the men . In 1870 a great strike occurred here , which finally involved not only the whole of the anthracite , but a part of the bituminQus region of Pennsylvania , which lasted near six months , bringing coal to an immense price in the market , and seriously embarrassing business , and which deserves the name of the great suspension . To make the matter perfectly clear , it is worth while to revert to the opening of our civil war in the year 1861 . The standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ninety-three cents per carload . At this rate he could make about $3 50 per day for himself , and pay his assistant , or laborer , about $2 35 . But before the breaking out of the rebellion the price of mining was as low as forty-five cents per car , or less than half the price in 1874 . During the war so great was the demand for iron , and consequently for coal , that prices had risen by 1864 to $1 68 per car , not very far from double the present price , but payable , as it will be remembered , in greatly depreciated paper money . In spite of this fact , this was the miners ' flush time . I have been told that many were earning from $150 to $500 a month , and that some of these bought homes , and afterward increased their landed property . The manner in which this great advance in wages was obtained is especially worthy of note . The Miners ' Union , or Workingmen 's Beneficial Association  --  the W.B.A.-began here , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining companies , the Delaware , Lackawanna , and Western Railroad Company , the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company , and the Pennsylvania Coal Company . At the time the W. B. A. was organized , coal was rising in price , but the companies were not raising the men 's wages . The miners felt themselves entitled to a share , the tenth or twelfth part of the advanced price , but they did not receive it until they called a convention . This , as I understand , was thus organized : The hands in each mine formed a branch of the W. B. A. , and each branch was entitled to send two delegates to local conventions , and these in their turn appointed delegates to a general convention when one was held . In order to obtain an advance in wages , the men appointed at their conventions committees to wait upon the general agent // of each company , and to make the same demand upon the same day , and it was always granted , until the price had risen as I have already stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . In September of that year , when the war was drawing to a close , andthe price of coal had begun to decline , the wages of the miners was reduced eight and a half per cent. , without causing any disturbance . By July of 1865 gradual reductions had brought wages down from $1 fiS per car-load to $1 09 . On this decline there was a strike among the miners in the Scranton and Wilkesbarre region . In the preceding May a convention had been called at Scranton to take action on the fall in wages . Many were opposed to striking . But in July another convention was called , and on the 15th the hands of the three great companies struck , from Wilkesbarre to Carbondale , and " staid out " eleven weeks . The companies did not raise their wages before they resumed work , but they began again with the understanding that their pay would be raised , and an advance of five cents per car-load was made in a few days , bringing the price up to $1 14 . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as wages declined , by January , 1869 , great discontent was felt among the miners . There was no outbreak , however , until April , when the men of the two greatest mining companies suspended . These companies , the Delaware , Lackawanna , and Western , and the Delaware and Hudson , when in full operation , sent at that time 118,000 tons of coal weekly to market . The withdrawal of a mass like this must , of course , influence the price , and the Pennsylvania Coal Company ( the third in size here , and employing about one-sixth of the hands ) profited by the withdrawal of the other companies , and , figuratively speaking , made hay while the sun shone . The Miners ' Union could not have been strong then , or the men of this company would not have worked while the others were out . It has been remarked that while prices continued to rise , the miners were delighted with the Union , but when wages began to fall , their interest in it fell too . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the strike of 1869 , continued to work , and raised the men 's wages about once a month , until it amounted to $1 31 the car-load . The two other companies probably tired , if corporations can be said to tire , of seeing the Pennsylvania Coal Company carrying on business thus , and it seems that hints were conveyed to the outstanding men by agents of their employers that they had made no organized application to the companies , informing them of their wishes . At length committees from the men called upon the agents of the companies , aud offered to go to work at the rate at which the other men were working . To these the agents answered , " We are always ready to pay what our neighbors are paying ; " and the men went to work at $1 31 . This was not a long-protracted strike , and the men were successful in obtaining nearly all which they demanded . These good prices continued for over a year , partly , it seems , for a reason to me unexplained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work , although a high one , was actually not so high as the companies could then afford to pay , so greatly was the stock of coal reduced and the market price raised . Wages continued then at $1 31 , when , in November , 1870 , the three companies united in notifying the men that in one month there would be a reduction to eighty-six cents . This decline was an immense one , over thirty per cent. , and the news came upon the miners like a thunder-bolt . It would have been much better policy for the employers to reduce the price gradually as coal declined in market . This state of things may indicate that there is not much sympathy between the miners and the corporations , and Jamtold that the men feel bitter toward their employers from their showing so little respect for their manhood as not to be willing to consult with them . These are tender points with some in the Scranton region . You will find the foremen not very anxious to talk about them , but you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men feel their interest as at variance with their employers ' . When the end of the month of notification arrived , the men declined to take the sum offered , and suspended . They claimed that the matter of wages should be determined by a sliding-scale , adjusted to the price of coal in the market , and this they called a basis . They also desired to have an agent to examine the books of the companies , and to see what their profits really were . The first demand is so reasonable that we can scarcely see why it should be refused , and it is granted in the Schuylkill County region . This sliding-scale , or the basis , became a rallying cry during the long and trying conflict which followed . And they stuck to this until they were starved out . On their side , the companies thought that strikes were coming too often ( the interval having been about sixteen or eighteen months ) ; and now , as we have said , the three companies were united . The miners , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the leading Welshmen would have preferred to compromise by offering to go on at a reduction less than that demanded by the com // panies , but these were overborne by others , who were very violent in the meetings of the W. B. A. , crying out , " Strike ! strike ! " until , Iwas told , it was as much as a man 's life was worth to oppose them . So the pacific or conservative Welshmen were outvoted by the more reckless of their own nation and the rest . But , once engaged , the Welsh were the most determined , being unwilling to yield until they had effected something . Says one , " I believe they would have held out to this day ; " and another , " I believe they would have emigrated : they had strong talk of going out West in squads . " As it happened , if we may call it chance , the only blood shed in the struggle was that of two Welshmen . The Miners ' Union did not anticipate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they seem to have been firmly banded , like the men , and they had the power of capital on their side . " It was like a big war , " says an acquaintance- ' ' a six months ' war . " It seems to the writer that in this contest , however , the men were struggling against fate ; for as paper money advanced in value and approached to gold , so , as a general rule , must the price of every thing decline that was paid for in that paper money , including wages , the price of labor . The men were not literally starved out , it seems ; for one interestedsays : " I heard of no miners that were suffering for provisions , though some of them were pretty hard up . The store-keepers took the miners ' side , because it was their interest to do so . The bigger pay the miner got , the more he had to spend in the stores . " Of course the time must have come when the tradesmen could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point must have been nearly or entirely reached when the men had been out near six months . During this period families were , of course , much restricted . They could probably get along with no new clothing , or but little ; and the store-keepers trusted them for flour , tea , sugar , tobacco , and the other little necessaries of life . Such , too , as had lots could raise potatoes , cabbage , etc. , but some of them became deeply involved in debt . Ho*vever , the times had been so good that probably at least half the men had means to support themselves for a little time , and they grasped at any work they could find any where . As the strike began in December , however , the amount of work must have been small . had not the other anthracite regions become involved , their comrades might have sent them funds , or given them a share of work ; but this was impossible . The funds of the Miners ' Union , the W. B. A. , were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a time . Nor were they supported by the public . Says a friend : " Not one miner in this region went to the poor-house , nor do I believe that one applied to the comniissioners of the poor for out-door assistance . They would not have thought of such a thing , for they believed that the sympathies of the commissioners were with their employers . " About once a month a committee would call upon Mr. , the agent of the Company ( and doubtless upon the agents of the others also ) , and inquire whether the company would grant them a basis on the former prices , but they effected nothing . The Irishmen were poorer , and they were sooner ready to yield . At length a gentleman of Scranton induced thirty men to " break away from the union , " and to go to work in a mine belonging to a company smaller than the three mentioned . These men were almost entirely Irish . They went to work daily about seven in the morning , returning about five in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by their employer . When the news spread among the miners that a body of men had gone to work in a certain spot , the miners would gather upon the way to see who these were , and the onlooking crowd was swelled by boys , and perhaps by women . As the men who had yielded made their appearance , the cry arose among the spectators , " Here come the blacklegs ! " -i . e. , the turncoats or traitors . One evening as these men were thus returning along the street in Hyde Park , it is said that a boy on the street threw a stone . One of the men attacked turned around , and , discharging his musket , shot two men through the body with the same ball , and killed them instantly . At least one of these men was a miner , and was or had been a Methodist local preacher ; the other was going to get medicine for a sick child . Both were Welshmen . There was immediately an immense excitement . While the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one cried out , " Kill him 1 " but others waved them back , saying , " Let the law do him justice . " The magistrate , a Welshman , committed him to jail at Wilkesbarre , whence he was bailed out , and when brought to trial was defended by the companies , was acquitted , and lives peaceably in the neighborhood now . I tell the tale as it was told to me . So the men gave in . This bloody scene and the ensuing funerals probably broke the doughty spirit of the Welshmen . They gave in , and went to work in the latter part of May , not entirely six months from the outbreak of the contest . They began at eighty-six cents , the price which the companies had fixed ; but on the 1st of June their pay was raised to ninety-three cents . // Can strikes be prevented ? In speaking to a miner of the great suspension , I asked whether it would not be better for the company and the men to meet and settle these matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered . The miners do not seem to have any desire to buy into the stock of the companies . Is it for fear , as a miner 's wife said , " the big fishes would eat the little fishes up 1 " But if the miner does not thus co-operate with his employers , or in the manner that the poorest sailor on a whaling vessel does with the owners , the principle of joint-stock is not unknown to them . An intelligent man , once a miner , tells me that all workingmen are now aspiring to form co-operative associations for the purpose of carrying on mining and iron-works themselves . There are iron mills on this system , he said , at Danville , and a number of furnaces and rolling-mills in Ohio . These are on the same plan as the renowned works at Rochdale , in England , that have been in successful operation for many years . There is , too , a co-operative store at Hyde Park , Scranton . This store has been in operation for several years , and pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purchase . The majority of the stockholders are Welsh , and nearly all are miners .
