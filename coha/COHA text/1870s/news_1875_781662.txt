txt A pleasing story , illustrative of the manners and customs of Chicago , is just now inakiug the rounds of the press . A man is said to have sued . another in a Chicago court for $60 , to which the plaintiff had . the clearest possime legal and moral right . To his astonishment , not only did be lose the ease , but the jury decided that ho must pay $150 to the defendant . The mystery of this unexpected verdict was subsequently explained by the Constable who summoned the jury . Said this officer : " I told the plaintiff he could have a good jury for $5 . Ile would n't pay the money ; so , of course , I summoned a jury for the other side . " The story may or may not be true . At any rate , it is not inconsistent - with the character of many Constables and jurymen ; and  --  in the opinion of the people of Cincinnati and of St. Louis ? Chicago is precisely the place where such an incident might naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jury-box only to reap the certain hatred of every one who is dissatisfied with the verdict , can not fail to make jury duty extremely repugnant to most men . To such men it seems rather hard that they should be compelled to do their own jury-work . No householder , unless he is an embittered misanthrope , does his own plumbing ; and no man who can afford to hire labor sweeps his own chimneys . These things must be done , but we have professional plumbers and chimneysweeps to do them .. Why , in like manner , should we not have professional jurymen , who would do , for a small compensation , the jury duty that other men are so reluctant to do If the story of the Chicago Constable . is true , such has . evidently beep the reasoninifiwhieh the respectable Chica-gonese have'adopted . The result has been the appearance of the professional Chicago juryman , and it is only fair to say that he seems to do the work allotted to him with quite as much intelligence and fairness as . do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee charged by the official dealer in Chicago juries is ridiculonsly cheap , no one can deny . A Constable who offers to supply juries at the low price of $5 ? verdict guaranteed  --  certainly can not be called unreasonable or extortionate . The only curious feature of the matter is that the professional jurymen do not more openly advertise their business . They should organize themselves into anincorporated company  --  as other men do when they wish to do illegal acts safely and profitably  --  and should advertise largely in the Chicago newspapers . A company which should offer to supply litigants with juries of all sorts at a fixed scale of prices could do a good business , and safely charge much higher rates than the Chicago Constable has dreamed . of charging . Perhaps ten dollars would be a fair price for a jury in a simple suit on a contract not involving more than $500 .

The convenience of this business method of supplying juries is obvious . It would do away at once and forever with the proverbial uncertainty of law , and would hence be an immense saving of money and temper . A clergyman upon whom some parishioner had cast her affections unsought , and who had thereby be-. come involved in legal difficulties with an irreverent husband , would only have to order " a jury for the defendant , " or , if he preferred , " a juryfor a disagreeraent  --  majority for defendant , " to be able to . pursue his ministerial labors with a serene confidence in the jury company in which he had put his trust . The tedious processes of law would be simplified and shortened , and men with the wealth and enterprise of Mr. TWEED would no longer be subjected to the annoyance of objectionable verdicts and the cost of consequent appeals .

We have had professional bail for many years . Professional Judges , who ' practiced their profession to make money from private litigants and grasping corporations , have ornamented the Bench in this City . Why should we not have professional jurymen also l It would . only be one more step in the direction in which our courts of justice in certain States have of late years been advancing .
