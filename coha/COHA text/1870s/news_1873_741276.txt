txt The fact that broken-down , dishonest managers and agents of so-called dramatic and musical entertainments are in the habit of making what they term a " raise " at this season of the year , is either not as widely known as it should be , or a certain class of the amusement-going people in each town and city throughout the country takes pleasure in being victimized . There may be some attraction , it is true , in standing outside the " Oporaehouse " ? we believe that is the fashionable name for the Music Hall  --  and counting the ( tapes of adroit swindlers , and indulging in a hearty laugh at their own expense ; but the wisdom of it may very well be questioned . During the Summer months the cheats referred to quarter themselves in the large cities , concoct their schemes for the Pall and Winter etimpaips , and cause such advertisements as the following to be published in the daily papers : W , txTun  --  Young ladiea and gentlemen who wish to cultivate their talents for . music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free of coat , under the direction of experienced teachers , by applying immediately to A.

The number of persons who have , or think they have  --  which for the purpose of the swindle is all the same  --  talents for acting and singing that it would be a , shame and . a sin to keep under a bushel , may be counted by the hundred in this City . There is consequently no difficulty in the way of getting up a concert or " variety " troupe from such material . The poor Innocents never dream of inquiring into the character of those who engage the in . Even if it did occur to them that it might be proper to do so , they would be afraid to venture a remark on the subject for fear of displeasing , or worse still , of being summarily dismissed . The aspirants for stage honors are rarely suspicious , They accept everything as gospel , and having received the order to prepare their wardrobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very highest degree if it were displayed in almost any other work . In the meantime , the " managers " employ their spare hours in writing requests in fictitious names , to the owners of the halls and theatres throughout the section of country they propose to visit , for lists of the " open nights " ? nights for which the halls have not been rented . With these before them , it is an easy matter to lay out a route without having to incur more than the mere cost of note-paper , envelopes , and postagestamps . The next move is to get large and small " posters " printed in as neat and striking a style as can be done for a trifling expense . After agents have been employed to go ahead and . " bill " as many towns as they can , the harvest may be said to have commenced in good earnest . The country editors , in most cases without having received a penny in advance , fall into line , and puff the swindles with most injudicious promptness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in glaring black , blue , red , and green letters upon the walls , have never been heard of before . A second file of accomplices or dupes of the " managers " go forward a week or so previous to the dates advertised for the appearance of the .. companies , and in the most business-like manner open offices for the sale of reserved seats . They sell all they can , remain as long as it is safe , and . then return to their pined . pals , without waiting to pay either the hotelkeepers or the bill-posters . As the " managers " usually depend upon the success of the ticket-sellers for funds to pay the rent of leene in which they can hold rehearsals , and to pay the railroad . fares to the first towns , if anything should go wrong at the outposts , the companies are left to shift for themselves , the audiences are disappointed , the hall-owners cheated , and the bill-posters driven to despair . On the other hand , when companies ' have actually been taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of miles distant and allow the unfortunate members to make their way home as best they can . There is good reason to believe that a great many of these " fly-by-night " schemes have been hatched during the past Summer . Three or four have already exploded . Last week , Providence was made to pay toll to a ticket agent , who claimed to be acting for a lady orchestra that is probably no longer in existence . A few days ago there was a swindling concern exposed while operating in the towns along the line of the New-York Central Railroad ; and still late ; a company formed under the attractive name of " The Brooklyn Ladies , " luckily for the members ceased to exist before it had a decent rehearsal . The statement of one of the ladles who was imposed upon by the organizer will show how these swindles are perpetrated : " I am very glad to say that all the loss I suffered was the packing of my wardrobe and music . Mr. ? called on me on Thursday and represented that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocalists . He fully agreed to my terms , and under the name of Mme. CORENNA CUSH-. 1.11.911 ( assumed ) I have been " billed " as the greatest living artist , something I am wholly unworthy of . As for me , it makes very little difference , but some of the young ladies are antateure , and have . been put to a great deal of expense in getting up wardrobes , and laces and silk dresses  --  expensive articles to buy . " After this warning , it is to be hoped that the stage-struck young people of New-York end other cities will be careful not to allow themselves to be deceived by either the advertisements or representations of the class of " managers " we have been at so much pains to describe . Hall-owners can protect themselves by not paying attention to demands for lists that are unaccompanied by references ; newspaper proprietors can prevent their readers from being imposed upon by refusing to publish advertisements without payment in advance when dramatic or musical companies are unknown to them ; the bill-posters can save themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of all , the public can yet more effectually suppress swindles by refusing to buy reserved seats for entertainments , when there is any doubt about the honesty of the managers , until the dams of the halls have been opened for admission . If this advice be faithfully followed , we can promise our country friends that they will very soon hear the last of the dramatic and musical swindlers.
