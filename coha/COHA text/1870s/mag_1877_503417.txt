VOL . XXIV. - OCTOBER , 1877. - No. 4 . AI*MINISTRATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN . ECOINSTIRUCTION , as it was . L called , the desire for the restoration , preservatioa , and perpetuation of the Uaion , was a matter of absorbing interest , which began almost with the war , and was mingled with all public measures from the commencement of hostilities . The questions affecting the character and structure of the Government were the matters of political controversy long after the armies were disbanded and hostilities had ceased . The civil war , its effect upon our political system , and what would be the condition of the country at its close , brought out the distinctive political principles of the opposing parties which , under various names and phases , had agitated the country from the foundation of the Government . In the necessary . exercise of war power to suppress the rebellion those who favored a strong , central , supervisory national government were strengthened in their opinions by the extraordinary measures adopted , while the Statists , who opposed centralism and con*olldation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the exercise of only the powers specified and granted in the Constitution , were for the moment correspondingly weakened . But a strict construction of the Constitution , and a rigid adherence to its provisions , as in time of peace , were insufficient for an energetic prosecution of measures to overcome the powerful , organized , armed resistance to the Government . An avowed sectional combination to dismember the Union had sprung up , and was supported by the State authorities South , and no inconsiderable portion of the thorough party men , who had been trained against centralism , opposed governmental proceedings , which were the result of military necessity , and absolutely essential to sustain the national existence . Those who were enlisted in this sectional combination had not voted for Abraham Lincoln , and they , and many of their Northern political associates and sympathizers , would not as a party support his administration . On the other hand , a class of extreme centralists , unwilling to submit to the restraints of the organic law , and who had about as mu&amp;h reverence for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were not satisfied that the President and his advisers refused to exercise absolute power , or hesitated to assume , in such an exigency , authority not specifically delegated . One class of extremists claimed the President transcended his rightful authority , and did too much ; another class insisted that in his war measures he was inefficient , and did too little . Neither extreme controlled the Executive . It was impossible , with good administration , to adopt or assent to 28 Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1877 , by SHELDON &amp; CO. , in the office of the Librarian of Congress , at Washington . // the impulsive demands of the radicals , and it would have been dereliction and abandonment of duty on the other hand to have acquiesced in the passive , non-combative , peace doctrine of the ultra Northern Democrats in the midst of a formidable and organized rebellion . The progress of events wrought changes of opinion , and influenced the action of the Administration . Emancipation had constituted no part of the policy of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreed he connected with it , as an essential and indispensable part of his policy , a plan of deportation of the colored population . Long before he yielded to emancipation , and in the belief that it was necessary to rid the country of the African race , he had schemes for their migration more advanced than those of the colonizationists . From a conviction that the white and black races could not abide together on terms of social and political equality , he thought they could not peaceably occupy the same territory-that one must dominate the other . Opposed to the whole system of enslavement , but believing the Africans were mentally an inferior race , he believed that any attempt to make them and the whites one people would tend to the degradation of the whites without materially elevating the blacks , but that separation would promote the happiness and welfare of each . In this view he was not singular , even among anti-slavery men . 1-lenry Clay , the life-Long leader of the party with which Mr. Lincoln had been associated in early life , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the President 's scheme of deportation as an indispensable accompaniment of emancipation . In May , 1861 , the President had made known his opinions on this subject of deportation and colonization , and his belief that some suitable and inviting territory within the tropics , less remote than Africa , might be ob tamed , to which the colored people could be induced to migrate . Aware of his feelings and views , an association of gentlemen , who claimed to have acquired a title to the territory of Chiriqui in Central America , urged that the Government should purchase the grant and make it available for a colored settlement . The President was much taken with the suggestion , and it was warmly advocated by several members of the Cabinet . He referred the proposition to me , with his favorable endorsement , to investigate and report on its practicability . The examination which I made after this reference did not favorably impress me as to the purchase or the policy . There had been under the preeeding* administration a project to obtain this Chiriqui grant , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing for naval purposes a harbor and alleged inexhaustible quantities of coal at a commanding point of the Caribbean sea and the Gulf of Mexico . A naval vessel , under Commodore Bugle , had been sent thither by Secretary Toucey , with engineers , to explore the country , examine its topographical and hydrographical features , and ascertain the quality of coal reputed to be there in abundance , and of a superior quality . Their reports were highly favorable , but before the arrangements for the acquisition of the grant were completed a change of administration took place . The parties in interest brought forward the subject of this purchase , in 1861 , to the new administration , coupled with a scheme of African or colored colonization . The deported negroes , it was represented , could be advantageously employed in mining coal . The whole project had to me the appearance of a speculative job , into which the preceding administration had been seduced . I reported to the President that I had no faith in the project ; that the Navy Department had other duties than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal were there ; that the Ohiriqui territory pre- ' // sented no inducements for the colored race to emigrate thither ; that if the negroes were there , they would not willingly work , nor were mining labors and operations congenial to them . The whole scheme , though skilfully presented in the name of humanity , had a money-making appearance in the interest of not over scrupulous speculators ; further than that , I had never been favorable to the plan of African colonization by the Government . Differing as I did from him and others on the question , it would be proper that the subject , if to be prosecuted , should be committed to some member of the Cabinet who was otherwise impressed . The papers were then handed to Mr. Caleb Smith , Secretary of the Interior , an earnest colonizationist , who ardently advocated the Chiriqui project . He promptly recommended the purchaser the immediate settlement of a black colony there , and that the Navy Department should make an advance of *O , OOO toward its acquisition , to be repaid in coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ought , he reported , to be no delay in securing the grant , for both the English and French were anxious to obtain it , and would already have purchased it but for the patriotism of the proprietors , who preferred that this important station in Costa Rica should come into possession of the American Government . Smith 's report was plausibly presented , and the President approved it without himself investigating the legality of the title , which he took for granted had been attended to by both Mr. Smith and the Buchanan administration , which had introduced the measure and favored the purchase . Most of the Cabinet assented . Both Mr. Bates and Mr. Blair were colonizationists , and in favor of deportation . Mr. Chase and Mr. Seward were indifferently doubtful . My objection to the Chiriqui project , and to the impolicy and illegality of Mr. Smith 's programme , caused a temporary suspension of the scheme , without any abandonment by the President of his policy of relieving the country of the African race . In the mean time Congress , responding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two projects of colonization in Central America or the West Indies were instituted . Samuel C. Pomeroy , a Senator from Kansas , where he had figured largely in the free State cause , and against the introduction of slavery into that territory , during the Pierce and Buchanan administrations , became interested , and proposed to take upon himself personally an examination of the Central American purchase . An association in New York was also to make an experimental trial by enlisting and carrying out a colony of negroes to the West Indies . The Government was , of course , to furnish a vessel , and be at the expense of what was claimed to be so humane an undertaking . Application was made to the Navy Department for a ship , in order that the colonization fund might be husbanded and spared the expense of chartering a vessel to transport the little colony . This was respectfully declined . The Secretary of the Navy did not feel himself authorized to divert a national ship from its duties for such an object . He had not made estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal for colonization . Recruits went by a different course to Cow Island , a desolate and forlorn place , where a colony was literally planted . Few survived to return . The funds and most of the negroes disappeared together . President Lincoln , though disappointed in these experiments , by no means abandoned his policy of deportation and emancipation , for the two were in his mind indispensably and indissolubly connected . Colonization in fact had precedence with him . At the beginning of his administration he had brought it forward , and in his * first annual message recommended that " steps be taken for colonizing both classes ( the free blacks and the // slaves that might be emancipated ) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them . " In Cabinet meetings , where the subject was frequently discussed , and at the time the preliminary emancipation proclamation was issued , he wished it distinctly understood that deportation was in his mind inseparably connected with that measure ; that he considered the two to be parts of one system , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally decided and promulgated on Monday , the 22d of September , 1862 . The subject was discussed and consumed most of the day . The second branch , that of deportation , was postponed to the following meeting on Tuesday , when it was taken up , examined , and debated in all its aspects , without coming to a conclusion , as was also the case on Friday , the 26th , when it was again considered . There was not a member of the Cabinet who did not coincide with the President as to the desirableness of relieving the country of a conflict or of an amalgamation of the two races , one or both of which results lay in the future were they to occupy the same territory . There was , however , great diversity of opinion as to the way and manner of effecting that relief , and also as to its practicability . Although an anti-slavery man , the President was not a convert to the doctrine of the social and political equality of the races , which was a favorite theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many interviews , and from both of whom he on this point totally differed . Sumncr was theoretically and Stevens practically favorable to the social and political equality of blacks and whites . The President doubted if the Africans as a race were themselves capable of organizing as a community and successfully maintaining a government without supervision , or individually susceptible of high intellectual cultivation . There might be and were exceptional cases , but they were by nature dull , inert , dependent , and of little foresight-an ignorant and inferior race , who needed to be governed , were not as a class able or qualified to participate intelligently in self-government . If they were to exercise the high privilege of suffrage  --  the first and most important step in free government-it must be at some distant day in the future after several generations of education and nurture . In the mean time they would increase in numbers , have leaders of their own or of a mixed race of exceptionable ability and ambition , and also white demagogues to excite and mislead them , until , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in which we were now engaged might be expected . It was the duty of all who were entrusted with public affairs to take the subject into consideration , and foresee and guard against these threatened but he thought certainly impending evils . Colonization he believed to be the only remedy . His own speeches and writings disclose his sentiments , which are much misrepresented and misunderstood . He was not a political Abolitionist . To a deputation of colored persons who waited upon him he said : " You and we are different races . We have a broader difference than exists between almost any two races . " " Your race suffers very greatly , many of them by living among us , while ours suffers from your presence . In a word , we suffer on each side . If this is admitted , it affords a reason at least why we should be separated . . . Your race are suffering , in my judgment , the greatest wrong inflicted on any people . But even when you cease to be slaves , you are yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white race . " " Not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of * " It is better for us both , therefore , to be separated . " These extracts indicate the purpose , policy , and kindly nature of the President , and when , impelled by events , he decreed emancipation , he connected // with it colonization as an essential part of his policy . But some locality more inviting and less remote than Liberia he deemed advisable ; and encouraged by the Secretary of the Interior , he still continued to regard with favor a settlement in Costa Rica . The whole subject was seriously and earnestly canvassed in successive Cabinet meetings following the preliminary emancipation proclamation in the fall of 1862 . Mr. Blair was a decided advocate of the President 's policy ; Mr. Bates was equally so , and going beyond others , he was for compulsory deportation - compelling the slaves when set free to leave the country . At one of the meetings he read a carefully prepared paper expressive of his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make emigration desirable and inviting to the blacks . Mr. Seward was indifferently favorable to the President 's views , and at his request consulted with the representatives of foreign governments as to the reception of such a colony . Mr. Chase took no decisive stand in the Cabinet . I , while assenting to the deleterious effects of the presence of the colored race , asked how our prosperity would be affected by sending so much labor out of the country , even if practicable , doubted the practicability of the scheme , questioned the validity of the Thompson Chiriqui grant , which I had inquired into in the spring of 1861 , suggested that the title to the grant itself was defective if not illegal , and questioned whether it was not a positive swindle . Mr. Stanton took little interest and no active part , but concurred with me on every point . Mr. Smith excepted to my remarks ; said the title was good beyond question . It had been fully investigated by the Buchanan administration , which had sent out the expedition under Commo. dore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself looked into the subject , and knew the men concerned in it to be honorable . The President was sui*prised and Blair startled by my doubts of the validity of Thompson 's title . Further action and discussion of the Chiriqui grant was suspended , and Mr. Seward was directed to make inquiries of the minister from New Granada in regard to the title of Thompson , and report at a future meeting . In a day or two thereafter Mr. Seward said he had made inquiries as directed , and that the governments and rival parties in Central America denied the validity of the Thompson grant , and pronounced it a bogus transaction . This terminated all negotiation and inquiry in that direction , though it did not immediately close the interest and purpose of the President , who in his second annual message , alluding to " the future of the freed people , " said , " I strongly favor colonization . " But it was one of the important measures of President Lincoln which failed of success-a part of his policy on which his Cabinet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully concur , from a conviction of the impracticability of general deportation , or sending *from the country millions of its inhabitants ; not that I adopted the scheme of social and political equality of the races , which was a sine qua non with the radicals . Little comparatively has been said on this colonization and deportation policy in which the President took so deep an interest , and in commenting on it he lamented that every humane undertaking of the Government was at once seized by a swarm of swindlers and converted into a mercenary transaction . Being a constitutionalist , and planting himself on the fundamental principles of the governmental compromise in the organic law , President Lincoln was reluctant on any occasion or for any purpose , even under the war necessities , to depart from coastitutioaal landmarks . Always cautious , and habitually but inquiringly reticent on controverted and unsettled questions , he moved with deliberation on important subjects , and on no one with greater hesitation than that of eman- // cipating the slaves in the seceding States . It is not surprising , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the most considerate of his supporters were dissatisfied , and some of them not gentle in their complaints . His own firm purpose in that trying period on the most trying question he had yet encountereci will be best understood from his letters and remarks openly and boldly avowed when compelled , or he deemed it expedient to give utterance to his views . His brief reply to a long and intrusively advisory letter of Horace Greeley , written and published by Greeley as " The Prayer of Twenty Millions , " discloses the views , object , and intention of Mr. Lincoln . Waiving " the impatient and dictatorial tone " of Greeley , the President said : " As to the policy I seem to be pursuing , as you say , I have not meant to leave any one in doubt . I would save the Union . I would save it in the shortest way under the Constitution . The sooner the national authority can be restored , the nearer the Union will be the Union as it was . If there be those who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time save slavery , I do not agree with them . If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery , I do not agree with them . My paramount object is to save the Union , and not either to save or destroy slavery . If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves , I would do it ; if I could save it by freeing all the slaves , I would do it ; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would do that . What I do about slavery and the colored race I do because I believe it helps to save the Union , and what I forbear I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union . " In that extract the aim and policy of the President are seen and explicitly stated . He did not deem it necessary , however , or even expedient , to inform 1*Ir . Greeley and the " twenty millions " for whom Greeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time already prepared and in his desk awaiting events a preliminary proclamation to emancipate the slaves in the seceding States . Others , and many of them , as well as Mr. Greeley , volunteered their opinions and advice as to how the Government should be administered , and admonished the President as to what were his duties . In these cases he listened amid his many duties to what was said , heard suggestions , advice spoken sometimes with friendly regard , sometimes dictatorially nttered , but acted upon his own convictions . The good intentions and abilities of Mr. Greeley he respected , but had not implicit confidence in the judgment and stability of that eminent controversial and philanthropic writer on measures of public policy . Mr. Greeley was at the head of one of the most important and influential political journals of the period , a vigorous and generally lucid writer , with a kindly heart and generous impulses , but he possessed a hasty and irritable temper , was impatient of restraint , and vexed with what he considered the dilatory movements of the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military action of the generals . Benevolently disposed , especially with friends , he was the enemy of slavery and all oppression . As credulous as benevolent , and with no great reverence for settIed political principles or fixed ideas of government , he readily listened to new and visionary schemes , was often deceived by inferior intellects that addressed his vanity , was the victim of theories , and of enthusiasts , who enlisted his curiosity , as well as by the cunning and designing , who imposed upon his sympathies and his party prejudices , which were strong . Liberal and tolerant in many things , he was nevertheless imperious and exacting ii1 other and often fanciful schemes , and was seldom satisfied with the management of public affairs , whether by friends or opponents , from // a bePef that he would in their position do differently and better . His trenchant pen he wielded with power , and often with effect . As the recognized head of one of the first journals he held a commanding position ; but not contented in his proper sphere and vocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conviction that he better than any one could control public opinion and direct the Government . He also flattered himself that he was something of an orator , and that he was as capable and effective a speaker as writer . But with all his talents , he was eminently unfit for administrative duties or responsible office of any kind-was too arbitrary and opinionated to be advised , too erratic , visionary , and impulsive to secure confidence and establish and maintain a consistent line of policy . As an orator , public speaker , or captivating debatorin a deliberative body , or even to a miscellaneous gathering , he was unattractive , having neither the elocution , grace , magnetic power , fervor , voice , or manner to sway an audience , although he could prepare an interesting essay on almost any subject to be read in a lecture room . But while charitable by nature , and readily dismissing resentments , he never recovered from the humiliation and disap. pointment which he experienced when made aware that Seward and Weed , the controlling minds ' of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves , but only a trusted , secondary , useful , and valuable subordinate to assist and carry out their schemes and purposes . In the peculiar party management of the Whigs of New York in the latter days of the Democratic regency and during Seward 's gubernatorial career , the two master spirits exhibited great address in conciliating , uniting , and concentrating others whom they found it convenient to consult , but no third person was incorporated into that dual management . They justly appreciated the abilities of Greeley and valued his serviccs , but they also knew some of his infirmities-his dogmatism by fits ; his contempt of certain practices which were to them indispensable ; his erratic , unreliable nature in emergencies when his aid was most wantedbut they did not then fully understand or appreciate his great greed for office , and they were well aware that his temperament was such that he would be likely in any responsible public station to bring trouble to his friends and associates . When the men came to fully understand each other , and Greeley learned that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only the trusted instrument of two whom he had supposed were his companions and equals , a separation and alienation took place . They all subsequently acted with the same party , but the familiarity and intimacy that had been broken was never restored . Greeley took a step in advance of his late friends in the Republican movement , left the Whig organization , which became demoralized ; but the remnant of which continued to be upheld and was under the control of the two men with whom he had acted , and who were reluctant to give up an organization that they had controlled with effect and by which they had sometimes achieved success . In the new departure Greeley did not conceal his dislike of his two old associates , was open in his hostility to the nomination of Mr. Seward for President which Weed had profoundly at heart , and he was also opposed to Seward 's receiving a place in Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet . The appointment of Seward to the office of Secretary of State made Greeley less cordial and earnest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without his being aware of the fact , he was more ready to dissent from and to complain of what was done or omitted to be done than would have been the case had Mr. Seward not been a conspicuous member of the Government . Mr. Lincoln was always an antislavery man ; but , as I have said , was never a political Abolitionist . Events // and war necessity compelled him to adopt the policy of emancipation , for which lie has received and deserved merited honors ; but those who applaud his course in that respect omit to mention that colonization and deportation of the slaves when set free was deemed by him an essential part of his emancipation policy . Whether right or wrong on that subject it is not necessary to discuss , but the truth need not be suppressed . He believed it would be best for both the whites and blacks that the latter should leave the country , or , as he expressed it in his interview with the colored representatives , " it is better for us both to be separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of his policy , I have sometimes doubted whether he would not have hesitated longer in issuing the decree of emancipation*had he been aware that colonization would not be accepted as an accompaniment . It is impossible at this day for those who were not participants to conceive the perplexities attending the disposition of the slavery question in its various and complex phases , among contending factions and in distinct localities-the differing views in regard to emancipation by men and sections , States and parties , throughout the war . After a year 's conflict , and the first step had been taken , and it was evident that slavery was doomed and that freedom to man was to be the future of the country , efforts were made to postpone the day of general deliverance . In the border States the subject of immediate and prospective emancipation was agitated , as in Missouri , and the question was raised whether if one or more of the insurrectionary States , North Carolina for instance , and perhaps others , were to cease hostilities and return to their allegiance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellum position , with their laws and institutions unchanged , and as members of the Federal Government , having equal political rights with the other Statcs . The people as well as Congress were for a time confused and uncertain on these matters , and discontented friends as well as the opponents of the Administration availed themselves of the occasion and the doubts to declare that the policy of the Executive extinguished all hope of reconciliation , and ensured the everlasting separation of the States . Questions as to the future of the States that were in rebellion , how they should be recognized or treated when the insurrection was suppressed , and in what way and manner a restoration of their former relation to the Federal Government should be effected , were much agitated in 1863 , not only by the considerate and patriotic , but they entered into the schemes of politicians who had personal aspirations and party objects to accomplish . The circumstances of the country indeed required of the Administration , while prosecuting the war and amid other pressing and absorbing duties , a defined governmental policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of constant thought and of many Cabinet discussions , which eventuated in the adoption of a line of policy that was embodied in the annual message of December 5 , 1863 , and a proclamation of pardon and amnesty of the same date to all but certain specified persons , with restoration of rights of property , except as to slaves , whenever a prescribed oath was taken of fidelity to the Constitution of the United States , and acquiescence in measures which were the results of the war . Oppressed with the responsibilities which the insurrection and waste of war had brought upon the Government and country , and the strain al ready made upon the Constitution , the President felt that other and not less weighty measures , affecting the future and permanent welfare of the country , were pressing upon him , impelling him to predicate a course by which the suspended or broken relations of the family of States could again be re // stored and nationalized . This matter of reconstruction , rehabilitating the States in insurrection after the rebellion had been suppressed , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administration . On it depended the enduring peace and welfare of the States , the happiness and prosperity of the people , and the stability and perpetuity of the Union itself . In the disposition of the subject bitter contentions arose , which , if partially allayed , were not fully adjusted under the administration of Mr. Lincoln , and after his death increased in intensity , changed in some respects the character of the Government , and entering into party conflicts , caused political alienations which disturbed the local and national elections that have not yet terminated , and may outlast the republic . The wild , revolutionary , and destructive schemes of some of his most prominent supporters , who were determined to centralize and consolidate the Government and reduce the States to the condition of provinces , found no favor with President Lincoln . On the other hand , the factious Democratic opposition , which interposed obstruction to almost every important and necessary measure , and which seldom in that trying period rose above the lowest level of party , excepted to the exercise of extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . The President , neither impelled by the one nor restrained by the other of these extremes , and surrounded by a multitude of threatening difficulties , continued cool , calm , and resolutely deliberate , but courageously firm in his reconstruction policy when action became necessary . Slow and reluctant to adopt emancipation , fully aware that in peaceful times the institution of slavery was protected by constitutional restrictions and safeguards , he had been unwilling to touch it , even under war necessity , but the exigency required governmental action . In his message of December 1 he 863 , said : " According to our political system , as a matter of civil administration , the Government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State , and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed . without resorting to it as a military measure . It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come , and that if it should , the crisis for the contest would then be presented . It came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful days . " In this extract the feelings and ideas of the President in that first cautious but necessary step are frankly stated . It was not a voluntary movement on his part , but slavery lay at the basis of national strife , and after war cbmmenced emancipation was indispensable to unity and the national welfare . A year later , but while the war was still in progress , and th*rebels , though weakened , were still vigorous and in arms , the conviction that the Union cause would triumph was general , and the question of the future of the Government and country , and how the States were to be reconstructed , and in their federal relations brought into harmonious action , was discussed . There was no wish with certain parties for a restoration of the old Union . The radicals preferred a consolidated central government , with supervisory authority over the States , to a federal Union , with reserved local sovereignty and an equality of . political rights among the several commonwealths . The President recognized and admitted the necessity of indicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chagrin of many friends , his policy was still one of reconciliation and a federal Union , with as little disturbance as possible of the governments and traditions of the rebel States , and a sacred regard of the constitutional rights of the erring as , well as of the unfortunate . He said in his message in 1863 : " Looking now to the present and future , and with a reference to a resumption of // the national authority in the States wherein that authority has been suspended , I have thought fit to issue a proclamation in which nothing is attempted beyond what is amply justifled by the Constitution . ' " " The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope it may do good , without danger of harm . " " This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or taken too soon . " As a basis of action for the loyally disposed citizens of any State to effect reconciliation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former rightful position in the Federal Union , he declared that any " number of persons not less than onetenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty , each having taken the oath aforesaid , and not having since violated it , and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing before the so-called act of secesswn , AND EXCLUDING ALL OTHERS , shall reestablish a State government which shall be republican , and in no wise contravening said oath , such shall be recognized as the true government of the State , and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion , and on application of the Legislature , or the Executive , when the Legislature can not be convened , against domestic violence . ' And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , the boundary , the subdivisions , the Constitution , and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained , etc . This proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the natio 1 authority has been suspended and legal State governments have been subverted , a mode in and by which the national authority and legal State governments may be reestablished within said States or any portion of them . " President Lincoln 's plan to reestablish a State government in any of the seceding States was plain and simple . The mode of reconstruction was fully discussed and concurred in by every member of his Cabinet . It was said there were members of Congress who would dissent from this action of the Executive , and there was some question in regard to the number of voters which on the first attempt should initiate reorganization . One-tenth was agreed upon . On no one point were the members of the Administration more united than that of designating what persons should vote and participate in the election . In the several States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject having been reserved when the Constition was framed for the local governments . It being an ungranted power , no uniform national regulation could be ordered , nor was it desirable that there should be if State individuality was to be considered . Each commonwealth had best determined that question in other and peaceful days , when they knew and had deliberately enacted for themselves who should be entrusted with the elective franchise and what was best for their own self government . But it was proper for the President to withhold pardon , and thereby exclude from voting , the primary source of government , and from participation in civil affairs , at least for a period &amp;nd until order and peace were established , rebels in arms who had forfeited citizenship and life by resisting the Government and putting the laws at defiance . These had forfeited the voting privilege , and in fact all their civil rights ; but the President , in the exercise of his prerogative , extended pardon and general amnesty to such as laid down their arms , returned to their allegiance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and union . Besides excluding those who were in open rebellion , it was important that strangers-persons belonging to the armies and others not legal residents , but who were brought thither by the warshould be precluded . The idea that the Administration or Federal Government was authorized to admit any to vote who were not legally qualified and entitled by the laws of the State in which they were temporarily located to do so , was not entertained or even suggested . No one proposed or believed that negroes or colored persons , even those who had intelligence or property , but were not permitted the elective franchise by the organic law of the States , should or could be endowed with the privilege of voting by the President or Congress . The Federal Government was clothed with no power to enlarge suffrage , but the President could circumscribe it by withholding or by conditional pardons could remove forfeitures and grant amnesty to the inhabitants , which he did by his proclamation . Suffrage was withheld from actual rebels ; but there was no attempt to enlarge , extend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This purpose to abstain as far as possible from federal interference in the State governments was by no means satisfactory to the radicals . The leaders and many of their less intelligent followers had in view the subversion and even the annihilation of the State governments , an avowed purpose to territorialize the States which had attempted to secede , and reduce them to the condition of provinces , to subjugate the people and govern them , instead of permitting the people to govern themselves , and to no longer recognize State equality . It was in fact an innovation on , if not the immediate destruction of our federal republican system-a change , revolutionary in its character , to be brought about by a fragmentary Congress , in the name of freedom , humanity , and equal rights . Connected with this ultra scheme and ultimately a part of the radical plan was a design , openly declared , not only to disfranchise most of the intelligent whites , but of conferring on every negro the privilege of voting . Senator Sumner , the champion leader of this revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege , but an innate right to which colored persons were entitled , if not by the Constitution , by the Declaration of Independence , which recognized all men as equals , and that it was the duty of the Federal Government to secure to them its exercise , regardless of local governments and the reserved powers and sovereignty of the States . In private caucusses and conversations it was urged that the negro vote was right in itself and that it would secure permanent ascendancy to the Republican party . But the appeals and the current party opinion failed to influence President Lincoln , who considered the proposition to disregard the fundamental laws and reserved rights of the States as an outrage that would ultimately be ruinous in its consequences to our federal system . Nor was there a single member of the Cabinet who gave countenance to the project of forcing negro suffrage upon the States . On the contrary , it was the policy of the President , dis*. tinetly and unequivocally declared and always consistently maintained , that only qualified voters by the election " laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " should vote on the question of rei*stablishing a State government , or , in common parlance , rcconstruction . There was diversity , it may be said contrariety of opinions in the Cabinet on incidental and minor points connected with the subject of reconstruction , such as emancipation , colonization , confiscation , amnesty , and acts of Executive authority without Congressional action to reorganize and rehabilitate the States in insurrection , but there was perfect agreement by // the President and Cabinet on the subject of non-interference by the Federal Government with the laws of the States on the question of suffrage . At a later period two members of the Cabinet , Chase and Stanton , advocated the establishment and enforcement of negro suffrage in the rebel States , the former as a political right , the latter as a measure of expediency , but neither of these gentlemen proposed or suggested it in the autumn of 1863 , when the policy of reconstruction was discussed . Mr. Chase , always an anti-slavery man , was a favorite and recognized leader of that class of persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covetous of his position as a chief in the anti-slavery cause , but sensitive on the subject of being considered a political Abolitionist , always disclaiming connection with that organization . The war and the exercise of strong measures by the Government had rendered that faction and their unconstitutional schemes less obnoxious than in former years . No member of the Administration was more surprised than the Secretary of the Treasury when the President in the autumn of 1862 announced to the Cabinet his purpose to issue a proclamation to emancipate slaves in the rebel States . Until made known by himself in full Cabinet meeting , I am not aware that any member of the Administration but Mr. Seward and myself ( one a Whig , the other a Democrat , in their political antecedents ) had been advised that he had the subject in contemplation . I have some reason to suppose that Owen Lovejoy , the avowed and leading Abolitionist in Congress , was confidentially consulted . Neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor the Postmaster General was present when the proclamation was first submitted to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet the President declared the act to be his own , for which no member of his Administration was responsible . It came upon Mr. Chase , as he stated , unexpectedly , but he cordially approved the measure . The step was , however , beset with many perplexing and embarrassing difficulties to the Administration . Universal emancipation throughout the republic was not decreed by the President , as many in these days suppose . The measure did not reach the border States , nor was it nor could it be extended over any State that had not rebelled . To have attempted it would have been an unauthorized assumption of power , warranted by no military necessity , nor could the Executive by any act of his or the Administration forbid the re*stablishmeat of slavery or the enactment of laws respecting labor or servitude in any State after the rebellion was suppressed . As against foreign powers the rights of an American citizen were maintained by the Federal Government , but the local organizations were his protection in the United Statcs . What , it was asked , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should her people voluntarily abandon the Confederacy and now come forward to resume federal allegiance and fidelity to the Union ? Would her position as one of the United States be like that of New York and Massachusetts ? There had been a dis , position manifested and some progress made in North Carolina toward reunion under the flag , and efforts were still being made to detach one or more of the seceding States from the Confederacy , and effect its complete restoration to the political family independent of its associates . Were North Carolina to cease hostilities and come forward under the proclamation to resume her place , would she also resume all her original sovereign rights as before the rebellion ? Would she be in the political condition of Maryland and other border States ? Would her slave owners retain their slaves under North Carolina laws ? Would the State have exclusive control of the subject and the same soyereign rights as before the rebellion ? // And if not , if deprived of a sovereign right never ceded to the central Government , but specially reserved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal footing with the other States . If dispossessed of this or any . other right which was enjoyed by her co-States , what inducement was there for her to reunite ? The original constitutional compact would be destroyed ; the States would be no longer equal in political rights , as had been agreed when the Constitution was framed . A primary fundamental axiom of our federal system would be arbitrarily set aside by the central Government . Indeed , it was claimed that emancipation had destroyed that equality , and that the border States had privileges of which other States south of them were deprived . Where under the Constitution had the Federal Government authority to make these discriminations or distinctions ? While the other members of the Administration felt the embarrassment of these complications , and no one more than the President , Mr. Chase , who had been startled by the unexpected action in the proclamation of freedom , pressed forward , breaking over all barriers , and entertained , or professed to entertain , no doubt in regard to the present or the future . Emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had effected , he claimed , a permanent change in the federal Constitution . Liberty was , by rebellion and the decision of arms , to which appeal had by the rebels themselves been made , become a part of the organic law of the republic , and freedom was hereafter the national birthright of every citizen . When it was denied that a change in the Constitution could be made by an Executive proclamation , Mr. Chase , a Statist and not a centralist , insisted that the change had already taken place . The fact that slavery was recognized and still existed in the border States he accounted as nothing-as hardly a temporary obstruction , a frail remnant , which wou4d be swept away by the mighty wave of public opinion probably before the rebellion was suppressed . In this decisive stand and these emphatic declarations of the Secretary of the Treasury , conflicting as they did with his political doctrines as a Statist , it was surmised that other ends than those of slavery and emancipation might be found ; that the President having by his emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was considered the prominent anti-slavery champion in the Administration , that gentleman was determined not to surrender his position , but thenceforward to be in the fore-front rank on all these questions . It is undoubtedly true that the President in coming to the conclusion of emancipating the slaves in the rebel States had done so without first consulting the Secretary of the Treasury , or advising with him until after the preliminary proclamation was written , and in doing so he doubtless had a purpose . It is no less true that Mr. Chase detected and comprehended that purpose ; but , though unadvised of the measure at its inception , he was unflinching in its support when it was announced , and thenceforward steadfastly and persistently insisted on its rigid enforcement by the Executive , with all its embarrassments and responsibilities . This was , however , with professed deference and friendly regard toward the President , who , he had a lingering hope , but with serious doubts , was not to be a candidate for rei*lection , and with whom he desired to act in concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in the Cabinet and the Republican party . Reconstruction , or the method of rehabilitating the States , reistablish* ing the Federal Government in its rightful authority and securing permanent union throughout the limits of the republic , were questions discussed and agitated in the autumn of 1863 , and politicians connected them with the approaching Presidential election . The plan communicated in the annual message at the opening of the // session in December was an Executive measure , suggesting what was deemed a practicable policy tending to reconstruction , which had been deliberately considered in the Cabinet and unanimously approved by every member of the Administration . Speculations in regard to the ensuing Presidential election had commenced among the politicians and party men , and although the subject was never alluded to in the Cabinet , the probable candidates of the Republican party were not inattentive to current public opinion . There was a growing impression among the Republicans that the President would not and ought not to decline a reillection ; that his continuance in office was essential until the rebellion was suppressed ; and that under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country could be best accomplished . Mr. Seward , aware that he had lost confidence and possessed less strength than in 1860 , when he failed of a nomination , came early to the conclusion that he would not be a competitor with Mr. Lincoln ; but he still had a corps of efficient friends who , like himself , were determined that no other man should supersede him , and especially not his former riva1 and present associate in the Cabinet , Mr. Chase . But the Secretary of the Treasury , though not in his proper sphere in the Treasury , nor particularly successful as a financier , had from his official position and extreme official patronage , and his early and continued anti-slavery opinions , acquired strength and a considerable personal following . His mental and physical powers were great , and were actively employed in discharging duties for which he had little taste , but he was never forgetful that he might be useful in a higher place . Not very skilful in political tactics , or correct in his estimate of men , and often deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he lost favor in one quarter while he gained in another . With lingering hopes , but serious doubts whether the President would or would not be a candidate for reilection , and unwilling , but nevertheless prepared , if public opinion would sustain him , to compete for the nomination , he , during the autumn of 1863 and early months of 1864 , exerted himself to gain the good will and support of the Republicans , and particularly the radical portion of that party .
