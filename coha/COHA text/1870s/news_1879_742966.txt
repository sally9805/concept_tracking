txt The financial troubles of the Catholic Church in Cincinnati are growing worse . At first It was believed that the liabilities of the Archbishop would not exceed $700,000 , and property to secure bonds to that amount was transferred to a Board of Trustees . It soon became evident , however , that the claims would largely exceed that sum , and the plan of issuing bonds was practically abandoned . The Trustees appointed to straighten out the strangely tangled banking system of Archbishop Purcell are proceeding with their labors as speedily as possible , but , owing to the lack of system in the keeping of the accounts , it is a difficult matter for them to name a time when they can give to the public a statement . It is now known positively , that at a synod of priests held in the Cathedral last Wednesday , where the venerable Archbishop presided in person , Father Callahan , his Secretary , stated to , the clergy assembled that up to that date the liabilities footed up $3,600,000 , and still the claims were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up by the Secretary , this startling fact was omitted . Various schemes to relieve the Archbishop were proposed at that meeting , but it was observed that the German priests ' present were taking no active part in the proceedings . Upon being reminded of the fact that while every English-speaking church in the diocese has taken up a collection in aid of the Archbishop , no G-erman church has contributed a dollar . Father Albrinak , of the Holy Trinity , spoke in reply , saying that the reason for this neglect was because the German Catholics wanted to see a statement of the actual condition of affairs before contributing , in order that they might know what had become of the money lent the Archbishop , and just how much it would take to extricate him froln ? his troubles . After some more explanations and speeches , it was announced that a lottery scheme had been devised as one of the most feasible means of raising the funds that the Archbishop so sorely needs . The scheme proposed is to extend through a long term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plan developed the fact that it was believed , if the importance of the subject was properly presented to the attention of the Legislature , it would repeal that portion of the Lottery law which prohibits the use of lotteries for charitable purposes . This scheme seemed to meet with the warm approval of many of the priests present , and even those who did not think it advisable , or feasible at least . gave it their passive acouleseence . Finally , a committee , consisting of well-known priests , was appointed to devise ways and means for carrying the plan into execution . In the opinion of some of the best-informed persons , the total amount of the Archbishop 's liabilities will exceed $4,000,000 . As it now seems to be understood that , In accordance with the decision of Chief-Justice Taney , none of the church property held in trust by the Archbishop can be disposed of in payment of these debts , as they were not contracted in the lino of his duties as Archbishop , it will be necessary to devise some extraordinary means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid . The universal feeling and expression among Catholics is that every dollar should be paid , and to that end contributions will be solicited from all the other dioceses in America and Europe , and priests will be dispatched to collect them . The friends of the Church are filled with alarm at the situation . It is doubtful if all the Catholic church and school property In Cincinnati , if put up at forced sale , would realize enough to pay the indebtedness . It is believed that litigation will soon be begun and that the first suit will precipitate an avalanche . The important question for depositors is , whether the property of the Church can be held to satisfy their claims , and this point will be the first to be settled in the courts . It is not known whether or not the resignation of the Archbishop will be accepted . The letter of Cardinal Sinieoni , sayingthatthe Pope thought it " inopportune to accept it at present , " is thought by some to be a sly bit of sarcasm at the venerable Archbishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Papal infallibility at the Ecumenical Council , not because he did not believe it , but because he thought the time inopportune . Ever since that time he has been known in Rome , among the Cardinals and higher clergy , as the " Inopportunist , " and it is hinted that some of the tenacious-minded Italians wish to remind him of that speech .
