txt It was unwise to make too much of this sort of talk . The opponents of the grant were a mere handful , scarcely more than a dozen , in the midst of the House , and they certainly do not represent the general feeling out of doors , which is that royalty should be kept up in a splendid , openhanded way , Yet , there can be no doubt that the cliseussion of such questions does set the minds of the people in * particular way of thinking , which rather dieenchants them in regard to monarchy , and , after all , it is not exactly a thing to be reasoned about . Some persons have been rather surprised to find Mr. Bright doming forward to patronise the heir apparent , and he was , perhaps , the only speaker who touched the question in the right key , and in this he gave another proof of his essential conservatism . He was at first , he said , rather doubtful of the expediency of the journey , but he had confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , it must be for something in the nature of a royal progress , and not for . a run through the country with a portmanteau and carpet-bag And then he went on to say a word for the Paince himself , as being of " a kindly nature . generous on all occasions , and courteous in a remarkable degree , " - which is no more than the Prince really deserves . PARLIAMENT . . The debate of last week on Mr. Trevelyan 's motion for the estabhshment of universal honeshold suffrage in boroughs and counties alike , has just been followed by another farce of a similar kind in the shape of a proposal to have an inquiry into the present distribution of seats , with , of course , a view to redistribution . A vague resolution to this effect , in which no indication whatever was given of the means by - which the inquiry should be conducted , or the principles on which it should be based , was moved by Sir Charles Dille , and was supported in debate by Prot Fawcett and Mr. Groschen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for the resolution , ? but did not speak . Mr. Lowe neither spoke nor voted . The Government had , of course , an easy victory . Everybody is more or less afraid of what would happen in the confusion of upsetting all old-fashioned arrangements , and mapping out the country into now-faogled electoral divisions , just as people are also afraid of a sudden extension di household suffrage among the most ignorant class of the population . There are , probably , not half a dozen men in the House of- Commons who do not in their hearts abominate these dangerous innovations , and Would be glad to do all they could to keep things as they are ; and yet there is not sufficient strength of mind on either side to resist the temptation of snatching the direction of the detested movement from the other side . " If we do n't do it , " say the Conservatives , " the Liberals will . " and on the other hand the Liberals feel obliged to make a dash for it , in order , if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite evident in the debate of Thursday night that neither party was as yet prepared for real action , and that the light skirmishing with which they amused themselves was only intended to feel the way for future operations . Last night there was a little burst of feeling on Mr. Gladstone 's part - which threvi additional light on the disruption of his party . The result of the new judicature reforms is , it seems , to be an increase in the judicial staff , and Mr. Gladstone telt it necessary to open his heart on this subject . Mr. Disraeli , in his peroration , urged the folly of surrendering , for what might prove to be'a vagary of philosophers , the solid advantages of a parliamentary system which bad raised the country to the highest glory and admiration of the world ; but , in point of fact , everybody knows that Mr. Disraeli could find an excuse for surrendering to-morrow if it suited his taste . THE BYRON MEMORIAL . " We know no spectacle , " wrote Macaulay , in his well-known essay on Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its periodical fits of morality ; " and it may be thought that there is something equally absurd in the British public 's present fit of repentance for its harshness and injustice m other days . There can be no loubt that in his own time Byron suffered as a scapegoat , but this was in a great degree the natural consequence of his own affectations and parade of mystery , and there is no reason to suppose that it has laid very heavily on the zonscievces of his countrymen . Mr. Disraeli said , very justly , at yesterday 's meeting to ar-:anze about a memorial to the poet , that his private Character was ambiguous , and that no one could undertake to pronounce upon it posi- tively and definitely . But he also added , with equal truth , that " when half a century has elapsed , private character is scarcely an element in the estimate of literary genius . " If , however , the question is thus reduced to one of literary fame , it is difficult to conceive what need there can be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the recognition of Byron as one of the great poets of the world . His place in literature has long been fixed , and the sticking up of a tablet or statue will make not the slightest difference one way or the other . On the other hand , there is something curious in the notion of some members of the family that as the public neglected to pay the honors due to the poet at his death , it can not now be allowed to remove this discredit from itself by a tardy reparation . It is obvious that whatever may be done in this way , the important point has already been decided by the more liberal and generous appreciation of the poet - which has sprung up in recent years . The arrangement now proposed is , under the eireumstances , the most appropriate and judicious ? that is to say , to leave the tablet at Bucknall as it ie , and to erect a statue . in some public place in London  --  and it is approved by Lord Lovelace , Byron 's son-in-law .
