txt Acting under authority of a clause of the Constitution which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several States , the House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill for the improvement of rivers and harbors . This ' bill appropriates $7,300,000 . The rivers to be improved are not important water-ways connecting the several States . Most of them begin and end within the boundaries of single States . This fact created much opposition to the bill , and those who had it in charge did not dare to trust it to ? the searching criticism which it was certain to encounter in the House in Committee of the Whole . Rule 112 of the House provides that " all proceedings touching appropriations of money shall first be discussed in a Committee of the Whole House . " The appropriation bill which passed yesterday was not so considered . Its friends were strong enough to suspend the rules , under the operation of which $7,300,000 ? was voted from the public Treasury for local improvements . This was done by a vote of 166 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of the minority was presented by 28 members , all but 5 of whom are Democrats . This protest was not received , a motion to adjourn having prevailed before the document could be read at the Clerk 's desk . But the bill had passed in the midst of a disgraceful riot . Some of the items of the bill are curious . For so-called improvements in the navigation of the Appomattox River there is an appropriation of $30,000 ; for the James River , $70,000 ; for Cape Fear River , North Carolina , $85,000 ; for the Great Kanawha River , West Virginia , $222,000 ; for Baltimore Harbor , $75,000 , and for Savannah , $70,000 . In one way and another , Red River has $99,000 , and White . and St. ? Francis Rivers , Arkansas , have . $75,000 . For improving the navigation of the Tennessee River , below Chattanooga , the large sum of $300,000 is appropriated . The South has a liberal share of these appropriations , but other sections are conciliated by liberal donations . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000 . Des Moines , Iowa , has $95,000 ; and Oakland Harbor , California , has an appropriation. of $80,000 . Duluth ; " the empire city of the unsalted seas , " is not forgotten , but is given an . appropriation for harbor improvements amounting to $30,000 . These are representative items in the bill . They indicate the breadth of the scheme . It would not be possible for any one section of the Republic to secure . the bulk of the appropriations made by a bill like this . The attack on the Treasury must be combined , co-operative . Accordingly , the managers of the bill have judiciously divided the sum total among Congressional Districts in a way which is calculated to enlist the support of Representatives from every part of the Union . Party and sectional lines were disregarded in this justance . The grab was impartial . The general character of the " improvements " to be made was well set forth in the bitter sarcasm of Mr. Co ; who said that it would next be necessary to legislate for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved . The appropriation , in fact , is not really intended to facilitate navigation " among the several States , " or otherwise . It should be called " An act to disburse the public funds in certain localities . " With a very few exceptions , the several items appropriated are designed to give a job to the constituents of Representatives . Take , for example , the Appomattox River , an insignificant tributary which it is difficult to find on the map of Virginia . What valid reason can be given for spending $30,000 in so-called improvements on that stream ? Then there is the Kanawha , a river which rises iri the Blue Ridge and empties into the Ohio . It is wholly a local stream , draining a portion of a single State . Yet the people of the United States are to be taxed in order that $222,000 may be expended along the valley of that river . And this is true of many insignificant harbors and streams ; each one of these supports a constituency which supports a member of Congress whose vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry and clamorous friends . The . River and Harbor Appropriation bill has , during late years , taken on the proportiOnS , Of a huge steal . It is almost nothing else : During the last year of GaANT 's Administration , when Mr. HEREFORD , now in the Senate , was Chairman of the Hotise Committee of Commerce , a bill resembling that which was passed yesterday became a law . One clause , however , gave the President discretionary power in expending the amounts named , and Gen. GRANT refused to order the work to be done . In that bill , as the Chairman was a West Virginian , the rivers , creeks , and trout brooks between the Blue Ridge and the Ohio were munificently. provided for . There was some indignation among disappointed politicians , and the cunning schemers have this year provided against the interposition of Executive economy . The appropriations are absolute . In the old days when the improvement of St. Clair Flats was one of the political issues , there was much fierce discussion as to the expediency and constitutional warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be patented in the last two River and Harbor Appropriation bills of Congress is as far beyond the St. Clair Flats job as a bank robbery is beyond pocket-book snatching .
