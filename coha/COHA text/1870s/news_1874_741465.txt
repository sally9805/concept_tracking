Johnson and wife , at North Lexington , Sun . day night , a brief mention of which has been already telegraphed . It appears that Johnson had not lived happily with his wife . Some months ago he left for Kentucky , but returned suddenly on Sunday evening , accompanied by Lorenzo Johnson , a cousin  --  one riding a fine horse and the other a mule ? and stopped at the house of a Mrs. Lindsey  --  the mother of Johnson 's wife . In the night , about 2 o'clock A. M. , pistol shots were heard in the room occupied by Johnson and wife , and when the family entered the room Johnson was found with a bullet hole in his head and the skull broker , and the wife 's head had been maimed to a jelly with an ax . A letter was found on the table addressed to Lorenzo Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he committed the deed , and had determined to do it before leaving Lexington on account of his wife 's infidelity . The statement in the letter is not believed , however , for the reason that Johnson could not write , and it is suspected that Lorenzo is the murderer , though there is no positive evidence against him . About 10 o'clock Monday morning the train from the West name down , and just as Lorenzo was getting aboard he was arrested for horse-stealing . The horse and mule ridden by him and his cousin proved to have been stolen from O'Fallon , Mo .. and the two men answered the description of the thieves . Lorenzo was taken to Richmond , and at hat accounts fears wore entertained that be would be lynched . The verdict of the Coroner 's Jury in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson was that they were killed by an ax and pistol-shots , after being chloroformed , but Lorenzo Johnson was not charged with the murder , and the affair is involved in mystery .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
