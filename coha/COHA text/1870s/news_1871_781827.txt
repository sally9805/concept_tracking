txt For the curious succession in which any particular form of crime repeats itself there are many plausible explanations . The natural influence of the mimetic instinct , stronger , perhaps , for vice than virtue and the strange fascination of any unusual phase of wickedness , would alone serve to account for it . But where shall we seek any adequate reason for the strange recurrence of such disasters as the burning , in quick succession , of so many steamers on the Mississippi , and of hotels in different parts of the country ! Almost daily , for weeks past , we have had to chronicle a catastrophe of the former kind , until it must seem almost like " tempting Providence " to take passage on a Mississippi steam-boat at all . Hardly have we forgotten the midnight horrors of that Richmond conflagration , which laid the Spottswood Hotel in rains , when we are called on to record a similar disaster in Wisconsin . The fire which a week ago destroyed the Halliday House , of Kenosha , in that State , seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night was uncommonly dark , cold , and stormy , with a strong wind and a heavy fall of sleet and snow . Two gentlemen returning from a ball discovered flames issuing from the building , and gave the alarm . The fire spread so rapidly that communication by the stairways was soon impossible . The two hand engines which seem to have constituted the entire resources for putting out a fire , were , as may well be imagined , totally useless . The ladders hastily broughtfrom neighboring barns and haylofts , reached only to the second of the four stories . And in this state of affairs the bewildered sleepers were suddenly summoned to grope their way through the , smoke to the street , and in too many instances they were driven back blinded and scorched to perish in the flames . Seven lives are known to have been soIost , and two of the inmates escaped so fearfully burned that death was deemed inevitable . Thus , nine out of thirty persons in the house when the fire broke out fell vielimas to its fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of a lady and her four children through a fatal mistake-of the hotel proprietor , who insisted he had seen them come out , and . so prevented the ? preparations for their rescue . Their bodies- were found in the rains . The clerk of thohouse ? while on his way to alarm . the inmates , was frightfully and fatally burned by the- explosion of kerosene in the lamproom , . where the fire is thought . first to have originated . It will not diminish our pity for these hapless victims of the most shocking of casualties if we profit by the lesson of their fate . We have now had : a second warning ; - the third may come in an even more impressive fashion . New-York may at ? any time be the scene of a hotel-burning as much more appalling than either of these ; asithe average popn/ation of one of our huge caravanseries exceed ? that of a provincial hotel . The authorities will be blamed if they fail at once to enforce the-use in all our hotels of every possible precaution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators , of rope ladders , and water-tanks-in the upper stories . A feeble effort in this direction , was made after the Spottswood tragedy , but once public attention was diverted , it of course died . out . This time let there be no such failureNew-York does not desire to repeat the experience of Richmond and Kenosha ..
