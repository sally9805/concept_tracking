GRANT has very little of the lamb in his composition , but a great deal of the mastiff , and is not at all likely to be torn in pieces ; nevertheless . the manner in which he has been treated in regard to the Civil ' Service reminds us of this fable , because of the very wolfish na ? ture exhibited by his assailants . Whatever he may do , whichever way he may throw his influence . they are determined that he shall be in the wrong . They declared at first that he was opposed to Civil Service reform , because that would deprive him of the patronage that he was using for corrupt purposes , chiefly in order to secure his own renomination . He appoints a Commission on the Civil Service , approves its report , and orders its proposed system of examinations to be put in practice immediately , and the retort is a charge of hypocrisy  --  that this declaration of an intent - purify and to elevate the service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they may not see the revelations of dishonesty on the part of officers of the service which have been brought to light under his Administration . To this accusation it now proves that Gen. GRANT has a refutation as complete as that of the lamb who " was not born then . " Gen. GRANT was not President when the large majority of these lately-discovered dedinquents in the service were appointed . He is not responsible for them in any way , except as every official person is in &manner; responsible for whatever evil is handed down to him from his predecessor . Yet more ; it is to Gen. GRANT 's Administration that the credit is due of bringing these delinquencies to light . His predecessors , in leaving some dishonest men upon his hands , only gave him opportunities to show his integrity of purpose , and-that abuses discovered by his officers should be reformed , and delinquents punished . To reproach him with the scandal of this , that , and the other embezzlement of the people 's money , which his energetic Administration has discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apolice officer responsible for the robbery or the assault of the burglar or the rowdy that he has arrested . and is taking before a magistrate . That this is , the real position of Gen. GRANT 'S Administration in regard to the Civil Service , is shown by the array of facts set forth in the long letter from our Washington correspondent , which we published yesterday morning , and which was carefully prepared from official records . By this it appears that Gen. GRANT 'S Administration has mvestigated and brought to light 192 cases of official misconduct in the Civil Service  --  but that , of this number , 153 , or nearly five-sixths , were those of officers appointed by his predecessor . These delinquencies involve the considerable sum of $1.633,411 34  --  but of this more than five hundred thousand dollars has already been recovered , and of the remainder a large sum may be regarded as certain of recovery . Bat of this entire sum of $1,633,41134 , more than four-fifths , or $1,313,302 93. was misappropriated by men appointed before Gen. GRANT 'S ' election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was politically born . Of these dishonest officers the great mass  --  one hundred and thirty-seven out of the one hundred and ninety-two  --  were appointed by a man who had had his political training ' in the Democratic Party  --  ANDREW JOHNSON . But it would not be fair to hold that party , or even JOHNSON , to the full responsibility of those appointments , or of the generally demoralized condition of the Civil Service when Gen. GRANT took the President 's chair . For the war had so disturbed the country , and so unsettled all departments of the public service , that the most zealous disciplinarian could not hope to restore even the usual condition of things in the course of one Administration . The reduction of the army and navy , and in various civil departments , the stopping of all the great business enterprises that rested upon the war , turned loose a horde of disbanded men and camp-followers of various grades , great numbers of whom had political friends , and imagined they had political claims . By these , and by the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their affairs , the President and the heads of Departments were besieged for places in the civil service  --  chiefly places in the Internal Revenue Department , the Post-office , and the Paymaster 's office . for these are the most profitable . Appointments were made to meet these demands , and the result was what might have been expected from the placing in civil office of many men without education and . without business habits . not a few of whom were political and military adventurers . Hence the condition of the Civil Service when it came into the hands of Gen. GRANT ; hence the occasion which he found for the institution of those searching investigations which have been so well rewarded , and for which the country owes him so much . Hence it is that some  --  too many , and yet a small proportion  --  of his own appointees have proved to be unfit for their places , and have therefore been cashiered and prosecuted . For the disturbance produced by such a struggle as that through which we passed does not cease even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible in weeding the service to pluck up the tares without plucking up some of the wheat also . The reform which Gen. GRANT has begun , both through the stricter administration of the affairs of the Departments and through the Civil Service Com mission , deleted 14 lines - columns merged
