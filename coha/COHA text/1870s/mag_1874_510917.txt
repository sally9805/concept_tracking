SOME TALKS OF AN ASTRONOMER. qwq points from each other , and we can , by a simple trigonometrical calculation , determine the distance of a body from each of the points without making any actual measurements . If , then , two observers , one in Australia and one in America , can determine separately , by such an instrument as I have described , the exact direction of a heavenly body at the same moment , we have at once the means of calculating its distance from the difference between the two directions . You naturally inquire how can two such distant observers be sure they make their observations at the same moment , and what common point of reference can they use to be sure that their directions are measured in the same way ? In regard to the former , I observe that it is not necessary that the observations should be made at the same absolute moment , if we only know the real moments at which they were made , and are able to calculate the motion of the body during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon a single pair of observations , but always employ a long series , the combination of which enables us to calculate the motion of the body during the interval between one set of observations and another . As points of reference we may use either fixed stars , which are so immensely distant that they seem to be in the same direction from all points of the earth , or we may use the direction of the earth 's axis . The stars near the pole , in their apparent diurnal revolution , cross the meridian twice , once above the pole , and once below it . If we determine the point on the circle when the telescope points to a star crossing above the pole , and again determine it when the telescope points to it when it crosses below the pole , the average of the two determinations will be the position of the circle when the telescope points exactly at the pole . Subtract this from the position of the circle under the microscopes when another star crosses the meridian , and the difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole of the earth and the body observed . On this principle vast numbers of observations have been made , at the observatories at Greenwich and at the Cape of Good Hope , to determine the Renith distance on which the moon crosses the meridian on vanons days . The combination of these shows that the difference of the direction of the moon as seen from the earth 's surface and from its centre is nearly a degree . And from these observations the distance of the moon has been determined within a few miles . This distance varies in different points of the moon 's orbit , and amounts , on the average , to a little less than 240,000 miles . The distance of the planets outside of the moon , or those which revolve around the sun , is so great that their parallax is very small , and the accurate determination of their distance is a very difflcnlt problem . The planets coming nearest the earth are Venus and Mars , and even their parallaxes never become so great as the smallest object visible to the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , and scarcely admit of exact measurement . Iii consequence of this extreme smallness of the angle to be measured , all our estimates of distances in the solar system were twenty years ago erroneous by about one-thirtieth of their entire amount . For instance , the distance of the sun was supposed to be ninety-five millions of miles , and it is now known to be only about ninety-two millions . Notwithstanding this , the proportions between the distances of the planets are known very accurately . For example , we know that Neptune , the outer planet , is almost exactly thirty times as far from the sun as the earth is , and once knowing the distance of the sun , we can find the distance of Neptune with great accuracy by multiplying it by this number . At the beginning of this paper I called your attention to the fact that five of the stars which we see change their places in the heavens from time to time . These are the five planets which , with the sun , earth , and moon , constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the telescope . The EXPLANATION OF PARALLAX . CAPE CARTH GR or I / // THE SUN . furthest known planet is Neptune . This object is entirely invisible to the naked eye . It is , as I have just said , thirty times as far as the sun . By the principle of parallaxes , which has just been explained , all these bodies will be seen in different directions as the earth changes its position while moving around the sun , just as a street lamp seems to change its direction as an observer walks past it . In the case of Neptune this change of direction amounts to two degrees , a quantity which can be seen and measured without the aid of any astronomical instrument . It is in consequence of the great extent of this angle that we are enabled to determine the proportion between the distances of the planets and the distance of the sun . Now let us turn our attention to the thousands of millions of fixed stars which do not seem to change their places in the heavens from year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off than the planets , because if they were not , we would see them in slightly different directions as the earth moved in its annual course around the sun . We know there must be some such change in their direction , but how great a change we can not tell until we measure it . By measuring it we shall be enabled to find the proportion between the distance of the earth from the sun and the distance of the star we measure . And this measurement of change of direction in different times of the year is the only method yet known for determining the distance of the fixed stars . Hence astronomers have for two hundred years or more been engaged in attempts to determine the annual parallax of the fixed stars ; but so small is this parallax that until quite recently it evaded every attempt to see it . The effect of heat and cold in changing the instruments used by the astronomers and in altering the rates of their clocks was far greater than the parallax which they bad to measure . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessel , the great astronomer of K*inigsberg , that a small star in the constellation Cygnus had a parallax of one-third of a second . Let me give you an idea how small an angle one-third of a second is . Suppose you were to put three hundred stars in a row , the distance between every two consecutive stars being one-third of a second , so that the whole three hundred extend over a line one hundred seconds I I HELATIVE FLOPORTIONS OF THE SUN AND PLANETS . // qwq amount of scientific knowledge . The time of the journey has been found by two entirely independent methods . The first is by the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites . The inner of these satellites revolves around Jupiter very regularly in less than two days . He passes through the shadow of Jupiter in every revolution , and thus becomes eclipsed . These eclipses can be observed with a small telescope , and the time noted within a few seconds . The time of revolution and the form of the orbit being precisely determined , the moments at which future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first astronomer who accurately investigated this subject found tha when the earth was between the sun and Jupiter the eclipses were seen several minutes sooner than they should have occurred ; as the earth moved away , they were seen later , and finally , when the earth got to the opposite sid TII ARTH , SEEN *OM *s SOLSTIcE , NOON AT LONDON ) . // of the sun , they were as much too late as they had been too early . As the earth returned , the eclipses again came earlier , and the irregularity continued in the same order year after year . The variation was found to be about eight minutes in time on each side of the mean . Persuaded that no such irregularity in the motions of those bodies could really exist , he attributed the appearance to the progressive motion of light , and hence concluded that this agent was about eight mmutes in passing over the space which separated the sun from the earth . The most exact determination of this time was made about seventy years ago from an examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were to be found in the Paris Observatory . The result was 8 minutes 13.2 seconds . The other method of finding the time light requires to pass from the sun to the earth is due to Bradley , who was Astronomer Royal of England in 1750 . In making observations to determine the parallax of the fixed stars he was surprised to find an apparent annual motion of the stars of about 20 seco*cls , which did not correspond to the parallax at all . After long study on the subject it occurred to him that , owing to the rapid motion of the earth in its orbit , no star would be seen in its true direction unless it was in the line of direction of the motion ; but the motion of the light itself would be combined with that of the earth . The angle being 20 seconds showed that the velocity of the light coming from the star was 10,000 times that of the earth in its orbit . Since the velocity of the earth would carry it to the sun in about 57 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * of 57 days to reach the sun . Calculate this time , and it will give 8 minutes 12 seconds . The most exact observations of recent times give 8 minutes 18 seconds . There is therefore an outstanding discrepancy of five seconds only between the results of the two methods , and this is accounted for by the uncertainty of the old observations of Jupiter 's satellites.5 The terrestrial velocity of light is also obtained by two different methods . The mechanical difficulties involved in them may of 4 ' &gt; &gt;EurtA / be judged by the fact that it has been necessary to nieasure a space of time less than a millionth of a second . The most accurate method is that of Foucault , in which a beam of light is made to fall on a rapidly revolving mirror , from which it is reflected to a second mirror , which throws it back to the revolving mirror . If the light required no time whatever to pass between the two niirrors , the stationary mirror would reflect it back to the same point from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other mirror might turn , it would be in the same position when the light was first reflected and when it came back after the second reflection . But if the light takes any time *o go and come , the mirror will have moved a little between the two reflections , and the rays will be thrown back to a different point from that from which it came . By giving the mirror a velocity of a thousand turns per second the deviation of the second reflection was sufficient to be measured by the aid of a telescope , and the results of the measurements indicated that the velocity of light was 185,000 miles per second . Multiply this by the 498 seconds it takes light to come from the sun to the earth , and we find the distance passed over to be 92,130,000 miles , a result remarkably accordant with the other recent determinations of the sun 's distance . vIL-WEIGHING THE HEAVENLY BODIES . qwq of a celestial body is by the measurement of its attractive force on some other body . Attractive power , mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to the same thing , the weight of a body being simply the attraction between it and the earth . It is found by experiment at the surface of the earth that the inertia of all bodies is proportioned to their attractive power , and there is a certain regularity in the movements of the planets which shows that they are subject to the same law . I must remark , however , that the weights we get are not pounds or tons , but fractions of the mass or weight of the sun . If a planet has a satellite revolving around it , the determination of its mass from the movements of the satellite is very easy . You know the earth has one satellite ( our moon ) , Jupiter has four , Saturn eight , Uranus four , and Neptune one . So , to determine the relative weights of either of the five planets I have mentioned , we find by careful observation the distance of every one satellite from a planet around which it moves , and the time of one revolution about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and divideby the square of the time of revolution ; the result gives the mass or weight of the planet . We can apply this rule equally to determining the mass of the sun by the distance and times of revolution of the planets around it . Taking the cubes of all the distances , and dividing by the squares of the times of revolution , we obtain a series of numbers showing the proportions between the weights of the several central bodies . Where different satellites revolve around the same primary , we shall get the same result for the mass of the primary , no matter which satellite we take . So , also , whatever planet we take to get the mass of the sun , we shall get the same mass for the sun . In fact , one of the great laws of planetary motion discovered by Kepler was that the cubes of the distances were proportional to the squares of the times of revolution . He found the law solely by observation . It was reserved for Sir Isaac Newton to discover that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the rule thus explained it is found that the mass of the earth is * that of the sun ; the mass of Jupiter is - *- u1*- * that of the planet Saturn is *-** that of Uranus , *-*-*-* that of Neptune * The planets Mercury , Venus , and Mars have no satellites ; hence this method can not be applied to them . But in speaking *f universal gravitation it was stated that every heavenly body exerts an attractive force on every other heavenly body , and thus causes it to deviate slightly from the orbit it would otherwise follow . By measuring this deviation we can determine the force that produces it , and thus learn the mass of the planet which exerts that force . The attrac tion of Mercury produces some small irregularities in the motions of Venus , from which its mass is found to be * that of the sun . The attraction of Venus and Mars produces certain deviations in the course of the earth around the sun . They cause the position of the ecliptic to change very slightly from year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found that the mass of Venus is about * and that of Mars about * that of the sun . Of course the same method can be applied to the planets which have satellites . You know that between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there lies an immense group of very small planets , sometimes called asteroids . More than one hundred and thirty planets of this group are now known , and several new ones are found every year . The planet Jupiter exerts a very powerful attraction on these bodies , and a number of mathematicians have calculated its mass in this way . Different calculators get results varying from T*J*-* to * You see how wonderful the agreement between the results found by methods so different . The determination of the mass of the planets by this second method requires the most profound mathematical knowledge , and the calculations are so complicated that very few can undertake them . Every thing must be computed with the greatest precision , for a single mistake in whole volumes of calculations might spoil the result . Where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain certainty ; but the discovery of the planet Neptune must make it plain to all who are disposed to doubt how great a degree of certainty has thus been attained .

During the sixty years which followed this discovery it was found that its motions could not / - *-  / - / JUPITER , AS SEEN BY THY GREAT WASHINGTON TRIAlScOPE , MAY 7 , 1874 // ty in another point , we should have what is called a pure spectrum ; but in the manner in which this experiment is made we can not get such a spectrum , because the light which comes from the top of the sun , and has one degree of refrangibility , will fall on our screen in the same place with the light which comes from the bottom or lower edge , and has a different degree ; and in the same way light of the same degree of refrangibility passing through the upper part or the lower part of the prism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should admit the sunlight through an extremely narrow slit , and also cover up all of our prism except an equally narrow slit , we might have nearly a pure spectrum ; but qwq than others .

Many astronomers judged that these deviations were one to the attraction of some planet not yet discovered ; but as they did not know where to look for the attracting body , their speculations led to no resnit . About 1843 two young mathematicians , Adams in England and Leverrier in France , undertook to calculate where a planet must be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berlin Observatory was pointed in the direction which they indicated , and there was a new planet within one degree of the compnted place . // A Sun B11 D E 1 1 ii I H Sodium ... * * - I Barium . ... Calcium ... Strontium. * * I SPECTRA OF VARIOUS BODIES . To refer to our illustration by grains of sand of all sizes , the principle is the same as if , on accurately weighing every grain , and separating the sand according to the size of the grains , we found that grains of some special size or weight were missing from the whole . These lines , hundreds or even thousands in number , thus spread over the spectrum , are the open book in which we read something of the chemical constitution of the bodies from which the light has emanated , or by the gases through which it has passed . If instead of sunlight we take candle-light , or light from a red-hot iron or from a glowing body of any kind , we see none of these dark lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all degrees of refrangibility. since we know the sun to be a glowing body , we conclude that he is of the same nature , and that the missing light indicated by the dark lines arises from those particular kinds of light having been culled out by the gases through which the light has passed . This culling o&amp;it of light of particular degrees of refrangibility by a medium is called selective absorption . Now it is found by experiment that each gas , such as hydrogen or nitrogen , exerts this act of Selective absorption on light of particular degrees of refrangibility in a peculiar manner . Different gases select light of different degrees of refrangibility , and therefore show lines in different parts of the spectrum . When light passes through the vapor of iron we see a great number of dark lines , but every one in a definite position . Learning what sorts of light any gas thus calls out or selects , we can always recognize light which has passed through this gas by seeing this sort of light missing-in other words , by seeing dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is shown in the accompanying illustration . The three rules of spectral analysis are these : 1 . A glowing solid or liquid body sends out light of all degrees of refrangibility ; therefore when we examine its light by the spectroscope , we see a continuous spectrum , without any dark lines . Hence the spectroscope can give us no definite information respecting the constitution of such a body . 2 . A glowing gas sends out light of special degrees of refrangibility ; therefore when we examine its light by the spectroscope , we see a greater or less number of bright lines separated by dark spaces . Each gas has its own system of lines ; therefore by looking at the spectrum of the gases and measuring the lines the spectroscopist can tell at once what gas it is which produces those lines . 3 . When light from a glowing solid or liquid body , as in rule 1 , passes through a gas , that gas absorbs light of the same degrees of refrangibility with that which it sends out when it is itself glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer can decide from the dark lines which he sees what gases the light has passed through . It appears , then , that the information given us by the spectroscope is , after all , practically limited to bodies in a gaseous state . When we find a spectrum without either dark or bright lines , we know that it comes from a solid or liquid glowing body , but we can not tell any thing of the chemical constitution A SUN SPOT . // of that body . To obtain this information we must have the substance we wish to examine in a state of vapor , and then we detect its composition either by examining this vapor in a state of glowin g heat , and noting the position of the bright lines , or by passing ordinary light through it , and noting the po. - sition of the dark lines . The question may arise , How do we knowthat the same lines which we observe in the spectrum may not be produced by different chemical substances * Is it not quite possible that some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1869. gen should give rise The corona and prominences are shown at a , b , c , d , e , f , g , as observed at Des Moines. to the same lines which we see in the spectrum of that gas I These masses of vapor have for several cenIt is , of course , impossible to prove that no tunes been seen dnning total eclipses of the other substance should give rise to them . sun , but their nature remained entirely unThe evidence in the case is much of the known until the spectroscope was applied same nature as that by which we rec.ognize to them .

But as a matter of gaged in these observations , and we may fact , we know that practically no two men hope to learn from them something more whom we have ever seen do look exactly than we yet know of the nature and destiny aliker and it is exceedingly improbable that of the globe from which we derive our light they should look so . The case is just the and heat . qwq regularity is from time to time broken by the apparition of bodies of an extraordinary aspect , which hover in the heavens for a few days or weeks , and then disappear , to be never again heard from . Comets have appeared , at intervals of a few years , from the period of the earliest historical records , the last one having been seen by nearly every body in the northwestern horizon only a few months ago . In days when men thought that the heavens were only a little larger than the earth , that the celestial movements were under the control of beings like the kings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only world in space , these bodies were looked upon as portending great calamities here below-war , pestilence , the death of kings , and the fall of empires . Indeed , as late as the fifteenth century we are informed that Pope Calixtus ordered prayers to be offered up for protection against the Turks and the comet  --  a circumstance which has given rise to the popular myth of the pope 's bull against the comet . Accordingly , in a great many cases , we find the account of a comet connected with the death of some emperor , or the occurrence of some great event . Perhaps in the simple fact that we of the present day look on these bodies without terror or foreboding , we have a fair compensation for all the labor the world has spent in acquiring a knowledge of the heavens . As to the frequency of comets , we may say that from fifteen to thirty , plainly visible to the naked eye , generally appear in the course of a century ; so that if any person grows to mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make proper use of his eyes . The appearance of a bright comet is so peculiar that it is impossible to mistake it . It consists of three portions , known as the nucleus , the coma , and the tail . The first is a bright central point , looking exactly like a star , from which it would be impossible to tell it but for the foggy appearance of its light . This arises from the " coma , " which is an envelope of white nebulous light surrounding the nucleus , and gradually shading off in every direction . Lastly , we have the tail , a long stream of milky light , growing wider and fainter as it recedes from the comet , until the eye can no longer trace it . A curious feature , noticed from the earliest time , is that the tail is always turned from the sun . The length of the tail is very various . Sometimes it can scarcely be seen , while that of the great comet of 1861 extended more than half-way across the heavens . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was found by Kepler and Newton that all the planets revolved about the sun in conic sections in exact obedience to the law of gravitation , the question naturally arose whether comets did not move in the same way , and subject to the same law . It was found by Newton that the great comet of 1680 did move in an orbit so near a parabola having the sun in its focus that the deviation from that curve could not be detected by observation , and that it was therefore subject to the gravitation of the sun just as the planets were . But in the case of a body moving in a parabola , the velocity is so great that after making part of a turn around the sun , it will go back nearly in the direction from which it came , never to return . The actual portion of the orbit in which the comet could be observed was so small that it was impossible to distinguish between a parabola and a very long ellipse ; and if the latter were the orbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after the lapse of hundreds or even thousands of years . As a matter of fact , this comet has not returned yet , and , for aught we know , may be flying away from the sun to this day ; if so , it is now far outside the orbit of the most distant planet . It was Halley , the friend and co-worker of Newton , to whom was reserved the honor of first showing that at least one comet revolved around the sun in a regular period . A great comet appeared in 1682 , and in calculating the position of its orbit Halley found that it coincided almost exactly with that of a comet which had been observed by Kepler in 1607 . If I were to draw the two orbits on this page the lines would be so close together they would almost run into one throughout their entire length . It was almost certain that the two comets were really the same body , which had returned to its perihelion after the lapse of seventyfive years . If this were so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past centuries . So , searching the records of observations , Halley found that a comet had been observed in 1531 moving in almost exactly the same orbit . There could no longer be any doubt that this was really a comet moving around the sun in a very // elongated orbit , for although the length of the intervals between its several apparitions was not always the same , the difference was no greater than would result from the effect of the attraction of the planets . Halley therefore ventured to predict that the comet would appear again about the end of 1758 or the beginning of 1759 . Meanwhile mathexuaticians found out how to calculate the effects of planetary attraction , and making the necessary allowances , Clairaut of France computed that the comet would return in the middle of April , 1759 , but announced also that the imperfections of his calculations might lead to an error of thirty days . Actually the comet returned to its perihelion on the 12th of March of that year . The next return was in 1835 . Mathematical science had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . The next return of this most interesting of all comets will take place about the year 1910 ; I can hardly tell you the exact year now , but no doubt before it appears astronomers will be able to announce the very day when it will pass perihelion . When the heavens came to be swept with telescopes , it was found that comets so small as to be invisible to the naked eye appeared with great frequency . The more careful the search , the more frequently they were found ; and now hardly a year passes without one or two new ones , and sometimes five or six . A large majority of these seem to move in parabolic orbits , and if they ever return at all , it will be only after the lapse of centuries . But a couple of dozen or so have been found to be periodic , returning at intervals varying from four or five years all the way up to seventy or eighty . For any thing we know , all the comets may be destined to return some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1858 , the most brilliant that has appeared this century , returns in about 1900 years , but there is none of more than eighty years which has certainly been seen at more than one return to the sun . To the question , . What is a comet ? science is still unable to 7etnrn adefi nite answer . When examined with the spectroscope , the most of the light of all comets seems to be separated into three bright bands . By the rules of spectrum analysis already given , this would indicate that the comet is a gaseous body shining by its own light . The position of these bands also seems to indicate that the gas is some com*dnation of carbon . But this opens two very difficult questions-first , why does not this gas at once expand in space , as we know every gas does when relieved from pressure ? and secondly , how can it remain hot enough to shine by its own light ? It seems pretty certain that the brighter comets can not be wholly gaseous . The first such comet which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last summer , and the nucleus of this one gave a continuous spectrum , but the coma showed bright lines , as other comets had done . To the telescope the nucleus of a comet looks quite solid , and it is probably either a large solid or liquid body , or an immense cloud of such bodies of small size individually , but so great in number that we can not see through them . The most plausible theory that can be formed respecting the coma and tail is that the nucleus is composed of some substance which is evaporated by the heat of the solar rays , and thus forms a cloud of vapor round it . This cloud of vapor is the coma . Now comes the most mysterious operation of all . The material composing the coma , or at least some portion of it , is repelled by the sun , and driven off into space DONATI 'S COMET OF 1858 , AS SEEN IN SEPTEMDER FROM TUE EAST BANK UF TUE UUDSON. // in a continuous stream , j ist as smoke rises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes the tail . The great problem of comets is , Why does the sun repel the vapor which rises from the comet instead of attracting it , as he does every other known form of matter ? The only theory of this action which has any thing worthy of consideration is that of Ziillner , a young Germau physicist of much eminence , now a professor in the University of Leipsic . He assumes that the suu is an electrified body , and that the vapor which rises from the comet becomes electrified in the same way with the sun , and is thus repelled . He also maintains that the light of telescopic comets is mostly produced by discharges of electricity through the vapors which compose it , which accounts for the spectrum consisting of bright bands . The principal drawback to this theory is that we have no , independent evidence that either the sun or the comet is electrified . Could this be proved , no serious doubt of the correctness of the theory would remain , and we might consider the problem of the constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relation of a remarkable character has been found between comets and shooting-stars . The nature of the latter is perfectly understood . The earth , in its passage around the sun , is continually encountering vast numbers of minute bodies , each revolving in its own orbit around the sun . These bodies probably weigh only a few grains each . Striking the atmosphere with the enormous velocity of the heavenly bodies produces a degree of heat which instantly burns them up , with the production of a most brilliant light . This light it is which produces the appearance of the shooting - star . These bodies have never been seen except by the light of their own destruction ; it is therefore impossible to determine the orbit in which any isolated one revolves . But when there is a meteoric shower this orbit may be determined with considerable accuracy by a comparison of all the meteor paths , and it was thus found that the meteors which produced the great showers of 1866 and 1867 traveled in the identical orbit with a comet seen in the former year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply fragments of the comet which it has gradually been throwing off and leaving behind in its journey . Since that time other meteoric showers have been foirnd associated with comets in the same way . Very curious in this connection is the association of the shower of meteors on the evening of October 27 , 1872 , with the lost comet of Biela , of which you have probably heard . This comet was formerly bright enough to be seen by the naked eye , but grew fainter at every return , and at last disappeared from view in even the most powerful telescopes . On Ocher 27 of every year the earth passes very near the orbit of this comet , and in 1872 , although the comet itself could not be seen , some of its fragments showed themselves in the air as a meteoric shower . X.-THE STELLAR UNIVERSE . We have in these talks passed in review a number of the more prominent and interesting features of the heavens . We have been mainly concerning ourselves with the solar system , comprising those bodies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astronomically speaking , right around us . But what are these thousands of stars we can see with the naked eye , and those millions we see with the telescope ? What is this " universal frame " in which our earth and all its kingdoms and peoples , our sun and our planets , with all their attendants , are but an insignificant speck of star dust ? This is one of the sublimest questions we can ask of astronomy , but it is one to which she is not yet able to give a definite answer . What we wish to know is , first , how the individual stars are constituted-what a star is , in fact . Then we should know their distances , their motions , their distribution through space , and the magnitude of the space which they fill . Finally , we should know the bond of connection among them , and in what respect they constitute a whole . I shall briefly indicate what is known or supposed of these various questions . Of what a star is the telescope can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter the star is nothing more than a lucid point , and in the most powerful telescope it is only a brighter point . Until starlight was analyzed with the spectroscope we could only judge from analogy that the stars , being suns , were probably constituted like our sun . But this instrument shows that this conjecture is well founded , though we do not yet know enough of what our sun itself is to tell from this alone what a star is . Until the present century was well on its way we were as much in the dark respecting the distances of the stars as we were with respect to their nature . The only way of measuring these distances is by the method of parallaxes , already explained . The earth in its annual course around the sun sweeps around a circle of 185,000,000 of miles in diameter , so that we have a base-line of this enormous length with which to triangulate out to the stars . Determine the exact direction of a star properly situated now , and again after the lapse of six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be attributed to parallax , and will afford an index to the star 's distance . For the three centuries which have elapsed since Copernicus promulgated the theory of the earth 's motion , astronomers have sought to detect and measure this change . Before the invention of the telescope Tycho Brahe made the most careful observations of the altitudes of stars without being able to find any change whatever . When the telescope was applied to astronomical measurements a vast step forward in accuracy was made , and in the seventeenth century we find Picard , the Cassinis , Flamsteed , Roemer , and a number of others working at the same problem , in every way their ingenuity could suggest , without success . In the early part of the eighteenth century the problem was taken up by Bradley , with an instrument much more delicate than any before applied , and it was in the course of his researches that he discovered the phenomenon of " aberration , " already described . But this apparent change of direction of the stars could not be attributed to parallax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the base-line , and it was in the middle of it that the greatest deviation took place . The efforts were continued by a great number of astronomers in the early part of the present century without any better result . Apparent changes like those which would result from parallax were sometimes found , but critical examination showed that they were really due to changes in the instruments produced by temperature and other causes . It was now seen pretty certainly that the parallax of even the brighter stars must be less than a second , and that to determine it some'instrument must be found which could be at all times relied on to give results correct to a small fraction of a second . Such was the state of things when the question was taken np by one who , though little known to the general public , may fairly rank as the greatest practical astronomer of the century . Bessel had at K5nigsberg only what would now be considered a very small and insufficiently equipped observatory , but he inaugurated a system of carefully investigating the errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as every other cause which could influence the results of observations , which has almost revohitionized instrumental astronomy , and has enabled the astronomers of the present time to attain a degree of accuracy in their results which would have been thought impossible a century ago . The instrument with which he succeeded in determining the parallax of a star was the heliometer . This instrument is essentially a telescope , of which the objectglass is sawed in two across the centre . If the two pieces are put together as they were in the first place , an image of a star will be formed in the focus just as if the glass were in one piece . But if the two pieces are slid along past each other , each half having its own focus , there will be two images of a star , one formed by each piece , the distance apart of which will be equal to the distance the pieces have slid . If there are two stars near each other , and the glasses be slid till the easternmost image of one star comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of the images of the two stars , as it would be were there but one glass , is proportional to the distance the two glass halves have been slid . The latter distance can be regulated and measured with great exactness by having the motion made by a fine screw , and thus the angular distance of the two stars can be determined when the focal length of the telescope is known . // The method employed by Bessel and most of his successors in determining the parallax of a fixed star is this : Some star is selected which either from its brilliancy or its proper motion is supposed to be comparatively near our system . One or two very small stars are then sought for as nearly as possible in the same direction with the bright one . The former , from their smallness , are supposed to be immensely more distant than the latter , though , as seen in the telescope , they may seem right alongside of it . The annual motion of the earth must then produce a change in the relative positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same principle as the lights already illustrated . It was this change in the case of the star 61 Cygni that Bessel sought to determine by his measures with the heliometer . Continuing his observations for some years , he found that as the earth swung from one side of its orbit to the other the star seemed to swing one-third of a second on each side of its position . The great problem was solved . Bessel 's determination was followed by a number of others as I have already said , and there are perhaps a dozen stars within a million times the distance of the earth from the sun . Immense as are the distances of the few stars which we have described , nearly all the others , even those visible to the naked eye , are situated at distances immensely greater . We have every reason to believe that these fainter stars are really as bright , on the average , as larger ones , and that their faintness arises entirely from the immense distance at which we see them . But the stars visible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which are seen with great telescopes . I believe that the great Washington telescope already mentioned will show from thirty to fifty millions of stars . The smallest stars we can see through it are probably more than athousand times as far as the brightest that we see in the heavens , such as Sirius and a Lyra* . You see that our sun with his whole retinue of planets is hardly more than a point in the stellar universe . Taking the distances which I have already given , you perceive that the nearest star is more than six thousand times as far as the farthest planet . The distance of the farthest the telescope will show can not be accurately estimated , but it is probably so great that light would take ten thousand years to pass over it . Even then we have no certainty that this is the utmost extent of the universe . But the stars beyond this are probably more thinly scattered than they are inside this limit ; in other words , if we do not see the limit of the universe itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is of course beyond human power to say how far the stars may be scattered through those portions of space which our telescopes can not reach . Our next question is , according to whatlaw , if any , are the stars distributed throughout space ? It needs only a glance at the heavens with the naked eye to show that this distribution is by no means uniform , but that in certain regions many of the stars are aggregated in clusters , while in other regions there are very few to be seen . But the most remarkable feature of the distribution is brought out with the telescope . Pointing this instrument on any part of the Milky Way , we find it to be formed by the scattered light of uncounted millions of stars too faint to be individually seen with the unaided vision . If we could see the whole Milky Way at once , we should find it to extend like a girdle round the whole heavens . With the most powerful telescopes the number of small stars visible in this girdle is greater than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singular fact that a large portion of the suns which make up the invisible universe are condensed into a vast girdle or irregular and broken ring , and that our sun is situated somewhere in the plane of this ring , and not far from its centre . We can hardly even guess at the dimensions of this ring , but light itself would probably require hundreds or even thousands of years to fly across it . Our last and greatest question is , whether these stars are entirely separate and independent of each other , each one moving on in its own infinite orbit , or whether they form a system , every member of which revolves around the same centre , like our sun and planets do . The latter has been a favorite idea . You are all familiar with the celebrated theory of Miidler , that Alcyone is the central sun of our universe . But truth compels me to say that this theory , sublime though it is , has not the slightest evidence to slistain it . It is true , as I remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars are known to exist ; but they do not follow any regular law , as they would if they all took place around some centre . So far as yet observed each star moves forward in its own straight line , and these lines cross each other in all sorts of ways . The most singular fact connected with the proper motions of the stars is that one or two stars are flying through space with such enormous rapidity that the combined attraction of all the stars visible with the telescope could never stop them . This seems to be especially the case with a small star , invisible to the naked eye , designated in astronomical literature as " Groombridge , 1830 , " from the name of the astronomer who first recorded its position . The rate of motion of this star is about seven seconds per year-the greatest known . It was hence concluded that it must be very near us , and a number of astronomers have sought to determine its parallax , hut have found it to be only about // 839 qwq tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , we could speak with more certainty of its destiny . We may expect that our posterity of a few thousand years hence will , by the aid of the observations and tables we shall transmit to them , be able to come to a definite conclusion respecting the age and the structure of the universe . But at present we have no conclusive evidence of any connection at all between the several stars , such as exists among the planets and satellites of our system , excepting in the case of double stars . In the first place , there is no direct evidence that gravitation itself extends to distances so enormous as those which separate the stars from each other . It is true that few , if any , astronomers would doubt that it does so extend ; but it is equally true that its action must then be exceedingly small . In the next place , if we grant this , there is no proof that the mutual gravitation of the stars is sufficient to prevent them from all flying away from each other in virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would , however , take millions of years for this to occur ; so that the universe , as we see it , is fitted to endure unchanged through periods of time far beyond those of which man can form any conception . XL-THE PRESENT WORK OF ASTRONOMERS . No doubt you think the business of an astronomer is to gaze through his telescope at the stars . As there are several hundred people in the world who are now employed as astronomers , being either students of the science or astronomers by profession , you wonder what they can all find to look at that has not been fully observed since the time of Herschel , and why they do not get tired of looking . But you are mistaken in supposing that simple star-gazing forms any important part of the work of an astronomer . The principal problem of the astronomy of the present day is the determination of the motions of all the heavenly bodies . To find how su4*h a body is moving we must know its position in the heavens at two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to give you an idea how positions in the heavens are determined . Any one observation of position is liable to many errors , small and great , arising from the imperfections of the instrument , and accidental mistakes in pointing the instrument or recording the numerous numbers on which a position depends . Hence two or three observations must be made and calculated before we can be sure of the exact position of the star . And an hour 's calculation may be required to reduce one observation . Then , as the position must be determined a number of times in the course of years before the motion of a star can be decided on , you see how much time and labor are required to de termine the motion of a single star . Consider that a million or two of stars are visible with an ordinary telescope , and you will see that the work of determining the positions of them all would occupy all the astronomers of the world for generations . As I have already indicated , owing to the immense distances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require centuries of observation to determine them with accuracy . Among the millions of visible stars there are not a hundred thousand the positions of which have yet been exactly determined . Now look at the solar system . We have , besides the sun , eight large planets , nearly a hundred and forty small ones between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , and eighteen moons . Tables of the movements of the earth and the brighter planets must be kept up with such precision and certainty that the captain of a ship years hence shall be able to learn from his nautical almanac the exact altitude of sun or planet at any required day , hour , and minute . On the accuracy of this information he must often risk his ship and all on board . To determine the motions of a single planet or satellite under the influence of the attraction of all the other bodies which affect it involves an amount of labor of which no one not acquainted with the subject can form any conception . Several mathematicians have spent t*n years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which express the motions of the moon , and enable them to be calculated . As time advances , the number of observations increases , and greater accuracy of results is required . The labor increases enormously , so that future corrections to the tables must be the combined work of several . The French Academy of Sciences has for eight years past been offering a prize for new tables of the satellites of Jupiter without securing a single competitor . You will not now be surprised to learn that in investigating the laws of the celestial motions there would be work to keep all the observatories of the world actively employed for many years to come . There are a great many other subjects to be investigated besides the motions of the heavenly bodies , and nearly all such investigations requira the co-operation of many observers . Take , for instance , the physical constitution of the sun . Observations of the solar spots . seem to show that they run in a period of between ten and twelve years . The source of this period is still an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution of the sun now than there were before the spectroscope was known , and before we can hope to penetrate them we must have a long series of observations of solar phenomena both with the telescope and the spectroscope. // Another class of interesting objects which occupy the attention of many astronomers are the variable stars . There are perhaps a hundred stars the light of which is known to vary in intensity . One conclusion which the observations of these changes has led to is that the so-called " new stars " which on several occasions have suddenly blazed out in the heavens are really only variable stars , and were in the same place before , only too faint to be noticed by the eye . We should like to know what sometimes causes a star thus to blaze out and increase its light and heat a hundred or a thousand times . Because if such a thing should happen to our sun , every living thing on the surface of the earth would be destroyed , and the elements would literally melt with fervent heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his light and heat that we need not feel in any danger of such a catastrophe . The physical constitution of the planets is another subject of astronomical investiga tion . Jupiter is an object of especial interest to the astronomers engaged in these researches . It now seems probable that most of the planets are covered with layers of clouds and vapor so thick that the rays of the sun can not penetrate to their surfaces . In the case of Jupiter these layers of vapor assume various colors , the cause of which has not yet been made out . You now see that if we know a great deal about the heavens compared with what was known in past ages , we know very little compared with what there is to learn , and that there is no lack of work for all the astronomical investigators in the world . I have been able to give you only a very short and summary survey of the work of astronomers in exploring the heavens . The subject is altogether too vast to be disposed of in so simple a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some general idea of the manner in which the great discoveries of astronomy have been made .
