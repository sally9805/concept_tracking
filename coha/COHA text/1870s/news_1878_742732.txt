txt A notorious sneakthief , well-known in New-York , who has been operating not only in this vicinity but in parts of New-York State and other sections of the country , has just been arrested here . He calls himself Charles Williams . He was first known in this neighborhood about four years ago , when he was arrested for robbing a dwelling in Chelsea . and sentenced to two years in the House of Correction . After awhile he feigned insanity so successfully that he was sent to the Lunatic Asylum in Taunton , and from this place he in due time escaped . He was next heard from in White Plains , N. Y. , where he operated . extensively . His usual mode of working was to go to a house early in the morning and watch his opportunity to sneak in while the attention of the servants was occupied , and then ransack the premises for valuables . At length he was again caught and sent to jail . Repeating the insanity dodge successfully , he passed along in duo time from jail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this institution he made his escape within a few months from the time of his incarceration . He next turned . up in Plainfield , N. J. , where he robbed about 40 houses and private stables , among the number the residence of Gen. McClellan . One morning while coming out of a house in this town with a bundle a servant girl espied him and gave chase . She succeeded in seizing him , but he escaped . Her cries aroused the neighborhood , and several men gave chase , and at length he was captured , but before ' surrendering he shot an officer in the leg . He was committed to jail for trial , and while there ho gave the name of John Murray . He wrote a letter to his mistress , Kitty Williams , of South Fifth-avenue , New-York City , telling her to ship the trunks to his father .

QMeCiellan , valued . at $1,000 , and in the room was also found a sewingmachine made of parts of machines stolen from several different houses in Plainfield . After being sent to jail Williams attempted . to play the insanity dodge again , but the doctors decided that any  --  man who could put a sewingmachine together out of a number of different parts , as Williams had done , could not be insane , and they also satisfied themselves on this point by a variety of tests . For the robberies in Plainfield , Williams was sent to the State Prison at Trenton for 18 years , but escaped in eight months and went to Galveston , Texas , pursuing his vocation in the cities of the West as he went along .
