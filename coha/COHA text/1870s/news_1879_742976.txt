txt There was a Waterloo fought on ' Change to-day . Those who were bears on wheat at 83 cents and those who were bulls at 95 cents , both got badly squeezed . Where the same man occupied both positions the result was disastrous in the extreme.There was a bad break in wheat in this market , and other markets fell off in sympathy , but not to the same extent . Wheat was more panicky than at any ; previous time for several years . J. K. Fisher &; Co. , popularly supposed to be the Chicago agents , of " Jim " Keene , of New-York , began selling early and spld vigorously . The ? crowd at first regarded the movement as a ruse , and freely took all that was offered , but in a little while the feeling changed , and then the market went down at a rapid rate ; but the firm referred to still kept on selling , till it had disposed of probably 2,500,000 bushels , partly through brokers . The margins were called freely , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather slender security for parties outside , while the ranks of the sellers received still further . accessions from the minor local ; " longs , " ? who rushed in to realize before the market should go still lower . Toward , noon there was a decided reaction , but it was only temporary , the news bringing in orders by telegraph to sell out , which again sent the market downward . The closing was somewhat better . The general impression was that the Keene party was being sold out , but , beyond this point , opinions were much divided . Some thought the giant operator had decided to close up his dealings here and leave the market to Its fate . Others thought it probable that he had decided to divide the responsibility , selling about half here and shipping the rest . 5ti11 others , but they were few , ventured the opinion that the great manipulator was only shaking out the smaller fry of operators , so that he might take hold on a more gigantic scale than ever . These wore among the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the purchases at ' the bottom were numerous enough to give a relatively stronger feeling near the close of the session . The great season of activity was , however , during the first hour , when the above-named quantity was sold , mostly in big blocks , besides a great number of smaller transactions . The range of the market was about 538 cents per bushel . An approximate estimate of the situation is tot difficult to make . The wheat was bought it an average cost of about 86 cents for April I ! eliverv , and was sold at an average of fully 04 cents ; that is , 8 cents per bushel on 2,500,000 bushels , equal to $200,000 , which would leave a profit of about $120.000 after paying commissions and interest on the use of the money . The wheat sold for April will probably be delivered at the beginning of that month , and if it can be taken back at a good profit , the party delivering it may conclude to buy it back . The fluctuations in the sales to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April went down to 9534 , then down to 94 and 9378 , whom , catching a momentary reactionary impulse , it rose again to 94 , oscillated for a time between that figure and 93 , only to be pushed down and down by degrees , until , finally , 9078 was touched , shortly after 12 o'clock . This seemed to be the limit of the depressing influence , whether from choice or the inability of the operators for a decisive break to manipulate the deal further to their own liking , by reason of a counter-current that had already set in , can hardly be arrived at with any degree of definiteness , and from that point the tendency was once more in the direction leading to a healthy tone . Gradually , the market picked its way upward again and confidence reasserted itself in the bosoms of the small " long " clique , which had , up to this point , plainly discerned ruin in the future should no turn occur , and19338 was reached , when the tide once more turned , and the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously unloaded into the pit at a rate that fairly staggered the " long " interest , for the whole proceeding was unexpected . The operators on the bull side were at a loss to understand why the parties who appeared to be manipulating the deal should , without apparent cause , hammer their own property . The " shorts " were delighted , and prophecies were freely expressed that ruin must overtake such as were unfortunately on the closing price of Thursday and the depreciating market of to-day . It was apparent that J. K. Fisher &; Co. were the leading spirits in the movement , and , of course , the impression at once went out that Keene , the New-York operator , who bought so largely in December options last November , and paid cash for wheat on delivery , was now dumping his burden upon the shoulders of the Chicago operators , This belief was strengthened during the forenoon by an industriously-circulated statement that Fisher &; Co. had received a telegram from Keene ' imperatively ordering the sale of the property . As soon as events began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deal , and did not fail to couple Keene 's name therewith . The news found its way to Wall-street , and the stock speculators who occasionally dabble in wheat and corn in this market began looking for " pointers , " and they must have got them , for . early in the afternoon the wires were freighted with messages ordering sales and purchases . Those who ordered the latter were positive Keene had not sold a bushel , while those who joined in the hue and cry , and were disposed to sell , did so on the belief that Keene had got tired of wheat and sold out in order to enter upon an operation hither in Western Union or some of the Granger railroad stocks . Where the market would go to under the hammering it received it would be hard to tell ad not the exporters and shippers come to the relief of the " longs . " Armour &; Co. , W. T. Baker &; Co. , A. B. Ream &; Co. , and Lyman Blair purchased largely , filling orders that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the prices current just before the break . It is a noticeable fact that ever since the Keene purchase last December the movement In wheat has been quite sluggish , and the operators have complained that there was little or no money in the deal , With 7,000,000 bushels of wheat here and 4,000,000 bushels in Milwaukee , it bas been impossible to throw any speculative life into the market . The " long " interest has had the best of it , such as it has been . This interest kept the price a shade above the present shipping rates at New-York. it was obliged to do so , and had not the Keene wheat been held off the market for the time it was , it is very doubtful if the " longs " could have succeeded in retaining control as long as they did . Just about the beginning of the afternoon session another rumor was set afloat , to the effect that the telegram under which Fisher &; Co. were acting had proved to be a forgery , and that the Western Union Telegraph Company had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrator . This story caused considerable excitement , and visits were made to the telegraph office by several large operators to learn the facts in the case ; but nothing could be gathered . Those who had received dispatches stating that Keene had not sold a bushel , appeared to believe in the forgery story , and so advised their correspondents by mail . They attributed the rise and firmer feeling in the afternoon to it , and it was hinted more than once that Fisher 's brokers were industrious purchasers at the recuperating figures . Another rumor was set on foot to the effect that the entire deal was controlled by a local pool , acting independently of Keene , and composed of Fisher , Adams , and Roche . Still , a prevailing sentiment is that Keene has unloaded . It-is urged that , having bought his grain at an average of 86 , and the market having steadily gone8 up until it turned 96 , he felt there could be no better time to sell , inasmuch as his warehouse charges had already reached 4 cents per bushel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for holding up to fully 5 cents . Then there was the certainty of an increase of warehouse charges after April 15 , and were he to hold until after that date , the accumulation of charges and insurance , to say nothing of interest on his investment which was nearly $2,500,000 , would have soon absorbed all the profits that could have accrued between his purchase price and the present or prospective market . The story that Fisher &; Co. were deceived into selling the Keene wheat out at this time by a bogus telegram is considered utterly unworthy of belief . There seems to no no doubt but what the Keene movement created a greater break than was intended . From 2 to 3 cents was as much of a decline as was expected , but when the market gave way and the bottom dropped five points , then the time came when it was imperative to cry halt . It will not be surprising if Fisher and his brokers enter the pit to-day and dispose of the remainder of the stock on hand at figures fully up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
