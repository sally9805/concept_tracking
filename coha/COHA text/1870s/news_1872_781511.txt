txt Before the war , we were frequently told . that the Southern woman was fully as superior in all respects to her Northern sister , as the Southern man was to the Northern mudsill . In those days the South had not tried . the terrible tragedy of war , and . was in the habit of amusing itself with the perpetual performance of a burlesque of mediaeval chivalry . Its men were , in their own estimation . the knights of the nineteenth century , and as such they occupied themselves to a considerable extent in the chivalric sport of shooting and stabbing one another , and in violent protestations that the " daughters of the sunny South " were peerless in beauty and . endowed with warm passionate natures , that made them infinitely the superiors of the cold and calculating women of the North . There may , however , be an excess of these admirable qualities in woman , and the recent experience of a gentleman of NewOrleans , who married two daughters of the South , confirms the belief that a too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman had procured a divorce , about a year since from his first wife , and had married a second with that alacrity which has so often proved that the average divorced man is deaf to the teachings of experience . The honeymoon was in its first and brightest quarter , and the divorced wife was in. quarters unknown , so that Unalloyed happiness may be supposed to have been the lot of this New-Orleans person . One morning , however , he went out of his house , leaving his wife alone in her room , and unprotected . except by the presumed . ' presence , somewhere in the neighborhood , of his Irish cook . No sooner had he turned the corner than the divorced wife appeared in the presence of her successor , with a suddenness suggestive of her being in league with the occult powers that . in the theatre at all events , send unexpected people - to the surface through wholly unlooked-for trap-doors . The new wife was first made aware of the arrival of the intruder by a pistol-shot , which narrowly missed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy and the pistol . The struggle was a fierce one , each passionate daughter of the sunny South doing her utmost to obtain sole possession of the weapon . In the contest the pistol-was broken , and the aggressor , with a knowledge of capabilities of fire-arms quite unusual in her sex , at once abandoned it in favor of a bottle of bayrum , which she broke over the second wife 's head with immense efiect . Greatly inspirited by the success of her change of tactics , she seized upon the numerous toilet articles , and by a rain of brushes and bottles , speedi-ly overpowered her , fer she had just . smashed a glass globe upon her conquered enemy , when the Irish cock arrived ou the scene , and . gallantly rushing into the fight , made a diversion , during which the first wife escaped , to be almost immediately followed by the unconquered but judicious cook . Left to herself , with no enemy within react , the divorced wife Was for a moment at a lose for . amusement . The discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the aid of this weapon , she proceeded to execute the process known iu the Southwest as " clearing out the ranch . " She left not a stick of furniture nor a strip of carpet or curtain uninjured , and when the lice finally called upon her , she was sitting like a feminine Manus amid the ruins of a domestic Carthage . Now , although the actors in the melodrama were of the " first families " of Mississippi , it would be grossly unjust to draw the conclusion that all Southern women are capable of the Berserk fury of this divorced wife . Still , we have here an instance of what the hot blood and . passionate spirit , which we have so long been told is the peculiar charm of the Southern women , may accomplish . The Cold-blooded , spiritless Yankee schoolmistress , who goes South to earn a hard and precarious living , is incapable of any such magnificent display of passion . And yet , were the - New- Orleans person to fearlessly express his present opinion , be would doubtless wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-teacher , instead of a superbly passionate and regally selfwilled daughter of the South .
