Clerk Why , Bond the policeman was sent for to take it . ( Takes up a tart , and commences eating . ) Judge . Judge Bussell How ! 333 , quick call the parties : Our scribbler 's answer , like his lunch , quite tart is. 333 . No. 333 ( Ringing a large bell . ) Oh , yes ! oh , yes ! come Jew and Gentile too , Come into court , and quick settle this stew . ( Takes his place by the side of Judge .

Antonio , you 're a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dark . This Jew has fixed you in a tightish place ; And right up to the music you must face . Ant . Antonio May it please you , judge , I know I 'm in a stew , And must confess this blow makes me quite blue ; But I am in , and he shall find I can Stand up to him , or any other man . Bass . Bassanio That 's right , old chap , hit out straight from the shoulder ; I 'll second you , and be your bottle-holder . Judge . Judge Bussell 333 , where is the Jew ? We 're getting anxious now to put this through . 333 . No. 333 Climbing the stairs , the Jew just now appears , Bearing his carpet-bag and sharpest shears . ( Enter Shylock , l. , with a carpet-bag and huge pair of shears ; crosses the stage with a tragic stride , and stops in r. corner . Exit 333 , l . ) Shy .

Judge Bussell Look here , old Shylock ; have no more such stuff : You 'll find your wig is warmed quite soon enough . Shylock , the world thinks , and I think so too , That you are gentle , though you are a Jew . We think you are playing Antonio a joke , Which , like good jokes , we trust , will end in smoke . Shy . Shylock Such logic is enough to make one sick . Do you think my bargain 's nothing but killikinick ? Judge . Judge Bussell Shut up , old man , and mind what you 're about ! You 'll find your pipe will quickly be put out . A dozen buttons from his coat you 'd cut away , Because he cut away , and did not pay ; But gave his I. O.

Shylock I told your grace , at Higgins ' , o'er a stew , That I was bound to put this matter through ; To have my bond , and have my buttons too . If you deny it , let the danger lie Upon your new-built City Hall close by , Which , by the late election , now I think on , Must be built stronger , having a strong Linkon . You ask me why I claim this dozen brass Rather than postage-stamps ; well , stamps wo n't pass ; So we 'll pass that , as I 'm a humorous man : I give that reason ; and no other can . What if my house be troubled with a rat , And I pay roundly for a Maltese cat ? Or purchase Rat Exterminator , bound to kill Either the rat or purchaser , at will ? Some men there are love not a roasted pig With calves-foot jelly , or  --  in any rig . No for your answer , as twice two are four , And four times five will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , with a pair such knaves , Two dozen buttons for old clothes I saves . No other answer will I give , that 's flat ; So , while I take the buttons , hold my hat . Bass . Bassanio This is no answer , you unfeeling brute ! Shy . Shylock What is't to you , you saucy , young cheroot ? Bass . Bassanio Do all men cut their customers like you ? Shy . Shylock Well ; barbers cut their customers ,  --  a few . Bass . Bassanio Every offence is not a settled vice . Shy . Shylock What ! would you have a barber cut you twice ? Ant . Antonio I pray you , chum , do n't question with the Jew , But let old Red-nose put this matter through . As well attempt to stop a city dinner , As try to move this wicked , ugly sinner . Judge . Judge Bussell That reminds me of a joke . Ant . Antonio Do n't say it . I have the floor , so on the table lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Come , take your buttons , and we 'll homeward tramp . Bass . Bassanio For thy six postage-stamps , lo , here are eight ! ( Showing eight immense five-cent postage-stamps . ) Shy . Shylock My friend , your offer 's given in too late . If every stamp were in eight pieces rent , And every piece were plastered with cement Instead of gum , thick as a Poor Man 's Plaster , Where every pull but makes it stick the faster , I would not have them ; I would have my due . I 'll have my bonds , and have my buttons too . My gentle ' Tonio , now you plainly see , In this great mucil age , you ca n't gum me . Bass . Bassanio How canst thou hope for credit , giving none ? Shy . Shylock Because I have the greenbacks , curious one . Those who want money want for credit too ; They get no contracts , while the rich ones do . As Uncle Sam shells out , ' t is plainly seen The smartest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Bussell Greenbacks , ha , ha ! I recollect a story  --  Shy . Shylock Of Deacon Foster , or old Mother Morey ? Shut up , old man ! do n't you begin to sputter ; That 's not the way to earn your bread and butter . Do n't spare the peddler ; make him pay the scot , Or else he 'll find for him this place too hot . Judge . Judge Bussell As I 'm the chairman of this gathering here , I can dismiss the court , ' t is very clear . ( Enter 333 , l . ) Well , gevus , what 's the matter with you now ? You look excited ,  --  symptoms of a row ? 333 . No. 333 Outside the door I met a little chap Who 's anxious in our courts to have a rap , Will spout for both the Gentile and the Jew ; And after that , no doubt , he 'll spout for you . Judge .

Bassanio ( Crossing to his r . ) Why dost thou grit thy teeth , and roll thine eye ? Shy . Shylock Because this strop is so infernal dry . Bass . Bassanio Will nothing move you , you infernal Jew ? Shy . Shylock Not as I knows on ; nothing said by you . Bass Bassanio Oh , be thou hanged ! thou mischievous old man ; Sell out your shop ; skedaddle , if you can , To some lone spot , where office-seekers roam When they find out there is no place at home ; Where wolves turn flip-flaps , elephants climb trees , Gorillas polk , and organ-monkeys sneeze . The place for you is there , you darned old hunks ! Where you ca n't get at other people 's trunks . Shy Shylock ( producing bond , and pointing to seals ) . Till thou canst split more rails than Uncle Abe , Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repair your wit , put on your mouth a stopper : I 'll have my bond ; so put that in your hopper . Judge . Judge Bussell Here comes the stranger that 's to set us right ,  --  A Bloomer ! goodness gracious , what a sight ! ( Enter Portia , l . ) Come you from old Bellario , stranger fair ? Judged by your suit , you some sort of belle are . Portia . Portia Faith , judge , ' t is joking now your honor is : No matter who I am , attend to biz . Judge . Judge Bussell I 'm glad to see you , like your manners well , Which minds me of a joke I 'd like to tell . All . All ( Groan . ) Oh ! Judge . Judge Bussell No matter now , it 's painful to some folks To hear my stories ; so we 'll have no jokes . Portia . Portia Which is the harpy Jew , and which the peddler ? Shy . Shylock I am no Jewsharp , you facetious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ! you bird of evil ? Shy . Shylock Shylock 's my name ; but ca n't you , pray , be civil ? Portia . Portia Silence , ye thief ! and let me have my say . Ye have a queer suit here , now , any way : But yet your right ; for , if he owes you money , You 'll get your buttons sure , my precious honey . You took the bobtail , Mr. What's-yer-name , I think ? Ant . Antonio I did ; but ca n't just now put down the chink . Portia . Portia Then must the Jew give credit ; that is flat . Shy . Shylock By what convulsion must I ? tell me that . Portia . Portia The quantity of credit is not bounded ; That is , where on a specie base ' t is founded . But specie 's out of question ; so , of course , Credit comes next , or greenbacks , which are worse . The postage currency might do , ' t is plain ; But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But credit is above all this confusion , ' T is something that is sought for in profusion . ' Gainst men who want for clothes ne'er close the door ; Because they have no money call them poor : ' Twill never do , it would far meaner be Than ridiculing Seward 's famed cold tea . All ask for credit ; and that same asking Should get it from where business-men are basking . I 've said this much upon this great occasion To seek to move your heart by moral suasion ; If you are stubborn , ' t is fit for me to say The bond is for fit , and give you your pay . Shy . Shylock Oh , hang your spouting ! there 's enough of that . Antonio spouted once , the silly flat , And left his Sunday coat with me the pawner Who keep at number one around the corner . The deed is forfeit ; and I claim my due ,  --  A dozen buttons , and brass buttons too . Portia . Portia Ca n't some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes : here 's enough to settle twice the hash ; If that wo n't do , I 'll sell my horse and chaise , And by that means another hundred raise ; If all this fails , ' t is very plain to see This jewel here the prey of Jew 'll be . My gallant Bloomer , do the handsome thing , And rob this daddy longlegs of his sting . Portia . Portia It must not be ; there is no higher law To come in here , where men can pick a flaw : ' T would be caught up by all reporters here , And in the Boston Dailies quick appear . Shy . Shylock A Daniel come to judgment !  --  yea , a Daniel Pratt ; O wise young Bloomer ! you may take my hat . Portia . Portia I pray you let me look upon the bond . Shy . Shylock ( Giving paper . ) Here ' t is : I 've got him fast , or else I 'm corned . Portia . Portia Why this is a bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shylock ( Giving another paper . ) Quite a mistake : I have it in my hat . Portia . Portia This is a milkman 's score ; hast any more ? Shy . Shylock No : that is what I use , my pork to score . ( Gives Portia the bond . ) Portia . Portia Shylock , the sum that 's offered large is quite . Shy . Shylock I know ; but still do n't see it in that light . I swore like blazes , though I had n't oughter , To have those buttons there , and nothing shorter . Portia . Portia This paper is all right , the buttons due At sight ; not even three days ' grace for you . ( To Ant . ) ( To Shy . ) Take now your stamps , and throw this in the fire . Shy . Shylock Not till ' t is paid ; for paper-rags are higher . It doth appear , that , in this pillared place , You hold more law than any pillar-case . You know which way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must still yer law expound . There are not tongues nor sounds enough in Quincy Hall To make me lose one button of them all . Ant . Antonio I pray you let the Jew no longer scoff ; But let him cut his button : I 'll cut off . Portia . Portia Well , then , here goes ! Oh , how I hate to do it ! I fear the buttons on your coat will rue it . Shy . Shylock O noble judge ! a second Mickey Lynch ! Bass . Bassanio Stand firm , Antonio ; prythee , do not flinch . Portia . Portia You must prepare your coat there for his shears . Ant . Antonio Do n't blow your nose , Bassanio ; dry your tears . Portia . Portia From off your breast I give the Jew his due . Shy . Shylock Ay ; and his coat-tails , too , must give me two ! So reads the bond , as black as ink can make it . Portia . Portia It 's black enough whichever way you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ? Shy . Shylock Some one to count ? why , yes : I count on you . Portia . Portia Have by some seamstress , Shylock , on your charge ; If you should chance to cut the holes too large  --  Shy . Shylock ( Examining the bond . ) Is any seamstress in the bond set down ? I can not see it : mine are out of town . Portia . Portia Well , peddler , have you any thing to say ? Ant . Antonio No , judge . It haps I made my will to-day , Settled affairs , and then insured my life . Bassanio , when ' t is done , go tell my wife ; And , as you go , please drop this umbarella Just round the corner , in the oyster-cellar . Shy . Shylock A wise proceeding for your reign is o'er . Bass . Bassanio Dry up , old Shylock ! you 're a thundering bore . Shy . Shylock Come , come ! it 's getting late , ' t is after nine ; Rip out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portia . Portia A dozen buttons from his coat to strip : That is the letter ; so , Jew , let her rip . Shy . Shylock O righteous Bloomer !  --  Portia . Portia Shylock , stop your jaw ! Is this the way you tamper with the law ? Shy . Shylock Law , no ! I only meant a little flattery . Portia . Portia I 'll have you hauled up for assault and battery . The court awards your buttons ; so , pray take them . Shy . Shylock Most bumptious jurisprudence , see me rake ' em . ( Starts towards Antonio with shears extended , Portia intercepts him with her parasol . ) Portia . Portia Tarry a little , aged Israelite ; There 's something else : be not so anxious quite . The law doth give thee here no jot of thread . All . All Ha ! ( General movement . Bassanio and Antonio embrace , upsetting Antonio 's board . Shylock tears his hair out by the handful ; the Judge jumps up ; 333 rings his bell ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portia Nary a thread , if here I 've rightly read : Take , then , thy bond , and take thy buttons too ; But , in the getting them , be careful you ; For , if you cut the thread that holds them on , You 'll get cut up with all your buttons gone . Bass . Bassanio O downright judge ! mark , Jew , a perfect trump . Shy . Shylock ( Tearing his hair . ) I never dreamed that way the cat would jump . I think I 'll take the stamps , and let him go . Bass . Bassanio Here are your stamps , pray take them , and now  --  Portia . Portia Whoa ! The Jew ca n't have them ; nothing but his due . Bass . Bassanio A second Daniel Pratt , you said , my Jew . Portia . Portia Come , take your buttons ; but look out , d'ye hear ? Shy . Shylock To take them without cutting 's nonsense shear . Bass . Bassanio Too sharp for you , my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thee on the hip , hip , hip  --  All . All Hurrah . Portia . Portia Why do you pause ? is not the matter plain ? Shy . Shylock I came to cut : I 'll cut , and come again . ( Going , l . ) Portia . P ortia One moment , Shylock ; not so fast , I pray : We 've yet another bill for you to pay . The law doth say , that every bond that 's made Must on its face a revenue-stamp parade . Now , on your bond there is no fifty stamp : Into the County Jail you 'll have to tramp . Judge . Judge Bussell ( Putting on a long white nightcap . ) Hold on here ! ere you haggle any more , Just give me leave to flourish now my oar . There 's too much time been taken on this case . Shylock , hold up your head , and show your face : Your goods are forfeit ; money and old clothes As rightful fee unto the Bloomer goes . Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catnip-tea , and do n't this joke repeat . The case is settled , and for bed I 'm bent . What say you , Jew ; are you at all content ? Shy . Shylock Taken my money , and my old clo ' too ; Taken my house ,  --  well , here 's a precious stew . They 've blocked my game , and seized upon my props : What 's to be done ? I know ; just here I pops . ( Kneels to Portia . ) Portia , my jewel , you have all my goods ,  --  Old boots , old coats , old stockings , hat , and hoods : Now , pray take me ( I 'm oldest of them all . ) ; I 'll be your slave , and grovel at your call . I long have loved you  --  fifteen minutes most : Come to my kitchen now , and rule the roast . I 'm only eighty-five : ' t is better far To be an old man 's darling  --  Portia .

Portia Well ; you are saucy , sir , I do declare . Shy . Shylock How do you make it , I should like to know . Bass . Bassanio Why , William Shakspeare says it should be so . Shy . Shylock Shakspeare . Do n't know the man ; pray who is he ? Bass . Bassanio The author of this play ; or ought to be . Shy .

( To audience . ) When for my due-bill I was striving here , Bachelor 's buttons then I claimed , ' t is clear . As I 'm to be a married man , ' t is plain For these same buttons I ca n't come again .
