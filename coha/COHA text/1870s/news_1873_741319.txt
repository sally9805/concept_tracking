txt Ex-President Johnson has addressed a Communication to the Washington Chronicle in reply to that of Judge Holt , published in the same paper in August last on the subject of the execution of Mrs. Surratt as one of the assassins of President Lincoln . Mr. Johnson says " Eight years have elapsed since the American people were called on to mourn the death of Mr. Lincoln , whose unselfish devotion to the Union , and genuine sympathy with the masses , have made his name a household ' word not only in the North , but in the once rebellitue South . During this long interval Judge Holt has remained silent , and only at this late day attempts to meet the charge made ; as he declared in his letter to the Secretary of War soon after the execution of Mary E. Surratt , that he with held from the President when presenting the record of her trial , a petition signed by five members of the Court , recommending , in consideration of her age and sex , a commutation of her death sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered ' what he terms the proofs of his innocence , he offers them for the conaideratisn of the War Department , and at the same time seeks consolation in the fact that notwithstanding the allegation made against him the President ordered no court for his trial , had no charges prepared , and made no open accusation , but to the close of his administration continued with him the same official relations as before . Without giving the reasons which , at that time , would in all probability have operated against any development of the facts in this case . The question suggests itself why Judge Holt , in this attack upon his " official integrity , " did not himself demand a court of inquiry . All his witnesses were then living , the circumstances attending the execution of the conspirators were fresh in the public mind . His reputation was at stake , and must have been as dear to him then as now . Yet he sought no ' vindication , but has preferred to wait until the memory of friends dimmed by years could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainties . Well versed in the law , ho has evidently weighed the advantages which delay would give him . Skilled in sophistry , he uses to the best advantage all that he considers proved . hialriends , and even construes my forbearance as evidence in his favor . " After reading the evidence adduced by Judge Holt , Johnson says : " In his search for testimony , Holt succeeded in discOvering only one witness who said he saw the record of the case , with the petition attached , in the President 's office . This witness is Hon. James Speed , then Attorney General , who is undoubtedly mistaken in hia.statements , for . as already shown , the findings and sentences of the court were submitted on the 5th of . July , ( he and I being alone , ) were then and there approved by the Executive , and taken by the Judge Advocate General to the War Department , whereon the same afternoon the order to carry them into effect was issued . Mr. Speed . doubtless saw the record , but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Executive Office . In this connection , Mr. Harlan 's letter has significance and value . For , in referring ) to an informal discussion by the Cabinet members upon the subject , at which he thinks Mr. Speed was present , he positively Mates that neither at that time ; nor at any other , was any part of the record of the trial , the decision of the court , or the recommendation for clemency read in his presence . The record of the court was submitted to me by Judge Holt in the afternoon of the 5th day of July , 2865 . Instead of entering the executive mansion in the usual way , he gained admission by the private or family entrance to the executive office . The examination of the papers took place in the library , and he and I alone were present . The sentences of the court in the cases of Harold , Atzerott , and Payne were considered in the order named , and then the sentence in the case of Mrs. Surratt . In acting upon her case no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to me : But the question of her sex , which has already been adverted to and discussed by the newspaper columns , presented itself and was commented upon both by Judxe Holt and myself . With peculiar force and solenfnity ho urged the fact that the criminal was a woman was in itself no excuse or palliation ; that when a woman unsexed herself and entered the arena of crime it was rather an aggravation than a mitigation of the offense ; that the law was not made to punish men only , but all , without regard to sex , who violated its provisions ; that to discriminate in favor of Mis . Surrat and against Herold , Atzerodt , and Payne , who were sentenced by the same court and at the same time to suffer the penalty of death , would be to offer a premium to the female sex to engage in crime , and bribe the principal actors in its commission ; that since the rebellion began in some portions of the country females had been prominent in aiding and abetting traitors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in a case so clearly and conclusively established , to set an example which would have a salutary influence . He was not only in favor of the approval of the sentence , but its execution at the earliest practicable day . Upon the termination of our consultation Judge Holt wrote the order approving the sentence of the court . I affixed my name to it . and rolling up the papers he took his leave carrying the record with him , and departing as he had come through the family or private entrance . From the above statement it will be noted the papers were not submitted in the usual way by the Secretary of War , but brought to the President by the Judge Advocate General under , of course , the instructions of Mr. Stanton . This doubtless was done to save time and hasten the execution , and evinces the spirit which animated Judge Holt during the entire proceedings . Who can doubt that if his name and that of Judge Bingham had been attached to the petition , signed by five members of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President , such ' an application would have been duly weighed by the Executive before final action in the premises Mr. Johnson says in conclusion : It being absolutely certain that if the petition was attached to the original record before it was submitted to the President , it is not to be found in the printed record authorized by Judge Holt , and certified to by Col. Burnett , Special Judge Advocate of the Commission . The question arises , which of the ' two is authentic and genuine 9 If the record in possession of the Judge Advocate General is true , then that is false which he has given to the public . Ii , on the other band , the record published with his official sanction is true , then that in his bureau is false necessarily .
