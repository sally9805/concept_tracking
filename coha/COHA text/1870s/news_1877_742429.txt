txt Mr. WILLIAM WHARTON , of Missouri , has invented what he calls an " improved thief and robber trap , " which will probably greatly interest that large and respectable class of our fellow-eitizens , the improved thieves . Under that head are , of course , to be classed the savings bank , insurance , and railway Presidents , who have of late improved so greatly upon the clumsy processes of ordinary thieves . Mr. WHARTON 'S trap , however , seems better adapted to those numerous and successful thieves who rob banks either by presenting forged checks or by snatching sums of money from unwary Cashiers , or who rob merchants by concealing portable goods about their persons while making , or pretending to make , purchases . It:consists of a trap-door placed in the floor in front of the counter or the Cashier 's desk , and so constructed as to be easily and suddenly opened by the Cashier or a clerk , by simply touching a spring . When the trap is opened , the thief who may be standing on it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited and dealt with at leisure . Thieves of any age or either sex can be caught by Mr. WHARTON 'S trap , and if the cellar in which they are deposited is made secure , no further attention:need be paid them until after business hours . Were such a trap to be placed in one of our large dry goods stores , the proprietor might easily catch from ten to two dozen thieves on any busy day . As most of those captured would be more or less disabled by the fall into the cellar , the proprietor could fearlessly descend among them with an axe after the close of the day , and after reducing them to quiet , could sort out the corpses , sending a few choice ones for sale to the medical schools , and placing the rest in his garbage barrel . A more beautiful and efficient scheme for encouraging honesty and convincing thieves of the error of their ways has never been devised . The universal adoption by all our business men of the improved thief-trap would soon greatly diminish the number of thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills from a hank Cashier if he felt sure that his act would be instantly followed by his precipitation into the cellar , and no lady of kleptomaniac tendencies would dream of secreting a pair of gloves or earrings at the risk of being caught in the thief-trap . Of course , at first the public would be somewhat shocked at hearing the sudden rumble of the machinery of the trap and the despairing shriek of the vanishing victim , while ladies of delicate nerves might perhaps be disturbed by the groanings of a trapful of captured thieves . Still , in time the trap would become so familiar that its operation would scarcely excite notice , and ladies would care no more for the groans of the unfortunate thieves than they now do for the haggard faces of overworked shop-girls . Great good could be done were the Police Commissioners to adopt the thief-trap , and place a number of carefully-concealed traps in the sidewalks of our principal streets . A policeman in plain clothes and with a mind apparently absorbed in pea-nuts , could be placed to watch each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it whenever a casual thief or other malefactor should step upon it . By this means a watchful policeman could make a fair bag of thieves every bright day until the secret of the location of the trap should become generally known and the game should grow shy . After which the trap could be moved to a new place , and the good work go on as prosperously as before . Still , with all its merits , the thief-trap will unquestionably be liable to be abused in the hands of unprincipled , ignorant or overzealous persons . The shop-girl , who , after being compelled to stand for six or eight hours , is attacked by a captious lady customer who requires to be shown fifty different articles before she decides to purchase ten cents ' worth of sewing cotton , will be strongly tempted to spring the trap and dismiss the customer to the cellar . Although any intelligent jury would hold that the shop-girl was morally right in thus defending herself from excessive labor , and that the entrapped lady deserved her fate , nevertheless , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false imprisonment , and to appraise her broken logs at such value as the testimony of experts might assign to them . Moreover , were the proprietor of the trap , in making his evening visit to the cellar with his axe , to fail to distinguish between the wrongfully-trapped lady and the genuine thieves , he would either be sent to the penitentiary for several weeks as a willful murderer , or he would be compelled to employ an experienced lawyer to prove his insanity . Ignorant bank Cashiers would likewise be occasionally guilty of mistaking a mere operator in telegraph stock or a savings bank President not yet entirely ready for the Police , for an ordinary thief , and thus filling their traps with a kind of game for which the thief-trap if r It strictly meant . Moreover , ; . t is to be feared that unprincipled housel- ... ilers would set traps in their front yards for the capture of book agents and insurance men , and that reckless clergymen would place traps iu their study floors in order to shorten their iutervie W3 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true meaning of the Apocalypse . Mr. WHARTON 'S thief-trap , excellent as it undoubtedly is , can not be safely introduced without the preliminary passage of laws defining the extent to which it may be used . It must be declared illegal to catch ladies who refrain from stealing , no matter how much they may wear out the strength and patience of tired shop-girls . There must also be a close season for designing widows and oppressive deacons , during which it wil ; be unlawful to trap them , and it would probably be well to forbid the use of the trap in the ease of book agents and insurance men , and to punish any man who should attack this species of game except with the rifle or shot-gun . Bank Presidents should not be captured until after the second year of actual service , and a fine of live dollars should be imposed whenever a broker is mistaken for a thief or gambler and fatally injured in a trap . With these precautions , Mr. WHARTON 'S trap may be safely used , and there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved popularity .
