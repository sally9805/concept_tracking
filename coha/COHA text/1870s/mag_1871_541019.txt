OUR WHISPERING GALLERY . III . * HAWTHORNE is still looking at us in his far-seeing way , as if he were pondering what was next to be said about him . It would not displease him , I know , if I were to begin our discursive talk to-day by telling you a little incident connected with a famous American poem . Hawthorne dined one day with Longfellow , and brought with him a friend from Salem . After dinner the friend said : " I have been trying to persuade Hawthorne to write a story , based upon a legend of Acadie , and still current there ; the legend of a girl who , in the dispersion of the Acadians , was separated from her lover , and passed her life in waiting and seeking for him , and only found him dying in a hospital , when both were old . " Longfellow wondered that this legend did not strike the fancy of Hawthorne , and said to him : " If you have really made up your mind not to use it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem ? ' * To this Hawthorne assented , and moreover promised not to treat the subject in prose till Longfellow had seen what he could do with it in verse . And so we have " Evangeline " in beautiful hexameters , - a poem that will hold its place in literature while true affection lasts . Hawthorne rejoiced in this great success of Longfellow , and loved to count up the editions , both foreign and American , of this now world-renowned poem . Since we talked together last month I have met an early friend of Hawthorne 's , older than himself , who knew him intimately all his life long , and I have learned some additional facts about his youthful days . Soon after he left college he wrote some stories which he called " Seven Tales of my Native Land . " The motto which he chose for the title-page was " We are Seven , " from Wordsworth . My informant read the tales in manuscript , and says some of them were very striking , particularly one or two Witch Stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press he deliberately threw it into the fire , and sat by to see its destruction . When about fourteen he wrote out for a member of his family a list of the books he had at that time been reading . The catalogue was a long one , but my informant remembers that The Waverley Novels , Rousseau 's Works , and the Newgate Calendar were among them . Serious remonstrances were made by the family touching the perusal of this last work , but he persisted in going through it to the end . He had an objection in his boyhood to reading much that was called " true and useful . " Of history in general he was not very fond , but he read Froissart with interest , and Clarendon 's History of the Rebellion . He is remembered to have said at that time " he cared very little for the history of the world before the fourteenth century. ** After he left college he read a great deal of French literature , especially the works of Voltaire and his contemporaries . He very rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be a gathering of the people for some public purpose , such as a political meeting , a military muster , or a fire . A great conflagration attracted him in a peculiar manner , and he is remembered , while a young man in Salem , to have been often seen looking on , from some dark corner , while the fire was raging . When General Jackson , of whom he professed himself a partisan , visited Salem in 1833 , he walked out to the boundary of the town to meet him , - not to speak to him , but only to look at him . When he came home at night he said he found only a few men // and boys collected , not enough people , without the assistance he rendered , to welcome the General with a good cheer . It is said that Susan , in the " Village Uncle , " one of the " Twice-Told Tales , " is not altogether a creation of his fancy . Her father was a fisherman living in Salem , and Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , and he always spoke of her as his " mermaid . " He said she had a great deal of what the French call es*it*g/erie . There was another young beauty , living at that time in his native town , quite captivating to him , though in a different style from the mermaid . But if his head and heart were turned in his youth by these two nymphs in his native town , there was soon a transfer of his affections to quite another direction . His new passion was a much more permanent one , for now there dawned upon him so perfect a creature that he fell in love irrevocably ; all his thoughts and all his delights centred in her , who suddenly became indeed the mistress of his soul . She filled the measure of his being , and became a part and parcel of his life . Who was this mysterious young person who had crossed his boyhood 's path and made him hers forever ? Whose daughter was she that could thus enthrall the ardent young man in Salem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sirens ? She is described by one who met her long before Hawthorne made , her acquaintance as " the prettiest low - born lass that ever ran on the greensward , " and she must have been a radiant child of beauty , indeed , that girl ! She danced like a fairy , she sang exquisitely , so that every one who knew her seemed amazed at her perfect way of doing everything she attempted . I see , dear Jack , you are curiously moved , and longing to hear who it was that thus summoned all this witchery , who it was that made such a tumult in young Hawthorne 's bosom . Well , you shall hear . She was " daughter to Leontes and Hermione , " king and queen of Sicilia , and her name was Perdita . It was Shakespeare who introduced Hawthorne to his first real love , and the lover never forgot his mistress . He was constant ever , and worshipped her through life . Beauty always captivated him . Where there was beauty he fancied other good gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always repulsive to him . When a little boy he is remembered to have said to a woman who wished to be kind to him , " Take her away ! She is ugly and fat , and has a loud voice . " When quite a young man he applied for a situation under Commodore Wilkes on the Exploring Expedition , but did not succeed in obtaining an appointment . He thought this a great misfortune , as he was fond of travel , and he promised to do all sorts of wonderful things , should he be allowed to join the voyagers . One very odd but characteristic notion of his , when a youth , was , that he should like a competent income which should neither increase nor diminish , for then , he said , it would not engross too much of his attention . Surrey 's little poem , " The Means to obtain a Happy Life , " expressed exactly what his idea of happiness was when a lad . When a school-boy he wrote verses for the newspapers , but he ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust . One of his quatrains lives in the memory of a friend , who repeated it to me recently : - " The ocean hath its silent caves , Deep , quiet , and alone ; Above them there are troubled waves , Beneath them there are none . " When the Atlantic cable was first laid , somebody , not knowing the author of the lines , quoted them to Hawthorne as applicable to the calmness said to exist in the depths of the ocean . He listened to the verse , and then laughingly said , " I know something of the deep sea myself . " In 1836 he went to Boston , I am told , to edit the " American Magazine of Useful Knowledge , " for which he was to be paid a salary of six hundred // 382 Our Whispering Gallery . dollars a year . The proprietors soon became insolvent , so that he received nothing , but he kept on just the same as if he had been paid regularly . The plan of the work proposed by the publishers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine was printed on coarse paper and was illustrated by engravings painful to look at . There were no contributors except the editor , and he wrote the whole of every number . Short biographical sketches of eminent men and historical narratives filled up its pages . I have looked in vain for this deceased magazine , for I should like to read Hawthorne 's narrative of Mrs. Dustan 's captivity . Mrs. Dustan was carried off by the Indians from Haverhill , and Hawthorne does not much commiserate the hardships she endured , but reserves his sympathy for her husband , who was not carried into captivity , and suffered nothing from the Indians , but who , he says , was a tender-hearted man , and took care of the children during Mrs. D. 's absence from home , and probably knew that his wife would be more than a match for a whole tribe of savages . When the Rev. Mr. Cheever was knocked down and flogged in the streets in Salem and then imprisoned , Hawthorne came out of his retreat and visited him regularly in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who had maltreated him . Those early days in Salem , - how interesting the memory of them must be to the friends who knew and followed the gentle dreamer in his budding career ! When the whisper first came to the timid boy , in that " dismal chamber in Union Street , " that he too possessed the soul of an artist , there were not many about him to share the divine rapture that must have filled his proud young heart . Outside of his own little family circle , doubting and desponding eyes looked upon him , and many a stupid head wagged in derision as he passed by . But there was always waiting for him a sweet and honest wel come by the humble hearth where his mother and sisters sat and listened to the beautiful creations of his fresh and glowing fancy . We can imagine the happy group gathered around the evening lamp ! " Well , my son , " says the fond mother , looking up from her knitting-work , " what have you got for us to-night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and your sisters are as impatient as I am to have a new one . " And then we can hear , or think we hear , the young man begin in a low and modest tone the story of " Edward Fane 's Rosebud , " or " The Seven Vagabonds , " or perchance ( 0 tearful , happy evening ! ) that tender idyl of " The Gentle Boy ! " What a privilege to hear for the first time a " TwiceTold Tale , " before it was even once told to the public ! And I know with what rapture that delighted little audience must have hailed the advent of every fresh indication that genius , so seldom a visitant at any fireside , had come down so noiselessly to bless their humble hearthstone in the sombre old town . In striking contrast to Hawthorne 's audience nightly convened to listen while he read his charming tales and essays , I think of poor Bernardin de Saint-Pierre , facing those hard-eyed critics at the house of Madame Neckar , when as a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of " Paul and Virginia . " The story was simple and the voice of the poor and nameless reader trembled . Everybody was unsympathetic and gaped , and at the end of a quarter of an hour Monsieur de Buffon , who always had a loud way with him , cried out to Madame Neckar 's servant , " Let the horses be put to my carriage ! " Hawthorne seems never to have known the raw period in authorship so common to most growing writers , when the style is " overlanguaged , " and when it plunges wildly through the " sandy deserts of rhetoric , " or struggles as if it were having a personal difficulty with Ignorance and his big brother Platitude . It was capitally // said of Chateaubriand that " he lived on the summits of syllables , " and of another young author that he was so dully good , that " he made even virtue disreputable . " Hawthorne had no such literary vices to contend with . His looks seemed from the start to be " Conimercing with the skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impediment . I was struck a few days ago with the untruth , so far as Hawthorne is concerned , of a passage in the Preface to Endymion . Keats says : " The imagination of a boy is healthy , and the mature imagination of a man is healthy ; but there is a space of life between , in which the soul is in a ferment , the character undecided , the way of life uncertain , the ambition thick-sighted . " Hawthorne 's imagination had no middle period of decadence or doubt , but continued , as it began , in full vigor to the end . And now , my dear Jack , if you please , I will ramble on among my own recollections of our famous romancer . In 1852 1 went to Europe , and while absent had frequent most welcome letters from the delightful dreamer . He had finished the " Blithedale Romance " during my wanderings , and I was fortunate enough to arrange for its publication in London simultaneously with its appearance in Boston . One of his letters ( dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1852 ) runs thus : - " You have succeeded admirably in regard to the Blithedale Romance , ' and have got just*i*o more than I expected to receive . It will come in good time , too ; for my drafts have been pretty heavy of late , in consequence of buying an estate and fitting up my house . What a truant you are from the Corner . I wish , before leaving London , you would obtain for me copies of any English editions of my writings not already in my possession . I have Routledge 's edition of The Scarlet Letter , ' the Mosses , ' and Twice-Told Tales ' ; Bohn 's editions of The House of the Seven Gables , ' the Snow-Image ' and the Wonder Book , ' and Bogue 's edition of The Scarlet Letter ' ; - these are all , and I should be glad of the rest . I meant to have written , another Wonder Book ' this summer , but another task has unexpectedly intervened . General Pierce of New Hampshire , the Democratic nominee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you know , and we have been intimate through life . He wishes me to write his biography , and I have consented to do so ; somewhat reluctantly , however , for Pierce has now reached that altitude when a man , careful of his personal dignity , will begin to think of cutting his acquaintance . But I seek nothing from him , and therefore need not be ashamed to tell the truth of an old friend I have written to Barry Cornwall , and shall probably enclose the letter along with this . I do n't more than half believe what you tell me of my reputation in England , and am only so far credulous on the strength of the ? 200 , and shall have a somewhat stronger sense of this latter reality when I finger the cash . Do come home in season to preside over the publication of the Romance . " He had christened his estate The Wayside , and in a postscript to the above letter he begs me to consider the name and tell him how I like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly elected President , contains this passage : - " Do make some inquiries about Portugal ; as , for instance , in what part of the world it lies , and whether it is an empire , a kingdom , or a republic . Also , and more particularly , the expenses of living there , and whether the Minister would be likely to be much pestered with his own countrymen . Also , any other information about foreign countries would be acceptable to an inquiring mind . " When I returned from abroad I found him getting matters in readiness to leave the country for a consulship in // 384 Liverpool . He seemed very happy at the thought of flitting , but I wondered if he could possibly be as contented across the water as he seemed in Concord . I remember walking with him to the Old Manse , a mile or so distant from The Wayside , his new residence , and talking over England and his proposed absence of several years . We strolled round the house , where he spent the first years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the windows , out of which he had looked and seen supernatural and other visions . We walked up and down the avenue , the memory of which he has embalmed in " Mosses , " and he discoursed most pleasantly of all that had befallen him since he led a lonely , secluded life in Salem . It was a sleepy , warm afternoon , and he proposed that we should wander up the banks of the river and lie down and watch the clouds float above and in the quiet stream . I recall his lounging , easy air as he tolled me along until we came to a spot secluded , and ofttimes sacred to his wayward thoughts . He bade me lie down on the grass and hear the birds sing . As we steeped ourselves in the delicious idleness , he began to murmur some half-forgotten lines from Thomson 's " Seasons , " which he said had been favorites of his from boyhood . While we lay there , half hidden in the grass , we heard approaching footsteps , and Hawthorne hurriedly whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody . " The solemnity of his manner , and the thought of the down-flat position in which we had both placed ourselves to avoid being seen , threw me into a foolish , half-hysterical fit of laughter , and when he nudged me , and again whispered more lugubriously than ever , " Heaven help me , Mr. - is close upon us ! " I felt convinced that if the thing went further , suffocation , in my case at least , must ensue . He kept me constantly informed , after he went to Liverpool , of how he was passing his time ; and if you read his charming " English Note-Books , " you will see he was never idle . There were touches , however , in his private letters which escaped daily record in his journal , and I remember how delightful it was , after he landed on the other side , to get his frequent missives . In one of the first he gives me an account of a dinner where he was obliged to make a speech . He says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very easily done ) with a few sentences of most outrageous flattery , and sat down in a general puddle of good feeling . " In another he says : " I have taken a house in Rock Park , on the Cheshire side of the Mersey , and am as snug as a bug in a rug . Next year you must come and see how I live . Give my regards to everybody , and my love to half a dozen . . . . . I wish you would call on Mr. Savage , the antiquarian , if you know him , and ask whether he can inform me what part of England the original William Hawthorne came from . He came over , I think , in 1634 . . . .. It would really be a great obligation if he could answer the above query . Or , if the fact is not within his own knowledge , he might perhaps indicate some place where such information might be obtained here in England . I presume there are records still extant somewhere of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ localities annexed to their names . Of all things , I should like to find a gravestone in one of these old churchyards with my own name upon it , although , for myself , I should wish to be buried in America . The graves are too devilish damp here . " The hedgerows of England , the grassy meadows , and the picturesque old cottages delighted him , and he was never tired of writing to me about them . While wandering over the country , he was often deeply touched by meeting among the wild-flowers many of his old New England favorites ,  --  bluebells , crocuses , primroses , foxglove , and other flowers which are cultivated in our gardens , and which had long been familiar to him in America . I can imagine him , in his quiet , mus // ing way , strolling through the daisied fields on a Sunday morning and hearing the distant church-bells chiming to service . His religion was so deep and broad that he could not bear to be fastened in by a pew-door , and I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely described himself as inside a church , but he liked to wander among the graves in the churchyards and read the epitaphs on the moss-grown slabs . He liked better to meet and have a talk with the sexton than with the rector . He was constantly demanding longer letters from home ; and nothing gave him more pleasure than monthly news from " The Saturday Club , " and detailed accounts of what was going forward in literature . One of his letters dated in January , 1854 , starts off thus - " I wish your epistolary propensities were stronger than they are . All your letters to me since I left America might be squeezed into one I send Ticknor a big cheese , which I long ago promised him , and my advice is , that he keep it in the shop , and daily , between eleven and one o'clock , distribute slices of it to your half-starved authors , together with crackers and something to drink I thank you for the books you send me , and more especially for Mrs. Mowatt 's Autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things I delight in autobiographies ; and I hardly ever read one that interested me so much . She must be a remarkable woman , and I can not but lament my ill fortune in never having seen her on the stage or elsewhere ..... I count strongly upon your promise to be with us in May . Ca n't you bring Whipple with you ? " One of his favorite resorts in Liverpool was the boarding-house of good Mrs. Blodgett , in Duke Street , a house where many Americans have found delectable quarters , after being tossed on the stormy Atlantic . " I have never known a better woman , " Hawthorne used to say , " and her motherly kindness to me and mine I can never forget . " VOL . XXVII. - NO. i6i. 25 385 Hundreds of American travellers will bear witness to the excellence of that beautiful old lady , who presided with such dignity and sweetness over her hospitable mansion . If she were alive now , my dear Jack , I should give you a line of introduction to her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and her voice sovereign antidotes to the homesickness which one is apt *b feel on first arriving in a foreign land . On the 13th of April , 1854 , Hawthorne wrote to me this characteristic letter from the consular office in Liverpool - " I am very glad that the Mosses ' have come into the hands of our firm ; and I return the copy sent me , after a careful revision . When I wrote those dreamy sketches , I little thought that I should ever preface an edition for the press amidst the bustling life of a Liverpool consulate . Upon my honor , I am not quite sure that I entirely comprehend my own meaning , in some of these blasted allegories ; but I remember that I always had a meaning , or at least thought I had . I am a good deal changed since those times ; and , to tell you the truth , my past self is not very much to my taste , as I see myself in this book . Yet certainly there is more in it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was written . " But I do n't think myself worthy of very much more credit than I got . It has been a very disagreeable task to read the book . The story of Rappacmi 's Daughter ' was published in the Democratic Review , about the year 1844 ; and it was prefaced by some remarks on the celebrated French author ( a certain M. de l'Aub6pine ) , from whose works it was translated . I left out this preface when the story was republished ; but I wish you would turn to it in the Democratic , and see whether it is worth while to insert it in the new edition . I leave it altogether to your judgment . " A young poet named - has called on me , and has sent me some copies of his works to be transmitted to America . Our Whispering Galle ? y. // Our Whispering Gallery . It seems to me there is good in him ; and he is recognized by Tennyson , by Carlyle , by Kingsley , and others of the best people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly exhausted , and that Routledge is going to publish another , enlarged and in better style . " Perhaps it might be well for you to take him up in America . At all events , try to bring him into notice ; and some day or other you may be glad to have helped a famous poet in his obscurity . The poor fellow has left a good post in the customs to cultivate literature in London ! " We shall begin to look for you now by every steamer from Boston . You must make up your mind to spend a good while with us before going to see your London friends . " Did you read the article on your friend De Quincey in the last Westminster ? It was written by Mr. - of this city , who was in America a year or two ago . The article is pretty well , but does nothing like adequate justice to De Quincey ; and in fact no Englishman cares a pin for him . We are ten times as good readers and critics as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to London afforded him great pleasure , but he kept out of the way of literary people as much as possible . He introduced himself to nobody , except Mr.- , whose assistance he needed , in order to be identified at the bank . He wrote to me from 24 George Street , Hanover Square , and told me he delighted in London , and wished he could spend a year there . He enjoyed floating about , in a sort of unknown way , among the rotund and rubicund figures made jolly with ale and port-wine . He was greatly amused at being told ( his informants meaning to be complimentary ) " that he would never be taken for anything but an Englishman . " He called Tennyson 's " Charge of the Light Brigade , " just printed at that time , " a broken-kneeci gallop of a poem . " He *vrites - " John Bull is in high spirits just now at the taking of Sevastopol . What an absurd personage John is ! I find that my liking for him grows stronger the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect have constantly decreased . " One of his most intimate friends ( a man unlike that individual of whom it was said that he was the friend of everybody that did not need a friend ) was Francis Bennoch , a merchant of Wood Street , Cheapside , London , the gentleman to whom Mrs. Hawthorne dedicated the English Note-Books . Hawthorne 's letters constantly abounded in warm expressions of affection for the man whose noble hospitality and deep interest made his residence in England full of happiness . Bennoch was indeed like a brother to him , sympathizing warmly in all his literary projects , and giving him the benefit of his excellent judgment while he was sojourning among strangers . That is Bennoch 's portrait near the likeness of his friend , and I do not think , dear lad , you will meet with a handsomer man in all your travels , when you go abroad . When you come to read Tom Taylor 's Life of Haydon , the artist , you will find Bennoch 's record there . All literary and artistic people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him . I happen to know of his bountiful kindness to Miss Mitford and Hawthorne and poor old Jerdan , for these hospitalities happened in my time ; but he began to befriend all who needed friendship long before I knew him . His name ought never to be forgotten in the literary annals of England ; nor that of his wife either , for she has always made her delightful fireside warm and comforting to her husband 's friends . Many and many a happy time Bennoch and Hawthorne and your uncle have had together on British soil . Let me tell you a little incident that occurs to me now . I remember we went together to dine at a great house in the country , years ago , where it was understood there would be no dinner 386 // speeches . The banquet was in honor of some society , - I have quite forgotten what , - but it was ajocose and not a serious club . The gentleman who gave it , Sir - , was a most kind and genial person , and gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best from London . All the way down in the train Hawthorne was rejoicing that this was to be a dinner without speech-making ; " for , " said he , " nothing would tempt me to go if toasts and such confounded deviltry were to be the order of the day . " So we rattled along , without a fear of any impending cloud of oratory . The entertainment was a most exquisite one , about twenty gentlemen sitting down at the beautifully ornamented table . Hawthorne was in uncommonly good spirits , and , having the seat of honor at the right of his host , was pretty keenly scrutinized by his British brethren of the quill . He had , of course , banished all thought of speech-making , and his knees never smote together once , as he told me afterwards . But it became evident to my mind that Hawthorne 's health was to be proposed with all the honors . I glanced at him across the table , and saw that he was unsuspicious of any movement against his quiet serenity . Suddenly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set speech of welcome to the " distinguished American romancer . " It was a very honest and a very hearty speech , but I dared not look at Hawthorne . I expected every moment to see him glide out of the room , or sink down out of sight from his chair . The tortures I suffered on Hawthorne 's account , dear Jack , on that occasion , I will not attempt to describe now . I knew nothing would have induced the shy man of letters to go down to B- , if he had known he was to be spoken at in that manner . I imagined his face a deep crimson , and his hands trembling with nervous horror ; but judge of my surprise , when he rose to reply with so calm a voice and so composed a manner , that , in all my experience of dinner-speaking , I never witnessed such a case of apparent ease . ( Easy-Chair C himself , one of the best makers of after-dinner or any other speeches of our day , according to Charles Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - never surpassed in eloquent effect this speech by Hawthorne . ) There was no hesitation , no sign of lack of preparation , but he went on for about ten minutes in such a masterly manner , that I declare to you it was one of the most successful efforts of the kind ever made . Everybody was delighted , and , when he sat down , a wild and unanimous shout of applause rattled the glasses on the table . The meaning of his singular composure on that occasion F could never get him satisfactorily to explain , and the only remark I ever heard him make , in any way connected with this marvellous exhibition of coolness , was simply , " What a confounded fool I was to go down to that speech-making dinner . " During all those long years , while Hawthorne was absent in Europe , he was anything but an idle man . On the contrary , he was an eminently busy one , in the best sense of that term ; and if his life had been prolonged , the public would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His brain teemed with romances , and once I remember he told me he had no less than five stories , well thought out , any one of which he could finish and publish whenever he chose to . There was one subject for a work of imagination that seems to have haunted him for years , and he has mentioned it twice in his journal . This was the subsequent life of the young man whom Jesus , looking on , " loved , " and whom he bade to sell all that he had and give to the poor , and take up his cross and follow him . " Something very deep and beautiful might he made out of this , " Hawthorne said , " for the young man went away sorrowful , and is not recorded to have done what he was bidden to do . " One of the most difficult matters he had to manage while in England was the publication of Miss Bacon 's sin1871. 387 // 388 gular book on Shakespeare . The poor lady , after he had agreed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in great wrath , accusing him of pusillanimity in not avowing full faith in her theory ; so that , as he told me , so far as her good-will was concerned , he had not gained much by taking the responsibility of her book upon his shoulders . It was a heavy weight for him to bear in more senses than one , for he paid out of his own pocket the expenses of publication . I find in his letters constant references to the great kindness with which he was treated in London . He spoke of Mrs. S. C. Hall as " one of the best and warmest-hearted women in the world . " Leigh Hunt in his way pleased and satisfied him more than almost any man he had seen in England . " As for other literary men , " he says in one of his letters , " I doubt whether London can muster so good a dinnerparty as that which assembles every month at the marble palace in School Street . " All sorts of adventures befell him during his stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his causing the thieves to be tried and sentenced to transportation . In the summer-time he travelled about the country in England and pitched his tent wherever fancy prompted . One auturnn afternoon in September be writes to me from Leamington : - " I received your letter only this morning , at this cleanest and prettiest of English towns , where we are going to spend a week or two before taking our departure for Paris . We are acquainted with Leamington already , having resided here two summers ago ; and the country round about is unadulterated England , rich in old castles , manor-houses , churches , and thatched cottages , and as green as Paradise itself . I only wish I had a house here , and that you could come and be my guest in it ; but I am a poor wayside vagabond , and only find shelter for a aight or so , and then trudge onward March , again . My wife and children and myself are familiar with all kinds of lodgement and modes of living , but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , poor things ! I doubt whether they will ever feel inclined to live long in one place . The worst of it is , I have outgrown my house in Concord , and feel no inclination to return to it . " We spent seven weeks in Manchester , and went most diligently to the Art Exhibition ; and I really begin to be sensible of the rudiments of a taste in pictures . " It was during one of his rambles through the Manchester Exhibition rooms that Hawthorne saw Tennyson wandering about . I have always thought it a great pity that these two men of genius could not have been introduced on that occasion . Hawthorne was too shy to seek an introduction , and Tennyson was not aware that the American author was present . Hawthorne records in his journal that he gazed at Tennyson with all his eyes , and rejoiced more in him than in all the other wonders of the Exhibition . When I afterwards told Tennyson that the author whose " Twice-Told Tales " he happened to be then reading at Farringford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself known , the Laureate said in his frank and hearty manner : " Why did n't he come up and let me shake hands with him ? I am sure I should have been glad to meet a man like Hawthorne anywhere . " At the close of x857 Hawthorne writes to me that he hears nothing of the appointment of his successor in the consulate , since he had sent in his resignation . " Somebody may turn up any day , " he says , " with a new commission in his pocket . " He was meanwhile getting ready for Italy , and he writes , " I expect shortly to be released from durance . " In his last letter before leaving England for the Coxtinent he says : - " I made up a huge package the other day , consisting of seven closely // since my arrival in England , and filled with sketches of places and men and manners , many of which would doubtless be very delightful to the public . I think I shall seal them up , with directions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence ; and your firm shall have the refusal of them then . " Remember me to everybody , for I love all my friends at least as well as ever . " Released from the cares of office , and having notl*ing to distract his attention , his life on the Continent opened full of delightful excitement . His pecuniary situation was such as to enable him to live very comfortably in a country where , at that time , prices were moderate . In a letter dated from a villa near Florence on the 3d of September , 1858 , he describes in a charming manner his way of life in Italy . I will read an extract from it : - " I am afraid I have stayed away too long , and am forgotten by everybody . You have piled up the dusty remnants of my editions , I suppose , in that chamber over the shop , where you once took me to smoke a cigar , and have crossed my name out of your list of authors , without so much as asking whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , nevertheless . It is pleasant to feel at last that I am really away from America , - a satisfaction that I never enjoyed as long as I stayed in Liverpool , where it seemed to me that the quintessence of nasal and hand-shaking Yankeedom was continually filtered and sublimated through my consulate , on the way outward and homeward . I first got acquainted with my own countrymen there . At Rome , too , it was not much better . But here in Florence , and in the summer-time , and in this secluded villa , I have escaped out of all my old tracks , and am really remote . " I like my present residence immensely . The house stands on a hill , overlooking Florence , and is big enough 389 to quarter a regiment ; insomuch that each member of the family , including servants , has a separate suite of apartments , and there are vast wildernesses of upper rooms into which we have never yet sent exploring expeditions . " At one end of the house there is a moss-grown tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk , who was confined there in the thirteenth century , previous to being burned at the stake in the principal square of Florence . I hire this villa , tower and all , at twentyeight dollars a month ; but I mean to take it away bodily and clap it into a romance , which I have in my head ready to be written out . " Speaking of romances , I have planned two , one or both of which I could have ready for the press in a few months if I were either in England or America . But I find this Italian atmosphere not favorable to the close toil of composition , although it is a very good air to dream in . I must breathe the fogs of old England or the east winds of Massachusetts , in order to put me into working trim . Nevertheless , I shall endeavor to be busy during the coming winter at Rome , but there will be so much to distract my thoughts that I have little hope of seriously accomplishing anything . It is a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should feel relieved by discharging some of them upon the public . " We shall continue here till the end of this month , and shall then return to Rome , where I have already taken a house for six months . In the middle of April we intend to start for home by the way of Geneva and Paris ; and , after spending a few weeks in England , shall embark for Boston in July or the beginning of August . After so long an absence ( more than five years already , which will be six before you see me at the old Corner ) , it is not altogether delightful to think of returning . Everybody will be changed , and I myself no doubt , as much as anybody . Ticknor and you , I suppose , were both upset in the late religious earthquake , and when I inquire for you , the clerks Our Whispering Gallery . // 390 Our Whispering Gallery . will direct me to the Business Men 's Conference . ' It wo n't do . I shall be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging . London is like the grave in one respect , - any man can make himself at home there ; and whenever a man finds himself homeless elsewhere , he had better either die or go to London . " Speaking of the grave reminds me of old age and other disagreeable matters ; and I would remark that one grows old in Italy twice or three times as fast as in other countries . I have three gray hairs now for one that I brought from England , and I shall look venerable indeed by next summer , when I return . " Remember me affectionately to all my friends . Whoever has a kindness for me may be assured that I have twice as much for him . " Hawthorne 's second visit to Rome , in the winter of 1859 , was not a fortunate one . His own health was excellent during his sojourn there , but several members of his family fell ill , and he became very nervous and longed to get away . In one of his letters he says - " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewell forever ; and I fully acquiesce in all the mischief and ruin that has happened to it , from Nero 's conflagration downward . In fact , I wish the very site had been obliterated before I ever saw it . " He found great solace , during the series of domestic troubles ( continued illness in his family ) that befell , in writing memoranda for " The Marble Faun . " He thus announces to me the beginning of the new romance - " I take some credit to myself for having sternly shut myself up for an hour or two almost every day , and come to close grips with a romance which I have been trying to tear out of my mind . As for my success , I ca n't say much ; indeed , I do n't know what to say at all . I only know that I have produced what seems to be a larger amount of scribble than either of my former romances , and that portions of it interested me a good deal while I was writing them ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and things to suffer , that the story has developed itself in a very imperfect way , and will have to be revised hereafter . I could finish it for the press in the time that I am to remain here ( till the i*th of April ) , but my brain is tired of it just now ; and , besides , there are many objects that I shall regret not seeing , hereafter , though I care very little about seeing them now ; so I shall throw aside the romance , and take it up again next August at The Wayside . " He decided to be back in England early in the summer , and to sail for home in July . He writes to me from Rome - " I shall go home , I fear , with a heavy heart , not expecting to be very well contented there If I were but a hundred times richer than I am , how very comfortable I could be I consider it a great piece of good fortune that I have had experience of the discomforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from England . Anything will seem like Paradise after a Roman winter . " If I had but a house fit to live in , I should be greatly more reconciled to coming home ; but I am really at a loss to imagine how we are to squeeze ourselves into that little old cottage of mine . We had outgrown it before we came away , and most of us are twice as big now as we were then . " I have an attachment to the place , and should be sorry to give it up ; but I shall half ruin myself if I try to enlarge the house , and quite if I build another . So what is to be done ? Pray have some plan for me before I get back ; not that I think you can possibly hit on anything that will suit me . . . I shall return by way of Venice and Geneva , spend two or three weeks or more in Paris , and sail for home , as I said , in July . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , or anywhere else . At any rate , it will cheer my heart to see you // touch my dear native soil again . " I went abroad again , as you remember , Jack , in 1859 , and found Hawthorne back in England , *orking away diligently at " The Marble Faun . " While travelling on the Continent , during the autumn , I had constant letters from him , giving accounts of his progress on the new romance . He says : " I get along more slowly than I expected If I mistake not , it will have some good chapters . " Writing on the ioth of October he tells me : " The romance is almost finished , a great heap of manuscript being already accumulated , and only a few concluding chapters remaining behind . If hard pushed , I codld have it ready for the press in a fortnight ; but unless the publishers Smith and Elder were to bring out the work in England are in a hurry , I shall be somewhat longer about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I anticipated . To confess the truth , I admire it exceedingly at intervals , but am liable to cold fits , during which I think it the most infernal nonsense . You ask for the title . I have not yet fixed upon one , but here are some that have occurred to me ; neither of them exactly meets my idea : Monte Beni ; or , The Faun . A Romance . ' The Romance of a Faun . ' The Faun of Monte Beni . ' Monte Beni : a Romance . ' Miriam : a Romance ' Hilda : a Romance . ' Donatello : a Romance . ' The Faun : a Romance . ' Marble and Man : a Romance . ' When you have read the work ( which I especially wish you to do before it goes to press ) , you will be able to select one of them , or imagine something better . There is an objection in my mind to an Italian name , though perhaps Monte Beni might do . Neither do I wish , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book too prominent by putting the Faun into the title-page . " Hawthorne wrote so intensely on his new story , that he was quite worn down before he finished it . To recruit his strength he went to Redcar , where 39 ' the bracing air of the German Ocean soon counteracted the ill effect of overwork . " The Marble Faun " was in the London printing-office in November , and he seemed very glad to have it off his hands . His letters to me at this time ( I wa* still on the Continent ) were very jubilai* He was living in Leamington , and was constantly writing to me that I should find the next two months more comfortable in England than anywhere else . On the 17th he writes : - " The Italian spring commences in February , which is certainly an advantage , especially as from February to May is the most disagreeable portion of the English year . But it is always summer by a bright coal-fire . We find nothing to complain of in the climate of Leamington . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us for fog ; but I like fog , and do not care about seeing my hand before me . We have thought of staying here till after Christmas and then going somewhere else , - perhaps to Bath , perhaps to Devonshire . But all this is uncertain . Leamington is not so desirable a residence in winter as in summer ; its great charm consisting in the many delightful walks and drives , and in its neighborhood to interesting places . I have quite finished the book ( some time ago ) and have sent it to Smith and Elder , who tell me it is in the printer 's hands , but I have received no proof-sheets . They wrote to request another title instead of the Romance of Monte Beni , ' and I sent them their choice of a dozen . I do n't know what they have chosen ; neither do I understand their objection to the above . Perhaps they do n't like the book at all ; but I shall not trouble myself about that , as long as they publish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it much my best romance ; but I can see some points where it is open to assault . If it could have appeared first in America , it would have been a safe thing " I mean to spend the rest of my abode in England in blessed idleness : and as for my journal , in the first place , Our Whispering Gallery . // I have not got it here ; secondly , there is nothing in it that will do to publish . " And now , dear Jack , I have read to you extracts enough from Hawthorne 's letters for to-day . There is really so much of interest connected with this great author , that I never know where to stop , when I fall to gossiping about him . When I began to open my memorial budget to you , I had no idea I should find so good a listener . But let us have a long brisk winter walk , before the snow falls faster and thicker . We can do our ten miles without the slightest harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white barricades .
