txt It is by no means needful or desirable that the Army appropriation debate at the present session of Congress should take the wide range of a general discussion of Army reorganization . Still , should it not , the latter subject will infallibly come up at the Winter session . Congressional tinkering on the Army has usually consisted of doing what ought not to be done and leaving undone those things which ought to be done . The.Army has , accordingly , been in a state of ebb and flux for the last dozen years  --  now increased , anon diminished , but never stable . The annual debate ' on the appropriation has come to be a source of mingled dread and disgust , and its close , for good or ill , is received with a sigh of relief . But this year the Army is more hopeful about the Congressional debates and votes , partly because the riot service , the Rio Grande service , and the bloody Indian wars have imposed on the troops a triple task to whose severity the public has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now well-felt public necessities . The expedition against the Nez Peres has brought the cavalry into special prominence of late . ' It is , of course , largely , though by no means exclusively , on this arm of the service that we rely in Indian campaigning , because it requires mounted men to pursue mounted men , and all hostile Indians are mounted . We have heretofore given some reasons why too much is expeeted of our cavalry iu a war like that of the Nez Perds . Not until the white soldier can ride like the Indian , shoot like him from horseback , live on roots , bear heat and cold , fatigue and famine , like the redskin , can ho hope to equal the Indian in the Indian style of warfare and in an Indian country . And as the Indian soldier is better fitted by nature and training for this peculiar service , so the Indian pony can march with ease where the cavalryman 's horse gets lame . But while these disadvantages are in a certain sense inevitable , there are others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect establishment than ours . There is no doubt that our cavalry ought to have better drill , more practice in horsemanship , and more target-firing . Here , again , we bring up short against the fact that the small size of the army , the variety of its duties , and the great extent of territory over which those duties are distributed , combine to render impossible the degree of drill which is needful for all troops , and especially for recruits . The changes of station to which our troops are subject are hurtful in this respect , and so is the hurrying of recruits into active service before they have become soldiers . We have lately received from Major PRICE , of the Eighth Cavalry , who has been serving with credit for several years in NewMexico , Arizona , and Texas , a copy of his suggestions for reorganizing the arm in which he is specially interested . We have no idea that they will be carried out , because they look to a much more thorough military establishment than the makeshift one which forms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have attracted our interest from dealing with the very necessities which we have before spoken of ; and possibly they may , in part , eveh recommend themselves to Congress from the fact that they propose increased efficiency with less cost . Stated very briefly , Major PRICE 'S plan would withdraw each cavalry regiment once in five years from its incessant labors and fatigues , Summer and Winter , and , gathering its scattered companies together , would put them in camp near the place of original enlistment , for recruiting , thorough instruction , and drill . To accomplish this without pecuniary loss , and , in fact , with gain , the terms of all enlisted cavalrymen in one-third of the regiments should be made to expire on a given date ; in the second third twenty months later ; and in the remaining third , twenty months later still , thus dividing the five years , or sixty months , into thirds , and providing for rotation of service . Each regiment would thus , obviously , have twenty months to devote to changing station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instruction . As the enlistment would be wholly regimental , and company recruiting would be , if possible , confined to one locality , the system would lead to getting recruits whose antecedents and character could be inquired into . This would have many good effects ; it would bind the Army to the country by strong local ties ; it would bring better material to the Army , because young men of character could inquire of townsmen about the service , and could serve with acquaintances ; and the result would be to encourage re-enlistments and to greatly decrease desertions . These points of advantage , and others which Major Puicz presents , can be easily appreciated by Congressmen . Now , as to his pecuniary saving . He figures it from varous sources . First , there is the very large travel allowance and rations given to a man enlisted , for example , iu New-York and discharged in San Francisco . Take the regiment home in bulk , as could be done on the camp enlistment plan , and of course there would be no such allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On that item alone $250,000 could be saved , according to Major PRICE . Then he figures $200,000 - more saved from the present transfers of regiments for the mere sake of healthful change , fully $1,000,000 in the decrease of desertions , $250,000 in expenses of recruiting ; $100,000 in courtsmartial , and $200,000 in military prisons  --  or say $2,000,000 a year . Of course , this economy is hypothetical , and we think it over rated . Still , as the expenses do now exist , there seems to be little doubt that Major ParcE 's plan would save something . The chief objection to it is that with our small service force , it is hardly practicable to keep so large a proportion in the recruiting and drill camp ; and the time , twenty months , assigned for this purpose , also seems to be unnecessarily long . Still , the theory of the camp of instruction is exceedingly important , and the other points suggested by Major PRICE merit consideration . As a cavalry officer , he is naturally in favor of greatly increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is not necessariJ ly connected with the part already presented , and need not therefore be discussed just now . Major PRICE proposes , however , that his rotation plan should also apply to the infantry , though in a different proportion . In a letter explaining his scheme , Major PRICE suggests that the recruiting rendezvous for cavalry should be , one in Massachusetts , one in New-York , one in Pennsylvania , one on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , within easy reach of Baltimore and Washington , one in Ohio , one in Illinois , and perhaps one near Chattanooga , one in the Carolinas , and one near Atlanta . He also suggests that these camps would form good schools for the attention of the Militia .
