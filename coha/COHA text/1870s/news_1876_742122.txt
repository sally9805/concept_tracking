txt The speech of Mr. EVARTS last evening was a powerful one , and can not be without great effect at this stage of the canvass . It was devoted mainly to a very clear and logical statement of the controlling issues pending between the two great parties , which statement was , however , preceded by an exceedingly acute and . skillful comparison of the private and public characters of the candidates . Mr. EVARTS found no difficulty in giving to Gov . HAYES a cordial but discriminating indorsement , and drew a striking contrast between the services which he has rendered to his country and the principal features of Mr. TILDEN 'S career . The three subjects to which Mr. EVART 'S particularly addressed himself were the prospect of specie payments afforded by the respective parties , the chances of civil service reform which each holds out , and the supreme question of the effect upon the results , of the war to be expected from the election of Gov . TILDEN . His treatment of the positions of the parties relative to specie payments was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imbecility , and duplicity of Mr. TILDEN 'S course was very telling . On the matter of civil service reform , he was explicit . His exposition of the vicious system by which the " machine " embarrasses the public service , enfeebles the Legislature , and perverts andlcorrupts politics , was very plain , and was received by his audience with evidences of hearty approval . We commend our readers , who had not the pleasure of hearing Mr. EVARTS to this portion of his remarks , and to his explanation of why he believed Mr. HA.YES could and would reform this evil , and why Mr. TILDEN would not if he could , and could not if he would . In the discussion of the relations of the two parties to the results of the war . Mr. EVARTS spoke with great eloquence and force . He constantly recurred to the struggle for the Union , and his words were deeply charged with that warm patriotism which he so often displayed at that period . We have no doubt that his expressions will offend those who think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the war with calm indifference , and treat the past as if it were not . Mr. EVARTS is not ready to bury the past , or belittle the forces which survive from that time . He does not think that it is yet safe for the American people to " recall its Stuarts . " He pointed out that the turning point in the growth of the rebellion was when the South asked its political allies in the North what would be the consequences to it of military resistance to the Government . He recited . the message which , on a precisely similar occasion ANDREW JACKSON had sent to the same section , contemplating a like attempt , and recalled the fact that at that crisis the attempt was abandoned , and the Union kept safe without the arming of a squadron or the loss of a life . Ho then recounted the course of Mr. TILDEN , who , in October , 1860 , at a stage of the Presidential canvass corresponding to the one at which we now stand , had . given to the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had he taken the opposite course , and had his party been guided by other counsels than his , the war might have been avoided . Why , then , should we exalt to the highest place in the nation a man , who at the most trying crisis of its history , did what he could to ruin , and nothing to save , it ? Why should we suppose that this man , who at such a moment yielded . everything to the South , would now be able to resist its passions , its eager interest , and its burning ambition It was true that Mr. TILDEN had said that he should veto the claims of the South , but it was a novel idea that a free and intelligent people should elect a President in order that he might veto the measures of his own party . The entire address of Mr. EVARTS was masterly . His point of view was elevated , his reasoning was logical , direct and pointed , and his lighter touches wore skillful and witty .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
