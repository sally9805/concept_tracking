MY FATHER 'S SHIPWRECK . J HAVE often promised you , my dear children , that I would some time write out my own early recollections of certain passages in the lives of your grandparents , who were , I think , honored and beloved by you in a very uncommon degree . These passages have always excited a deep interest in the family circle , and something impels me now to undertake the fulfilment of my promise , ere the lengthening shadows , which are approaching , dim the distinctness of outline with which these far-off objects still stand out in the background of my earliest days . I was , as you know , the only child of my parents . At my birth your grandfather was a shipmaster . It was a period when a faithful performance of the duties of that vocation required a man possessing " a sound mind in a sound body " ; and that these gifts were his in an uncommon degree I think he found abundant opportunity for manifesting in a long and varied career . All records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general knowledge of the fact that , some time during my second year , he sailed in the schooner M , of B , owned by Colonel I. T , for the Mediterranean . About this time a decree was issued by the French at Rambouillet , " confiscating all American vessels and their cargoes then found in ports under the control of the French , and directing that , if any should enter a French harbor in future , it should be seiied and sold . " At Naples the M , with twenty-nine other American vessels , was thus confiscated . My father was detained there a weary time , making vain efforts to recover his vessel , and by a long and tiresome lawsuit he at one time succeeded in procuring its release , when almost immediately a new seizure was made by a new order from Napoleon Bonaparte . During this lawsuit he was obliged to have an audience with King Joachim Murat , and I have heard him laughingly describe the sport he made for his landlady and fellowboarders , by his somewhat grotesque // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion . A part of this , I remember , was an extraordinary chapeau , to be carried chiefly under the arm , having been reduced to an unwonted degree of thinness by his various annoyances , his calves were considered to fall short of the proportions of beauty , as exhibited by " black satin shorts , " in black silk stockings clocked and curiously gartered . I recollect , too , having heardhimsay he felt " perfectly at ease " in making his simple statement to royalty ; that he was listened to with " perfect politeness , " and a very fair promise made him that his petition should be granted . One not inconsiderable incident of personal danger I recall as occurring to him at this time . He had a narrow escape from assassination . While sitting one day , after dinner , engaged in reading in the cabin of his own vessel , - it must have been during the short time of its release , - with his back turned toward the companion-way , he suddenly became conscious of a shadow falling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some object interposed between him and the door ; and he leaped to his feet just in time to avoid the stroke of a cutlass , which came down with sufficient force to make a deep incision upon a strongly bound sea-trunk which stood beside him , - a blow which must have cloven his skull , had it fallen as it was intended . It was dealt by the hand of one of the villains engaged in the lawsuit , who , on being thus defeated of his murderous design , pretended to make a joke of it , declaring it was merely an attempt to startle him from his book . Nor could my father have hoped for any redress , had he chosen to take it otherwise , such was the condition of the existing government . During his eighteen months of detention he found some leisure to indulge his curiosity as a traveller . He made the ascent of Vesuvius , during the time of an eruption , with a party of friends , walking where the ground was sufficiently hot to curl slightly the soles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXVIII. - NO. i66. occurrence now , but not quite so much so for Americans sixty years ago . He also made a journey to Rome on account of his lawsuit . This being in the summer of 1809 , he happened to start on his return to Naples on the same night , between the 5th and 6th of July , on which Pope Pius VII. , according to Sir Walter Scott , was obliged , by order of the Emperor , to quit Rome , a temporary exile , repairing first to Grenoble and afterwards to Savona . I have often heard my father , an eye*vitness , describe the frantic consternation into which the Catholic populace were thrown by this rash act of Napoleon . On the xoth of April , i8io , my father , with several others , masters and supercargoes of vessels , finding all chance for recovering their property lost , and fearing even for their personal safety , took passage in the ship M- for 5- , which vessel was the first released by the government , on the application of Alexander Hammet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews of the Vessels confiscated at Naples . An account of the fearful wreck of this good ship M-on her homeward passage I give you in your grandfather 's own words , as written by himself very soon after his return to his own home . On the xoth of April the ship M- , of 5- , sailed from Naples , with forty-six souls on board , namely , thirty-one passengers , and fifteen , the crew of the said ship . Passed through the Gut of Gibraltar on the 22d of April ; nothing material occurred until the 20th of May , when , being in lat. 400 N. and long . 390 30 ' W. , having strong breezes at southeast and eastsoutheast and rainy weather , at I I A. M. took in topgallant steering sails , and fore and mizzen topgallant sails , jib and light staysail and mainsail . At I P. M. foretopmast steering - sail halyards parted , and all hands were called to haul in the steering-sail , and take in sail ; but owing to the topmast // steering-sail being carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , which brought both steeringsails into the water , and both were lost . One man was on the main royal yard , furling the royal , three on the main topgallant yard , and one in the maintop , the rest employed in cle*ving down the topsails , but , finding the squall came on heavily , they were obliged to let fly the topsail sheets , the helm at the same time being hove hard to windward with the wind on her larboard quarter ; she came to against her helm , and when the wind got abeam she began to capsize , and as soon as she got her gun*vale to the water , in an instant capsized with her masts and sails in the water . One man was on the main royal yard , three on the main topgallant yard , and four or five in the forecastle unwell , and one in the cabin , who said , when he came out of the cabin , the water was rushing down in sheets as large as the companion-way would admit ; notwithstanding , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting away the lanyards with our knives , we at length procured an axe , and cut away the masts , and got a rope from the fore and mizzen chains all hands then got hold of the rope , and , going as near the keel as possible , by this means righted her , and found her full of water , her hatches , cabin doors , and windows being open . At the same time the long-boat and pinnace , and several water - casks were drifting among the spars to windward . We then hove over the guns , anchors , etc. , to lighten the ship , and endeavored to clear the wreck of the spars , rigging , etc. , which lay beating against her ; but our efforts were in vain , as the starboard lanyards were so deep under water that we could not come at them . Three men then got into the small boat , which was very badly stove , and endeavored to tow the long-boat out from among the spars ; at the same time there were men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endeavoring to cut a passage for her ; and , in about two hours , they got the August , long- boat alongside of the wreck , and righted her , but found the pinnace in her so badly stove that it was impossible to repair her . The long-boat had one of her buts started , and a hole in her bottom , on which account we were obliged to turn her bottom up again to drive the but to , and stop the hole . Mr. S- C- , of Derby , in Connecticut , stripped himself of his jacket and trousers , got on the bottom of the boat , drove the but to , and stopped the hole in her bottom by nailing canvas and sheet-lead over it , which we got from the stern . We then righted her , and three men jumped into the boat to bale her out , which they effected in about fifteen minutes ; eight more then jumped into the boat , and shoved off , for the purpose , as I then supposed , of repairing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard irons and waist cloths , and some pine boards , with all the tools and nails I could procure , and passed them into the small boat , to send to the longboat , which was lying at about twenty or thirty fathoms ' distance , still thinking they would lie by us . Just before night , as the yawl was lying alongside , taking in tools , nails , etc. , Mr. B- , who was sitting on the t*iffrail , got into her and went to the long-boat . About twelve o'clock at night they hailed us from the boat , and requested me to send them a chest and a cask of sweet-oil , which was made fast to the stern , which request I complied with . From that time until morning they frequently told us to desist from hauling in the boat , or they should be obliged to cut the painter ; there was , however , no one near the rope , nor was there any attempt made during the night to haul up the boat . The next forenoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yawl , in procuring from the spars a sail , spars , rigging , and oars for the long-boat . About twelve o'clock , as I was taking an observation , they said to me that , as I had two quadrants and two compasses , I could spare them one of each . I replied , that if they My Fat/icr 's Slez'pwrcck. // would come under the stern I would give them , but they declined doing that , and requested me to make them fast on a board , and veer it astern , which I refused to do . This was the first idea I had of their leaving us . I refused them the quadrant and compass on the idea that they would not leave us without them ; but immediately upon my refusal they stept their mast and bent their sail , and were all ready to get under way . Finding their intention was to leave us , several of the people on the wreck entreated them , for God 's sake , to come alongside , and take some more of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those on the wreck then requested them to come a little nearer , that they might send some word to their friends , if the boat ever got home . They refused to do even this , and immediately hoisted their sail . " Upon seeing this , three or four jumped into the sea , and swam towards the long-boat , among whom was iVir . C- , above mentioned , who repaired the bottom of the long-boat at the risk of his life . They immediately cut the painter , and the two men in the yawl jumped out of her into the long-boat , setting the yawl adrift ; at the same time some one on board of the long - boat held up a knife in a threatening manner , meaning probably to make those in the water understand they would keep them off at any rate . These men then returned , with the exception of one , who swam to the yawl , which was drifting to leeward . With much difficulty he got on board of her , and found one oar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was at that time sailing very slowly , at the distance of nearly a mile from the wreck ; he was apparently gaining upon them , when they manned their oars , and pulled away from him , on which he returned to the wreck , having been absent about two hours . Since my arrival , Captain G- , of Newburyport , has stated to me , that it was with great difficulty he got on board of the long-boat from the yawl , several of them being opposed to it , although he had been very industriously employed in getting her from among the spars , etc. , and in procuring articles for repairing her ; he likewise stated to me that , had they known they should be taken us in four or five days , they ; ; zi*ght have taken ten more . ' It is my sincere opinion that when the boat left us , far from being incapable of holding more , she required at least one ton weight to put her in good sailing trim . Although I never requested them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished them to keep by us , in the hope that if we should be fortunate enough to see any vessel , the long-boat might forelay it , and by that means rescue the whole of us ; and had they stayed by us but two days longer , we should probably have been all saved , as , on that day , a large ship passed so near the wreck that we saw her hull ; and the yawl , shattered as she was , was despatched to board her , but , being small , and a heavy sea running , it was impossible to make much progress ; they got near enough , however , to see the people on the deck . To show that it was the opinion of many , if not all , on the wreck that the long - boat ought to have stayed by them , I will merely mention that , at the time the boat left the wreck , there were several young gentlemen who told those leaving us , they hoped some might get home from the wreck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-boat about twentyfour hours after she capsized . A list of fifteen names is here given in the manuscript . " After the departure of the long-boat , on Monday , May 21st , we immediately hoisted a signal by lashing one of the royal masts to the stump of the mainmast , and hoisting a cabin quilt about thirty feet above the deck . We then erected a stage , by laying spars across the quarter-rails , and laid a sail on the spars , on which we were tolerably comfortably situated ; all hands were thea employed in securing provisions . // " On the 24th of May we caught a turtle , and found in a chest a box of tinder , which being quite wet we dried in the sun , and got fire ; we then took the bell of the ship and built a fire in it , and with a baking-pan cooked a good mess of turtle-soup for thirty-one persons . We burnt some fresh tinder , and kept it dry as we could , but never could get fire afterwards . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , one barrel of wine , salt pork and beef , hams , potatoes , corn , bread , etc. , sufficient to have lasted two or three months , and had the long-boat stayed by us , we might have secured a great quantity in her ; but , unfortunately for us , on the 28th of May , came on a heavy gale of wind , and in the course of the night the spars which lay alongside , a heavy sea running at the same time , beat away all the upper works ; at the same time our staging went , and we lost all the provisions , excepting a little salt meat , and about three gallons of wine . But if at this time , we could have had the tools the long-boat took from us , especially the broad-axe , we might have been able to disencumber the wreck of the spars , which , by beating against it , undoubtedly caused the loss of the upper deck . In the fore part of the night there were four men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boat making so much water , two of the four were obliged to get out on the staging , leaving two to steer and bale . In the morning , it being a little more moderate , myself ; with two others , took to the yawl , and were employed , in the fore part of the day in taking the people from the quarter-deck to the bowsprit ; directly after the quarter deck floated off with the stump of the mizzen-mast in it . During the week our provisions lasted , the company unanimously chose Captain J- and myself to take charge of them , and deal out as we thought proper . I would likewise state , that , during the time I was with them , Captain J- prayed publicly with the company , and that many of them paid great attention , es pecially Messrs . C- , C- , and P- . On the 30th , the weather being pleasant , I was employed , with four others , in procuring spars and sails , to make a stage on the forecastle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on each side of the stump of the foremast , to the bows of the ship , which made a tolerable stage for the whole company , on which they were quite dry . Nothing remarkable happened until the 3d of June , when C P- , of Salem , died , overcome by fatigue and reduced by famine . Our wine at this time being gone , and having nothing but a wineglass of vinegar for each man , during every twenty-four hours , not having had any water since the 28th of May , it being a calm day on the 4th of June , we went to work to get a pipe of brandy , which we effected about midday , when many of the people , having previously drunk much salt water , which had increased their sufferings to a great degree , inadvertently took brandy to quench their raging thirst . The next day the following persons died . A list of fourteen who died within fortyeight hours is here given , with the names of the vessels , etc. , to which they belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper deck was gone , and everything that was between decks had floated out , leaving us without any subsistence , excepting some pork and beef ; which it was impossible to eat for want of water . On the 7th of June , finding we could be of no use to those on the wreck , having no thing but brandy to subsist upon , and being then in lat. 390 12 ' N. , thinking that too far south for the track of Europeans , we decided , five of us , to trust ourselves to the yawl , and endeavor to stretch northward . " The morning we left the wreck we went under the bowsprit , and joined in prayer with Captain J- for our deliverance . At ten we bade them a final adieu , taking in the boat about two and one half crallons of brandy and a little pork . We left on the wreck the // following persons , viz. Here follows a list of ten names . " N hen the yawl left the wreck , the five following appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we did in the boat " The following persons left the wreck in the boat , viz. , J- C. V- , EA 1- , J- L- , of Salem , J- T- , of Ipswich , and myself . For sixteen clays after we left the wreck we had no sustenance , excepting the brandy , of which we took a gill in the course of twenty - four hours . On the night of the 22d of June we had considerable rain , and we caught water enough , by holding up our handkerchiefs and *vringing them , to quench our thirst partially , and to save two quarts . On the 23d T- , overcome with fatigue , hunger , and thirst , breathed his last , without a groan . On the same day we observed a number of rudderfish round the boat , and making a dipnet out of a hoop and some twine , caught . plenty , and , after drying them , we ate some of them , being the first food we had taken since leaving the wreck . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught water sufficient nearly to quench our thirst ; in which time I had eaten a small quantity of salt pork with some of the fish . But as soon as our water was gone I could eat no more . On the 28th of June L died , of hunger thirst , and fatigue . He went out of the world without a struggle or a groan . On the 29th , the boat still leaking so badly as to keep one man constantly baling , there being a heavy sea running , we had the misfortune to lose all our oars and the boat 's mast . Having nothing left to steer the boat with , she lying in the trough of the sea , and being in great danger of filling every moment , we lost nearly all our remaining courage . However , we went to work to make a paddle to steer the boat with by taking the yard from our boat 's sail , which was made of the blade of an oar split in two , and seizing it together in its former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a handIe , by this means we kept the boat before the sea . " On the 30th of June , about 3 P. M. , the boat being half full of water , I was looking round between hope and despair , and , to my unspeakable joy , espied a sail to the southeast , which , after looking some time , I thought was standing from us . In about ten minutes I observed she was standing on the wind to the north-northwest , and that she would not fetch within two miles of us , we being to windward . " We were now almost in despair , having neither oars nor boat 's mast , and Mr. V- so lame that he could scarcely move himself , but being in the stern of the boat , he took the paddle and kept her before the wind , while Mr. E- baled the boat , which was leaking very badly . I went to work to rig a sail , and for that purpose took one of the boat 's thwarts ; and the Lord giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little natural strength left , - I split the thwart over the stern of the boat , seized it together , and made a mast six feet long ; with a piece of board I made a yard ; and in about ten minutes got a sail set , and was running before the wind to forelay the vessel . About four o'clock p. iw. , having run about two miles to leeward , we came alongside the vessel , which proved to be the General J of G , from Lisbon , commanded by Captain S- L. D- , who received us on board , and treated us with the tenderness of a brother while we remained with him . He gave us at first light food in small quantities , increasing the portion as we were able to bear it . And I here desire to express my grateful acknowledgments that so worthy a man was made an instrument in God 's hand to be our deliverer . This was the eighth sail we had seen since our shipwreck , - four before we left the *vreck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreck and in the boat , were , as the reader may judge , inexpressible . Captain D- received us on board his vessel in lat. 4o* I2* N. , long . 450 i871. 49 // XV . They immediately hoisted our boat on board the General J , and found three of her buts started off , and the oakum so much out of her bottom , that , when they cast off the gripes , of which we had three , her stern nearly dropped out . In this small and shattered boat three of us had lived twenty-three days , since leaving the wreck and on the 21st of July we arrived safely at G- , and in a short time reached our respective families , to the mutual joy of ourselves and our friends . Even strangers seemed to look on us as raised from the dead . " May we , each of us , give God the glory for such signal deliverance , and , in gratitude , devote the remainder of our days to his service . ( Signed ) " H- L- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. - Since my arrival I have been informed by Captain F- , that it has been frequently reported at 5- that the M- was upset in a drunken frolic ' ; but I can assure the public that there was no person intoxicated , to my knowledge , while I remained on board the ship . I feel very grateful to Captain F- for his offer of a passage to me in the M- , and for his kind treatment of me while on board , before the shipwreck . This simple statement was made by my father , as soon after his return as he was able to collect his ideas and express them upon paper . And it is , indeed , wonderful , considering the physical condition to which he was reduced , that it did not require months rather than weeks to restore him to the degree of mental and bodily vigor necessary for the performance of this very painful duty . You will remember they were taken on board the General J on the 30th of June ; they arrived at G on the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at his own home in B- . At that distant day , the whole neighboring community were excited by so remarkable an event as this " sec August , ond return from the wreck of the Little child as I then was , I distinctly remember how , day after day , our little parlor would often be filled with persons , who came miles to see one who had survived such sufferings and exposure . A written account was demanded by the public ; but , owing to some peculiar circumstances connected with these sad events , my father undertook to give it with extreme reluctance . A very large number of near relatives and friends of the sufferers resided in the immediate vicinity ; and even before what was termed the " second return , " the conduct of those who left in the long-boat had been a good deal discussed , and now a loud call was made for a statement of facts relating to it . So he gave his testimony with regard to them . Honesty and moral courage , with which he was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his kindness of heart and true knowledge of human nature led him to put the mildest construction upon the motives of those who had escaped in the longboat . Respecting Captain F- I have heard him say : " I believe him to have been guilty only of weakness . He yielded , probably through fear , to the selfish impulses of one or two passionate young men , when he should resolutely have taken command of his own boat , and exercised the judgment of a man in lading and directing her . " Some of these gentlemen were personal friends , whom he often met afterwards , and for whom he felt unabated regard through life . He suppressed many sad details of suffering , which would have lent a thrilling interest to the story , but which could not have been borne by the bleeding hearts to which they must have found access , if given in a public newspaper . There is quite a remarkable forgetfulness of seif in his narrative , as he omits all personal details which are not of direct importance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here add a note made by a friend , who got the My Fadier 's SiVpwreck. // item in conversation , years afterwards , from my father . Where the narrative , simply says , " The quarter-deck floated off , with the stump of the mizzen-mast in it , " my friend 's note has , " Captain L- , the others all being on the forward staging , happened to be alone on that part of the upper deck near the mizzen-mast when it was swept away , carrying the stump of the mast with it . After floating off three or four rods , and hesitating whether his last chance was there or on the wreck , he plunged into the water , swam back , and got safely on board again . " My father lived fifty-two years after these events occurred , but he never could discuss them without an effort . Indeed , after he was eighty years of age , I have known him to lose a meal if this subject became a topic of conversation at table . I can now distinctly recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a boy who , while he was impatiently waiting for - dinner , exclaimed " I shall die of hunger ! " " If you had seen men die of hunger as Idid , and if you had felt , as Zizave , what it is to die , as to hunger and thirst yourself , you would then know Ibe dreadful meaning of that word Lunger . " At the solicitation of persons who did not suspect what suffering it gave him to recall these scenes , I have at different times heard him give details far more harrowing than anything recorded in his narrative ; and now , when those for whom I write are so desirous of knowing more of the story , I regret that I did not on those occasions commit the facts to writino* for I always , at my mother 's injunction , scrupulously refrained from asking him myself for any details . Some things I can recall to memory which may add an interest to what I write . My father always observed character with more interest than insensible objects , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by no means remarkably observant of places and things , unless associated with " human life therein . " On the wreck he must have made a study of the manner in which men of different temperaments and characters were affected by their common calamity , for I remember being partictdarly charmed , in early life , by hearing him describe observations of that sort which he there made ; and the good Captain J- , the lively and talented P- , and the true-hearted , energetic Chave always stood out , in my imagination , as lifelike pictures of representative men . I remember hearing that , after the long-boat left them , my father was one day attempting to take an observation , when one of the men , suddenly becoming deranged , as several of them did before death ended their sufferings , rushed at him and knocked off his hat into the water . At this time the heat of the sun was very oppressive , and for a few hours he felt the loss very painfully ; but at length it so happened that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed up from the hold , and floated within reach . " It contained many valuable things carefully collected by him , but he said he thought o nly of securing something to protect his head . As it floated past him he caught at a brightcolored cashmere shawl lying upon the top ; this he folded in a way to answer his purpose , and this he kept on his head until he was taken from the boat . I have this shawl in my possession now ; faded with its exposure then to the sun and salt water , and stained where the beloved head rested on the salt pork , which , when the parched mouths could no longer eat it , was used as a pillow in the boat . I have also a portion of a blue bandanna handkerchief which he held up to catch the precious drops of rain , and wrung into a small wooden box , with which they baled the boat , to slake his thirst . Of this handkerchief he finally made the " signal , " which caught the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masthead to look out , " and who reported to Captain D --  upon the deck , " I see a sail , sir , at a great distance , " and being ordered to " look 5 ' // again , " shouted , " it is something almost alongside now . " I have also a piece of tarred line , knotted at the ends , just twenty-one inches long , which was the exact measure of my father about his waist , taken carefully by Captain D- the day he was received on board his vessel . He was a man rather al ) ove ordinary height , and of good proportions when in health . These , to me , precious relics I would have my children preserve after me , as tokens of suffering and privations so manfully borne more than half a century ago , by one who yet lived long enough to gain the love and veneration of them all . About twenty years ago I made a visit with my father at Franklin in New Hampshire . On the evening before we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom he had much respect , he entered more fully into details regarding this whole matter than I ever heard him at one sitting , before or after . Near midnight I listened to his description of the parting scene , when the yawl left the wreck finally , given with great feeling , but I have not words to describe it , as it has since lived in my imagination . The wreck had drifted out of the regular track of vessels crossing the Atlantic , and remaining upon it , there was no hope of escape for any of the men . I believe the idea of leaving it in the yawl first came to my father , and the four who joined him did so without persuasion . Of the ten remaining at the time of their departure , five were unable to raise their heads or to speak audibly , and the other five considered their own chance to be better than that of those who left . They wept and prayed together , and made signals as long as they remained in sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my father on the boat . He was through life remarkable for his temperance in eating and drinking , refusing with dignity , even on his death-bed at eighty-five , to take " extra meals on account of debility , ' nor could he ever be persuaded to eat anything at all offensive to his taste . I remember , as if I saw it yesterday , . the strange , sad smile with which he answered his mother , when I was a very little girl . She had asked him to " just taste " something which he did not fancy , saying , " XVhy , Henry , it is so good ; and you saw the time , on the wreck , when you would have been glad to eat anything . " " No , mother , " said he , " in the boat , for a time , I might but I shall always remember how on the wreck I took my knife to pare the rind from my allowance of bacon , and was just going to toss it overboard , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never seemed a*vare that he had more presence of mind and fortitude than most men ; but I have heard him say , in reference to this period , " I really did not s ; *ffer so much as many in the same conditions with me , because I could turn off my mindfrom Qur wants better than they could . " I have heard him say he could make successful efforts , even in the boat , to compose himself to sleep , which the others could not ; and that , in this state , he was often " much refreshed by dreams . " He suffered more from thirst than hunger , and more than once , dreaming that he was a boy at home , he stooped and drank , as he had then often done , from a clear brook , which ran near his mother 's house , and awoke " refreshed . " At last he ceased for a few days to suffer from this cause ; having , at first , no desire for either food or drink when he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lie said , he " died as to hunger and thirst . " But far keener that anything phiysical was the mental suffering lie endured . The 30th of June , the events of which are lightly touched in his narrative , was , as I heard him describe it at Franklin , such a day as few men have lived to tell of . Three vessels , speeding onward in safety , had appeared within their horizon , and passed these worn and weary toilers , in their shattered boat , unknowingly . The last // 1871. disappeared at sunset , and soon darkness , almost crushing out life with hope , came down upon them . What wonder if they felt deserted by God and man , forlorn , exhausted , starving upon that wide , lonely sea ! Then dawned that 3oth day of June . Their failing strength seemed to have been tasked to the utmost . Poor V- was lying helpless , with one whole lower limb so swollen and inflamed by exposure to a burning sun , while constantly soaked in salt water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely exhausted , and having besides a passionate temper , had lost self-control , and used his feeble voice only in making bitter complaints at having been induced to leave the wreck , declaring he would do no more in baling the boat or in attempting to steer it . My father toiled on until past high noon , when he too felt " nature giving way " ; the boat was half filled with water ; he folded his arms , and closed his eyes ; one yearning thought of home , and all he was leaving , rushed through his heart , filling his soul , and impelled him " once more to sweep the horizon with his eye " ; this done , lying back in the boat , he " would allow her to go down . " But , in that farewell gaze , a fourth vessel standing favorably toward them met his eyes ; hope instantly revives , strength from above is given , he seizes the thwart of the boat , and by a seemingly miraculous effort splits it in twain upon its frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bales , the other steers ; they gain upon their approaching deliverer ; they are descried by " the sailor on lookout at the masthead " ; the vessel is " laid to , " and they are thus " snatched from the very jaws of death . " The account given by Captain D- , of their appearance and condition when first rescued , I have often heard my mother repeat . This kind and good man , looking through his spy-glass from the deck of the vessel , saw izothing , but , at the sailor 's second report , the mate , looking over the side , saw , almost close to them , an indescribable object . So embrowned and emaciated were these men , almost divested of clothing , which had " been used strip by strip to calk the boat , " that they had almost lost the semblance of humanity , as they lay , " With throats unslaked , With black lips baked , " unable from debility and emotion to make audible replies to the questions proposed to them . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing lost his balance , and fell between the boat and vessel , but the mate , who was then preparing to leap down to them , caught him , as he touched the water , and , carefully passing a rope around his body , had him tenderly raised , and placed safely on the deck of the vessel ; and finally , after rescuing E- in the same manner , the entire boat , with V- lying in it , was hoisted on board the General J- by the sympathizing sailors . Captain D-said my father " asked for nothing , but at once seemed desirous to attempt to give an account of himsef which he did , in a hoarse whisper , but with a mind perfectly collected , and in a very direct and intelligible manner . " The others " wept , and begged like little children for food and drink ; and , painful as it was , it was necessary , for some days , to deny them what would have killed them at once , if they could have got access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had then no hope of reaching home , and for twenty-four hours did not even inquire if the vessel were homeward bound ; but I wished my friends to know my story , thanked God devoutly for giving me this chance of sending it to them , and thought , this being done , I could then lie down and die in peace , for I felt that I was still at the gate of death . " By Captain D- 's unceasing and extremely judicious kindness , however , they were surprisingly recovered in the twenty-one days they passed on board his vessel . At first my father found great difficulty in swallowing a few teaspoonfuls of thin rice-water , was a // number of hours in accomplishing it , and then was oppressed to an agonizing degree by distention of the stomach . Fortunately there was a quantity of nice oranges on board , which were liberally dispensed , and in a day or two the juice became exceedingly grateful to him , until finally , before they landed , he was able to take small l ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall ; and he was so desirous of going home ai ' once , that Mr. L- , formanyyearsa well-remembered driver of the stage-coach , then running only twice in a *veek between Gand Boston , where several trains of cars now pass and repass daily , offered to drive him , in the most comfortable manner which could then be devised , to B , and used years afterward to speak of it to the family , as " a peculiar privilege " that he had been allowed to do so . Strength , however , was not yet sufficiently restored to my father 's wasted frame to enable him to perform at one effort the whole journey of fourteen miles ; and about nine o'clock in the evening he was brought to his mother 's house at * Beach , being still distant five miles from his own home , and was there received by her and her family " as one arisen from the grave . " If , my dear children , you all love and venerate the memory of your grandfather , I am sure those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough to remember her now , accord an equal place in your regards to your grandmother . Some of you , who have heard her mental sufferings at the l ) enod I have described , alluded to by your grandfather and others , would , you say , feel this record to be incomplete , if what I am able to recall of this portion of the family chronicle should be omitted . For your gratification , then , as I really have some distinct and vivid recollections of home scenes and occurrences associated with these events , which took place during my third summer , I will give them to you as they may be recalled ; but they must be mere outline sketches of a few scenes , strongly im* pressed at a period far remote . What I do remember was indelibly traced , but all filling up has been obliterated by the mists of gathering years . This was in the time of the " Long Embargo , " and all the good wives of absent sailors in our neighborhood were , I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living in the house where I was born , of which we occupied only a part . In my father 's absence she kept no servant . It was my birth month , June , and a cousin of my mother was making us a visit . Years afterward I heard her describe the singular state of nervous anxiety in which my poor mother had been living for more than a month . She was naturally very cheerful , and of a serene , equable temperament . But my father had left home expecting to be absent only six months , and had now been gone eighteen , under circumstances of peculiar trial and danger . This preyed upon her spirits sadly , and produced a dread of coming evil quite unnatural to her usual temper and disposition . A pleasant Sunday morning came , about the 20th of June , and her cousin persuaded her to go to church , to hear the then celebrated Dr. Griffin , of Boston , preach . In those days church-going , in Massachusetts , was very generally considered an incumbent duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could give no reason which seemed plausible for absenting herself on this occasion , yet feeling a great repugnance to making the effort , she determined to take me with her , hoping I might become restless , and thus give her a nopportunity for returning . If restlessness was my habit , as is by no means unlikely , in the time of warm weather , and protracted services at " meeting , " I was , on this occasion , either awed or entertained , so as to behave extremely well , until the sermon was nearly ended , when she took immediate advantage of my making an attempt to possess myself of her fan to take me home , de // daring she could not have kept herself quiet ten minutes longer . She was engaged to spend Monday with a sister of her cousin , then living at the foot of Washington Street , but when the time arrived , begged to be excused , as feeling wholly unable to go , saying when urged , " I am sure something dreadful is impending , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But her cousin , feeling a friendly anxiety on account of her very unusual state of mind , insisted upon the fulfilment of her promise , fearing that she would become insane if she left her alone , and trusting that going abroad might serve to divert her mind from its strange fancies , which she supposed to result entirely from her living a good deal a lone , which left her too much time to brood over my father 's prolonged absence . Being herself a spinster , she probably did not understand those magnetic sympathies which , in fine natures , always exist where there is a true marriage . It was a lovely June morning ; its atmosphere comes back to me with all its balmy freshness ; so does its midday heat , and its evening shadows ; it is the first day I wholly remember . I did not often take morning walks with my mother in that direction , and I recall the street as it then appeared , so different from what it now is , as I gambolled on before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then running back for a moment , to look up at her wonderingly , because she did not seem to feel as I did . As we passed down what is now Cabot Street , it was just after the eight-o'clock mail had been distributed . A gentleman stood outside an open window , reading something from the newspaper to a person on the inside . As he looked up , and seemed to see us , he walked rapidly away . Mother caught her cousin by the arm , as we approached the house , begging her to return home immediately . " See , " said she , " Mr. - has spoken to his sister , and she is walking across the room to look at me , wondering to see me here ; that 55 paper contains some dreadful news of Henry ! " And it is , to say the least , singular that this was all true . Yet she did not know he had left Naples , and , as to anything she knew , had no occasion for increased anxiety on his account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arriving at the house , begged directly to go to a chamber , where she should see no one but her cousins . Alarmed at her strange manner , Mrs. L- seated her at a pleasant window ; and at last , taking a hint from Miss A- , with a view to divert my mother 's mind , asked her to arrange an infant wardrobe in new drawers for her , at the same time placing a nice little frock upon her lap . She mechanically took it up , and crushing it together in her hands , still sat listlessly gazing on the view of the ocean which the window commanded , with a face so sad and unlike herself , that her cousin left the room in distress , to call in a mutual friend . Presently a knock at the street door aroused my mother , and listening a few moments , she distinctly heard a lady who opened it say , " Do let her alone till evening ! " " No , " was a gentleman 's reply , " the children in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this door . " While they talked my mother descended the stairs , and with a face like marble , laying her hand firmly on Deacon L- 's arm , said in a strange , hollow voice , " Yes , tell me now ; I can bear anything , if you do not say he is dead ! " She was then quietly seated in an adjoining parlor , and very gently told that my father had taken passage in the ship M- , for 5- , with thirty others , on the xoth of April ; that on the 20th of May she had been wrecked in a squall within ten days ' sail of home . That fifteen men - but he was not with them - escaped in the long-boat , had been taken up , and brought to Salem , having no hope that any other return could ever be made from the wreck . I had slipped into the room , and stood close beside my mother ; I did not at all comprehend what had hapMy Father 's Shipwreck . // pened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene and that room , with much of its furniture , and the faces in it , were so engraven on my memory in a few minutes , that though I never entered it again until one year ago , I found a distinct picture of it in my mind with which to compare its altered appearance . My mother uttered not one word , but suffered herself to be dressed and placed in a carriage , and with me seated beside her was driven home . This was about ten o'clock in the morning . S he was placed in an easy-chair in her own chamber , where she sat nearly in one position , uttering no word or moan , nor in an5r way taking notice of the friends who passed in and out or gathered around her , until about three o'clock in the afternoon . In the mean time I suppose I was the charge of no one in particular ; so after dinner I contrived to steal out of doors unobserved , without any sunbonnet , and being soon enticed by some rude children into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mother , racing up and down , at quite a distance from the house , heated and covered with dust . She took me by the hand to lead me back ; but at the door I resolutely refused to enter . Some one went to my mother , and said , " Can not you go and speak to Fanny ? She is making herself sick by running about the street in the hot sun . " She started at that , walked to the entry , and seated herself at the top of a flight of stairs just as some one was bringing me up by force . Being perfectly beside myself with excitement , I struck out with my little hands , hitting my poor mother on the face , and then clung sobbing to her neck . This broke the spell for her ; she clasped me in her arms , and for a time her tears flowed freely . I was then taken in charge by a friend , and she was led back to her seat , where she presently relapsed into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At sunset her minister and very intimate friend , the good J- E- , who had been out of town all day , came in and sat down at her side . Being a man of strong sympathies , now deeply moved , he sat for some time , like the friends of Job , and " spake no word , because he saw that her grief was very great . " Then , as he afterward said , feeling that her condition was becoming dangerous , " he " tried this experiment to arouse her . " Taking her hand , he said in a low , distinct voice : " Sister L- , will you come to the church on Sunday and hear me offer prayer to God for you as a widow , and address the people ? " She instantly startled him and all in the chamber by raising her tearless face and exclaiming , " I have not yet heard that Henry is dead ! " And when one near her whispered , " Poor child she has gone crazy 1 " she added , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him , and he may be taken from some rock in the ocean . " And " at that moment , " as she afterward often said , " my first ray of hope dawned upon me . " I well remember , as night came on , how dreary and sad it seemed to me to be undressed by stranger hands , and told that my mother could not come to me . But I was saddened into obedience then , and made no resistance . Following on this " heavy day " came a month of agony , which made fearful demands upon my dear mother 's physical constitution , naturally a very fine one , and from which , indeed , she never wholly recovered to the end of her life , which closed at sixty - eight years . I have often heard my father say to her , " The wreck macic greater ravages upon your constitution than upon mine , for I think I was made over , and might date my age from iSia . " And it is true , that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid after his return home , no one could enjoy greater freedom from physical ills for more than half a century . This month , passed in cruel alternations of hope and despair , to which my mother perforce abandoned herself , was a very distinct period for // strong impressions upon my infant imagination . I had the daily recreation of being sent to school , which was kept by Ma'am 0- on the other side of our house ; but at home I remember how sad and lonely I was , missing my dear mother 's cheerful words and smiles ; for she said that before this stroke really fell upon her , though wearied and worn with her anxious fears , she always exerted herself to be cheerful with me , and I only saw in her my loving playmate and the tender guardian on whom I leaned for everything . Now I sat alone at my meals , while she paced the room in such a changed and mournful mood that I hardly knew where to turn for comfort at home . She has told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food before me , she turned to her listless , restless pacing up and down , for some time absorbed in her own melancholy musings , when she was at last aroused by a very deep sigh from me , and looking up , found me sitting just as she had left me , my food all untouched , gazing sadly at her . And in reply to her inquiries , I said : " I am hungry , but I do not like to eat so . I went into Emily 's house , " - Emily was a little playmate in the neighborhood , - " and she was eating nice dinner with her mother , and they were laughing as we did . " After that she was regular in sitting at the table and making efforts to eat , but said she could rarely force herself to swallow , such a vivid picture of my father , starving somewhere , would come before her and destroy all power of eating . Had she known his actual state , she said this vision could not have seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never once disrobed herself for ordinary rest in bed , but would continue her restless to-andfro movement , until from sheer exhaustion , sometimes , not until toward morning , she would throw herself upon my bed , and , dressed as she was , fall into uneasy slumbers . During these weeks , not one of her friends supposed there could be the slightest reason to hope my father would 57 ever again be heard from . Yet if any one suggested this to her , it directly produced the effect upon her of Mr. E- 's question , and her imagination would at once present some mode of rescue . And thus , though she still evidently remained in perfect possession of her reason , she afterward knew they all looked to see her suddenly , perhaps hopelessly , deprived of it . My grandmother was very desirous of having us come to her at WBeach , and a friend one day took us there ; but my mother *could not endure the wide views of the ocean which the house commanded , and begged to be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of her term of sorrow , having once thrown herself down , as usual , toward morning for rest , she dreamed that she was standing at a door of my grandmother 's house , from which a wide view of the harbor could be seen ; a heavy shower of rain was falling which suddenly ceased , and , at once , the setting sun lighted up the whole bay . Presently she discovered a plank , with three men upon it , approaching the land ; while she looked it " came ashore , " and the first man who leaped upon the beach was my father . She started to her feet , with a wide-awake assurance that he was safe . And as the light of a summer morning was abroad , though the sun had not arisen , she felt that she must speah of it to somebody . So taking me up in my little night-dress , she at once took my road to school over the attic stairs , and presented herself at " Ma'am 0- 's " bedside , feeling quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , she told her dream , and added , " 0 , I believe he is safe , and I shall surely see him again ! " The face , now beaming with hope , so changed from the expression it wore as she saw it only the evening before , filled " Ma'am 0- " with dismay ; and being so strangely aroused , she scarcely knew how to address her , feeling that now indeed reason had fled ; so , taking her hand soothingly , My Father 's S1izj , *wreck. // she said , " Yes , dear , dreams are sent to bless us , but we must remember they are oniy dreams . " My mother did not suspect what fears she had excited , but feeling that , even here , she had somehow been misunderstood , she slowly and wearily led me , wondering at it all , back to her own room , and felt greater depression than ever from that morning . But the day of relief was drawing nigh . In about a week after this time my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may remember , about nine o'clock in the evening . After the first shock of the arrival was over , it was my grandmother 's first care to endeavor to have my mother and myself brought to them as soon as possible . And forgetting the hour , on a lonely road , my uncle 's wife , with my eldest cousin , then a little girl , ran directly to the house of Captain M- , their nearest neighbor , who yet lived at a considerable distance ; knowing that , as he owned a carriage , he would be only too happy to start immediately on this " errand of mercy . " Nor did they underrate his kindness . As soon as his chaise could be got in readiness , he set off at once , feeling , as he afterwards said , that he " could consider what to do when he arrived , as he went along . " That , besides being wise and benevolent , he was a man of tact , was exhibited on this occasion . I do not remember that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollect his face , voice , and whole deportment on that night . When he arrived it was after all on the street had retired to rest ; and he drove to the house of our sympathizing next-door neighbor , M r.I* , the son-in-law of Ma'am 0- , with whom he was well acquainted . After arousing him and his wife from their slumbers , they decided to go together , having first consulted Ma'am 0 to have my mother gently aroused by her , and gradually prepared for their thrilling intelligence . But unfortunately the door was opened to them by a well-meaning but injudicious woman , who acted in the capacity of a servant in the house ; and while the gentlemen were communicating to one who followed her some of their facts , she rushed over those stairs , and , before Mr. P , who saw what she aimed at , could overtake her , she had seized the latch of my mother 's chamber door , which was locked , and , shaking it violently , shouted , " Miss L- , Miss L , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and well ! " My poor mother had thrown herself face downward across the foot of her bed in a despairing mood a short time before , and thus had fallen into a troubled sleep . Judge , if you can , what a shock this clamor and those words must have produced upon one in her excited condition . She shrieked , and gathering the bed-cover in her hands , drew it tightly over her head , declaring afterward that , if she had heard that sound again , she must have instantly gone distracted . But in a moment the mild voice of Mr. P- was heard , saying in a low , soothing , yet perfectly distinct tone , which fell on her ear " like oil on the troubled waves , " " No , no , dear . If you could presently open your door , here is Captain M who can tell you there is good reason to hope there is some real news of your husband . " This calmed her in an instant , so muck she could bear to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap , she was seated and quietly listening , while Captain M cautiously beginning with the fact that news had arrived of my father , after much suffering , having been taken on board a vessel from a small boat , gradually announced that the vessel was bound to G , and at length , that it had arrived ; that he had been taken to his mother 's house that evening and now , could she prepare herself and me to go to my grandmother 's to meet him there ? She listened like one in a dream , and at last said slowly and mournfully , " Have you seen him ? Are you sure he is living , and can live till I get there ? " He replied , " I have not // 59 myself seen him ; your mother sent to me , and I came for you without any delay ; but I fully believe him to be living , though probably in a very exhausted condition ; he sent for you to come to him . " She then quietly began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly remember sitting perfectly still on a chair , while my mother moved noiselebsly about the hushed room , dimly lighted with only a nurse-lamp , and that strange gentleman sitting there , also perfectly quiet . No wonder the marked countenance and iron-gray hair left an image strongly impressed . And now we go out into the open air , and are carefully placed in the chaise . It was near the middle of a hot night in July , and there was a very clear moonlight . When I wish perfectly to recall the whole of that picturesque road to W- Beach , now so much travelled for its extreme beauty , I can shut my eyes and see every point of it as it was then daguerreotyped upon my brain , on that strange moonlit night , so long , long ago . Not a word was spoken by any one until we came to that remarkable bend in the road , at the top of the hill near M Beach , where the wide and beautiful ocean view bursts so suddenly upon the gaze ; then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in an imploring tone , " 0 Captain M- , do stop here , and turn your horse to carry me home ! This is only a dream ; it must be so ; I can not bear to go on ! " With true tact , he instantly stopped the horse , and quietly settling himself into a posture for discussion , replied , " I do not at all wonder at your doubts ; I myself stopped my horse as I was going to your house , and it was just at this turn of the road too , and asked myself , Am I not dreaming ? Am I not on my way to excite hopes in that poor suffering young wo - man that can not be realized ? ' Then I paused and reflected some time , and finally said to myself , No , I can not be mistaken ; so many persons can not all have been dreaming ; our neighbor and her little niece certainly came to my house at a very late hour for them , and waking my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we called up our son , who harnessed the horse , my wife helping me to get ready ; we could not all have dreamed . ' " Still he saw doubt resting on my mother 's face ; still humoring her mood , he said , " I think we had better go on till we come toward ' Sandy Way , ' where you know we can see your mother 's house at a considerable distance ; if it is lighted up at this hour , we will go on ; if it is all dark , we will return . " To this she consented , though still unbelieving , saying not another word , until turning a corner they came in full view , though still at a distance , of the western end of the dear old homestead , illuminated even to the garret window . " Then , " she afterward said , " I felt assured . " And imagination busied itself , during the remainder of the ride , in picturing " a wasted form , scarcely able to recognize her , bolstered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit alive . " As the chaise drove up the ample green yard to the front door , my father stood at it , extending his arms to his *vife and child . As they received me , my mother fell senseless to the ground , before any one could prevent her fall . In the confusion which ensued I remember nothing more distinctly than a thrill of fear which pervaded me , when I felt myself in my father 's arms ; for a moment , I think I had an undefined feeling that he was not a real man , - perhaps I had heard of ghosts , I can not now tell . I was too young when he left home to remember him as he was then , so he had always been only an idea to me , and of late I suppose strange images of him had presented themselves to my childish fancy . But if dread was really my first association with him , no child could ever have had in after life less occasion to connect that idea with afather . We remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to return to our own home . Even h*re* // crowds of people had come to visit him , - many more than he was able to converse with , especially while recent suffering , which he shrunk from alluding to , was so fresh in his memory . But for weeks after his return , my mother said that , though he carefully avoided all voluntary allusion to the subject during the day , yet at night , as soon as his eyes were closed in sleep , he would startle her with such ejaculations as , " For God 's sake , hail the boat , EIn after life I often heard persons say to him , " How could you ever dare to trust yourself at sea again ? " To which he would reply , " I felt ten times more confidence than ever , after being rescued from such dangers . " And so it was that , in six months after his return , he sailed for the West Indies .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
