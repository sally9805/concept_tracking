ARTICLE VII- THE NATURE AND PROGRESS OF TRUE SOCIALISM . HISTORY has lately been said to move in cycles and epicydes ; its phenomena tend to recur , at intervals , in regular suecession . An anarchic condition may be followed by despotism , that by democracy , and that , again , by anarchy ; yet the second anarchy is not like the first , and when it , in turn , yields to despotism , that also is different from the former despotism . The course of history has been in a circle , but it is a circle whose center is moving . The same phenomena may recur indefinitely ; but at each recurrence the whole course of events will have advanced , and the existing condition will be found to have had its parallel , though not its precise duplicate , in some previous condition . There is nothing permanent in history , and there is nothing new . That which is will pass away , and that which will take its place will be like something that has already existed and passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit ; but , like the earth , it moves in an orbit the center of which is describing a greater orbit . That any particular social condition has existed in the past , and has passed away , is no evidence that it will not return , but is rather an evidence that it will return , though in a different form . That socialism existed in the highly developed village-community of the middle ages , and that it existed in a ruder form in antiquity , is , as far as it goes , an evidence that it may appear again , though in a shape adapted to its new surroundings . The earlier cycles of the historic movement are too distant for tracing , and it is impossible to say how many times it may have appeared and disappeared in prehistoric times ; but the last cycle may be traced with reasonable distinctness . We have been made familiar , of late , with the village-community of medituval times . Beginning at that point , we may trace the economic history of Europe through a series of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aphelion of the system , the extreme // anti-socialistic point , and begin slowly to tend in an opposite direction . I should locate this turning point at a period about a hundred years ago . While Adam Smith was formulating the present system of Political Economy , the world was , in economic matters , at its farthest limit in the direction of individualism , and was about commencing slowly to progress in a socialistic condition . It is necessary to dissociate from the meaning of the term socialism , as Ii intend to use it , the signification of lawlessness and violence which is apt to be attached to it . I do not mean by socialism a certain rampant political thing which calls itself by that name , and whose menacing attitude at present is uniting well meaning men against it . The socialism which destroys property and arms itself to resist law is rather socialistic Jacobinism , or communism of the Parisian type . Political socialism , even when moderate and law-abiding , has no right to the exclusive use of the generic term ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs of which are to be seen in other things than communistic newspapers and Lehr-und IVehr- Vereins . I mean by socialism , not a doctrine , but a practical movement , tending not to abolish the right of property , but to vest the ownership of it in social organizations , rather than in individuals . The organizations may be private corporations , village-communities , cities , states , or nations , provided only that working men be represented in them . The ob , ject of the movement is to secure a distribution of wealth founded on justice , instead of one determined by the actual results of the struggle of competition . Wherever numbers of men unite in the owning of capital , as they already do in the performing of labor , and determine the division of the proceeds by some appeal to a principle of justice , rather than by a general scramble , we have a form of socialism . The word thus signifies a more highly developed condition of social organization . Within the great organism which we term the state , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nearly all our manufactories . These have the marks of high organic development in a minute differentiation of parts ; labor is minutely subdivided in these // establishments . One man grinds in the ax-factory , and , during his brief lifetime , is not , in economic relations , an independent being , but only a part of the grinding organ of an ax-making creature whose separate atoms are men . All the laborers of the factory , taken collectively , compose an organism which acts as a unit in the making of axes . This ax-making body , however , with its human molecules , is acting in a subordinate capacity-it is hired . As a whole it is serving an employer , and it desires to become independent . The same ambition which prompts the apprentice to leave his master and start in business for himself , is now prompting these organizations of employees to desire a similar promotion . Industrial organisms are seeking what individuals have long been encouraged to seek-emancipation . It is the old struggle for personal independence , translated to a higher plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sought are various , and , in so far as the object is realized by any of them , competition is held in abeyance within the organizations , and the division of the product is determined by justice rather than force . Justice is by no means excluded under the present system . What we term competition is , in practice , subject to such moral limitations that it can be so termed only in a qualified sense . Moral force , however , now acts only as a restraining influence ; it fixes certain limits within which competition is encouraged to operate in determining the distribution of property . Socialism proposes to definitely abandon the competitive principle . If completely realized , as we shall see that it can not be , it would give to every man , not whatever he might be able to get by force in the industrial arena , but what , in abstract justice , he ought to receive ; and moral influence would no longer content itself with prescribing rules , however minute , for the economic gladiators , but would bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate arbitration . This is ideal socialism , and any actual tendency toward it is practical socialism . The original force in the movement is moral ; mere diversity of interest does not produce permanent social changes . Such diversity of interest always exists where property is to be distributed ; but the sense of justice overrules discontent if the // July , distribution is equitable . When a company of thieves are dividing their booty , mere diversity of interest would prompt each one to try to seize the whole of it ; but the captain is allowed to divide it into equal shares . The interests of every member of the gang are antagonistic to those of every other ; yet there is no outward conflict . Tn this criminal company the sense of right is sufficiently strong to overrule discontent as long as justice presides over the distribution . Let justice be disregarded , and there will be an uproar . All societies present these phenomena , desires antagonistic , justice as the mediator ; it is when the mediation becomes imperfect that social revolutions occur . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest between employers and employed , there would be no thought of reorganizing society . There is such a conflict ; but there is behind it a sense of injustice in the distribution of wealth . Singularly enough , there is less disposition to question the existence of the injustice than there is to deny the existence of conflicting interests . We are constantly being told that no intelligent conflict between capitalists and laborers is possible ; that their interests are completely identical , and that their normal relation is one of paradisaical harmony . Frequently as this statement is reiterated , the laborers fail to be convinced , and the relation between them and their employers grows , in fact , constantly less paradisaical . There is confusion of thought in prevalent discussions , and the first thing to be done is to analyze the actual relation of capitalists and laborers , and try to remove the confusion . There is harmony of interest between the two classes in the operation of production ; but there is diversity of interest in the operation of distribution . Capitalists and laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , for both are dependent on the product . The mill must be run , or neither owner nor employe can receive anything . When , however , the product is realized , the relation changes ; the question is now one of division . The more there is for the owner , the less can go to the men , and here is a source of conflict . The crew of a whaling ship may work with good will until the cargo is brought into port , and then wrangle over their respec // tive shares . They will not go to the length of burning the ship , for they all . need it for farther use . Certain limits are thus set to the conflict that arises over the division ; but these limits are liable to be broad , and within them the conflict continues . For clearness of illustration a case has been selected in which production and distribution are separated in time ; ordinarily they both go on together , and the relation of employers and employed is , therefore , not an alternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to one in which they antagonize , but presents a permanent harmony in one respect and a permanent antagonism in another . Both parties are interested in continued and successful production ; hut in the mere matter of distribution their antagonism of interest is as permanent as their connection . To ignore either side of the relation is unintelligent . If it be incendiary to proclaim only an irrepressible conflict between capital and labor , it is imbecile to reiterate that there is no possible ground of conflict between them , and that actual contests result from ignorance . While there is no such thing as harmony of interest between participants in any distributing process , there is , fortunately , such a thing as harmony of justice , and if this had been reached or approximated , there would be no need of reforms . It is not merely a sense of unsatisfied want , but a sense of unsatisfied desert , that is prompting men to seek a new mode of distributing wealth . There are two kinds of distribution , there are good things to be divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to be shared during the process . After the voyage is over it is oil-barrels that are to be counted and divided , and each man wants as many as possible ; during the voyage it is toils and dangers that are to be borne collectively , and each man desires to have as few as possible . In each part of the distributive process there are antagonistic interests which can never be removed , and between which justice only can mediate . Socialism proposes to directly invoke such mediation in both parts of the process ; " work according to ability , . and compensation according to need , " is the ideal of Louis Blanc . We know that it is an ideal only , and that society can not reach it ; but we ought to know that society may and does // tend toward it by many different ways , which , taken collectively , are effecting a sure and healthful reorganization of industrial conditions . While , at present , the distribution of the product of industry is a more prominent question than the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialistic condition the reverse would be the case . In a commune the compensation would be the fixed , and the labor the variable element ; and here is the chief difficulty of the system . Justice could probably mediate more easily in the distribution of the product than in that of the labor . If pauperism threatens the present system , laziness would threaten an ideally socialistic one . It would be difficult to make men work when their living should no longer depend on it . The true conception of practical socialism is not that of an ideal scheme , against which this and other objections would be valid , but rather of an actual tendency , showing itself in many specific ways , and working gradually towards an ideal , which unpractical theorists may have grasped and stated , but which would only be put farther out of reach by measures of disorganization and violence . There are socialistic waves on the surface of society ; but beneath them there is an undercurrent flowing calmly and resistlessly in the direction of a truer socialism . Practical socialism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . The concentration of industries in a few great establishments produces evils for which practical socialism in some form is the only permanent remedy . Yet these evils may be temporarily alleviated by measures tending to retard this process of concentration . Two classes of remedies for labor troubles are likely to be in operation together , one class resisting and retarding the inevitable growth of centralization , and the other accepting centralization , and rather facili. tating it than otherwise , but endeavoring to remove the evils which it occasions . Only the latter are socialistic measures ; yet the former need to be considered , not only because they attack similar evils , but because they serve to gain time for the testirig of socialistic measures . Haste is the worst enemy of social reform , and whatever gains time for its earlier steps is , therefore , its truest ally . // Of these non-socialistic measures the most important is the prudential and legal restraining of population , advocated by Malthus . So much has been said on this subject that farther discussion is uncalled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure . In one way it retards centralization ; in another it improves the condition of laborers when centralization has taken place . It will become doubly important as the socialistic tendency proceeds ; the absence of such restraints would be fatal to a definitely communistic scheme . Emigration is next in importance . The great West , as long as it lasts , is the hope of the world , the refuge from economic , as well as from political oppression . Land properly subdivided secures a union of capital and labor , and vests them both in an individual ; the diffusion of population tends to individualism . As long as such diffusion is practicable it is preferable to socialism . Small farmers are the best material ever created for the making of orderly and prosperous states . Self-reliant and inseparably committed to the preservation of order , they are the natural enemy of the social agitator-provided , always , they are not too much in debt . Small merchants and artizans are apt to be associated with small farmers , and are next to them in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor , come in the same category . These are the elements of the ideal New England village , as it existed a hundred years ago , but as it exists no longer in that locality , though its counterpart may be found , in less perfection , at the West . Such a community is the culmination of the principle of individual . ism , and exhibits its very best results . Long may such communities continue , and far distant be the day when they shall have everyv*here yielded to manufacturing and mercantile towns , with their dense population , their poverty , ignorance , and not unnatural discontent . Yet the prospect of such a transformation hangs now like a threatening shadow over the land . Population can not scatter itself forever . The world is beginning to seem small ; emigration from the east and that from the west already meet . The days of diffusion are limited , and those of concentration are at hand . The present situation has thus its element of discouragement as well as of encouragement ; discouraging is the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of removing the evils which that process entails by measures , in a broad sense , socialistics , and of retarding , by other measures , the centralizing process itself . To the broad view the prospect is , on the whole , exceedingly hopeful ; but it takes a correct and comprehensive view of the nature of true socialism to make it appear so . The prospect of delaying the concentration of industries is the better from the fact that that process is partly owing to causes within our control ; we have hastened it by our own acts . If it be an object to keep our rural communities as long as possible , an effective means of doing so would be to stop making laws , the effect of which is to break them up . Protective tariffs favor manufactures at the expense of agriculture , and therefore hasten centralization . A law of this kind may properly be called " An act to hasten the depopulation of rural villages , to encourage poverty and ignorance , to facilitate the extension of revolutionary ideas , to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moderate free trade policy would have a great many effects not to be discussed here ; but one of them would be to prolong the . duration of the best forms of individualism . Such measures , at best , only postpone the great question ; they do not settle it , and nothing can settle it except what I have termed , in a broad sense , true socialism . Unknown to social theorists , the way for true socialism has been preparing for a hundred years , and a consideration of these preliminary steps helps to give the true conception of it , as a general development , directed by the Providence which presides over all history . Among these preliminary changes is the growth of business corporations . These institutions are not beloved by working men , since they are aggregations of capital , but little of which is owned by employees . They mean , to the laborer , an employer without a soul , instead of an employer with one , and they sometimes grind the laborers as few individuals would grind them . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative institution , and has been its necessary forerunner . It has developed the plan of organization on which coLperative societies may succeed . A slight change in // the existing company would make it a co*iiperative society in complete running order , with its business established and its success assured . Certain foreign experiments in railway man - agement show that the soul need not be entirely wanting in an ordinary corporation , when it is not wanting in its managers ; in its present form it may have a rudimentary soul , the presence of which makes a vast difference in the welfare of its laborers . When the corporation shall fairly pass the point in its development where it acquires a fully grown corporate soul , it will become a coöperative society , a beneficent form of true socialism . Federative governments have paved the way for whatever of political socialism is hopeful and legitimate . The village commune of the middle ages existed at a time when the city or village , and not the individual citizen , was the political unit in the general government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ; and the town , as a whole , was a sabject of the king . With the breaking down of city walls and of civic isolation , the citizen became a member of a general society . When the town ceased to be the political unit , it ceased , at the same time , to be the economic unit ; it no longer held its lands in common . The partial revival of the federative principle in politics has made it easier to partially restore the socialistic principle in economic matters . There are now cities , states , and nations , each of which acts as an organic unit in many political relations , and the chance of their acting as an organic unit in industry is greatly increased . Enterprises that would be impracticable for a nation may be possible for a state or a city . We have now to consider institutions that are definitely socialistic . Of these , cooperative societies are first in order , and , thanks to recent experiments and discussions , may be spoken of as something better than visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished facts . These circumstances are probably not realized , as yet , over the greater part of this country . The Rochdale association owes its success to conditions not all of which can be found in any part of America . There was a large homogeneous population of manufacturing employees , well organized , and imbued with // the teachings of Owen . There was an absence of retail shops that were either good or cheap . There was a universal prevalence of the credit system among dealers ; and there was an absence , among them , of that sharp competitive spirit which , in this country , leads merchants to strive to outdo each other in reducing prices to a minimum . The association , therefore , had exceptionally good material in its members and its managers , and had an unusual field for securing custom by the virtual reduction of prices which it was able to offer to its patrons . The absence of these advantages , at present , in this country proves , not that coperation has no legitimate home here , but rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure should not be drawn from past failures . These failures are accounted for , and their causes are not permanent . The requisite conditions are likely to be realized in the future , and with them will come a higher degree of success for the new principle than we have seen here as yet That success is to be regarded as assured already , on better evidence than the result of any particular experiment , namely , the general course of events , of which such an experiment is one of many indications , an eddy , that tells the direction of the undercurrent . The Rochdale store has been called an experiment in " coöperative distribution , " in distinction from manufacturing enterprises , which have been classed as " cooperative production ; " an unscientific use of terms , since mercantile industry is productive , like any other . This store represents a peculiar kind of coöperative production . Mr. Mill has pointed out that it is not completely co*ziperative , in that the managers , clerks , porters , &amp;c , are not paid by shares in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such shares would make the experiment complete . Yet these employees are few in number in proportion to the shareholders and customers , who are the real parties in the experiment . Codperative stores organized by working men in manufacturing villages are of the nature of mixed codperation . The essential particularity about them is that men who are employees in one industry become proprietors in another . There is a union of capital and labor in the same hands , but not in the same industry ; while the labor of the men is engaged in one enterprise , they accumulate capital and employ // it in another . While , therefore , such experiments may greatly benefit the working men , they can not remove the cause of conflict between them and their employers in their own original industry . The store may help the mill operatives to cheap goods , but their relation to the owner of the mill remains unaltered . The same is true of all experiments in mixed co*3peration ; they are beneficent undertakings , but do not remove the root of the evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which laborers do not own capital , but are paid by a share of profits , instead of by wages . Mr. Mill 's illustrations of this system , taken from the workshops of Paris , are sufficiently familiar ; but an illustration nearer at hand and brilliantly successful is offered by the New Bedford whale fishery . The crews of whaling vessels were regularly paid by a share of the cargo , and the hearty good will which they showed , in a kind of work in which superintendence by the owner was impossible , proves the efficiency of this measure in intensifying the harmony of interest and of feeling which should exist between employers and employed , as far as production is concerned . This plan does not , in theory , remove the conflict of interest which exists in reference to distribution ; it is still possible to wrangle over the size of the shares . The seamen who received each a two-hundredth part of the cargo might strike for the one-hundred-and-fiftieth . Strikes did not , in fact , occur , because custom had determined what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all submitted to such arbitration . The share system , if generally introduced , would work to the advantage of the laboring class in times of prosperity , and to their disadvantage in times of depression . Under unsettled conditions neither employers nor employed are likely to favor the plan ; the employers , because they do not wish to sacrifice the chance of becoming rapidly rich in prosperous periods ; and the workmen , becanse they do not wish to run the risk of receiving less than they now do in times of adversity . Under settled conditions the plan might be expected to work to the advantage of both parties . A minimum would doubtless be determined upon below which the shares of the laborers should // not be allowed to fall . With the general prevalence of more settled conditions in industry the adoptioi* of the share system becomes more probable . Co*iperation is complete only when laborers own the capital which is employed in the industry in which they are engaged . Here the conflict of interest between capital and labor is reduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distribution of the product . This most desirable form of cooperation is the most difficult . In a small way it is in operation where a number of partners in a shop do all the work . Where small industries prevail , however , there is little need of coöperative experiments . In the departments of transportation and of manufactures concentration is most rapid and most merciless to the laborer , and while the evils of railroad monopolies are more likely to be remedied by state action , those arising from overgrown manufacturing enterprises call urgently for private coöperation . The difficulties are in proportion to the desirability of the end , arising from the amount and character of the capital required , the complicated nature of the process , and the fierce competition to be sustained . These difficulties account for past failures in this direction , and deprive them of their weight as arguments against the ultimate prevalence of the system . Difficulties will be surmounted , if the principle of the system is right and is in the general line of economic progress . Complete codperation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for this mode of living is less urgent in this department of industry than in others ; but success is easier , and in the chief experiment of the kind , a religious motive has supplemented the economic . The Shakers , the Amana communists , the Perfectionists and others have been united by other than economic bonds , and the success of their experiments is not only nor chiefly in proving that agri. cultural socialism is possible , but in showing that this mode of living is favorable , as it seems to have been in Jerusalem of old , to religious brotherhood among men . Indeed the bit of communistic history furnished by the book of Acts appears to have , as one object at least , to refute the arguments of those who claim that socialism is not merely impracticable , but ulti // mately and forever undesirable , and who can see only evil in the successive steps of society in that direction . The early Christian commune was a success religiously , if not otherwise ; and if modern communes can be made successful economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they also ally themselves with the spirit of religious fraternity , then their growth will be as sure , though possibly as slow , as the growth of the fraternal spirit among men . Public industry is the most general form of socialism , and it is here that its political battles are to be fought . Political socialism demands that the government shall own the capital of the country , and that the proceeds of its use shall be divided according to principles of abstract justice . There is no harm in this as an ideal , but there is ruin in it as an immediate practical aim . It is not only best that we should tend toward this ideal , but it is inevitable that we should do so ; yet it is insane to try to reach it at once . Here is the dividing line between the false political socialism and the true ; the one sees an ideal , and would force humanity to it through blood and fire ; the other sees the ideal , and reverently studies and follows the course by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the social philosopher is , therefore , that of recognizing the general direction which social development is taking , but avoiding that mental confusion which mistakes the socialistic ideal for an object of immediate practical effort . The most intelligent socialist will be the most zealous opponent of what commonly terms itself socialism . Facts sustain this inference ; the German government , in its practical workings , is strongly socialistic ; and yet it suppresses pronounced socialism by arbitrary methods ; and there is no inconsistency in this . That Germany , by regular means , is becoming markedly socialistic , is a reason for resisting attempts to precipitate , and thus completely thwart the beneficial movement . Were theoretical socialism to be inaugurated in practice , practical socialism would be put backward a hundred years . German governments own railroads , telegraph lines , forests , and mines ; they conduct manufactures , maintain parcel posts , and do much of the banking business of the country . The // functions of government the world over are increasing with all reasonable rapidity . While , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to precipitate its visionary schemes , intelligent socialism will uphold it and await the general growth of the movement with such contentment as it may . The increase of the economic functions of the government is regarded , in this country , with apprehension , not so much because it is in itself undesirable , as on account of the practical difficulties to be surmounted before it can be safely accomplished . Given an untrustworthy government , and the less you commit to it the better , is a summary of the prevalent argument . It is not singular that immigrants from a country where the government , if oppressive , is honest and efficient , should be less conscious of the practical difficulties , and more impatient to secure the result in view , and that , from such material , a pronounced socialistic party should be organized . if the condition of our civil service is unfavorable to the adoption of the measures of political socialism , the federative character of our government is favorable to it . Cities , states , and the nation as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in the aggregate , equal those of the 0-erinan government . We are crowded in this direction by a powerful vis a tergo , the increasing abuses of economic centralization , and it is only a question of time when the abuses of overgrown corporations controlling legislatures and making or marring the prosperity of cities and even states , at their sovereign pleasure , shall more than counterbalance the abuses which would arise from their assumption and management by the state . One socialistic measure has attracted little attention in proportion to its importance , namely , prison industry . The employment of prisoners in industries conducted directly by the state government itself , is , perhaps , the most practicable and the most unquestionably beneficial of any of the measures of this nature . The socialistic ideal is realized in a great prison conducted in this manner ; there is " labor applied to public resources , " and there is strict equity in the division of the profits . In such institutions all the profits , and more , go to // the laborers . The system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers , neutralizes the benefits to be derived from this legitimate form of socialism , and is contrary alike to the principles of Political Economy and to those of morality . Public work-houses for tramps would be an extension of the system , and would have the incalculable advantage of dissociating the tramp question from the general labor question . Such a measure ought to be highly satisfactory to most of the parties concerned ; to the government , because its burden of watchfulness would be lessened ; to the citizen , because he would be made more secure ; and to the well meaning political socialist , because his party would be well rid of its most dangerous element . It would probably not be equally satisfactory to the reckless and criminal hangers-on in the socialist party ; though , in consistency , it ought to be so , since it might have the effect of placing them in a commune under government auspices , the operation of which would be more regular and successful than that of any which they could hope of themselves to establish . The proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared political socialists ; if well meaning they would advocate it ; if desirous of confusion and plunder , they would oppose it . If breadth of view is necessary anywhere , it is so in discussing the general socialistic tendency of modern life . No limiting of the vision to particular phases of the question is to be adriiitted . A narrow view sees the menacing attitude of socialistic Jacobinism , and steels itself to resist anything that calls itself by the dangerous name ; a broader view will distinguish true socialism from false , and see that the best protection against the false is the natural progress of the true . Present institutions contain in themselves the germs of a progress that shall ultimately break the limitations of the existing system , and give us the only socialism that can be permanent or beneficial . In many ways capital is vesting itself in social organizations , instead of in individuals . Labor is organizing itself , private codperation is increasing , and governments of every kind are assuming new economic functions . The true socialism is progressing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to enact sufficient laws for the suppression of the false . Socialism , in the broad sense , meets an imperative human want , and must grow surely , though not , as reformers are wont to estimate progress , rapidly . The prime condition of success in its growth is slowness ; haste means all manner of violence and wrong . Only step by step can we hope to approach the social ideal which is beginning to reveal itself ; impatience would place us farther away than ever . The condition of permanence in socialistic changes is mental and moral progress . The permanence of republics has long been known to depend on these conditions ; they are shortlived where the people are ignorant or bad . True socialism is economic republicanism , and it can come no sooner , stay no longer , and rise , in quality , no higher than intelligence and virtue among the people . The beauty of the socialistic ideal is enough to captivate the intellect that fairly grasps it . lit bursts on the view like an Italian landscape from the summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous declivity . Individualism appears to say , " Here is the world ; take , every one , what you can get of it . Not too violently , not altogether unjustly , but , with this limitation , selfishly , let every man make his possessions as large as he may . For the strong there is much , and for his children more ; for the weak there is little , and for his children less . " True socialism appears to say , " Here is the world ; take it as a family domain under a common father 's direction . Enjoy it as children , each according to his needs ; labor as brethren , each according to his strength . Let justice supplant might in : the distribution , so that , when there is abundance , all may participate , and when there is scarcity , all may share in the self . denial . If there is loss of independence , there will be gain of interdependence ; he who thinks less for himself will think more for his brother . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle of competition , there is gain of moral power , acquired by the interchange of kindly offices . The beautiful bond which scientists call altruism , but which the Bible terms by a better name , will bind the human family together as no other tie can bind them . // 581 Sufferers under an actual system naturally look for deliverance and for a deliverer . The impression has prevailed among working men that a new device of some kind might free them from their difficulties . Ideal socialism seems to meet this expectation , and those who preach it as an immediate practical aim naturally receive a hearing . The way in which the old system is defended is often as repulsive as the new teaching is attractive . When one teacher bids the poor submit , and another bids them hope , they will not be long in choosing between them . Yet there is no royal road to general comfort . There is much to be gained by reverently studying the course of Providence , but comparatively little by inventing new schemes of society . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no particular apostles . The socialistic ideal itself is valuable , not when it is used to incite men to frantic attempts to reach it , but when , by giving definiteness to their intelligent hopes , it is made to lighten the moderate steps by which only they can expect to approach it .
