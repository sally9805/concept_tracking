txt Later particulars of the frightful railroad disaster near Ashtabula , Ohio , do not greatly mitigate the terrors of that calamity , as first reported . There is still some uncertainty as to the exact number of the killed . It is not likely , indeed , that the death-roll will ever be complete . Many of the dead were not only burned past all possible , recognition , but the bodies of some were so nearly consumed that it would be difficult to tell whether the poor remains reproseuted one person or fragments of several . It is likely that some of those hurled from the bridge and drowned in the stream , were swept away by the icy current , and will never be recovered . The world is full of people who , dying and making no sign , may leave none to moan over their absence and inquire what has become of thew . Some such may have been on that fatal train . We have no later data from which the exact number of persona on the train can be ascertained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original estimate made by those iu charge of the train . The conductor says that about one hundred and sixty passengers left Buffalo with him , and that about thirty left at various stations . If forty-nine escaped and all the rest perished , there would be a loss of life of about seventy-five . Possibly , as investigations are pushed , the estimate of the number on the train at the time of the wreck may be still further changed . The conductor 's calculation would seem more likely to be nearer the truth than that of any passenger who had not specially noted the occupants of the train . But some of the passengers insist that there were nearly 200 on the train . The disaster had all the elements of a most horrible tragedy . The night was cold and stormy , the snow blowing furiously as the fated carriages struggled on to the bridge . The continuity of the train was not broken , but , as the net-work of the iron span gave way , everything upon it , save au extra locomotive ai the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fire that succeeded , and the icy stream in which some were entrapped by the crushed ice , were the means by which so many were cut off . It was a frightful spectacle , at which we do not look , even in imagination , without a thrill of horror . It has tilled many homes with lamentation , and left many persons maimed for life . It was a swifter destruction thin that which came upon the lost in the Brooklyn fire . The train fell like a bolt . Tile agony of some was prolonged . But the most part died suddenly . It was a mercy that they were spared the lingering Buffering of a few . The attention of everybody will be directed to conjecturing the cause of this shocking slaughter . It is idle to say that railroad traveling is attended with a certain percentage of risk and that the average of ' casualties is made up somehow . Ia this particular case , nom was a fault in the bridge which fell ; if this were not true , the bridge would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such lamentable disaster to chronicle . To be sure , the bridge had stood the test of heavy trains for eleven years ; but there must , sooner or later , come a strain which will bring down a structure which has its weak point . It came to_the the Ashtabula bridge last Friday night . The storm ? of snow had nothing directly to do with the disaster , except to add its terror . Even the cold , which was intense , should not have hastened the catastrophe . There have been colder nights during these eleven Winters past , and the bridge has stood through them . But the weak place , wherever it was , may have been made weaker by the low temperature ; and the work , with its imperfection wide . teeted , was ready to fall when frost had contracted the iron , and a heavy train had rolled upon it . Moll build bridges for absolute safety ; for years , after a due trial , they seem absolutely safe . Then vigilance relaxes . Millions of passengers go and come without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal touch . It is tottering to its fall . If the Ashtabula bridge had been a new one , there would bo less difficulty io reaching the exact cause of its destruction . As it there is asyet no explanation of the disaster to which both the managers of the road and the public will assent . It is natural for the former to plead that the disaster was unavoidable ; and the public is equally certain to sad that it was the inevitable result of crimieal and gross carelessness . There are reports , more or less vague , of the bridge being considered unsafe . Certainly it de , ? s seem as if a work of this sort , constructed to insure the safe passage of c.suntless passengers , might have been so built that a frequent and careful examination would shaw its weak spot , if it had any . It is probable that this was the case with the Ashtabula bridge , Whatever may come of the frost theory , or the theory of a car thrown from the track , in this particular ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been averted if the bridge bad been more vigilantly examined .
