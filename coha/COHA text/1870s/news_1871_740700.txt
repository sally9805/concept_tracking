txt The plea put forth in FOSTER 'S name is now asserted by himself and . his counsel to have been written by a reporter  --  one of Mayornim 's model " journalists " ? and . published . without their knowledge or consent , and indeed against their express wishes . It was taking a dastardly advantage of a man in Fosisn 's situation to give this additional prejudice to an already desperate case , for the sake of a paltry newspaper sensation ? but Mayor HAT Vs journalists are not particular to a shade . What we said , however , in reference to the appeal , under the supposition that it was genuine , holds equally good . now that it is shown to be the work of the Mayor 's hacks . And , however censurable the appeal may have been in its design and execution , it has-at least been productive of this much good , that it has drawn forth an almost unanimous expression of public opinion on the crime of drunkenness . How rapidly that vice is increasing in our City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the daily papers needs to be told . With a large part of the population , it has become a settled practice to devote all their holiday hours , to a prolonged . debauch . These festivities seldom end without bloodshed . Of the deeds of rum-inspired ruffians , which regularly dishonor our days of prayer and feastmg alike , our news columns and the Police reports probably reveal only a moiety . But this imperfect record has attained a startling magnitude . Last Monday morning we printed a list of a score of deadly assaults occurring on the previous day , nearly all of which were directly traceable to drunkenness . To discourage drunkenness , then , is to take the most effectual step for the prevention of crime . But how to do this without too great an infringement on the right of personal liberty is a rather delicate problem . We have never been advocates of the prohibitory system , which only intensifies the natural appetites by the natural resistance to arbitrary control . To say that it is not the use , but the abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to repeat a truism as old as Genesis . Unhappily , with many the use almost inevitably entails the abuse ; and for these persons it seems as if nothing short of entire abstinence would be effectual . Yet , if they refuse to apply this remedy , how are they to be constrained The law , which generalizes only , can scarcely legislate against excess without infringing on-the privileges of temperance ; and . moral suasion , reinforced with all the aid . of striking examples , from Father MATHEW to Joins B. GOUGH , has still left something to be desired . It has been suggested , and the suggestion has had . our hearty approval , that the laws for the punishment of drunkenness ought to be enforced . But here , again , there is difficulty . For the law contemplates drunkenness as a punishable offence , only in so far as it is a breach of public order , or an encroachment on the rights of others . The drunkard , like FOSTER , whose condition is betrayed in no weakness of speech or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . the law can not meddle with him until his brutal desires have found . a victim . The maudlin , reeling bacchanalian , who makes night hideous with his howling , is usually ranch the less dangerous man of the two . Again , liquor affects different temperaments very differently . A single glass makes one man tipsy , while a dozen would leave another perfectly sober to all outward seeming . Here , too , injustice would be worked by a rigid application of the statute . In some village Utopia , in one of our Western States , people have thought to devise a remedy by making the dramseller liable for any violation of law committed by his customer . That vicarious responsibility , it is to be feared , would hardly prove acceptable to our political majority . In the meantime , there are measures which can be taken with profit , and which we have urged before . Instead of accepting drunkenness as an extenuation , let it be regarded as an aggravation of any other offense . Ignorance of the law excuses no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead . ignorance of his own physical vices . Let it be taken for granted that the drunken homicide knew beforehand that liquor might convert him into a brutal murderer , and let him be punished accordingly .
