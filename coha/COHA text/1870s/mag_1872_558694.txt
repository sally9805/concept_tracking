Cambridge : Deighton , Bell , &amp; Co . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ewald has now been carried far enough to give us confidence that it will be completed with the thorough excellence that marked its beginning . We are glad that the general reader who can not read German has the means of becoming a learner under the highest Biblical authority , and that the average theological student // Oct. has lost his main excuse for neglecting to study the Old Testament . It is unfortunate that we have had to go so long without a thorough history of the people of Israel . Dean Milman confessed the inadequacy of his serviceable but brief work , and the absurdly pretentious volume of Isaac M. Wise has found its proper obscurity . Dean Stanley 's rhetorical lectures , inspired rather by an appreciation of the historic present than the historic past , may have served the turn of affairs in the Established Church of England ; but , notwithstanding the fact that their author follows Ewald , they take halting steps in historical science , and are now valuable chiefly as milk for those who can not digest the meat of Ewald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wrote - " We have now in the broad light of day to complete ( what the best Fathers of the Church began ) a philosophic history , the certainty and truth of which shall ultimately attract all alike , Jews and Mohammedans as well as Christians , scholars as well as soldiers and kings . " ( Trans. , Vol. 1 . p. 203 . ) This task has been fulfilled for some years ; but most readers have been confined to such brief and dry abridgments of his theory of the seven narrators of the Pentateuch and Joshua as are to be found in Bible dictionaries , to such mildly tempered modifications of his treatment of the course of the more established history since Abraham as are furnished by Dean Stanley 's lectures , and to the curiously wooden translation , by Mr. Glover , of the fifth volume , containing the life of Christ . Now that Mr. Carpenter has added , with equally distinguished success , two more volumes to the two that Mr. Martineau edited for a thirsty and grateful public , their readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep of Ewald 's history . Ewald deserves a title which he gives to some of the Biblical writers ; he is a prophetic histor&amp;n . Not without the prophet 's faults of temper and a habit of absolute dogmatism about uncertainties , he yet ranks among the highest historians for accuracy and thoroughness of detail , with breadth and firmness of grasp . While he adds also to his special power of historical appreciation , remarkable minuteness of philological learning , and a grammarian 's system , he yet possesses an insight into the character of individuals and of nations , a deep moral judgment , a lofty religious sentiment , and an imaginative power , which are truly prophetic . Indeed we want a prophet to write the history of prophets .. And we have waited a great while for an Ewald . To be a prophet in these days of science and free international criticism requires all that was needed in Judtea of religious genius , spiritual knowledge , experience in character , and faith in God ; and besides this an intellectual genius yet higher , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual knowledge more varied , since the Gentiles have become listeners ; experience in character more delicate , as both saints and sinners are gentler ; and a faith which has not feared to be hospitable to speculative doubts in the many mansions of the Maker of sceptics and their fathers the dogmatists . To be also an historian , whose authority about the doings of time shall equal his testimony to eternal principles , the prophet must have all the learning of his age about his special science , and must know well its relations to all knowledge . We are not so much in the habit of praising men as to fear that our admiration of Ewald shall be deemed excessive if we can induce the sceptical to read his work . The stand-point from which Ewald proceeds to form his view of the Biblical records is free and unbiassed . He has not even the bias of learning which hampers what he contemptuously calls the Latin-andGreek scholars . Since he is also an Orientalist , he does not treat us to the familiar tune of three strings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks , and the religion of the Jews ,  --  a melody , alas , to which too many of us are confined ! While he finds the steady development of the true religion in Israel , he knows whence the Hebrews came , and his accounts of the antecedents of the word " Elohim , " which finally came to mean the one God , and of the various points of contact between the religion of Jahveh and the ethnic religions are very fair and clear . Although a profound believer in the inspiration of men , he does not hesitate - indeed , he does not think of hesitating - to make it plain that he does not believe that the Spirit of God has ever been harnessed with manuscripts . " On whatever stage , " he says , " Hebrew tradition thus introduces the Deity acting and incarnating itself in history , it undoubtedly is always mythic on those occasions , taking that word in its largest acceptation ; and it is of no use to deny that in this it approaches the style and nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread of false , or even too gross , views of the Deity , as well as of dangerous confusion of the divine and human , and - even where it makes these attempts to introduce the immediate agency of the Deity - inspires it with that beautiful considerateness and reserve which are perhaps nowhere so necessary as here . As it thus preserves the true dignity of the Divinity through all these perilous attempts , its choicest productions may serve us as a model , and afford a standard to determine how far a pure religion may venture to make sensuous representations of the Deity . And because the Greek term myth is inseparably connected with the whole system of heathenism , and means not story about God , but story about the gods , therefore we avoid it in Biblical subjects , and rather speak , when we must , of sacred , or , better , of divine tradition . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. pp. 40,41. ) // Oct. views for his own sake , or for the sake of the truth , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his readers , Ewald adds here and there a paragraph adapted to reassure those who are quick to be startled at broad investigations of the human element of religious history , and to restore a healthy positive tone to such critics as are prone to nothing but " sad doubts " so soon as they have made the amazing discovery that their school text-books and their Bibles are not infallible . " We can not doubt , however , " he says , " how to treat the tradition of the Old Testament in our investigations of history . When an account is called tradition , the name does not determine from what sources the story may be derived , nor what foandation it may have . Historical research is to supply this deficiency . Tradition has its roots in actual facts ; yet it is not absolutely history , but has a *ecnliar character and a value of its own . Hebrew tradition possesses all the charms that belong to that of the other aspiring nations of antiquity , and , in addition , the altogether peculiar excellence of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay , of even having become in part the vehicle for its great truths . We mast acknowledge and appreciate this excellence in itself , but we can not use it for strict history without investigating its historical significance . It is absurd entirely to neglect its use for historical purposes , and to consider the duty of science to be to express sad doubts of its truth ; thereby depriving ourselves out of mere folly of the most comprehensice means *f searching out a great portion of history . It is rather our duty to ta/ce tradition just as it expects to be taken , - to use it only as a means for discovering whet the real facts once were . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 44. ) having started thus freely , rationally , conscientiously , and reverently , the peculiarity of Ewald 's treatment of the general course of the history is that he has no pet dogmas to enforce , and no particularly hated dogmas to deny . He is absorbed in the facts which he can clearly discern , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not approach , and in the uncertain yet indispensable traces of facts which were something , and which he must know negatively , if not positively , in order to satisfy his eager interest and to be perfectly true to his subject . He has really read and thought himself into the Old Testament times . As he goes along hot with the sweat of Egypt , and reeking with the blood of Canaan , he now and then , with Moses and the prophets , gets away on a mountain or into the wilderness and reflects and generalizes upon the meaning of the swarm of facts about him . But his generalizations , while treating of God , are religious rather than theological , while treating of Church and State are wise rather than technically philosophic . Ewald seems to feel that the time has not yet come in our knowledge for a fusion of the philosophical , scientific , and historical departments . Here we see how the historical element steadies and modifies the prophetic element of his genius . As an historian // he minds his own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet his spiritual elevation saves him from what we have always regarded as a vulgarity in Gibbon , - the way of being too knowing , and of lording it over the masses of the past with a pen . Ewald writes of the men of history as he talks with men now . He looks down , not upon , but to , the common people , he looks up to his superiors , and he looks into the eyes of his equals in the Old Testament , not as if he were in his study , in a Christian church , or in a lecture-room , not seeming to look backward , but standing in the past and looking forward with the leaders , or looking at everything in general or at nothing in particular , with the common Hebrews as they spent their ordinary days and went through extraordinary crises without expecting to be analyzed , summed up , classified , and indexed by ready writers for libraries , or even to have their family names pronounced with veneration by the congregations in churches dedicated to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief account of some of the chief parts of Ewald 's work as nearly in the translated words of the author as shall be consistent with ii clear and continuous review ; for there can be no better introduction for an authority destined to have so great an influence than a careful selection of passages which show of themselv&amp;s the character of the work to which they belong . Ewald supposes that Israel knew and used the art of writing in Egypt before Moses , and in the remains of the earliest writings he finds a reaction against the unrestrained form of tradition in respect to definite form and fixed limits : - " It is probable that the cognate nations possessed not only the art of writing , but an historical literature also before Israel did ..... The more surely , therefore , might historical composition in Israel - even if certain crude attempts at it had not been made before - have been rapidly developed after the great days of Moses and Joshua ; and it is incontrovertible that after Moses a Hebrew historiography of momentous import could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and what phases it passed through in the course of centuries , is in the main only to be gathered from an investigation of the documents themseh*es . For the accurate appreciation of this portion of Hebrew literature shows , indeed , that its history is most closely connected with that of the general development of the nation , and that the image of the progress of all national efforts and conditions is clearly reflected in the special product of its mind . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. pp. 52 , 53 . ) " But the height of the support and treatment in consequence of which Hebrew historiography stands so alone in antiquity , and serves for us , too , as a perpetual model , remained the sole highest point which it both strove after and attained . This forms at once its genuine glory and its immortal meaning , which one should never ignore ; but as it lays claim to no more , it would be // folly to bestow upon it any other . That it sought out and faithfully used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consequence of its universal tendency to plain truth and Divine earnestness ; but to what may be called , in a stritt sense , erudition , it never raised itself " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 55 . ) With regard to the anonymous character of the historical books : - " It is a matter of very little importance , indeed , when looked at from the simplest point of view , who is the first to write down a well-known story or tradition The case is quite different with the prophets ; their name , nay , their life , must at once guarantee their word . Hence there is no portion of the Bible in which the names of the authors have , on the whole , been so faithfully preserved . " But " as soon as ever it becomes very difficult to search out the whole historical truth , and there is a deeper appreciation of that difficulty , then individuals must devote themselves specially to that investigation , and the historical view which thus proceeds from a person who has examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of his name We may , in this respect , affirm that the nonnamelessness of the historian is the beginning of historical science . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. pp. 56 , 57 . ) " But here we arrive at one of the most memorable phenomena of the entire ancient Hebrew literature , which extends far beyond the range of the historical books , and hitherto has been but little regarded . In order to appreciate it in a manner proportioned to its importance , we must think ourselves back into the times when there was a great mass of scattered anonymous writings on the same subject in circulation , and when it was no easy task even to bring them together , and still less so to collect them properly Tolerably early the skilful compounding of many such works into one new one must have been raised into a special art ; for , in fact , there needed not simply the will , but also considerable ability and dexterity to effect such a compilation ; skilfully to work over materials , to weigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omissions and some connecting or explanatory additions , to blend the whole as far as possible , and to build up a new whole , whose origination from previous documents only a practised eye can discover . But this special art book-compounding must have been much practised in the nation of Israel as early as the tenth century , n. c . . . . . It is certain , on closer investigation , that not merely the Pentateuch or Genesis , but almost the whole of the historical books , are traceable to distinct and still recognizable sources , though in most the combination has be en so cleverly executed that one frequently experiences a difficulty in recognizing the rivetings . Moreover , this art is exhibited in the first three Gospels and the Acts . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. pp. 59 , 60 . ) " The historical works contained in the Old Testament , which must be the chief sources of this history , are divided , both as to their character and their external order and arrangement , into three parts : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity of the nation , or the period down to the time of the Judges ; namely , the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua ; which , however , properly only form one work , and which ( if we wished to // give them a collective name ) might be called the Great Book of Origins , or of the Primitive History . 2 . The books which describe the time of the Judges and Kings , down to the final destruction of Jerusalem namely , the Book of Judges and the four Books of Kings ( i. e. the two of Samuel and the two of Kings ) , to which we must add the Book of Ruth , which accidentally has received a place in the Hebrew Bible among the Hagiographa ; all these likewise , on their last redaction , only formed one work , which might be appropriately called the Great Book of Kings . Each of these two great works , therefore , not only embraces a separate province , but , by a surprising coincidence , at the same time comprises one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation is divided by intrinsic character and all critical investigation brings us to the conclusion that neither of them , in the state in which we find them , is a single work in the strict sense , but is to be regarded as a book in which a number of kindred accounts and representations of the same period have gathered round one central work , or rather , have attached themselves to it as closely as possible , just as , in the Psalter and Proverbs , a quantity of kindred matter has gradually gathered round the nucleus furnished by David 's songs and Solomon 's proverbs . To these are to be added : 3 . Those much later works which are placed together in the Hagiographa , namely , the Great Book of Universal History down to the Greek Times ( the Chronicles with the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah ) , and the little Book of Esther . These are the three strata of historical books in the Old Testament , which moreover were completed and received into the canon in the same order of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both as to origin and present shape , from peculiar and independent tendencies of historical view and description , we find in them , when taken together and thoroughly appreciated in all their minutest parts , the exactest possible history of the dates and modifications of Hebrew historical composition , from its rudiments , down through its fullest and ripest development to its complete decay . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. pp 61 , 62 ) . The Great Book of Origins is made up of the works of seven different authors . The first , whose prose is rough and hard as a stone , wrote the Book of the Wars of Jahveh , a collection of reminiscences of the victorious campaigns of Moses and Joshua . The second , more skilled in narrative composition and hence later , probably living in the first century after Moses , wrote the Biography of Moses . The third , living at the beginning of Samson 's jurisdiction , in an unquiet time , in which every one tried to secure himself by oral or written agreements with friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fourth , a Levite of the brilliant age of Solomon , whose aim was to survey , from the resting-place which that epoch had reached , the entire mass of historical matter in its greatest extent , and to trace it back up to the ultimate commencement of all creation , wrote the Book of Origins ( or generations , as our English Bibles have it ) . " As the Greeks and Persians , after the Persian war , embraced with fresh // delight the history of all nations and ages , and in a short time immensely extended their historical survey , so this work endeavors to conceive of history in its widest extent , as certainly no earlier work had conceived of it But precisely because the work thus treated history from the Israelite point of view , perhaps for the first time in its widest extent , it sought to combine all the closer , and to discriminate all the finer , all its details . Accordingly , treating as it does of the great unwieldy mass of historical families , nations , or single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ventures to unite them all in a single great infinitely ramified pedigree , which has its root in the first man , a second progenitor after the deluge in Noah , and its youngest branches in the great contemporaries of the author and their families . " ( Vol . I. pp. 78 , 81 ) . Ewald 's esteem for this author is shown by the following characteristic utterance with which he concludes his notice of the Book of Origins - " Lofty spirit , thou whose work has for centuries not irrationally had the fortune of being taken for that of thy great hero Moses himself , I know not thy name , and divine only from thy vestiges when thou didst live , and what thou didst achieve ; hut if these thy traces incontrovertibly forhid me to identify thee with him who was greater than thou , and whom thou thyself only desiredst to magnify according to his deserts , then see that there is no guile in me , nor any pleasure in knowing thee not absolutely as thou wert . " ( Trans. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seven authors of the Great Book of Origins are called the " Prophetical Narrators " of the primitive history . They indulge in " the great freedom of repeated narration , which so remarkably distinguishes the works of this age from the Book of Origins and the still older books ; for all legendary literature will endeavor the more to break through old restraints , and will move with the greater freedom the oftener it treats the same subjectmatter ; but here it was especially the grandeur of prophetic truths that declared itself by means of the freer exposition thus admitted . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 97 . ) The first of the prophetic narrators is not called the fifth in the series , because Ewald does not suppose that the authors of the Wars of Jahveh and the Biography of Moses included in them the primitive histories properly so called ; he is therefore called the third narrator of the primitive history , the authors of the Book of Covenants and the Book of Origins being the first two . This narrator 's peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working of the prophetic and the divine spirit , which enters more or less prominently into most of his descriptions . This conception of the ancient history comes out strongest in the life of Moses ( Num. xi . sq. ) , but the scheme of the life of Joseph also leads curiously to such a prophetic // truth ( Gen. 1 . 19 , sq. ) ; and the frequent introduction of the dream , and its prophetic significance , by which he is perceptibly distinguished from the other narrators , harmonizes well with this prophetic theory of his that pervades his whole history . This writer is supposed to have lived in the tenth or ninth century , " while such great prophets as Elijah and Joel were still active ; for his history is like a reflex of the high prophetic activity of their times . Although passages like Rom. xi . sq . quite remind us of Joel , we prefer to assign to the northern kingdom a narrator who makes the life of Joseph the most brilliant period of the patriarchal history , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much what the Book of Origins was to that of Judah . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 99 . ) The second prophetic narrator , being the fourth narrator of the primitive history , who wrote in the ninth or eight century , at the time of the greatest prophets , had a peculiar genius for actual creation , and " exhibits a culmination and mature development of all the intellectual powers and capacities of the ancient nation , which can hardly be surpassed . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 100 . ) " The language is essentially the fully developed prose style ; but , from the author 's intellectual peculiarity in the treatment of history , it always inclines towards a prophetic loftiness of description , wherever the subject will at all allow of a more soaring flight , as at the call of Abraham and the other periods of this great hero 's life , at the call of Moses and his deeds in Egypt . " One consequence of this great freedom of description is , finally , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped in narration , and the ideas and colors of language current in the author 's age are , without much ceremony , transferred to the primitive times . This narrator also calls God from the first Jahveh . " This variety of divine names in the primeval history is not without weight for the discrimination of its elements ; but it presents only a single token , which must everywhere be judiciously interpreted and brought into harmony with all other indications ; for when adopted and insisted on without such careful judgment , it leads into great errors . Moreover , it is obvious that different histories require the application of different laws . " ( Trans. , VoL I. p. 103 , Note 1 . ) The third prophetic , being the fifth narrator of the primitive history , and the seventh and last of the series of the authors of the Great Book of Origins , is he from " whose hand proceeded the first great collection and working up of all previous sources of the primitive history , to whom therefore is to be referred the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with the exception of some additions which were intercalated still later . In his compendium he omitted , transferred , and condensed passages from the early works . // " lie was evidently determined mainly by the importance of a passage from the earlier books whether to insert or to omit it , or to abridge it more or less . Of slight repetitions and unprominent contradictions in the contents of the narrative he was but little afraid , still less of variety in the mere use of language . He preserves , accordingly , in the passages which he repeats from older hooks , the diversity of the names of God , Elohim , and Jahveh , in the main quite as . . . . he must have received it , though , agreeably to the progress of his time , he himself calls God Jahveh by preference As if he would bring prominently forward at the outset of the whole work that the two names in their ultimate significance are intrinsically but one , and that Jahveh is only more definite than Elohim , he of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first passage which he borrows from the fourth narrator , Gen. ii . 5 - iii . " ( Trans. , Yol . I. p. 114 . ) The Deuteronomist , writing from Egypt after the death of the good King Hezekiah , when the land was in the greatest danger from internal maladies , attempted most vigorously and emphatically to recommend the old law , altered and renovated in such a manner as to suit his times . " The work of the Deuteronomist , or prophetic renovator and perfecter of the old law , " is " a hook which is in many respects to the Old Testament what the Gospel of John is to the New , and which , though wearing an historical dress , still is widely removed from the circle of historical books . " ( VI . p. 117 . ) " No book exerted a stronger influence both on the life of the people and on their literature than this , when in the ninth century peculiar circumstances rendered it the authoritative basis of the reformation under King Josiah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was inevitable that the same art of book-making , which was so active among the ancient people , and had been long practised especially on this domain of primeval history , should again be tried . It was held good to work in the book of the Deuteronomist into one of the earlier works We can also clearly recognize the manner in which this last compiler , the true editor of the great historical book as it has reached us , proceeded . He left the work of the fifth narrator exactly as he found it , up to the section shortly before the death of Moses , to which the chief portion of the Deuteronomist 's work could suitably be attached . But since the latter . . . . had written the life of Joshua very briefly , the editor proceeded , after the death of Moses , on a freer plan , uniting the more detailed narrative given by the older work with the essential contents of the Deuteronomist 's , and so blending the two works completely into one . It was certainly this last editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a passage which even yet stands quite disconnected . In this ( v. 1 ) Moses is called for the first time the Man of God . ' This name , in the two only passages of this great book where it occurs ( here and in Joshua xiv . 6 ) , indicates a different hand from that of the Deuteronomist . The very fact of the insertion of this passage enables us to recognize most distinctly a last editor , who , however , must have lived before // the end of the seventh century , or at all events before the destruction of Jerusalem ( 586 B. C. according to Ewald ) , and brought the work into its present and final form . For there is no single indication to lead us to any lower antiquity . " ( Trans. , Vol. 1 . p. 130 . ) Ewald 's chapters on chronology are ingenious , clear , and interesting ; and , ahuiough they bear the unfortunate stamp of his dogmatism , they are valuable . He thinks that , while tradition is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient people is not secure unless it be proved to have used a continuous and fixed computation in specifying the order of events . During the whole period in which Israel flourished as a nation , no one era ever came into continuous and general use . But they were not without means of counting . Some means was necessary for the annual festivals and the entire calendar . This work was in antiquity in general , in Egypt especially , and doubtless in Israel , a duty of the priesthood . The Book of Origins begins the year with the first day of the Pasehal month , thus dating from the Exodus ; as the Romans counted their years from the expulsion of the Tarquins , long before the building of the city was adopted as the commencement of their em . At least , when the laws of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years were carried out , and this certainly occurred immediately on the conquest of the country , a fixed chronology must have been established , and at that time the year of the Exodus may very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This method , however , does not seem to have been employed for civil documents , nor do we find it in the ordinary histories by writers less learned than the priestly author of the Book of Origins . Hence many points in the Old Testament chronology are more or less uncertain . For the whole early history the numbers given in the Book of Origins - the 480 years after and the 430 years before the Exodus - form the axis upon which everything turns , and upon the reliability of which everything hangs . To establish or to correct such a chronology , however , a comparison is necessary with the contemporaneous history of some other nation . Israel , in the time of her independence , was too proud to use the Phcenician , Egyptian , or Babylonian chronology , and her literary culture was too rudimentary to give them a collateral mention . The so-called synchronisms in the Book of Kings were imparted by the learned after the total destruction of the Northera kingdom . Ezekiel , the earliest Hebrew writer , employing a non-Israelite chronology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivity , - yet scarcely ventured to put it in front of his work . For the later half of the history of Israel , there are many points of comparison with Phenician , Assyrian , Chaldean , and Greek ; but for the first half , the period before David and Solomon , these sources , so far as we yet know // Oct. them , fail us almost totally . At present , therefore , the Egyptian chronology alone possesses for both divisions of the history considerable , and for the earlier unrivalled , importance . Genealogies are of some assistance , but from abbreviations which were common , and from political commotions and the dispersion of the people , they are uncertain . Another difficulty is , that numbers are especially liable to be mistaken and changed by the transcriber . We must be satisfied , then , if only from the actual commencement of the history of Israel as a nation we can lay down a chronology correct in all its general features . Ewald thinks that the Hebrew conception of the earliest traditional life corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden age , Noah the silv*r , the patriarchs the brazen , and Moses and Joshua the beginning of the iron a.ge . " On looking through the data concerning thc lives of persons in the four ages down to the time of Moses and the Conquest , we discover the prevailing view to be that which assumes from 120 to 140 years as the extreme limit of human life in the existing epoch ; for just as the men of the Third Age were conceived as far outliving that term , in the Fourth , Joseph dies at 110 , Levi at 137 , Kohath at 133 , Amram at 137 , his sons Aaron and Moses at 120 , Joshua , like his progenitor Joseph , somewhat below the Levites , at 110 : with other indications of the same view . Now from this Fourth Age , to determine by successive proportionate augmentation the possible years of human life in the earlier ages , the number 125 was evidently taken as the basis of the Fourth , from which , by repeatedly doubling the number , 1000 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 . Thus was prescribed to every historical personage , according to the age in which he lived , a maximum length of life which might not be exceeded . If the Hebrew conception went in this assumption somewhat beyond the most ancient Hindu , which adopted the proportion 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , on the other hand it always remained free from the extravagant extensions of these numbers into which the later Hindu traditions fell . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 275 . ) The records of the time of the patriarchs Ewald calls the preliminary history . The following passage will indicate his view of the migration of Abraham : - " Little as we arc able to prove all the details of that migration from the North towards Egypt , which probably continued for centuries , it may with great certainty be conceived as on the whole similar to the gradual advance of many other northern nations ; as of the Germans towards Rome , and of the Turks in these same regions in the Middle Ages , who also were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another as brave protectors If this , then , was the true character of these migrations , we can see that they might last for centuries , and that nothing less than the forcible rearrangement of the political relations of Canaan through the Mosaic kingdom of Israel put a final stop to the dependence of Canaan on the influences of the northeast ; // for Chushan-Rishathaim , who shortly after Joshua , issuing from Mesopotamia , subdued Canaan , is the last ruler of this kind for many centuries . Further , we now understand that Abraham 's name can designate only one of the most important and oldest of the Hebrew immigrations . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 310 . ) Ewald thinks that it would be a violation of history to understand Abraham and his family alone by the Hyksos people . The Hyksos he supposes to comprehend all the various tribes , some small and some great , which were generally united only by their common Hebrew origin , and at that particular time also by a common movement southward ; some of whom pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjacent countries , probably with many shiftings backward and forward , of which now only some faint reminiscences can with difficulty be traced ; Abraham being only one among many lenders of these tribes . This view is actually confirmed by other indications . " The Midianites and the Kenites , for instance , from whom Moses ( as will be afterwards shown ) received so much assistance in his exertions for Israel , may themselves , according to Manetho 's account , have belonged to the Hyksos formerly expelled from Egypt , and have assisted Moses the more zealously on this account . " ( Trans. , Vol . I. p. 396 . ) The settlement of the Israelites in Egypt at the time of Joseph was an honorable act of undertaking to occupy the northeastern frontier of Egypt for the defence of the country and for their own advantnge . Israel was a sturdy people , who during the most of the four hundred and thirty years of their Egyptian residence suffered neither slavery nor oppression , and their final revolt wa* against a system of enforced service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lasted not much more than half a century . One proof that the time of their grievous oppression had been short is the vigor of their rebellion . " That Moses was a prophet at the time when , overcome by a righteous but too vehement indignation , he slew the Egyptian and had to fly from Egypt , is not conceivable in any strict sense . Ancient tradition itself deems him a prophet only from the moment of his solitude at Sinai , when he was suddenly and irresistibly transported by an overpowering fire of Divine revelation . But the high importance of Moses in the history of the world lies most of all in the fact that he became a prophet , and from that moment acted as a prophet for his whole remaining life He was indeed leader , lawgiver , and worker of miracles to his people , but all these additional attributes fade before the primary one , that he was a prophet There is no notion more preposterous than that prophecy always took the same form among the ancient Israelites But however great ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prophecy as its permanent element , which determines its // Oct. peculiar life , and only grants it varying expression as the external objects change with which it comes in contact . This inner form is the impulse of religion to reveal her own truth ; hence in its every stage and vicissitude , and consequently in this its earliest and most rigid form , prophecy can not he understood without a knowledge of the nature of religion . " ( Trans. , Vol . II . pp. 47,48 . ) " But again , religion is concerned not merely with beholding the Divine , hut also with the nature of what is beheld . Everything was so prepared on the soil of Egypt , then thrilled with the most startling antagonisms of nationality and religion , that a distinct opposition to the fully developed Egyptian corruptions of itself rendered an advance to a higher , nay , to an eternally true religion possible . On every soil thus prepared the most surprising truths germinate with ease , their very opposites conspiring to force them upwards ; and rn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful movement extending far beyond Moses and his people for the f9undation of a better religion as the basis of a higher life . But how few are able amid storms and passions really to perceive the truths invisibly germinating on such a soil , to discern them by the Divine light , and to carry them out with a Divine confidence ! That the eye of Moses discerned them , that it therefore suffered itself to be opened by the Divine Spirit to discern them , constitutes the immeasurable significance of his life . " ( Trans. , Vol . II . pp. 50 , 51 . ) We have thus attempted to give , chiefly by striking , characteristic , and suggestive pass ages from the work itself , a general view of the motive , method , and spirit of Ewald 's history . To skip to the third volume and enter into a few details , we would call attention to the author 's masterly treatment of Solomon and his age . The history of Saul and David we should like to dwell upon in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the characters of these heroes and the importance of the work of each have been described . But the view of Solomon 's relation to religion , and of the people 's attitude towards him , is rarer and needs to be compared with the common notions of that monarch 's decline , and of the fall of his general policy under the feeble administration of IRehoboam . When Solomon came to the throne , " the monarchy had fully solved its lower problems , - it had made the country powerful , the kingdom strong , and the people peaceful and industrious ; but for this very reason , during the long peace , all the higher problems involved in the national life of a civilized people pressed upon it with increasing force . " ( Trans. , Vol . III . p. 288 . ) " A greater freedom in religion was the necessity of the age . Itcan , indeed , by no means be shown from ancient authorities that Solomon , even in advanced life , ever left the religion of Jahveh , and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary history extant testify to the contrary ; and we still find an express statement that upon the altar which he // erected to Jahveh he sacrificed thrice during the year ( at the three great festivals ) with all the solemnity which was only becoming in a king such as he . 1 Kings ix . 25 . But we must reflect that under him the kingdom of Israel had the strongest tendency to become an imperial power , and emancipate itself completely from all its ancient limitations . But in a prosperous empire , and especially in one which seeks its well-being in peace and commerce , the toleration of diverse religions is absolutely indispensable , for a government of this nature can not desire any sudden change in the various tendencies and views of the people . Still less will it desire to destroy them with violence ; and thus every form of religion was , without doubt , tolerated within the wide circumference of Solomon 's kingdom . . . . . In fact , even in that early period , under the wise Solomon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ np , which the true religion would undoubtedly have to permit as soon as it became more distinctly conscious of its own nature , and against which , in our own day and in countries west of the Kiemen , no one feels called upon to act , excepting Jesuits and persons of similar sentiments . Undoubtedly the religion of Jahveh was at that time , in some respects , too weak to rely wholly upon itself without any external support But if Solomon 's rule had not already , through other causes , somewhat estranged from him the national feeling , who can tell what might not have been successfully and permanently achieved in this age of wisdom . But now , as this innovation was carried through by the sole exercise of the royal prerogative , many of the stricter believers , cherishing the memory of their early history , and the glorious days of the past , were soon led to regard this freedom of the philosophic king with gathering dislike , as the increasing laxity of the national life caused in many a growing indifference , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , also , Solomon undoubtedly alienated the hearts of many of his subjects ; and there sprung up silently two parties which , in the later history , stand out with increasing distinctness and abruptness , - one party favoring this innovation , and hence easily giving way to the admission of looser heathen customs into Israel , and the other resolutely opposed to the whole movement . Under a rule so powerful and brilliant as Solomon 's , such a change in the national life could only gradually make itself felt , and the evils accruing to the religion of Jahveh from the growing freedom did not fully manifest themselves until a later period . After they had been long laid bare during the course of centuries , the Deuteronomic redactor of the history treated this point as if the heart of the once wise king had , in his old age , been drawn away from the religion of Jahveh into idolatry by his numerous heathen wives . " - 1 Kings xi . 1-10 . ( Trans. , Vol.111. pp. 296 - 299 . ) Ewald then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its religious fervor and directed by its religious narrowness , and by its love of barbarous freedom , although it had helped Israel to leave Egypt successfully , led her also to the damaging mistake of breaking with David 's house , which was civilizing her . She could not long endure the rude beginnings of civilization in the taxes and compulsory service of Solomon and Rehoboam , and preferred to run the risk of // an attempted reaction to times which could not be imitated without anachronous barbarism . " The general feeling , accordingly , might be expressed in the two assertions:1 , That the monarchy , as developed towards the close of Solomon 's life , could not stand ; and , 2 , that , on the other hand , it must be carried hack to such principles as had prevailed say in Samuel 's time . With this the prophets , so far as we know , were in accord ; and all the better minds in Israel probably shared their sentiments . But if we try to imagine the state of affairs in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ultimately be attained , this passage in the ancient history will be found the best adapted ( if taken along with the true greatness of prophecy in those ccnturies ) to exhibit clearly the earthly limits which it was not yet able to break through In the last years of Solomon 's life , and immediately afterwards , even prophets of Jahveh , whom we have no right to regard as false prophets , might urge the disruption , because the higher blessing of the true religion and of the human rule answering to this , a blessing which in Israel always remained the supreme concealed power , determining and deciding everything else , ran at that time the risk of being set aside by a further one-sided development of the monarchy . But on this very account the disruption , like every schism , remained a great evil ; and whether it was ever again to be remedied during Israel 's independent national life , or whether the preservation of the spiritual blessings of the people must finally involve the destruction of all its earthly blessings , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the disruption should have attained their full development . " ( Trans. , Vol . III . pp. 310 - 314 . ) An account of Ewald 's treatment of the New Testament history would require more space than is at present at our disposal . We will only say that , while it is remarkably able in its general conception , and even original in much of its development , it yet lacks the unequalled freshness of his Old Testament history , and is obscured here and there by a reflection from common ecclesiastical views which lose their power over his mind whenever he gets back of the Maccabees . It is important to know that Ewald thinks John to have been the author of the Fourth Gospel . His treatment of miracles , however , is uncertain . Ewald 's German style , while not obscure to those who have become used to it , may nevertheless be said to add yet another difficulty to the study of the history of Israel . It is also peculiarly difficult to translate . But we have to congratulate Mr. Martineau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only in presenting the contents of the work accurately and clearly , but also in catching the best traits , even some of the charms of Ewald 's own original manner . Indeed , the chief difficulty of Ewald 's style becomes one of its chief attractions to a constant reader . He writes less like a member of a class than any historian we have read . His whole life is thrown before us // amidst the philology , chronology , science , art , politics , and religion of his history , and the story , with his views and feelings about every part , even the least parts of it , is told with a rush of diction which , without being very diffuse , is so extraordinarly suggestive that superficial readers often mistake what is the genuine expression of a true , deep , and powerful historic sense for mere enthusiasm for his personal opinion . We expect that Ewald 's view will have a great influence upon American students of the Bible , leading the more narrow of the " Orthodox " to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , and leading the more negative or indifferent " Liberals " to be ashamed of neglecting a history that teaches the need of more liberality than is found in New England , and to study the ancient records , not with the mere local purpose of refuting the dogmas of ignorance or exclusive traditionalism , hut with a positive aim to discover the historic truth , and to learn definitely what can be known , and what can not be known , and why ; and also whether we may expect to learn more , and whence , and how . It is also interesting to look forward to the interest in the writings of the Old Testament as a literature which will probably be awakened especially by Ewald 's chapters on the literary progress of Israel . Another most desirable effect the book should have , - the elevation of the religious view of history to that point where alone it can be in harmony with science , the recognition of Divine revelation all over the world . This position , so far from lowering , exalts the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance , if not of greater importance , this position is the only one which can induce men who know and understand the history of the world to worship the God of Israel .
