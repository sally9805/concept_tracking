ART . V. - American State Universities , their Origin and Progress , a History of congressional University Land Grants , a particular Account of the Rise and Development of the University of Michigan , and Hints toward the Future of the Americart University System . By ANDREW TEN BROOK . Cincinnati : Robert Clarke &amp; Co. 1875. iN giving to the public the volume before us , Mr. Ten Brook has made a substantial contribution to the history of higher education in America . He has sketched the early progress of our colleges in the Atlantic States . He has given us a graphic picture of the state of culture in the West at the time when the general government adopted the policy of Congressional land-grants . He has traced briefly , but clearly , the characteristics of the different land-grants themselves . He has outlined the manner in which these different grants have becim administered , He has given us in considerable detail an account of the difficulties and of the ultimate establishment on a firm basis of the most successful of the State universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodiment of all his studies in a chapter on " The Prospective University . " The value of a work of this kind depends far more upon the nature of the information it imparts , than upon the manner in which it is written . It is not our purpose , therefore , to attempt to write what would be called in any literary sense a critical review . We are , in fact , as we conclude the perusal of the book , in no critical mood . We hail the work as , for the most part , an original contribution to the educational history of our country . We are sure it contains much information // that needs to be disseminated . We are also sure that it will greatly interest every inquiring educator . We know that the author has had unusual means of observation . We remember that for many years he was Professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy in the University of Michigan , and that , too , at the very time of its most trying experience . XVe remember also that for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , *nd was on terms of intimate acquaintance with the professors of one of the greatest German universities . We are profoundly grateful , therefore , that one who has had so large observation , and who was really so large a part of the University of Michigan at the time when its future greatness was made secure , has given us an account of its perils and its successes . No intelligent reader of this volume will fail to observe that chano'e has ta an important ken place in public opinion concerning the manner in which our colleges and universities ought to be supported . This change , so far as we remember , is nowhere alluded to by Mr. Ten Brook , and yet it is , perhaps , worthy of a somewhat careful consideration . Every one knoxvs that at the present day public opinion inclines to the establishment of a sharply defined line between our upper and our lower schools . The belief is almost universal that our common schools ought to be supported by general taxation . The welfare of the State manifestly demands that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich , receive an elementary education . This interest could not be subserved , if the poor were to be left to their own unaided efforts . The State , therefore , says to the rich : You shall contribute of your abundance for the education of your poor neighbors ' children . It matters not that you educate your own children at a private school and at your own private expense ; it matters not even if you have no children whatever of your own to educate . You are a part of the State . You receive the benefits of that enlightened condition of society which comes from the general prevalence of schools ; and , consequently , you must bear such a part of the burden of their support as your property is a part of the whole property of the State . But while this argument see ins to be generally satisfactory when applied to the // support of the common schools , it is often objected to when applied to the support of schools of a higher grade . The fact is obvious that throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our colleges and universities , and even our academies , ought to be supported largely , if not indeed exclusively , not at the expense of the public , but by means of private munificence . Not long since a case occurred in one of the most enlightened of our States where a gentleman of high standing raised the question concerning the right of the school board to expend any portion of the school money for the support of a high school . Before the court it was argued on ethical as well as on constitutional grounds that the public moneys could not properly be expended in support of instruction in any other than what are commonly known as elementary branches . Happily this position was not sustained by the court ; but it must be confessed that the arguments advanced were quite in harmony with the views on the question which , at present , are more or less generally enlightened . Now it is our firm conviction that the distinction which we have noted is without substantial foundation . It seems to us that the arguments advanced in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is entirely at variance with the early vieWs and habits of our own country . It would scarcely seem necessary to plead the cause of higher education in a republic . In general and abstract terms everybody admits- the necessity of it . It is too obvious to admit of question that there can be no intelligent guidance of the intricate affairs of state , without something of that discriminating knowledge which comes from a thorough training of the higher faculties . Of course it is impossible for all men to have large personal experience , and therefore it is best that , so far as possible , they should acquire large knowledge of the personal experience of others . Therefore the more of higher education you can have in a state the better . All this is commonplace , and will be universally assented to . But it is languidly admitted , rather than earnestly felt . It is , probably , after all , not too much to say that the masses of the people , as represented in the average legislature , half believe that higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a // necessity to be publicly supported . The consequence is that in most of our States , while the people guard strenuously all encroachments upon the system of common schools , they are quite willing to leave the care of their higher institutions of learning in the hands of those over whom they have no control . This willingness , encouraged by the arguments to which we have already alluded , has resulted in the general adoption of a policy of non-interference . But is it true that higher education is in any sense less necessary to the welfare of a state than the education afforded by the common schools ? Is it not , after all , quite as essential that the men who are to make and administer our laws should be thoroughly trained , as that those who choose the lawmakers should know how to read and write ? Nay , is there any ethical or logical reason why , if you provide a certain grade of education for the voter , you may not also provide a certain gi'ade for the lawmaker ? Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible justification of the other ? If these questions are answered as we apprehend they must be , the problem reduces itself to a very simple query : Is there any method by which higher education can be more certainly and more satisfactorily secured than by committing it to the charge of the state ? Those who answer this question in the affirmative , so far as we have observed , found their objections to the policy of state support either on the belief that it is unjust to the tax-payer , or that it is unsafe for the student . It is sometimes urged that , as , in the nature of things , higher education can only be acquired by the few , it ought not to be secured at the expense of the many . But to this it is a complete answer to say that such an education is a public benefit , and that unless it can be shown that this benefit can be better secured in some other manner , it ought to be provided for just as other public benefits are provided for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylums by the state , to say that they are chiefly beneficial to the few only . No member of Congress presumes to argue against appropriations for lighthouses and harbor improvements , on the ground that such improvements are chiefly advantageous to merchants and navigators ; and , // therefore , that merchants and navigators or their friends ought to construct them . The truth is , that a very large part of what are known as public improvements are directly beneficial to no more than a very small portion of the community , while the advantage derived from them by members of the public at large is only of that general and indefinite nature which comes from the improved condition of the state as a whole . It requires but a moment 's reflection to perceive that no state could thrive , that no true , civilization could exist even , if the principle were to be admitted that no man is to be taxed save for that which to him personally is to be of direct and tangible advantage . To admit the principle , and act upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social improvement . The argument , therefore , that our legislatures have no right to tax the people for the purposes of higher education , is utterly fallacious . The position can only be sustained when it is admitted that such education is of no advantage whatever to the state at large . The other objection to which we alluded , is that in universities supported by the state , students are unsafe . This objection is not , perhaps , very loudly urged , but it is , without doubt , to a very considerable extent , secretly entertained . Occasionally it crops out in unseemly ways . We happened to know of a zealous editor who ; not long since in a moment of thoughtlessness , allowed his spirit to escape his control , and to make an antic display of itself . In announcing the admission of a large class to one of our Eastern universities , which he did not think sufficiently religious , he headed his article , " Two kundred raw recruits for Satan ! " It would , of course , be unjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of persons ; and yet we fancy the number is not altogether inconsiderable who would differ from him chiefly in method of expression . It has to be admitted that there are vast numbers of good men and women who entertain the notion that those colleges which are in some way or other under the supposed control of the Church are the only safe resorts of our young men in search of an education . Now , we wish to state explicitly that , in our opinion , this // notion is not only without foundation , but that it exerts a pernicious influence on the cause of higher education in the country . In the first place , the notion is founded on exaggerated views of the difference between the state and the denominational universities . It is often represented , and , indeed , believed , that institutions of the one class are distinctively religious , while those of the other class are distinctively irreligious . Such representations are really the inosj efficient means by which a numerical majority of the colleges in our country are kept alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth . There is , indeed , a manifest difference between the dominant spirit of a great state university and that of an obscure denominational college . But the very moment you bring to the college a large faculty and a large number of students , the difference vanishes . We have no disposition to make invidious comparisons . But we have repeatedly heard men of earnest religious faith and life , who have had professional experience in both classes of institutions , declare that the difference in this respect is imaginary rather than real . Nay , further , we have never heard the contrary asserted by any one who has had good opportunity of judging . We have come to believe , therefore , that the comparisons so frequently made are either outright cant , or are the product of entire ignorance on the subject . The real distinction , then , is between the small colleges and the large ones . Here , no doubt , there is a marked difference . In the smaller institutions the student is under the more direct supervision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual pupils . The peculiar wants of each are recognized , and are treated in their appropriate manner . It is also true that the individual peculiarities of the professors themselves leave a more positive impression on the mind of the student . If the instructor is ardently religious , as in a college of this class lie is likely to be , a restraining , and perhaps even a religious influence may be exerted . These , in general terms , are the advantages held out by the small college . For certain purposes they are , doubtless , not to be despised , but they are entirely different in // kind from the advantages presented at a great university . They are the characteristics which direct rather than develop the mind . They stand guard over it doubtless often keeping it out of danger , but they do not inspire it for its highest efforts . They keep it from utter failure , but they do not move it to the highest success . If the best education consisted simply of making perfect recitations and keeping out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . But the best education is far more than that . Perhaps it is correct to say it is an inspiration rather than an acquisition . It comes not simply from industry and steady habits , but far more largely from that kindling and glowing zeal which is best begotteii by familiar contact with large libraries and museums , and enthusiastic specialists . It shows itself not so much in the amount which its possessor has made himself master of , as in the spirit with which he takes what he knows , and goes out with it to grapple with his life work . This is the reason , it may be said in passing , why valedictorians and senior-wranglers so often disappoint the hopes of their friends . For the moment a student begins to covet a given position , he is tempted , for obvious reasons , to limit his efforts to the work which will favorably affect his standing . His success depends upon the regnlarly perfect performance of the task assigned . He keeps himself , therefore , within very narrow limits . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than breadth . Its possessor is working for a price , whereas all genuine scholarship is , and must be , its own sufficient reward . The difference is quite enongh to account for innumerable failures as well as innumerable successes in life . It needs scarcely to be said that the highest successes are to be awaited when to the exact scholarship of the one is joined the enthusiastic spirit of the other ; and it is this combination of excellences which the large university is best adapted to secure . While the small college affords guidance and protection , the large one offers guidance , inspiration , and opportunity . What the respective merits of the city and of the country are to the man of business , those of the large institution and those of the small one are to the student . As the young merchant will be less exposed to financial perils in a village grocery than in the whirl // of a commercial metropolis , so will the student be less exposed to danger in the quiet retreat of a rural college than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these avocations it is the stir , the enthusiasm , the unceasing activity , and , above all , the constant intercourse with men of the same pursuits and the same ambitions , that develop the greatest energies and secure the highest successes . The advantages of a concentration of energies for higher education have long been felt in every nation of Europe . England , Ireland , and Scotland , with a population not much less than our own , have scarcely half a score of institutions empowered to grant degrees . In France there is , strictly speaking , but a single one . In Germany , where the system of education has been brought to the highest perfection , the number is only twenty-one , or one for about two millions of inhabitants . In our own country the latest announcement is that we have three hundred and twenty-two colleges and universities , each entitled , so far as municipal law can bestow it , to rank itself as one of our highest institutions of learning . A single one of our States has the enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average gross income of somewhat less than nine thousand dollars each : forty-two faculties , forty-two libraries , forty-two museums , forty-two complete sets of apparatus , to say nothing of laboratories and observatories to be provided for and administered out of an income which scarcely exceeds , if indeed it does exceed , the insufficient income of Harvard College ! Now , it is to be noted that this fatal isolation of educational appliances is the direct result of our methods of supporting our colleges and universities . In our opinion the system of private endowments could never have resulted otherwise . Local interests and ambitions are ever active , and have ever exerted a powerful influence . Men will give money for a cob lege in their town , when they would give nothing for a college at a distance . Then , too , the attitude of the different religious sects has tended powerfully in the same direction . Every denomination knows that , if it is to push its way in the civilization of the present century , it must have an educated clergy . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of education , against the influence of opposing creeds . To accomplish this result it must have schools . As our system practically excludes parochial schools , it is limited to the college and to the theological seminary . These , therefore , it must have in as great abundance as possible . Whenever a rich sectarian dies , therefore , he is exhorted to leave his money to one of the sectarian schools already founded ; or , if he is unwilling to do that , to found a school in his own name . The exhortation is often made effectual by the fact that the cost of an efficient college is ridiculously under-estimated . Not long since occurred an example that will serve as an illustration . An effort was made to endow a denominational school in the heart of one of our largest States . A great meeting was held for the purpose . Within less than a hundred miles were several colleges already in operation , besides a university with an endowment of more than two millions of dollars . And yet one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must endow a great Christian university . Yes , we must have the greatest and best university in the country , even *f it takes an endowment of five hundred thousand dollars ! " Here was pious simplicity indeed ; and yet the speech was not altogether exceptional either in piety or simplicity . It was the identical spirit which has dotted the country all over with mendicant colleges and universities , whose chief work in the general cause of higher education has been to keep down the standards of scholarship , and to stand in the way of something better . Now , in our opinion the public has not sufficiently understood and appreciated the leading cause of this condition of affairs . We have no doubt that the immense number of our colleges is very generally deplored . But we are not sure that the public is ready to admit either the extent of the evil , or the fact that the evil is the legitimate and necessary product of our system . That it is such a product , we believe it is easy to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the colleges and unfversities were not to be snpported in the same manner as the lower schools are supported , it was fixed as a necessary consequence , that , while the lower schools would flourish , the colleges and universities would multiply // beyond all demand , and a vast majority of them would languish beyond all recovery . We believe that under the change of policy to which we have referred , the importance of higher education has declined in public estimation ; that while a comparison of the state of the learned professions at the present time with the same of fifty years ago will reveal a degeneracy , a careful study of statistics , like those prepared by President Barnard in 1870 , will also show that the number of students seeking a college education has relatively declined . We believe , furthermore , that nothing but a return to the early policy of our country will reinstate the general cause of higher education iii the position of relative importance which it formerly occupied . It has thus far been assumed that the present method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pursued in the early history of the country . It is of importance in this connection to bring out the fact of such a change into a clear light . F or the purpose of doing so , let us consider for a few moments the policy pursued up to the time of the Revolution . In general terms it may be stated that , through all the dark periods of our colonial history , the encouragement of higher education was regarded as one of the great interests of the state . It was no doctrine of the fathers that higher education was less entitled to the fostering care of the commonwealth than was the education afforded by the common schools . It seems never to have entered their imaginations that the university was not entitled to the support of the entire people . But on so important a part of our subject , it is perhaps desirable that we should be more specific . It was in the year 1636 , only six years after the arrival of Winthrop and his colony , that the General Court of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one authority , equal to a year 's rate of the whole colony , toward the erection of a college . " * It is of interest to note that this was two * President Quincy in referring to this act says , " To this date we trace the ori*in of the seminary . This is , . . . Gentis cunahula nostra3 uherrima regna. " ' // years before John Harvard gave to the college his name by leaving it half of his estate and the whole of his library . There is an important sense , therefore , in which Harvard Cob lege was a " State institution . " Not only was the first grant made by the Legislature , but through the whole of the colonial period , the college never ceased to depend in large measure upon the General Court . If the amount of patronage extended by the civil authority was small , the reason was that " the necessities of the country were extreme , " and its " available resources scanty and precarious . " The people were struggling for their existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular appropriations were made for the benefit of the college . President Quincy declares that during the whole of the first seventy years of its history , " its officers were dependent for daily bread upon the bounty of the General Court . " * Eloquent praises have been bestowed , and justly bestowed , upon the generous sacrifices of the colonists for the benefit of the college . There is , perhaps , nothing more touching and inspiring in the whole glorious history of New England , than the list of simple presents and legacies given in those early days " towards establishing for learning a restingplace , and for science a fixed habitation , on the borders of the wilderness . " But it ought not to be forgotten that this noble generosity was only a part of the financial history of the college . It takes strong hold of the affections and the imagination ; and , for that very reason , it lingers in the memory , while the regular and substantial gifts of the General Court are forgotten . But to suppose that the college was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was supported by individual bequests and donations , is entirely at variance with its true history . Nor is it correct to suppose that it was founded by the Church . The Church and the State were , it is true , united , but the Church , as such , it should be distinctly understood , had nothing whatever to do with the college . It was the General Court that gave to the institution its name . By the charter of 1642 the entire control of the college is vested in a board consisting of " the governor and deputy-governor for the time being , and all the magistrates of this jurisdiction , together with the // teaching elders " ( not the clergymen ) " of the six next ad*joining towns , namely , Cambridge , Watertown , Charlestown , Boston , Roxbury , and Dorchester . " Eight years later , when the charter was modified , tile control passed into the hands of the President and Fellows , all of whom were named by the General Court . It is a fact which throws a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college were conducted , that in neither of these charters is there a single clause , or a word even , that is not in the most liberal and catholic spirit . If the college was even a Christian college , it was not because of any characteristics of its fundamental law , but because it was controlled and administered by Christian men . The charter of 1650 , that which for more than half a century was the fundamental law of the college , expressly refers to the object of the institution as being " the advancement and education of youth in all manner of good literature , arts , and sciences . " * And if the fundamental law was liberal in its spirit , the corporation itself was not less so . it is a fact worth noting , that " the two first presidents , and the only ones appointed by the early emigrants , were known unhelievers in points of religious faith to which the Congregational clergy of that time rigidly adhered . " f The original seal of the college also illustrated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was deemed a sufficient motto . It was probably not until President Mather 's turbulent administration that the present one of " chri*to et Ecelesiw 4 was adopted . Be that as it may , President Quincy expressly declares that the one of 1643 , consisting of the three open volumes and the word " Veritas " is the only seal of the college which has the sanction of any record . This early dependence of Harvard upon the State was continued , moreover , not only during the whole of the colonial period , but even after the adoption of a State constitution . That instrument devoted an entire chapter to the interests of the only college within its jurisdiction . " It shall be the duty , " so runs the Constitution , " of all legislatures and magistrates , in all future periods of this Commonwealth , to cherish the in* Quincy , I. 591. t Ibid. 47 . Ibid. 49. // terests of literature and science , and all seminaries of them , especially the University at Cambridge , public schools and grammar schools in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the tiniversity as a part of her school system . All parts of that system received her fostePing care . " To the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our fathers , " it was ordered , " that every township , after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty householders , shall appoint one to teach all children to write tind read ; and where any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families , they shall set up a grammar school , the masters thereof being able to instruct the youth so far as they may be fitted for the university . " As time advanced , these high schools or academies were recognized and designated as a part of the public-school system . A plan was at one time advanced which contemplated one in each county . Of these , fifteen were incorporated prior to 1797 , and seven of them had received special donations of lands in Maine towards a permanent endowment . Meanwhile , for the college the Legislature not only paid a regular appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time rent of the ferry between Boston and Cambridge was given to it , and once at least " every family in each of the colonies gave to the college at Canibridge twelve pence , or a peck of corn , or its value in unadulterated wom pompeage . " From whatever point of view we look , then , we find that the schools and the college received equal encouragement and equal support at the hands of the Legislature . if a careful comparison were to be made , it would probably show that the college receiVed the most numerous favors . The second college established in the Colonies was that of William and Mary . In 1692 the reigning monarchs of England granted to it ? 1,985 in money , twenty thousand acres of land , and a tax of a penny a pound duty on all tobaccoes exported from Maryland and Virginia to the other Colonies . In addition to these royal favors , the Colonial Assembly gave it by temporary laws a duty on liquors imported , and on skins and furs exported. * From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works , YIII. 391. // upwards of three thousand pounds a year . By the charter which it received from the parent country , it was under the government of twenty visitors , who were to have full legislative power , and who , in connection with the president and professors , were allowed a representative in the general Assembly . The college thus endowed and provided for by the State remained the only seminary of higher learning in Virginia until as late as the ontbreak of the Revolutionary War , and , with a single feeble exception , the only one until the year 1825 . It could thus call to its service the ablest professors to be found . It exerted a powerful influence on the schools of the State . Under the inspiration of its guidance these schools attained a high grade of excellence . Jefferson wrote in 1820 that " the mass of education in Virginia , before the Revolution , placed her with the foremost of her sister Colonies . " * In 1788 , the same statesman had written from Paris to his friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faculty of William and Mary College ; and , after canvassing the merits of its respective members , he concluded by saying : " I know no place in the world , while the present professors remain , where I would so soon place a son . " f But notwithstanding these characteristics , there were defects in the early organization of the college which in the course of time made themselves felt . The liberal spirit which had characterized the charter of Harvard was waiiting in William and Mary . The college was an establishment purely of the Church of England . The visitors were tequired to be all of that church . The professors were required to subscribe its Thirty-nine Articles . The students were obliged to learn its Catechism . In short , one of its fundamental objects came to he " to raise up ministers for the Church of England . " When the Revolutionary War came on , the spirit of opposition to everything English , together with the natural jealousies of so sectarian a college , was enough completely to destroy its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk so low that even Jefferson , who had written in such enthusiastic terms of it in 1788 , despaired of raising it into life . * " Early History of the University of Virginia , " p. 185 . I Jefferson 's Works , II . 428. // When , in 1824 , it was proposed by some of its friends to remove it to Richmond in the attempt to resuscitate it , Jefferson opposed the movement , on the ground that in despair of the college , the State had founded the University of Virginia , and that it would be impossible to give to the two an adequate support . When it is remembered that in 1824 Virginia was , with the bare exception of New York , the richest and most populous State in the Union , the language of Jefferson on this point is of very interesting significance . " If both remain , " writes he , " there will not be students enough to make either worthy the acceptance of men of the first order of science . They must each fall down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common teachers , and our State education must stand exactly where it now is . Few of the States have been able to maintain one university , none two . Surely the Legislature , after such an expense incurred for a real university , and just as it is prepared to go into action under hopeful auspices , will not consent to destroy it by this side-wind. " * At the time this letter was written , Virginia had a population of about one million two hundred thousand , and yet we have the clearly expressed opinion of the distinguished author that it was not best to remove the weaker of the two institutions , because by doing so , they would divide the number of students , and so oblige both to " fall down to the level of our present academies , under the direction of common teachers . " Now the view entertained by Jefferson was by no means exceptional . Indeed , a similar spirit had pervaded the whole history of our colonial life . It was from considerations of the same nature that the founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after the first colonization of Connecticut . But on this subject the account of President Dwight is of so much interest that I give it entire - " The first house in the colony of Connecticut was erected in the year 1635 , and the first in the colony of New Havcn in 1637 . The first house in Salem was built in 1626 . The act of the Legislature which gave birth to Harvard College was passed in 1636 . Only ten years , therefore , elapsed , after the beginning of a settlement in Massa // chusetts , before a college was commenced in earnest ; whereas sixtyfive years passed away after the colonization of Connecticut was begun , and sixty-three after that of New Haven , before any serious attempt was made toward the founding of Yale College . But von are not hence to conclude that the colonists of Connecticut and New Haven were at all less friendly to learning than those of Massachusetts . The project of establishing a college in each of these colonies was very early taken up , but was checked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole population of New England was scarcely sufficient to support one institution of this nature , and that the establishment of a second would , in the end , be a sacrifice of both . These objections put a stop to the design for a considerable time . " Of the serious design of the New Haven colonists to establish a college , the following document , copied from the records of Guilford , furnishes decisive evidence : - * " At the General Court held at Guilford ; June 28 , A. P. 1652 , Voted , The matter about a college at New Haven was thought to be too great a charge for us , of this jurisdiction , to undergo alone , especially considering the unsettled state of New Haven town , being publicly declared , from the deliberate judgment of the most nnderstanding men , to be a place of no comfortable subsistence for the present inhabitants there . But if Connecticut do join , the planters are generally willing to bear their just proportions for the erection and maintaining of a college there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kind proffer to the setting forward of such a work . ' " Whether the foundation mentioned above wonid be considered as such , in a legal sense , may be doubted ; that it was the beginning of this seminary is certain , and from this period , the inhabitants of every description , particularly men of education and influence , embarked in the design with zeal . " In October , 1701 , the Legislature granted these gentlemen Lthe petitionersj a charter . constitnting them trustees of a collegiate school in his Majesty 's colony of Connecticut , ' and invested them with all the powers which were supposed to be necessary for the complete execution of their trust . " * From this extract two things are evident : first , that the colonists understood the fact that a single college might thrive where two colleges would be sure to fail ; and , secondly , that // the first movement made in Connecticut for the founding of a seminary of higher learning was made in the Legislature . It should be noted that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of this seminary . " The same high authority , moreover , after recording the fact that numerous and valuable donations had been received from private individuals , declares that the " principal benefactor , both during this period and all which have succeeded , was the Legislature . " * In confirmation of this statement , the author remarks that the Legislature in their first charter gave to the institution the annual sum of fifty pounds sterling , and continued this grant until the tear 1755 . At that time it was discontinued , on account of the heavy taxes occasioned by the last Canadian war . In 1750 , " Connecticut Hall " was erected froni money " principally furnished by the Legislature . " But the largest gift of the State was in 1792 . At this time the Legislature appropriated to the institution the arrearages of certain taxes which had for a considerable period been due to the State , on condition that the governor , lieutenant governor , and six senior councillors , for the time being , should , by vote of the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received as members of their board . This proposition was unanimously accepted by the board , and the income from the appropriation proved to be so considerable that the trustees were enabled immediately to make large and important improvements . With the money so obtained they purchased the whole front of the square on the northwestern side of the green , and on it erected three new academical buildings and a house for the president ; they made *a handsome addition to the library ; they procured " a complete philosophical and chemical apparatus " ; * and , finally , they established three new professorsimips . Thus it will be seen that down to the beginning of the present century , Yale College was chiefly indebted to the State Legislature for the means of its prosperity and its advancement . It would take us too far from our purpose to consider the history of each of the colleges founded previous to the IRcvolu * Dwight , I. 169. t Ibid. 173. // tion . But it will be enough to state that the methods of support which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Yale were in no respect exceptional . Wherever there was any interest in educational advancement , that interest showed itself as a rule in appropriations of money and lands for the benefit of the colleges and high schools . It has already been shown that the comprehensive liberality of Massachusetts extended to the appropriation of lands for the benefit of the academies . The same liberality was characteristic of the other Colonies . As early as 1701 , the very year of the first charter of Yale College , the Legislature of Connecticut established " a grammar school in each of the four chief counties to fit pupils for college , " and granted to each of them an annual appropriation . In New York the early progress of education was slow . In 1656 there were only three schools in the whole Province . But in 1659 a Latin school was started , and three years later we find that it was resorted to by pupils from the Hudson , the Delaware , and from Virginia . When in 1661 the Province fell into the hands of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due inquiry what progress hath been made towards the foundation and maintenance of any college schools for the education of youth . " The first movement after this inquiry resulted in an appropriation by the Colonial Assembly of ? 1,800 for a college , and seven years later , that is , in 1754 , in a royal charter . On the recommendation of the first president , the Lords of Trade reported to the Privy Council in favor of a grant of twenty thousand acres in the immediate vicinity of New York . In the more southern Provinces , appropriations for higher education were not less adequate . In Maryland the Legislature went so far as to make provision for high schools in all the counties as early as 1723 . To the schools thus established aid was given in money , and lands were appropriated in each of the connties . Still further in the same interest , a poll-tax of twenty shillings was imposed on negroes and Irish Catholic servants imported into the Province . Under these really luxurious provisions the academies thrived . Had time State gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 1875. 383 would have had the advantage of a head , it is difficult to see in what respect the schools of Maryland , taken as a whole , would have been inferior to those of New England . But a fatal mistake was committed . The State should either have endowed a strong university or college , whose superiority over the other schools would have been acknowledged , or it should have been content to send its pupils to colleges in the other States . But it did neither . In 1782 the school for Kent County applied to the Legislature for a college charter . The application was granted , and the institution took the name of Washington College . The number of students was somewhat augmented , but the kind of instruction was not materially changed . To the new college the State granted an annual appropriation of twelve hundred and fifty pounds . Two years later the school at Annapolis made a similar application , and was treated in a similar manner . This second institution was called St. John 's College , and was granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the small State of Maryland had two colleges at a time , when it would have been difficult to support a single one . Still further , the origin of the colleges had established certain jealousies which it was impossible to subdue . The superiority of the new instituti*n 's over what they had previously been was not so marked as to command respect , and , therefore , they were doomed to failure . As academies they had been admirable , as colleges they were nothing . So universal became the dissatisfaction , that in 1805 the State withdrew its aid altogether . In the same year St. Mary 's College was founded at Baltimore ; and thus the people who could scarcely keep alive two colleges with the help of regular legislative assistance , found three on their hands with the legislative appropriations withdrawn . This is , in our estimation , one of the saddest chapters in our educational history . President Sparks , in reviewing education in Maryland , has fitly remarked that " the efforts of this State in advancing the interests of learning have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise " ; * and yet , notwithstanding these munificent efforts , the cause of higher education , by reason of the dispersion of its resources , has dwindled into abject feebleness . Sad as this // chapter is , we are persuaded that no one can be studied with more profit by the present generation of Americans . In addition to what we have already remarked concerning the schools in Virginia , we shall only call attention to the system so urgently put forward by Jefferson . This great statesman saw , as no other person of equal prominence has seen , the desirability of coi*iuecting all the schools of the State in a simple organic whole . His system was essentially the system of Prussia . He proposed that every township should have at least one free English school ; that the whole State should be divided into ten districts , in each of which should be a gymnasium or college ; and , finally , that the system should be made complete by the establishment of a single great university . The whole system was to be supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Legislature as early as the year 1779 . It was l ) ursued by Jefferson with the most determined perseverance for nearly fifty years . But his worthy zeal was in vain . So long as he endeavored to raise the College of William and Mary to the rank required for a university , his project was opposed by all dissenters , for the reason that the college was strongly Episcopalian . As soon as he abandoned the college , and proposed to endow a separate university , the project was opposed by the college and by the l ) est of its powerful friends . When it was proposed to remove William and Mary to Richmond , and to have two universities in the State , Jefferson himself saw that it would be impossible to support the two , and that the plan , therefore , involved ultimate disaster . Thus it was impossible to concentrate a sufficient force to carry out the statesman 's design , and the most magnificent educational project yet devised in this country was destined to virtual failure . The merit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson found himself obliged to limit his efforts to the founding of a State university , he found his project shorn of its real means of success . A university without good subordinate schools is like a supreme bench without efficient subordinate courts . The University of Virginia failed to realize the hopes of its great founder and its numerous friends , because the State had neglected to provide preparatory schools . Even the great universities of Germany rest upon // the gymnasia as their foundation . To suppose that any great university can flourish without the support of efficient schools , is to suppose that a great edifice will stand in mid-air . In the Carolinas the schools of all grades were , from the first , under the nominal support of the State ; but no efficient system was i ) 1ovided for , and , consequently , no high success was attained . The Constitution adopted by North Carolina in 1776 made it the duty of the Legislature * " to establish schools for the convenient instruction of youth . " It also required the establishment of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secured ; the Legislature was indifferent , and universal Inefficiency was the result . In South Carolina the educational spirit was somewhat more creditable to the people of the State . As early as 1700 the Legislature provided for a free school at Charleston , and gave efficient support to the country schools . The fruits of this policy soon began to be seen . During the first half of the eighteenth century , - indeed , as late as to the outbreak of the IRevolutionary war , - a greater number of students went to Europe for a university education , from South Carolina , than from any other Colony . The want of facilities for higher education within the borders of the State , however , came to be seriously felt . In 1769 a bill was introduced into the Legislature for founding a college , but this , for various reasons , was defeated . In 1785 , however , the effort was renewed . Not content with a single college , the Legislature now provided for three . Ten years later , a fourth was added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar policy had been in Maryland , - just what it must be everywhere . The State had , at best , but few students who desired a collegiate education . Some of these went to Europe , some of them went to the North . The remaining number , when distributed among four colleges , was ridiculously inadequate to any respectable appearance . The tendency of very small numbers is invariably to depress the standards of scholarship . So it was , of course , in South Carolina . Within ten years the four colleges had " descended to the rank of grammar schools " ; and the Legislature felt compelled to take the subject once more in hand . This it did wisely and fearlessly . In 1801 it established the South Caro // lina College on so liberal a plan , that the institution was at once raised far above all rivalry with the other colleges . The latter sank to their proper condition of preparatory schools , while the former became supreme . The educational influence of the college , thus established , and continued under the inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not be easy to exaggerate . In less than twenty years after the founding of the college , the State Legislature had given to it as much as $ 286,000 , - a sum which at the beginning of this century was truly magnificent . But no State ever made a better investment . During the first half of this century the general accomplishments and . the political ability of the statesmen of South Carolina were the just pride of the State , and would have been the pride of any State . In forming this high standard of intellectual and political power , the influence of the college was immeasurable . If objection be raised against the political doctrines generally held by its alumni , the answer is , that the heresy of the South had its origin and its inspiration , not in one who was educated in South Carolina , but in one who was educated in Connecticut . The youngest of time thirteen original States presents no exceptioii to the spirit which we have seen manifested elsewhere . The Constitution of Georgia , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county should " establish and keep a school at the public expense . " Eight years later the Legislature took hold of the work of developing time schools into a complete system . To this end it was enacted " that the county surveyors , immediately after the passage of this act , shall p*ceed to lay out in each county twenty thousand acres of land for the endowment of a college er seminary of learning , and which said lands shall be vested in and granted to his honor the governor for the time being . " On the basis of this appropriation a university was h ) laced at the head of the school system of the State . The endowment was amply sufficient to provide not only for its present wants , but also for its perpetuation . It is not our purpose to inquire into the causes of educatiomial success and failure in the original States . It is enough to have shown that , during the whole of our colonial history , the support // of the public treasury was comprehensively bestowed alike upon the colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to note that no discrimination was made in favor of the one class or the other . But soon after the independence of the country was secured , a change took place . New elements began to complicate the educational question . Though the colleges , as *vel1 as the subordinate schools , had been nominally under secular control , yet the religious spirit of the time was very intense , and this intensity sho*ved itself to a very considerable extent in the schools . During the colonial period the dissenting sects had been comparatively feeble . But now they began to acquire strength . They not only grew , but they multiplied . They saw the necessity of an educated clergy . They perceived that an educated clergy could best be secured by means of schools of their own . In the course of fifty years colleges were planted by the score in the interests of the sects , where , in the interests of education , scarcely a single one was needed or could have been supported . The effect of this new tendency was doubly disastrous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the students between so great a number of institutions . It depressed the standard of scholarship in both professors and students . But this was not the whole , nor , indeed , the worst result . Its most disastrous consequence was in the fact that it paralyzed all efforts to secure appropriation for higher education from the State legisThtures . The State could not support all , and therefore no course was open but for it to withdraw its support altogether , and to turn over the colleges to the various religious denominations in whose interests they had been founded. , Thus in the course of the first quarter of the present century an entire revolution in our educational system was wroug*h t . The State had formerly supported generously both the higher schools and the lower ; now , it retained control of the lower , while it substantially abandoned all interest in the colleges and universities . The most immediate result of this abandonment of the early policy of the country was an enormous increase in the number of colleges . As soon as the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the will of the public , various considerations increased the general tendency . Local pride often had much to do with the founding of new institutions , or with the raising of old ones out of their proper sphere . A still greater influence was exerted in the same direction by denominational feeling . Does our denomination need a college or an additional college in this State ? Can we in any possible way get one planted ? These are the questions that have generally been asked , the questions that have determined the establishment of the new institutions . The last thing considered is the question whether or not such a college is needed by the public at large . A few thousand dollars are secured for the beginning of an endowment . Ambitious localities are ready to encourage the new project by giving lands , and perhaps erecting buildings . As soon as the infant college is fairly brought into life , its struggle for existence begins . It receives gifts of books , largely from superannuated clergymen and members of Congress , and calls them a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a museum . If it offers to its professors very small salaries , it strikes the balance , Charles Lamb fashion , by giving them an excess of work . But in the scramble of so many colleges for the means of existence , something more than these inducements is necessary to secure any respectable number of students . A preparatory school is therefore established in connection with the college . By nursing the scholars through a number of years of preliminary training , it is hoped that a considerable number will be induced to take the college course . But notwithstanding these efforts , the number of students in the college classes remains ridiculously small . Though the institution calls itself a college , and persists in being known as a college , an examination of its catalogue reveals the fact that it is but one tenth college , while it is nine tenths preparatory school . Now , we are not blind to the fact that under certain circumstances this state of educational affairs would not only be no reproach , but would even be a just cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-denial of the fathers in founding our earliest colleges . But the circumstances which surrounded the fathers , and made their devotion // so praiseworthy , no longer exist . The gift of two mites was admirable , not because it was two mites , but because its giver was a poor widow . The two mites of the millionnaire are ridiculous and contemptible . If we were to establish the proportion we should have to say : As the State was to the college then , so is the State to the college now . But how far , how very far , from the truth Would this proportion be ! If the policy of the founders of our country had been generally followed , it is difficult to see why we might not have had crc this universities that would compare favorably with those of the Old World . It is often said that we are too young to have great schools ; but there is no more absurd mistake than to suppose that universities must be venerable before they can be great . The great schools at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present century , and the youngest of them has some two hundred professors and more than two thousand students . In comparison with these , what single institution have we that can for a moment be considered worthy of the wealth , the intelligence and the enterprise of our country ? We believe that all who are familiar with what a great university ought to be , and is , will answer that we have not a single one . It would be difficult to determine how far the tendency to which we have referred has influenced the respect of the public for higher education . There can be no doubt that it has tended to depress the standards of scholarship . Reasoning d priori we should say also that it would tend to diminish the esteem in which colleges and college education are held . But we are not left to the uncertainties of d priori reasoning . Statistics have been accumulated which show beyond all question that since about 1830 the number of students seeking a collegiate education has steadily diminished . Nor is this diminution confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , for examNe , from all New England , attending colleges throughout the country , was not materially greater in 1869 than it had been in 1838 , although the population in the mean time had increased by more than fifty per cent . To be more precise , the ratio of students from New England in all the colleges of the country , in 1838 , was one in every twelve hundred and ninety-four ; while in 1869 it was only one in // nineteen hundred and twenty-seven . * In the country as a whole , the number of students in college in 1870 was somewhat less than it had been in 1860 , though the population of the country had increased by more than thirty-three per cent.t That this diminution was in part occasioned by the war is quite probable , but we are prevented from attaching too great importance to this cause by the fact that the number had been steadily diminishing for more than twenty years . In 1840 the number of students in college in the whole country was in proportion to the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one in two thousand and twelve ; while in 1869 it had declined to as low as one in two th6usand five hundred and forty-six. * * These and the following figures are all taken from the elaborate stati*tics prepared by President Barnard , of Columbia College , and Published in his Reports of 1870 . They were made out from inspection of catalogues from all the colleges and universities in the country , and are , without doubt , approximately correct . The uumber of students from the States of New England in all the colleges of the country , in proportioa to the population , is more elaborately showa by the following table - Years . Maine New Massa- Rhode Con- New Vermont nampshire. chusetts . Island . necticut .

Report for 1870 , p. 57. t This proportion is more fully shown by the followin' finures . The number of students for 1869 is somewhat conjectural , inasmuch as sixty-five of the colleges in the country did not respond to the request for catalogues . It is assumed that the number of students in each of these sixty-five colleges is the same as in each of the others , after deducting the twenty-eight colleges of New England , New York , and New Jersey . This assumption , however , is doubtless ex*essive , and consequently gives the number of students as greater than the facts would warrant . It accounts , moreover , for the discrepancy between these fi*ures and those above given . 1840. 1860. 1869 . Population 14,582029 27,490266 36,000,000 Students 9,416 13,661 14,141 Ratio 1 : 1549 1 : 2,012 1 : 2546 // Thus it is evident that the number of undergraduate students in the country , for the thirty or forty years previous to 1870 , was not only diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period was very remarkable . What the tendency since 1870 has been , we have at hand no means of determining . Now , whatever may have been the specific causes that have colltril ) uted to this diminution , - and they are doubtless several in number , - it is evident we are forced to the general conclusion that the colleges of to-day , as a whole , preseiit less attractions to young men than did the colleges in the early part of the century . It may have been partly because courses of study have not conformed to the public demand . It may have l ) een in a measure owing to the intense mercenary spirit which for the last forty years has had possession of the country . But in our opinion it is far more largely due to the insignificance of the modern college in the popular imagination . Ambitious young men who aspire to professional and political honors bend their chief energies to the means of helping themselves on . Forty-two colleges in a single State are sure to be insignificant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination attaches to them very- lit tie importance and , as a matter of fact , the graduate finds that his degree has given him little or no advantage over his fellow . The ambitious young man , therefore , is quite likely to eschew the college and betake himself at once to the more attractive experiences of the office and the political stump . This is no fanciful picture , but one that may be shown to be absolutely true to the facts . The popular impression , at least among literary men , is that college graduates are considerably less numerous and less conspicuous in the professions and in political liEc than were men of a similar edneation fifty or a hundred years ago . rrhle popular impression is doubtless correct . In regard to the professions it is , perhaps , difficult to speak with great confidence or precision ; but in regard to the prominence of college-bred men in political life , the position admits of absolute demonstration . A study of the dictionaries will show beyond all question that the number of graduates elected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected in the early days of the Republic . We had supposed this to be the case ; but after a somewhat wearisome turning over of Drake and Lanman , we have found the difference to be even greater than we had suspected . Of the signers of the Declaration of Independence , for example , thirty out of fifty-six were college-bred ; of the Senate of the First Congress , fifteen out of twenty-six ; while of the Forty-first Congi*ess , the latest of which we could procure exact information , the proportion from the same States was only seven out of twenty-six . If the investigation were to be extended to the house of Representatives and to the dther States , the comparison would probably be still less favorable . Be that as it may , it is too evident that for some reason or other the graduate of to-day is not so likely to be the man chosen by the people as was the graduate in the early days of the Republic . It thus becomes just as obvious that college graduates , as a class , arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it to be that they are relatively less numerous . It needs only to be said , in concluding this part of our subject , that the responsibility of this serious , if not even alarming , tendency rests alone with our present educational system . It can not be said to rest with the colleges , for it would be unjust to demand of them the impossible . They accomplish all , be it said without qualification , that colleges under these limitatiohs are able to accomplish . As a rule they are administered by men who , for ability , for earnestness , and for devotion would at least compare favorably with any other class of men to be found in the country . But they are bound hand and foot by the poverty of the means they have to do with . Probably no American educator has visited the alcoves and the museums of a European university without turning away . heartsick at the thought of the meagre appliances to which he must return . For this meagreness there is of course no remedy , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any radical change for the better until , by some means or other , the number of colleges ranking themselves with the highest is reduced . To this end we believe that every consideration of true policy requires that the interest of the people should be concentrated upon a limited number of the larger and stronger // colleges and universities . We believe that these should be raised into such conspicuous pre-eminence that the smaller and weaker ones will cease to be regarded as on the same level or to be entitled to rank in the same class . We believe that in no other way can higher education be raised to the rank which it now holds in Europe , or even to the rank which it formerly held in our own country . If in the older States it is impracticable to enlist the legislatures in the work of raising the few at the expense of the many , the hope of a favorable change must rest upon the basis of private benevolence . But in the newer States where State universities have been established , no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacle in the way of a large policy of legislative liberality similar to that which characterized the early history of New England . With the vast wealth of the West to support it , such a policy could not fail to build up a series of universities that would be a real credit to the land . The early history of the State universities , foi reasons which Mr. Ten Brook has made amply obvious , has not been without its vicissitudes . In several of the Western States the work of moulding the educational policy fell into the hands of narrow and inefficient men . In such instances a short-sighted policy was pursued . For the sake of immediate results lands were often sacrificed for a mere pittance , when by patiently holding them an ample endowment might have been secured . In other cases the lands fell into the control of corrupt men , whose only interest seems to have been to use their opportunities for their own advantage . In almost every instance too great haste has been shown to dispose of university lands , and to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the respective land-grants , Mr. Ten Brook has treated much more at length the history of the University of Michigan . Indeed , it is to this history that a greater part of the volume is devoted . For this the reader will be grateful , inasmuch as the University of Michigan has been the most successful of State universities , and , for this reason , has the most valuable lesson to teach . The educational spirit manifested in the early history of Michigan is worthy of great admiration . Care was taken // from the very first to make the most ample provision for schools . As early as 1827 , four years after the organization of the legislative council , an act was passed requiring that " every township containing fifty families should provide themselves with a schoolmaster , of good morals , to teach children to read and write , and to instruct them in the English and French languages , as well as in arithmetic , orthography , and decent behavior , for such terms as shall be equivalent to six months for one school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred families should provide for a school for an increased length of time " ; and that " every township containing two hundred families should be provided with a grammar schoolmaster of good morals , and well instructed in the Latin , French , and English languages . " These provisions , which remind one so forcibly of early New England , were strengthened by a penalty levied in case of failure and paid over to the schools which had complied with the law . Eight years later , when the Territory applied to Congress for admission as a State , we find the same spirit embodied in the petition . Iiistcad of imitating the example of the other States of the Northwest Territory , by granting section sixteen of every township to " each township respectively for the use of schools , " Michigan kept the fund as a unit , and administered it for the good of the schools as a wholes The difficulties under which the other States have labored have been almost innumerable , owing to the fact that in many of the townships the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , on the contrary , a distinct department of public instruction was created , and the administration of the schoolfund was intrusted to its boards . The result has been the establishment of a very large permanent fund and the erection of a school system which may challenge comparison with that of any other State in the Union . Still more marked , if not more important , were the early provisions for a university . In 1817 , ten years before the adoption of the law above referred to , providing for common schools , the Territorial government passed an act to establish the " Catholepistemiad , or University of Michigania . " The act itself is a curiosity in the history of education . It not only // 895 State Universities . provided for the establishment of " thirteen Didaxum or Professorships , " but it indicated the manner in which the university was to be supported . It declares that for this purpose , " the existing public taxes are hereby increased fifteen per cent , and from the proceeds of the I ) resent and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of the Catholepistemiad or University . " Still further , in imitation of the means by which the College of New Jersey had s3cured an endowment , the university was authorized " to prepare and draw four successive lotteries , deducting from the prizes of the same fifteen per cent for the benefit of the institution . " Four years after the adoption of these extraordinary provisions , a supplemental act was passed appointing the trustees , and determining the general policy of the university . Section five of this act was the most important , inasmuch as it gave to the institution its place in the school system of the Territory , and determined its policy in matters of religion to be precisely identical with that of the common schools . It provided that the trustees of the university " might from time to time establish such colleges , academies , and schools dependent upon the university , as they might think proper ; made it the duty of the trustees to inspect such colleges , academies , and schools ; to examine into the state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yearly report ; to ordain rules for the government of the institution not inconsistent with the laws of the United States or of the Territory ; and to appoint a president and professors and to remove them at pleasure . It further provided that " persons of every religious denomination were capable of being elected trustees , and no person , president , professor , instructor , or pupil , was to be refused admittance for his conscientious persuasion in matters of religion . " From this early legislation , two very important conclusions may be drawn . The first is that in the very earliest history of the State the importance of a great university was earnestly felt ; and the second , which is really of still greater moment , is that the government was in the hands of men who fully appreciated the importance of building up the school system , not in parts , 1 ) ut as a whole . The influence of this early // direction of public opinion in the Territory it is impossible to value too highly . When the State was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for the appointment of a State Superintendent of Public Instruction . To the great advantage of the cause of education , the Rev. John D. Pierce was appointed to the position . Indeed , no better appointment could have been made . We do not know how any one can read the early Reports of this superintendent without greatly admiring the breadth , the enlightenment , and the genuine wisdom with which they are filled . The University of Michigan is not the product of any one man ; but if we were called upon to designate the one to whom in our opinion it owes most , we should say , without much hesitation , it was Superintendent Pierce . Educated at Brown University , he had early devoted himself to the study of educational systems , and had become a great admirer of the system of Prussia . The details of this system were his chief guide in framing the system which he recommended for Michigan . his first Report was laid before the Legislature on the 5th of January , 1837 . It sketched with considerable fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State should he . After developing at length the subject of the lower and intermediate schools , the report treated with especial fulness the organization of the university . Three departments were recommended , precisely those which were afterwards established . After maintaining that schools of law and medicine should he established as parts of the university , the superintendent treats the subject of theology in the following terms : - " But whatever may be the advantages of such a connection , it is not to be expected that the study of theology as a profession can ever be made a separate department of the university . There is no connection , and it is devoutly to be hoped there never will be , between Church and State under our government . We have , therefore , no establishment , and consequently no ministry to provide for it . The diff*rent denominations , being left free in the exercise of their religions , are at liberty to adopt such measures for the training of the ministry of their respective churches as they may deem most desirable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ; and it would be usurpation on the part of the State to assume to interfere in its direction . But so far as the great principles of the science of theology are concerned , they necessarily come within the compass of that general knowledge with which every welleducated young man ought to be acquainted . The mighty evidences of the divine existence , resulting from the unnumbered manifestations of contrivance and design throughout the universe of matter and of mind , and the basis on which Christianity has reared its stupendous fabric and founds its claims to the confidence and affection of the world , would be fruitful topics for the predilections of such a professorship as is proposed to be established . Besides , it will be found to be essential to the prosperity of the university . Without something of the kind it would be abandoned by all religious denominations . We should then have presented to our view the spectacle of a university on the broadest foundation , and splendidly endowed , but without students ; while private institutions , struggling for existence , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Christianity is the religion of the people , it must be recognized as coming within the circle of general knowledge , though they will suffer no interference in the formation of their religious opinions . It is all important to secure the interests of the great body of the people in the welfare of the university . But the great mass of them will be found attached to the different denominations of Christians . Nothing , therefore , should be done to excite jealousy or create alarm . And it is equally important that no religious test be introduced , but that every individual be left free in the exercise of his religion , and to worship as his conscience shall dictate . No flourishing institution can be found which does not embrace so much as is here proposed ; every attempt on a different plan hitherto made has proved an entire failure In respect to the assertion that State institutions do not and can not flourish , it may safely be affirmed that the history of the past proves directly the reverse . The oldest and most venerable institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted , came up , increased in stature , and attained to the maturity and vigor of manhood , under the guidarice and patronage of the State . There have been no failures , except in the cases named , and obviously for the reason assigned . The same is true of nearly all the celebrated European universities ; they are state institutions , founded , sustained , and directed by the state . It is all important that the University of Michigan , in its constitution and order , be such as to secure the confidence of the liberal minded of all denominations , and then it may be expected that they will give it countenance and support . " // Another part of Superintendent 's Pierce 's Report we can not refrain from quoting , as it touches in energetic language upon a subject to which we have already referred . On the subject of granting charters for private colleges , lie says : - " XVhen this decision is finally made , it will not require the inspiration of a prophet to determine whether the State shall eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding and rearing up an institution of noble stature and just proportions , worthy alike of the State and of learning , and equally worthy the name of university , or whether the State shall ultimately sink to a low level in the world of knowledge , having institutions under the imposing name of colleges scattered through the length and breadth of the land , , without funds , without cabinets , without apparatus , without libraries , without talents , without character , and without the ability of ever maintaining them . If one is granted , others must be , and there is no limit . If one village obtains a charter for a college , all others must have the same favor . In proportion as they increase in number , just in that proportion will be their decrease of power to be useful . " It is curious to note , moreover , with what pains Superintendent Pierce reinforced his recommendations on this importaut sut*ject . He had procured the opinions of several of the most prominent educators on the question . In answer to his inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am qualified to judge , the plan of concentrating your energies in one nuiversity is incomparably preferable to that of granting university charters to an indefinite number of private institutions . By a great number of small and badly appointed colleges you will increase the nominally educated men , but you will decrease the power of education , because it will be little else but the name . " To the same question Mr. Everett replied : " I should think one institution of a high order would be as much as you could expect to found and sustain . You will not understand me , " continues he , " as at all underrating the importance of academies and schools . I deem them quite as important as colleges . But it is not useful to grant to academies and schools the privilege of conferring degrees . If the question is between one well endowed and amply provided institution and several languishing on an inadequate public and // private patronage , - which , if several are attempted , will be apt to be their condition , - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . " President Brown , of Pennsylvania , wrote that " the Legislature should guard against an undue multiplication of colleges , and that iii order to do this no charter should be granted to any association , except on condition of having procured such an amount of funds as will procure respectability by supplying al ) le professors and the proper college accommodations . " President Mellvane wrote that Michigan had " a noble opportunity of taking and holding dignified ground oii this subject ; of building a breakwater against the winds and waves , by which other less independent institutions are in danger of being overwhelmed " ; and concluded by recommending that this opportunity " be improved by having but one place of degrees in Michigan . " * The policy so vigorously advocated by the first superintendent was sufficient to prevent , for the most part , if it did not absolutely prevent , that multiplication of colleges which has been the bane of higher education in the other States of the North west.f The next great step in the history of the University was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately this was not completely done , but it was so nearly accomplished that the Board of Regents became substantially independent . In 1840 a select committee was appointed to inquire into the condition of the university , and to ascertain what steps were necessary , if any , to insure its full and permanent success . The report of the committee is of great length , and discusses many subjects of importance . It refers to the fact that no State institution has l ) rospered so well as * Shearruan , " Public Instruction and School Law , " p. 40. t In addition to the credit of having outlined so admirably the policy of the univer*itv , Superintendent Pierce is also entitled to the praise of having saved it at one time from financial ruin . The State law required that the architect 's designs for the bnildin ; s of the university , after being adopted by the Board of Re* cuts , should receire the approval of the superintendent . At a time when the financial condition of the university looked especially hopeful , a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out , wotild , by its magnificence , have completely swamped the irtstitntion . Fortunately , it received the unexpected veto of the superintendent , and thns more than half a million was saved , at a time when the whole fund did not greatly exceed that amount . // some of the independent colleges , and ascribes it for the most part to the manner in which State universities have been controlled . The following extract from the rcport is of great interest , inasmuch as it gives , not only the views of the committee , but also the policy which was adopted , and which accounts in great part for the prosperity of the University of Michigan . We think it will hardly be denied that there is embodied in its crude rhetoric a great amount of educational wisdom - " State institutions have fallen into the hands of the several legislatures , - fluctuating bodies , chosen with reference to their supposed qualifications for other duties than cherishing literary institutions . When legislatures have legislated directly for colleges , their measures have been as fluctuating as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have acted through a board of trustees , under the show of giving a representation to all , they have appointed men of such discordant and dissimilar views , that they never could act- in concert , so that whilst supposed to act for and represent everybody , they , in fact , have not and could not act for anybody . Again , legislatures wishing to retain the power of the State in their own hands , have not been willing to appoint trustees for a length of time sufficient for them to become acquainted with their duties ; to become interested in the cause which they were appointed to watch over , and to f*ei the deep responsibility of the trust . A new board of trustees , not knowing well what to do , generally begins by undoing and disorganizing all that has been done before . At first they dig up the seed a few times to see if it is going to come up , and after it appears above the surface , they must pull it up to see that the roots are sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is sufficient root to support so numerous branches , then lop off the branches for fear they will exhaust the root , and then pull it up again to see why it looks so sickly and pining , and finally to see if they can discover what made it die . And as these several operations are performed by successive hands , no one can be charged with the guilt of destroying the tree . Thus has State after State in this American Union endowed universities , and then , by repeated contradictory and over legislation , torn them to pieces with the same facility as they do the statute book , and for the same reason , because they have the right The university is too sacred to be made the foot-ball of party . If it sinks once , life will be extinct before it will rise again . To secure to the university , and thereby to the State , the benefit of a Board of Reg*znts having // experience and enjoying the confidence of the entire community , and having time and opportunity to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herewith submit a bill . It proposes to exempt this subject from becoming a prey of politics ; to give permanence and thereby efficiency to the board charged with executing the great work of rearing a university with dependent branches ; and to put upon this permanent board of well-known individuals the entire responsibility of accomplishing this work What the Legislature should attempt in reference to the university is , in the opinion of the committee , to put the whole subject into the hands of competent men , leaving it with undivided responsibility on their shoulders , and then the Legislature not meddle with it again except to protect as guardians , not to destroy as capricious despots . Repeated legislative interference , known by experience to be the ruin of a cause like this , would soon dishearten every regent who takes an interest or active part in the duties of his office The duties of the regents , in their turn , will be mostly to provide the means and apparatus , and the like , and fill the several faculties with able men , and throw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The further duties of the regents are only to watch and defend , and not to interfere with the growth of what they have planted . A board of experienced regents can manage the funds of the university better than any legislature ; and the faculty can manage the business of education - the interior of a college - better than any regents . " No formal action on this report seems to have been taken , and yet the policy which is so vigorously set forth in it became the general policy of the university . From the first the institution was kept in the hands of a Board of Regents , appointed for the special purpose of directing and controlling its affairs . From the first , also , its interior workings were con- ' ducted exclusively by the respective faculties . To this separation of powers , and this absence of officious interference , very much of the prosperity of the university is to be attributed . During a portion of the history of the institution the regents have been appo*nted by the governor , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but whether elected or appointed , they have pr*ctically given to the faculties entire control of the work of instruction and discipline , while they have strenuously resisted all interference of the Legislature in the // administration of the finances and the appointment of professors . Their policy on this last point is well illustrated by their treatment of the legislative provision requiring the appointment of a professor of homceopatby in the School of Medicine . For nearly twenty years a law requiring such an appointment has been upon the statute-books of the State . But the regents became convinced that such an appointment would greatly injure the Medical School , if , indeed , it would not utterly destroy it . They therefore resisted the law , and defended their resistance on the ground that the Constitution gave the general management of the university into their hands , and not into the hands of the Legislature . Two attempts to overthrow this defence in the Supreme Court failed ; and it was not until after the Legislature had made special provision for a separate and distinct homceopathic school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one respect , however , the institution has not been free from the embarrassments rising from legislative control . Though in the direct management of tho institution the Legislature has had no voice , yet in the care of its lands the same exemption was unfortunately not provided for . The legislative dealings with the early financial history of the university more than justifies the language used in the report above quoted coiicerning the dangers of legislative interference . Though of late the Legislature of the State has manifested a wise and generous policy toward the university , yet it is entirely erroneous to suppose that the institution owes its prosperity thus far to any financial assistance it has received from the State . Mr. Ten Brook has very clearly showii that , were a balance to be struck to-day , it would be found that the university fund has been injured by unwise legislation far more than it has been augmented by direct appropriations . A few facts will be enough to show the justice of this comparison . The Congressional act of 1826 gave to Michigan the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at the time was exceptional , was turned to so good account that , ten years later , Superintendent Pierce , in his first IReport , estimated the value of the lands at not less than $ 20 per acre . Nor does this estimate appear to have been extrava // gant ; for , in the following year , when lands of no exceptional value were offered for sale , they brought an average price of $ 22.85 per acre . But immediately after this promising beginning a series of legislative acts followed , which brought great embarrassment to the Board of Regents . The first of these acts , approved in 1838 , authorized the release of sixteen sections of land that had been located in 1830 . The conditions of the releasing act were , that Congress should grant the same number of sections elsewhere , to be estimated by a person named in the act , to be of equal value less the improvements that had been made by actual settlers . The object of the act was to secure titles to settlers who had planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the lands had been so occupied was sufficient evidence of their great value , and it was absurd to suppose that in 1838 government lands could be located which would equal in value the best that had been located in 1830 . Yet the Legislature did not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the university for those of the settlers , though the latter bad no claims whatever to the lands . A still more remarkable instance of a similar kind occurred in 1839 . A bill was introduced " for the relief of certain settlers on university and State lands , " proposing , on certain conditions , difficult to be defined , to sell to such settlers the lands which they occupied at the government price of $ 1.25 per acre . This , it should be remembered , was two years after the Superintendent had estimated the value of the lands at $ 20 per acre . Now the Legislature proposed to sell the best of the lands at $ 1.25 . Against the bill the Board of Regents remonstrated , but with out effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his approval . The event was a crisis in the history of the university . If the action of the Legislature should be sanctioned by the governor , the university would be ruined . Governor Mason was but twenty-seven years of age . Every political interest would seem to have urged his approval of the measure . If he had given it his sanction , the university would have been quickly deprived of the means of life , and would have been in the future of no more consequence in education than any other of the two hundred colleges of the Western States ; no one , moreover , would have thought ill of the governor for his ap // proval . But the first paragraph of his message shows how far he was above all personal motives - " I return without my signature , to the house in which it originated , a bill entitled An Act for the relief of certain settlers on university and State lands . ' In refusing my sanction to the provisions of this bill , I am governed by an imperious sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my official oath . The determination I make is a painful one . It has been formed , however , after mature and anxious deliberation , and can not be resisted . " This veto saved the university . Next to the first Report of the first Superintendent of Public Instruction , it should be regarded as the most precious document in the archives of the institution . When the university hall comes to be properly adorned with the memorials of the founders and benefactors of the university , if the statue of Superintendent Pierce shall be thought entitled to the first place , that of Governor Mason should certainly receive the second . But notwithstanding the temporary relief afforded by this veto , the Legislature persisted in tampering with the prices and sales of the lands . By an act of 1840 , nearly five thousand acres were sold at an average price of $ 6.21 per acre , the whole sum realized making an aggregate of somewhat more than $ 78,000 less than these lands would have brought at the average price of the sales thirteen years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have been paid as a premium for squatting upon the lands without buying them . But not content with this , the squatters demanded and received still greater favors . In 1842 , the minimum price was fixed at $ 12 per acre , and was even made retrospective . The superintendent 's report for the following year shows that $ 34,651 were actually returned to purchasers either in money or credits . The sales up to that time had amounted to some $ 220,000 ; and yet , by means of this retrospective legislation , the sum realized was $ 93,000 less than it otherwise would have been . If it be urged , in extenuation of this act , that the severity of the times made it necessary that the settlers should have relief , the rejoinder is , that the relief should have been afforded by the State , and not have been extorted from the university . The great care with which the lands had been located , as well // as the experience of the superintendent in securing sales previous to the tampering legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote period the whole of the lands could be sold at an average price of not less than the minimum which had been originally established . This result , probably , could not have been reached at once , but there is good reason to believe it could ultimately have been attained . This would have given to the university a fund of not less than $ 921,000 . It was on the expectation that at least this sum would be realized that the early plans of the regents were laid ; and yet the persistent tampering of the Legislature , as here indicated , was enough to reduce the fund to about $450,000 , or less than one half of the amount above named . Whether in the heart of this unfortunate legislation there was any corrupt motive or not , the series of enactments , as a whole , affords an excellent illustration of the danger of submitting even the financial affairs of a university to legislative control . During the past years the Legislature has made liberal appropriations , but it has not yet by any means repaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a very simple computation to show that , had the policy of the regents *ziever been interfered with on the one hand , and had the Legislature never made any appropriation for the university on the other , the institution would now have been far richer than it is . But we are not without faith that the Legislature will yet repair the injury inflicted by its early indiscretions . Fortunately the injury was of such a nature as to be easily remedied by so ample a treasury as that of Michigan . We have already remarked that in the design of the first superintendent the university was to be an integral part of the school system . In furtherance of this design , ten branches of the university were early established in as many different parts of the State . These branches were sustained largely from the university fund . They took the rank and did the work of preparatory schools . They were under the direction of the university itself ; and consequently the quality of instruction given was of a high order . Their influence in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State must have been considerable . But the time came when the university fund could no longer endure the depletion // which these schools required . We have seen how the financial anticipations of the first superintendent were disappointed . As it became apparent , moreover , that the treasury of the university was to be inadequate to the demand , it was also found that the branches were not altogether fortunate in their location . In the rapid growth of the State , iiew towns had sprung up , which in many instances had come to exceed in importance those to which in the beginning they had been vastly inferior . The new towns established high schools , and the branches of the university declined in relative importance . These adverse influences finally severed the official bond be-. tween the university and the schools . Fortunately , however , this act of severance did not take place until the branch schools had done an important work . They had given to the high schools a model , and they had kept the field clear of private academies . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no State in the Union has greater reason to be proud of her high schools than has Michigan , the fact is largely owing to the early influence of the branches of the university . The present relations of the university and the high schools form one of the most interesting features of the educational system of Michigan . Though the university has no authority over the schools , yet there exists a semi-official bond of union between them . They have , if we may use the figure , entered into diplomatic relations by which both parties are benefited . These relations have been imitated in some of the other States , but , so far as we know , the University of Michigan is entitled to the credit of having inaugurated what may now fairly be called a system . The following notice , published annually in the University Calendar , will convey to the reader an adequate notion of the relations to which we refer : " A committee of the Faculty will visit , once every year , any public high school in Michigan , on request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Faculty . If the Faculty shall be satisfied from such report that the Preparatory Courses of Study in the school thus visited embrace all the subjects required for admission to the university , and are taught by competent instructors , then the graduates from such preparatory courses will he admitted to the Freshman class of the university without examination . They must present to the // president , within three months after their graduation , the diplomas of their school board , certifying that they have sustained their examinations in cdl the studies prescribed for admission to one of the three courses , Classical , Scientific and Engineering , or Latin and Scientific . They will also be required to appear at once in their classes , otherwise they can he admitted only after examination . The privilege of admission on diploma is limited to public schools in Michigan , and their school boards must make the application annually . " A careful inspection of the conditions embodied in this Notice to Preparatory Schools will show that the system is guarded at every point . As it now stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the system occasionally admits a student to the university who on examination would be excluded , or admitted only under heavy conditions , this disadvantage is probably far more than counterbalanced by the general influence which the university is able to exert on the schools as a whole . The only objection which , so far as we have ever heard , has been raised to the system , is one which might with equal propriety be raised against the system that prevails in Prussia . Doubtless many are admitted to the German universities on diploma from the gymnasia , that would be excluded were they required to pass an entrance examination ; and yet in no other country are the mass of students so thoroughly prepared for their university work . No great university can afford to forget that a part of its work is the elevation of the preparatory schools . We can not take leave of this subject without remarking that the schools of Michigan appear to be more perfectly organized than are the schools of any other State in the Union . The cornmon.school fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high schools are prosperous , and are inspired by a vital connection with the university . The university itself during the past ten years has annually brought together about twelve hundred students . The policy of the State , moreover , is on the whole liberal . Within the past few years the Legislature has provided for the assessment of a regular tax for the support of the university ; and during the past winter special appropriations were made for the establishment of three distinet departments . Large additional appropriations will indeed // yet be needed , but the State is rich , and , it is hoped , will be not ungenerous . Best of all , the system is free from the embarrassment of complicated surroundings and distracting jealousies . In this respect it has no superior and probably has no equal . If , under all these favoring conditions , a policy of coinprehensive liberality is followed , the cause oT higher education in Michigan seems to us to have every possibility of greatness before it . Let the State appreciate her opportunity , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university in America . CHARLES KENDALL ADAMS . @
