txt A case was recently decided in the Exchequer Division of the High Court of Justice of England in which the momentous question at issue was , substantially , whether a person is liable in damages for giving a discharged servant a bad character and thereby preventing her from getting a new situation . This may seem a trivial matter to occupy such an imposing tribunal for three days , but it is seldom that the subject-matter of litigation comes home to a larger number of persons . Doubtless , the attention which the case attracted in London was largely due to the fact that the defendants were no less personages than the Duke and Duchess of WESTMINSTER , though as an affair of domestic experience it was quite typical . It was several years ago that the Duchess had JANE JONES as a lady 's maid , and concluded to employ in her stead one of foreign extraction , " up in the languages . " So she took the liberty of discharging JANE , whereupon the damsel proceeded to display a most remarkable attachment to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted hers elf in a most violent and unpleasant manner , insomuch that the family doctor was called in and her brother sent for to take her away . Notwithstanding this demonstration , the Duchess made her a liberal present and gave her a " recommend , " wherein she stated that JANE was a " perfectly honest , sober , and trustworthy person , " a " good hair-dresser and dress-maker , " and that " Lady WESTMINSTER only parts with her on account of preferring a foreigner . " But the maid failed to get over her attachment for the service which she had left so much against her will , or to recover from the resentment which her dismissal had aroused . In short , she lost no opportunity in annoying her Grace of WESTMINSTER and of saying spiteful things about her . The displays of bad temper and the tendency to hysterical performances were even carried into other families , by way of showing how unjustly she had been deprived of her favorite place in aristocratic service . The Duchess appears to have borne whatever of persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own relatives was in danger of being subjected to Miss JANE 'S freaks , whereupon she wrote what the jury seems to have regarded as the truth about the maid 's conduct . ate had " gone quite out of her mind " on the occasion of her dismissal , and again , while in the service of the Dowager Lady HUNTLEY , she had " proved most ungrateful and also very absurd ; " she had been " abusive and annoying , " and had " wrangled on religious subjects . " In short , one would infer from this letter of 1876 , which was made the subject of a libel suit , that JANE was anything but a desirable person to have in the house . The missive was shown to JANE and she was wroth , and as the information therein contained prevented her from obtaining employment , she determined to appeal to a jury of her countrymen for redress . This was , doubtless , unpleasant for people in the exalted station of the Duke and Duchess of WESTMINSTER , and they might easily have avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the irate damsel , but they deserve the gratitude of all housekeepers /for refusing to yield and putting to a rest the privilege of warning people against employing an undesirable servant . The only thing that placed the Duchess in an apparently equivocal position was her original recommendation , which was doubtless truthful so far as it went , but which considerately withheld any reference to the parting performances of the maid . It is also to be remembered that the girl exhibited the worst of her bad behavior after the certificate of character had been given her . But there is nothing more common in human experience than the giving of recommendations which do not tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth . In a vast majority of cases a domestic servant leaves a family because she does not give satisfaction or is not satisfied with her place . In either case , she can not remain acceptable and does not fill what that family must regard as the requirements of a good servant . She may be negligent , extravagant , slovenly , ill-tempered , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet she will expect a " character from her last place , " and nine times out of ten she will get it . - It will speak of her good qualities , and say nothing of the very things which the future employer will be most concerned to know . Few people have the heart to refuse a recommendation of some sort , for it is almost ' equivalent to giving the girl a bad character , and if one is given , it must be favorable so far as it goes , or it will not serve the purpose . It is an amiable weakness that induces people , especially ladies , to perpetrate these " white lies , " these colorless frauds , which convey incompetent or undesirable servants from family to family , and multiply the difficulties of housekeepers in obtaining satisfactory " help . " What are they to do ? They do not wish to blast a poor girl 's chance of employment , and they think ? others may get along with her , if they can not . Perhaps she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may overcome her faults , learn by her misfortune , be subject to good training , in short , turn out well after all ; who knows ? And so they send her on her way with a certificate that conveys half the truth , and an impression that is wholly false . Doubtless , if a friend or relative applies to them personally for information , they will , like the Duchess of WESTMINSTER , tell the truth and save them from the annoyance which they take the chance of inflicting upon the equally worthy but unknown people , whose convenience is a matter of indifference to them personally . It is a fine question of domestic ethics just where the line is to be drawn , and society will doubtless continue to use a free hand in the matter ; but there might well be a little more thought , and a trifle of conscientious regard for the claims of persons unknown shown in the matter . The Duchess of WESTMINSTER showed in her experience and conduct how much she is like the common order of human beings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good authority that it is altogether lawful , to say the least , to tell the truth about a discharged servant and prevent others from being the victims of her faults or caprices.
