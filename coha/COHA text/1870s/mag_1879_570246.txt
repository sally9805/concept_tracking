ARTICLE 1. - OUR TREATIES WiTH CHINA . THE recent discussions in Congress upon the Bill limiting the number of Chinese who can legally arrive in any one ship to fifteen persons , have had the effect of drawing general attention to the character of those Chinese who are now in our territory , and to our treaty relations with the Government of China , which nothing else has ever done . Few of our people probably knew that the United States bad treaties with China ; and still fewer were aware what stipulations in them involved duties and obligations on our part as well as on her 's , and could tell how we had performed them . It was generally known that we required the Chinese authorities to protect and defend our fellow-citizens within their jurisdiction , and that we had already obtained from that Government payment for losses incurred in former years . They were hardly aware that the treaties made between China and western Powers were more like so many Magna Chartas , or Bills of Rights , than ordinary treaties between nations on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the debates on this Bill , and to learn from the discussion that the Chinese in our midst are living under the sworn protection of this nation , having guaran. // ties that no other foreigners have , and that this Bill violated the ratified faith of the nation toward them . After it had passed Congress , the people simultaneously uttered their voice that such an act was impolitic ; - more than that , that it was needless ; - more still , that it was dishonorable , and what we would not do towards any other Power . The President 's veto has received their approval as a judicious , sound , and timely refusal to yield to a sectional demand to go back on a lifelong policy in regard to immigration from other lands , until at least there was a more cogent reason than now exists in this case of the Chinese . The reasons for that veto are all so compactly given in the Resolution offered by Mr. A. A. Low , at the meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce , Feb. 27th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : - " Resolved* That this Chamber deprecates the proposed law to restrict the immigration of Chinese to the United States , as establishing a bad precedent ; as an unworthy political concession to the lawless spirit of a single State , under whose laws the subjects of China have enjoyed neither peace nor safety ; as tending to degrade the national character in the sight of all other nations ; as calculated to imperil the life of the missionary , and impair the value of his teachings ; as exposing the merchant in his dealings to the consequences of public dishonor ; and , finally , as presenting the hasty action of our Congressional Body in sorry contrast with the more cautious and dignified wisdom of the Heathen Empire . " Yet it is not without its difficulties , or there would not have arisen so heated and prolonged a controversy . We do not , however , propose to go over the entire ground , but to briefly consider those points which have been brought forward most persistently in support of the Bill . The reported debate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most relied on to carry conviction as to its necessity and propriety , and furnishes the topics on which to say a few words . What course the matter would have taken if there had been no treaty stipulation imperiled , is hard to say . The reproach of abrogating a treaty by passing a bill in which it was not even referred to , and without informing the other party , aroused quick remonstrances from State legislatures , from colleges , from missionary // societies , from chambers of commerce , and from distinguished individuals , all alike presenting their reasons to the President , against his approval . This treaty with China is the only one on our records which contains a provision respecting international emigration between the contracting parties ; it is the only one too , so far as we are aware , which contains and lays down the royal law of Christ as a rule of action . The Governor of Nations had beforehand placed the United States under peculiar liens , therefore , towards this ancient kingdom to treat it with justice and patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its two portions , at an interval of ten years , will exhibit their unity , to which half-forgotten fact the President calls attention in his veto . In October , 1856 , there arose between the Chinese and British authorities at Canton , a quarrel which culminated in a war . The capture of that city by a Bi-itish and French force in 1857 , and then the transfer of hostilities to the north , the capture of the Taku forts and Tientsin in 1858 , all followed ; and subsequently the signing of treaties ended the strife . The belligerents , under the guidance of Lord Elgin and Baron Gros , had early invited the American and Russian Plenipotentiaries , W. B. Reed and Admiral Count Putiatine , to join them in a strong , united presentation to the Chinese Court of the necessity and advantage to all parties of a revision of treaties , and a better defined intercourse tbau had been before obtainable . They did so , and the fortunes of war in May , 1858 , favored the fulfillment of this singular union of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace gates of the oldest and most populous , in tones not to be disregarded . The four treaties were no doubt signed by the Chinese commissioners under fear of worse consequences if they refused , but their provisions put international intercourse on a sound footing ; and , as the past twenty years has proved , a progressive one . The American treaty contained one stipulation not found in either of the others , and worth quoting in this connection ; it is , that the parties to it , and their peoples respectively , " shall not insult or oppress each other for any trifling cause , so as to produce an estrangement between them. * ' It has a present application that was not foreseen . // This treaty has been on the whole a means of developing and cementing kindly relations between the two nations . This was conspicuously shown in November , 1867 , when on the approaching departure of Anson Burlingame from Peking , where he had been American Minister for nearly six years , the Chinese Government unexpectedly and freely offered him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send to all the courts with which they hpA formed treaties . Although the contrary has been often asserted , I have the strongest reasons for saying that this proposal was freely and voluntarily made to him by the Chinese Government . With him were associated two Chinese coordinate ministers , and two secretaries , an Englishman and a Frenchman , making it a cosmopolitan Legation . Nothing like it had ever been done before by the Emperor , and it was regarded as a long step in advance by all who knew the seclusion , ignorance , and apprehensions in which he and his courtiers had hitherto lived , and so lately begun to emerge from into a better position . When the embassy reached Washington , it was naturally received with great 6clat . Among other things done during its stay here , was the negotiation of eight additional Articles to the existing treaty by plenipotentiaries of the two Governments , who signed them on the 28th of July , 1868 ; it was ratified by the Senate a few days afterward , and then forwarded to Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done till the 23d of November , 1869 . The delay arose chiefly from the fact that it was not expected , when the embassy left China that any treaties woQid be made by it ; and the not unreasonable conclusion that the safest way for the Court there would be to wait until it came back ,  --  the more so that no limit of time was specified in the document for an exchange of ratifications . In a dispatch , dated August 31 , 1869 , Mr. Fish says that this compact , now generally known as the Burlingame Treaty , " came voluntarily from China , " which is true in a certain measure , but it was not proposed by her . Considering the circumstances under which the first , or Reed treaty was signed , those attending the second were not less indicative of great and real progress in the intervening ten years . Its fifth article relates to emigrants from either country // going to the other , and has drawn the greatest share of attention in the recent discussion . There can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of its framers was not at all to encourage international immigration , so much as to reprobate and prevent the forced or illegal traffic called the coolie trade , whose conduct in American ships had recently been , by an Act of Congress , declared to b* illegal , if not piratical . The Chinese Government was not , however , so free in this respect as our own , for one article in the treaty between Spain and China of 1864 , permitted Spanish ships to take Chinese laborers to Spanish colonies , thus sanctioning the coolie trade . But so horrible had been the treatment the coolies had received in Cuba , that none could be obtained at any of the open ports after a few years , and all ships for Havana loaded at Macao , out of Chinese jurisdiction . In March , 1866 , a set of rules for regulating the hiring of laborers at Chinese ports was signed by the British and French Ministers with the Chinese Government . They are still in force , and have done much to put a stop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return each laborer to his native country at the end of his contract time . The enforcement of these rules in Chinese ports was intrusted to the Customs ' officials , which as far as possible assured full protection to the ignorant and needy laborers , and made their engagement so slow and expensive that it was given np . The whole thing was really an effort to get labor below its market value . During ten years or more ending in 1874 , a marked and well-known distinction between free and contract emigration was drawn by the natives simply by the port the ship sailed from . If she cleared from llongkong everybody knew that her passengers were free ; if from Macao , forty miles west of it , all knew that they were coolies , chu-tsai , i. e. , like pigs in baskets , and would probably never come back . They were bound to Havana or Peru , and their departure was in all cases a final one . In 1873 , the horrible atrocities connected with this business had become so outrageous and notorious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all contract Chinese from the colony of Macao , and brought the evils to an end . The recital of these evils would be only a repeti // tion of the modes in which reckless cupidity , irresponsible power , crafty misrepresentation , cunning , violence , and callousness , all united to get the advantage over ignorance , poverty , and want among the laboring Chinese . Its details are on record for those who wish to learn them . The newspapers at llongkong did most of the work of exposing the traflic till it was suppressed . The Chinese authorities at Canton issued stringent regulations to punish and restrain crimps and other agents among their subjects , but the laws were mostly a dead letter . The native villains and kidnappers were sometimes caught in their crafty schemes by their countrymen , and put to death with excruciating tortures , crucifixion , and burning as a warning . Still , so long as the coolies could be shipped from Macao the trade went on to the terror of the community in which it thrived , and the disgrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in human beings never could be conducted with both profit and honor . These notices of the real nature of what is properly called the coolie trade , are given because so much has been said in the United States by the advocates of this Bill about the coolies brought here . During all this period of twenty-five years , so far as can be learned , not a single vessel left Macao for San Francisco , but many American ships took in coolies there for Callao , Havana , and elsewhere . It may be stated here that this word coolie is not of Chinese origin , but is the name of a hill tribe in India , whose able-bodied men were wont to go down to the plains in harvest time , j ust as Irish laborers cross to England at the same season , and return home when it is over . The demand for laborers in the Mauritius and West Indies after negro emancipation in 1884 , led gradually to supplying them from Calcutta by these hillmen , for whose protection and repatriation British laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants landing at San Francisco has been often explained ; but when it serves its purpose to point an expression of dislike , speakers have no scruple to use it . The Memorial of the Six Companies declares that there is not , nor has there ever been , a single Chinese brought there under a servile labor contract , and not a coolie or serf lives within our borders . Stringent laws were issued by the // Chinese authorities against the atrocities of the trade , but neither in China nor the United States do good and just laws execute themselves , lilt needs good and just rulers to do the executive part . Yet there is little doubt that the free emigration from Hongkong helped the coolie dealers to wheedle their ignorant victims into signing a contract to go abroad . The former were known to be bound to the Old or New Gold Hills , as California or Australia were popularly called in all that region ; and the coolies could easily be told that they would in time reach the same places . The lands to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ; also Brazil , Jamaica , Trinidad , IDemerara , Surinam , Hawaii , and Central America to build the Panama railroad , and perhaps a few other tropical countries . The total number in twenty-five years is not ascertainable at this moment , but the Customs ' records at Havana show that 142,422 Chinese laborers landed at that port alone between 1847 and 1874 ; probably as many went elsewhere . During most of these years , men were going and returning from San Francisco and Melbourne with stories of their successful washings for gold , each man bringing back his pile with him ; and these accounts much helped the coolie catchers to fill their ships with men deceived with similar hopes . Mr. Blame states that in the same period , 233,136 Chinese arrived at San Francisco , of whom 93,273 returned to China ; but I venture to state that out of the 300,000 coolies taken abroad , not 500 ever escaped or returned home . Therefore it is all the more inexcusable for Senators in favor of this Bill to deliberately confuse the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men coolies , so as to mix them with the chu-tsai . If they did not know the distinction between the two , that puts them on the worse horn of the dilemma . In his speech in Congress , Mr. Blame said , that " in the sense in which we get immigration from Europe , there never has one Chinese immigrant come to these shores . .... The Chinese Government agreed to enforce the provision that there should be nothing else than voluntary emigration . They have never done it ; the treaty stands broken and defied by China from the hour it was made to the present time . We had to legislate against it ; we legislated against it in the coolie // law . The Chinese were so palpably and so flagrantly violating it , that statutes of the United States were enacted to contravene the evil they were doing ; and it has gone on , probably not so grossly as before , but in effect the same . " One can easily see how these assertions from such a source would carry great weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many laws , and been ineffectually striving against this trade , long before the Burlingame treaty was signed . Our own Government has not passed a single statute relating to it since February 19 , 1862 , and its Sec . IV . provides that the act shall not interfere with voluntary emigration of the Chinese , and requires a consular certificate for each passenger . The legislation Mr. Blame refers to was enacted six years before the treaty , and effectually stopped all participation in the coolie traffic by American ships . Suppose that the object of our laws had been designed to keep our citizens from going abroad as coolies , how different would have been their operation ! Yet the Emperor could not prevent his subjects going to Hongkong , an English colony , to embark for America or anywhere else . It is rather too much like the wolf berating the sheep for fouling the water as it ran down , for Mr. Blame to cry out , " We had to legislate against it . " No one at Washington brought up the charge in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years sending coolies to California ; nor were the immigrants then so generally stigmatized as serfs , coolies , peons , slaves , and Mongol hordes , for their labor was needed . I crosse ( l the Pacific in 1860 in a ship with three hundred and sixteen Chinamen , not one of whom had a contract , and three-fourths of whom came from two villages . No Chinese ship has ever yet crossed the ocean , consequently no Chinese has ever brought coolies to this country , and the blame of violating the treaty could not legally rest on them . Mr. Blame 's legal acumen ought to have shown him this weak point in his pleading . On the 16th of January , 1867 , the following Resolution unanimously passed both Houses of Congress , and the next day a copy of it was sent to Mr. Burlingame at Peking " Whereas , The traffic in laborers , transported from China and other eastern countries , known as the coolie trade , is odious to the people of the United States as inhuman and immoral ; and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern international law and policy , which have substantially extirpated the African slave trade , to permit the establishment in its place of a mode of enslaving men differing from the former in little else than the employment of fraud instead of force to make its victims captive ; - Be it therefore " Resolved , That it is the duty of this Government to give effect to the moral sentiment of the nation , through all its agencies , for the purpose of preventing the further introduction of coolies into this hemisphere , or the adjacent islands . " This IResolution was a proper expression of public opinion ; but it never prevented a single coolie afterwards lar*ding at Havana or Callao , any more than its tone would lead one to sup pose that a hundred thousand coolies had already landed at San Francisco through the agency of the Six Companies there . Certainly if there is one matter in which the American and Chinese Governments have been of one mind , it is the restriction of the coolie trade ; while all the difficulties , the responsibilities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , the most ignorant of the two nations . Mr. Blame , in his letter of Feb. 21st , speaks of having seen a oontraet of a poor woman who had come to California as a prostitute ; but why did he not obtain one contract of a coolie who bad come there , and look it over before he stood up in his place in Congress , to publicly charge the Chinese Governrnent with defying and breaking the treaty ? I have seen thousands and thousands of the labor contracts made with the men going to Cuba and elsewhere , but nil the inquiries of the Morton Committee in 1876 , in San Francisco , failed to produce a single one . Was it honorable to bring such a charge , when the Chinese Legation recently appointed to reside near our Government could have answered his inquiries , and were entitled to courteous treatment ? President Woolsey says , in 18 of his International Law : " The honor or reputation of a State is equally its right ; and the injury done by violations of this right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffer in their feelings from a national insult , and the influence of the loss of a good name upon intercourse with other states , as well as upon that self-respect which is an important element in national character . " Such an attack , there fore , as this on Chinese good-faith rebounds on those who make it , if it can not be sustained . // If the aim of Mr. Blame in these allegations of Punic faith on the part of the Chinese , was to show that , as they have all along broken the Burlingame treaty , we might do so too , he has brought no proofs of his statements ; and has conspicuously failed in his aim . When asked by Senator Matthews for his proofs of the manner , degree , and extent to which the Chinese Government is responsible for the establishment of the Six Companies for the purposes of immigration , he made this surprising reply : - " That I do not know . The secrets of the Chinese Empire are past finding out . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have some , undoubtedly , and they retain it . They are in a certain sense agents of the Chinese Government for the importation of this coolie population . Does the Senator disbelieve that himself ? " Naturally enough , the answer and proof to such an appeal were far more difficult for Mr. Matthews to bring forward than it was for the Senator from Maine to so lightly make the charges . Seldom , however , has a public man put himself in a more pitiable attitude than he did when this was all the proof he could bring for upholding the infraction of a treaty with an unoffending nation ,  --  a treaty , too , which declared in another article that Christianity taught men to do to others as they would that men should do to them . In the iReport brought by Mr. Willis into the House on the 14th of January , nearly onethird of it is taken up with proving that Congress has the right to abrogate a treaty . He quotes precedents and legal decisions , and refers to the Act of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with France are no longer obligatory upon the United States . His simple reference to that case would lead the reader to suppose that it was in the main similar to the Chinese . President Hayes goes fully into the mattei ' , as every reader of his veto knows ; but the provocation in 1798 will be best shown by quoting the preamble to the Act " Whereas , The treaties concluded between the United States and France have been repeatedly violated on the part of the French Government , and the just claims of the United States for reparation of the injuries so committed have been refused ; and their attempts to negotiate an amicable adjustment of all complaints between the two nations have been repelled with indignity ; and , whereas , under the authority of the French Government there is yet pursued against the United States a system of predatory violence infracting the said treaties , and hostile to the rights of a free and independent nation , therefore , " &amp;c. // The debate in the House was chiefly in respect to this preamble . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the gist of its advocates : - " France has violated the faith pledged by her treaties with America ; this , by the law of nations , puts it within the option of the legislature to decide , as a question of expediency , whether the United States shall any longer continue to observe their stipulations . It is owing to the perfidy of the French Government that the abrogation of our treaties with that nation has become justifiable and necessary . As an American , he hoped the United States would always regard the faith due to treaties , and that all their acts would , on the face of them , appear consistent with it . In this respect he wished the conduct of the American Government to appear in marked contrast to French perfidy . It is of importance to our national character . . . . Why is it now deemed requisite to abrogate the treaties by which this country has been connected with France ? It is because France has not only violated them , but has also refused that attention which was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violation. " - Debates in Congress , vol. ii , p. 314 . This and other recorded speeches narrate the acts of strife and outrage on the part of the French Republic towards American commerce and citizens , which justified Congress in abrogating the treaty , and ( leclaring " that the United States are of right freed and exonerated from its stipulations . " If there had been similar , or any grounds for a like preamble in the present case , Mr. Willis ' report would , we may be sure , have given them . All that its chief supporter in the Senate has to say , when he is asked for his proofs , is , " I do not know . The secrets of the Chinese Empire are past finding out . " This wise answer of Mr. Blame can be compared to that given last year , by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations . The New York merchants had presented a memorial , asking that the surplus of the Chinese Indemnity Fund , now in the keeping of Congress , might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferers by famine in the northern provinces . Although it was known that sufficient food was obtainable in the south of China , and the money could be sent by telegraph in one day , Mr. Hamlin reported in substance " The // supplies could not reach there within that period of time which would make them available for the purposes for which an appropriation could be made . It is therefore not a practicable thing to do . The precise condition of the fund may be hardly possible to state at this moment . Therefore no relief measure originating in Congress could be made available within the period of time when it would be necessary . " It is , however , easy to show that the declaration of Article V. in the Burlingame Treaty has had no perceptible effect on Chinese immigration . It reads : - " The United States and the Emperor of China cordially recognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance , and also the mutual advantage of the free migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity , of trade , or as permanent residents . " In this extract , so suggestive of the IDeclaration of Independence , the contracting parties quote the inherent right of man to change bis home and allegiance , as if it was properly higher than a treaty stipulation , not so much to qualify it , as a reason for taking measui-es to prevent its notorious abuses . The Emperor of China is as helpless to prevent his subjects leaving their native land , as Congress and President Hayes together are to keep Americans at home . That it was not regarded as possible on the part of China to take any effective steps to restrain her subjects , seems to have been generally understood , for no reference to it occurs in the debates . Yet an undefined impression exists in many minds , that in some unknown way this article has been the cause of two hundred thousand Chinese landing on the Pacific coast , and that its abrogation will stop their coming . In 65 of his International Law , President Woolsey quotes ileifter as saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unfulfilled obligations can restrict it ! " He also shows that a Government is no more j ustified in prohibiting a subject from emigrating , than it would be in prohibiting a foreign sojourner from doing the same . If we think that the Emperor of China is respectable enough among the potentates of the earth to make a treaty with him , why should we hesitate to grant him the rights and courtesies involved in it ? Mr. Blame and others ( Iraw a dark picture of the vast immigration threatened from China . In his letter to Mr. Garrison , // he quite overlooks some facts connected with it which may brighten his outlook . He states that in the twenty-five years which have elapsed since the Chinese began to come here in numbers , in 1854 , a total of 233 ; 136 have landed in San Francisco , of whom 93,273 had returned home ; and he estimates that 129,000 remain within our borders . This last is probably a large figure ; but does he not see that by his own calculations it will pi-obably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing in our wide domain ; and that , too , against the competition of the owners and settlers of the soil , and the skilled labor of our artisans ? If two-fifths returned home in that period when the land was open and calling for laborers , and the building of railroads gave work and wages to thousands of these hands , is it not as certain as a thing can be on these facts , that the supply of workmen will be proportioned to the demand ? In 1872 , almost half a million of immigrants landed at New York in one year , and they have not all added to our wealth or peace as much as the few myriads of Chinese . The eagerness of Mr. Blame to make out his case has rather blinded him to the arguments against it to be drawn from the few facts with which he supports it . Furthermore , he is probably unaware that these immigrants have all come from a strip of territory not so large as the State of Connecticut , lying in the single province of Kwangtung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not an emigrant has ever sailed from Shanghai or Tientsin for California ; all have gone from llongkong . The province of Kwangtung measures 79,45fl square miles , and its inhabitants number about twenty millions . These speak many local dialects , which tends to crystallize them into separate communities , and has great influence on emigration , because it is only those who speak the same dialect who naturally go together . A man from Canton , meeting one from Amoy , Fuhehan , Ningpo , Tientsin , or Hankow , would be unintelligible to each of them , as they severally would be to each other ; and this feature almost compels emigrants to follow the lead already opened . Thus Swatow furnishes the emigrants for Siam , Amoy does those for Manila , Kiaying for Borneo , and six districts in the central and southwest parts of Kwangtung province , are the // native soil of those now in Australia and the United States . The cause is chiefly linguistic , but the inducements and help of friends , and the reports of returning miners also , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Burlingame treaty is not abrogated , the gap now open into the vast population of the Chinese Empire will continue to run like a leak in a mill-dam till we are swamped , are as baseless as the fear that the Indians in our borders are going to unite in a league to regain their ancestral hunting grounds . Mankind do not change their home or allegiance without adequate inducements and rewards , and these are all wanting in this case . The single fact that 2700 more left San Francisco in the last half of 1878 than landed there , shows that some strong agencies influence this emigration . Why did Mr. Blame keep this fact out of sight ? The report of Mr. Willis also characterizes the Chinese immigrants as sordid , selfish , immoral , and non-amalgamating , and these habits had rapidly changed their first favorable welcome to their being " regarded as a standing menace to the social and political institutions of the cOuntry . " Mr. Blame also styles one part of his letter , " Not one step toward assimilation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously impossible to weigh and strike the balance as to the comparative immorality of various nations and cities , yet it can be proved " that the Chinese quarters in San Francisco are in fact neatness itself compared with Baxter street and other slums in New York city , where women live in the greatest abundance . But even the filth in those New York slums is not half as disgusting as the faces of the depraved , debauched , drunken denizens of those plague spots . In the Chinese quarter there is no drunkenness , no profane swearing , no fighting , and no miserable wrecks of women There are a few Chinese women of abandoned character living in a short obscure street in San Francisco ; but there are long streets thickly inhabited on both sides by white women of the same character , who have gathered there from every nation , and who , sitting at their windows and doors , solicit visits from passers by , by day and night . " In 1875 , Congress passed a law stopping Chinese prostitutes from coming to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were and are now brought to San Francisco . This law has been the means of stopping an immigration which was started for , and at first patronized by depraved foreigners living in California . The Six Companies have tried to repress it , too ; and when they went so far as to put some of the poor women on board ship on their way back , a lawyer interfered with a habeas *orp*s and brought them all on shore again . No one pretends to uphold the Chinese as a pure and moral people , destitute as they still are of the high examples and sanctions of the Christian religion ; but those in California have not been sinners above all others in that region , that Mr. Blame should adduce them as an argument for breaking a treaty . He says that the Chinese do not assimilate with the rest of our population , and charges this as blameworthy upon them . There are some peculiar reasons for this , which he does not bring forward ; the two most influential of which are , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them apart . The foreigners who go to China are mostly in the same position , and in both cases it measurably secures against an overflowing or dangerous immigration . Those who have come to this country in manhood , have not only been too poor to spend their time in learning English , but their own monosyllabic language so cramps the vocal organs that they can not possibly pronounce many of our common words . They are therefore compelled to work and live together , and feel as aliens among their enemies . Those benevolent men and women on the Pacific slope , who have tried in patient toil to teach thousands of the young men the precepts of our religion , could tell Mr. Blame that there are no insuperable obstacles in the way of assimilating . The violent and outrageous treatment they have received has not been so closely in accordance with treaty stipulation that we should " not insult or oppress them for any trifling cause , " that he has any right to blame them for not assimilating with us . If the municipality of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had encouraged a few Americans to learn to read and speak their language , and then employed them as official interpreters to make known the laws , and de // inand their obedience of the ignorant new corners , much of this difficulty of assimilation would not exist . In San Francisco , this population has been forced to live crowded in a manner that they never do at home , because no other available dwellings were to be procured , and it was not safe for them to live apart , or just where they pleased . They seldom owned their own houses , and had to make the best of those they could get . Says Mr. Becker , the Chaplain of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Wilmington , in respect to the condition of their quarter : " Will it be believed , that while every other part of the city is kept clean by the city 's carts and scavengers , and these people and their property pay taxes like all the other inhabitants and estates , the police testify that in five years they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that all the effort made in that direction is from the voluntary contribution of Chinamen themselves I Certainly the city which taxes them and has not sent a cart there in five years , which rents water at $2.50 a month for each spigot , and furnishes no adequate sewers , has no right to complain of a population which taxes itself in one block at the rate of over $150 a month for the purpose of doing that which it has already paid the city to do . The remedy for dirty streets and alleys would rather seem to us to rest with the municipal authorities than in the abrogation of national treaties . " I will not recapitulate other reasons for the Chinese being aliens . Mr. Blame knows that they are not allowed to become citizens , and then blames them for not assimilating . He has no doubt read over the details of the unjust and discriminating legislation passed in California against them . For a long time they were not allowed to testify in courts , and one argument used hy a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the immunity from punishment which this law had brought in its train was fast encouraging lawless men to rob and attack and kill white men as well as Chinese . The miner 's tax , the laundry tax , the capitation tax , the fishing tax , the immigrant 's poll tax , the school tax , are the names of various State or local acts , most of them now repealed , probably , by which this people were fleeced . The first one alone is estimated to have taken out of Chinese miners ' earnings , in all , the sum of // $31,327,280 , up to the time of its repeal in 1862 . But being aliens they had no political rights to offset this taxation , and were not allowed to send their children to the schools for which they were taxed . It is the same old story of might a gainst right . One wonders why a man of Mr. Blame 's standing should have commitied himself to favor this Bill on such grounds as he puts forth in his speech , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 21 . For instance , he asserts that " all our exports to all Chinese ports outside of llongkong , was only $692,000 ; ' while a little inquiry would have brought him the true figures . In 1876 , the exports , exclusive of silver , were $4,392,555 ; in 1877 , their total was $5,652,272 ; and in 1878 , it was $6,016,543 . The export of silver , also a home product , in 1876 , was $10,198,967 ; in 1877 , $17,601,274 ; and in 1878 , $11,682,332 ; or an annual average for each year of $13,160 , . 857 . He explains that he calls Hongkong a Chinese port , though really a British colony ; and adds , " It we were at war with China today , fliongkong would be as open to us as Liverpool . To speak of China punishing us by suspending trade is only the suggestion of dense ignorance . " Now , as Hongkong is an island of the size of Manhattan , it is plain that in 1878 it could not have taken nearly seventeen millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have carried it there for the purchase of Chinese produce in the Empire . His argument , therefore , is no better than his facts ; and moreover , if we were at war with China , a blockade of her ports would prevent their exporting to Hongkong . His next remark is like it : " We pay China an immense balance in coin , and probably we always shall do it ; " as if Congress had not author . ized the coinage of the Trade dollar chiefly in order to get the Chinese more readily to take our surplus silver produce in that style ? Other honorable senators besides Mr. Blame have shown remarkable ignorance on some points where we should have looked for strict accuracy , inasmuch as the sources of information were not far off or difficult to reach . Mr. Sargen tsays that " The Burlingame treaty ought to be cut up by the roots , in fact as all these treaties should be . There is no reciprocity // in them . We are allowed to enter but five ports in China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it upon a passport , and that is difficult to obtain . The Chinese come here by the hundred thousand , travel over this country , and do as they please ; by the Chinese census , only five hundred and forty-one Americans are in all China . Our citizens can only go in at certain ports , and are impeded in their passage through the country . " A reply to one count in this singular charge , and this statesmanlike reason for cutting up a treaty by the roots , could have been found if he had read the Reed treaty where seven open ports are enumerated ; and since it was signed eleven more have been opened . The passport system was pressed upon the Chinese by foreign envoys as the best means of protecting the natives against reckless foreigners ; and the passports are all issued by their own ministers and consuls . I have myself issued many to American citizens , and they can go everywhere they please , though in many districts a lawless population makes travel sometimes dangerous to persons not knowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for Chinese traveling in California . Once more , the Chinese have never taken a census of foreigners , and why the fact ( if it be one ) that only five hundred and forty-one Americans are in all China is an argument for abrogating the treaty , needs some clearer explanation . Again , Mr. Sargent said : " If senators had listened to the arguments on this question , they would know that there is in the English treaty and in the French , a provision somewhat similar in terms providing for the immigration of Chinese to their colonies ; and that in both these there has been legislation under the pressure of the necessity which is felt in the Pacific States . " He has here somewhat confused two separate things . In October , 1860 , Lord Elgin signed a convention at Peking , the fifth article of which reads as follows : " His Imperial Majesty , the Emperor of China , will , by decree , command the high authorities of every province to proclaim throughout their jurisdictions , that Chinese choosing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond sea , are at perfect liberty to enter into engagements with British subjects for that purpose , and to ship themselves and their families on board any British // vessel at any of the open ports . " A proviso is inserted in the regulations for this trade , that the " Chinese Government throws no obstacle to the departure of Chinese subjects embarking of their own free will , and at their own expense for foreign countries ; but a law exists capitally punishing all those who kidnap by fraud or force , Chinese subjects for emigrants . " It will be seen that this is quite different from the expressions in the Burlingame treaty . The French Charg6 issued orders in 1866 to his consul at llongkong to do all he could to prevent French ships taking coolies from Macao , but his superiors in Paris countermanded them ; very few coolies were ever taken to any French colony , and none at all to any part of Australia . I was acting Minister at Peking when these regulations were proposed for acceptance by the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ship could lawfully carry contract laborers to any part of the world . Mr. Blame says that the State Department contains no notice that China ever complied with the provision to make a law about the coolie trade ; but the Secretary of State probably never made any inquiry respecting the matter . I am quite confident that the Chinese Government was never informed about the laws which Congress made against it before July , 1868 ; and they were few compared with the laws already promulgated by Chinese officials against it . Mr. Blame would hardly deem the negative fact that no copy of a British Act of Parliament against the slave trade was in our State Department a proof that none existed in the United Kingdom . T will not go any further into an examination of the many speeches in the Senate on this serious question of abrogating the treaty with China-speeches which stand in such unworthy contrast for their reasoning and facts with those uttered in 1798 . Most of the speakers on both sides failed to tell us whether the results of abrogating it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think it would make little difference what the Court of Peking might think or do , after it was in this manner released from all the obligations to maintain the stipulations it had entered into . Perhaps it would not be in haste to act . But those Americans living in China know that the rights of self-government , the protective // power of consular and ministerial officials , the security of life and property to each person , the opportunities of travel , the advantages of schools , missions and churches , the possibility of collecting debts , the machinery and freedom of courts , and the rates of duties levied on imports and exports ; all these , and others too , depend at present on the validity of the treaty of 1858 . Those of its stipulations which interfere with the entire authority of the Emperor over all who live within his territory , have been a source of annoyance and a cause of regret to the high officers in the land ever since they learned what treaties with foreigners have involved . On one occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and opportunities of the Chinese who had gone to America , as a reason for allowing similar advantages in China to Americans , to every point he had the same answer , " But you govern them . You govern them . " More of our fellow-citizens in China are now probably engaged in missionary work than in mercantile . Many of them are scattered over the country away from the open ports , having printing-offices , schools , churches , and other benevolent enterprises under their control . They belong to eleven different societies , and number altogether two hundred and twenty adults . They are bound by ties of family , friendship and common eftbrts for the progress of Christianity among the natives , with thousands and myriads of the good and benevolent in all parts of this land . Much of their success in their work has been owing to the feeling of security which these treaty rights have thrown over them in their distant homes , and fairly recognized by the local rulers . Under the operation of this treaty natives who attacked our countrymen have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property destroyed . Before the treaties existed , no one felt safe ; homicides and riots were frequent at Whampoa , and lives were lost on both sides . In 1822 , a sailor was taken from an American ship for accidentally causing the death of a woman coming over the bow , and publicly strangled in Canton . Not a member of Congress seems to have considered what results might follow , affecting the personal welfare and laudable enterprizes of their countrymen in that land . That anar // chy and riot would instantly ensue in China wherever Americans live , as soon as the rulers and people heard that the treaty was abrogated , I do not believe ; for the former have gained a good name during the years they have lived and labored among the Chinese , and the latter are trained to respect law and order . The Chinese Government has more knowledge of its own rights now than when the Reed treaty was negotiated , and through the scholarship of our countryman , Dr. Martin , have the works of Wheaton and Woolsey in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Some may ask in respect to this question of Chinese immigration , whether there are no features which make it undesirable , and what are the reasons why the immigrants are treated so badly ? The reasons for their bad usage , when they first came , chiefly arose from their helplessness and alien position . Just as the slaves twenty years ago had really no legal rights , so the Chinese could then be robbed and killed with impunity by the outlaws who flocked to California . That has passed away in a small measure , but the Memorial to Congress from the Six Companies , dated only sixteen months ago , shows that their countrymen still suffer outrages for which they get no redress . These outrages arise more from the instinctive dread of a serious competition in the rate of wages among the Irish there than any other one cause , and this fear has led to their combining so as to influence local and state politics . The Chinese are worth nothing in politics , and the Irish are worth much to those who please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state their cause , and it costs much labor and money , as well as skill and learning , to follow up and disprove the unsound arguments and false statements made about them . The Report issued by the Congressional Committee sent to California in 1876 , contains so many contradictory statements that one needs to be well acquainted with the subject to know their relative value , and the qualifications of the witnesses . Perhaps it was the reading of this bulky volume of one thousand two hundred and eighty-one pages , which led Mr. Blame to exclaim , " The secrets of the Chinese Empire are past finding out . " The leading characteristics of the Chinese , which have given // them their standing among the nations of the earth , are their thrift and industry , their respect and pursuit of the arts of peace and learning , and their love of order and law . It is their untiring industry which has made them so valuable to the Pacific States , and when there is less demand and remuneration for their labor , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Archipelago , Siam. and India , and will prove true in this country and Australia . They have no desire to found new colonies in far off regions , or they would long ago have possessed the great islands of Borneo and Sumatra ; they will follow a remunerative lead , but are not disposed to venture all on a chance of sudden gain . Their countrymen in other provinces are more ready to ridicule and despise the Cantonese for going among the barbarians than to follow their example ; for they say , China can teach the uncouth people of those lands , but we need not risk life and luck to go and do it . The trait which has caused most trouble where they have emigrated , is their aptitude at combining together in every kind of association . In their own land , they form into clubs and companies , guilds and cabals , societies and unions , clans and leagues , of one kind and another . Sometimes it is to resist government , and sometimes to cooperate and help it . Clan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local authorities simply look on at the deadly struggle for supremacy ; and when it is settled , both parties will join in various companies , and unite in friendly efforLs to maintain a guard against marauders and rebels in aid of the national defense . This democratic spirit has preserved the people from the extremities of official tyranny and taxation ; while , on the other hand , their ignorance and prejudice weakens them when they resist improvements , and vent their spite against competitors in trade . They carry this habit of combination abroad , using it for mutual protection and to secure a common end ; sometimes , like our masonic lodges , which are much like the /twui of the Chinese , it may be made a means of crushing a rival or removing an enemy , but this is the exception . Mr. Blame says that " inside the municipal law and independent of it , the Chinese in California administer a code among themselves , even pronouncing the death penalty , and executing it // in criminal secrecy . " If he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions of the Six Companies in their Memorial , that " they have never had organized or secret tribunals to administer justice in this country ; many of our misunderstandings and difficulties we have settled among ourselves in the way of arbitration , " are far more worthy of credence . In comparison with the stringent rules of trade-unions and strikes , and the ruthless acts of internationals , communists , and ku-klux when banded against law and order , the sternest acts of Chinese hwui abroad are less savage . Yet their tendency to unite in such leagues is one habit which might develop into aggression , as well as limit itself to protection . In California the wrongs hitherto suffered by them have all been from the heavy hand of those whose exorbitant demands for wages could brook no rivalry in labor , and who would not see or acknowledge that the cheap Chinaman had prepared work for the skilled American and ready Irishman . They have added three hundred millions to the value of property in California alone , hardly a cent of which would or could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress has been laid on the $180,000,000 which they carried back to China with them , as if it had pauperized the State . Few of them have got into the hospital or almshouse , and considering their bringing up at home in heathenism , ignorance , vice , and degradation , few were in the State prison . The tables give one hundred and ninetyeight Chinese against three hundred and forty-seven white criminals . Another objection against a great Chinese immigration , is that they do not bring their families , but this insures the return to a larger extent of those who come here merely to find a good market for their labor , and of itself shows the perfect unsoundness of Mr. Blame 's awful picture of the vast immigration threatened as delineated in his letter . Still , if they wished to marry , where are the women ? The existence of polygamy in China enables a man to bring home another wife if he likes ; while , in fact , he seldom does so . The women refuse to go abroad for a good many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and unmarried . Their difficult language // also operates as a serious obstacle to adopting our usages and learning our ways of life ; and , moreover , compels them to receive orders from their countrymen who serve as the interpreters and headmen in contracts with their em* ) loyers . I will not go further into these reasons , for those who seek more information can easily get it . The well-written veto of President Hayes , which prevented the obloquy that Congressmen tried to fasten on our national reputation , proved its strength of reasoning in this , that their second vote for the bill was less than the first . He conclusively shows that Congress has neither the power to make a treaty nor break one ; much more , then , it can not , as this Bill does , indirectly abrogate or nullify a treaty , and give no hint of its purpose . He properly shows that the will of the nation can be declared in some other way in respect to its continuance , and that there is no other objection against its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that a fair examination of the rise and nature of this influx of laborers will prove that it has not been caused by the stipulations of the treaty ; that the Government of China has not the least control over it , treaty or no treaty ; and that the Chinese will not ever become a menace or a scourge . We , as a people , may be thankful that the discussion and vote in Congress have attracted attention to the nature of treaty obligations when there was no imminent peril demanding hasty legislation , or delicate questions stirt-ing up national rivalries . Mr. Blame 's course in the debate has served , too , to draw attention to it and to him ; and he has been well answered by Mr. Garrison , and still better by Mr. Beecher , whose excellent address on the third of March , in Philadelphia , touches every point in the matter . Mr. Blame has spoken and written on this question without careful examination into his alleged facts , or analyzing his deductions ; and be will probably , by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A word once spoken , four horses can not catch it .
