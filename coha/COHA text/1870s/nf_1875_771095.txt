THE ADVENTURES OF THE CHEVALIER DE LA SALLEAND HIS COMPANIONS , IN THEIR EXPLORATIONS OF THE PRAIRIES , FORESTS , LAKES , AND RIVERS , OF THE NEW WORLD , AND THEIR INTERVIEWS WITH THE SAVAGE TRIBES , TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO . By JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . NEW YORK : DODD , MEAD &; COMPANY , Publishers Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1875 , by DODD &; MEAD , In the Office of the Librarian of Congress , at Washington . TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE GREAT VALLEY OF THE WEST , WHOSE MAGNIFICENT REALMS LA SALLE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE THE FIRST TO EXPLORE , THIS VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED , BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . PREFACE . There is no one of the Pioneers of this continent whose achievements equal those of the Chevalier Robert de la Salle . He passed over thousands of miles of lakes and rivers in the birch canoe . He traversed countless leagues of prairie and forest , on foot , guided by the moccasined Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trod , and penetrating the villages and the wigwams of savages , where the white man 's face had never been seen . Fear was an emotion La Salle never experienced . His adventures were more wild and wondrous than almost any recorded in the tales of chivalry . As time is rapidly obliterating from our land the footprints of the savage , it is important that these records of his strange existence should be perpetuated . Fortunately we have full and accurate accounts of these explorations , in the journals of Messrs . Marquette , Hennepin , and Joliet . We have still more minute narratives , in Etablissement de la Foix , par le P. Chretien Le Clercq , Paris 1691 ; Dernieres Decouvertes , par le Chevalier de Tonti , Paris 1697 ; Journal Historique , par M. Joutel , Paris 1713 . For the incidents in the last fatal expedition , to establish a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi , and the wonderful land tour of more than two thousand miles from the sea-coast of Texas to Quebec , through the territories of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clercq , the narrative of Father Anastasias Douay , and the minute and admirably written almost daily journal of Monsieur Joutel , in his Dernier Voyage . Both Douay and Joutel accompanied this expedition from its commencement to its close . In these adventures the reader will find a more vivid description of the condition of this continent , and the character of its inhabitants two hundred years ago , than can be found anywhere else . Sir Walter Scott once remarked , that no one could take more pleasure in reading his romances , than he had taken in writing them . In this volume we have the romance of truth . If the writer can judge of the pleasure of the reader , from the intense interest he has experienced in following these adventurers through their perilous achievements , this narrative will prove to be one of extraordinary interest .

Nearly three hundred and forty years ago , in April 1541 , De Soto , in his adventurous march , discovered the majestic Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee . No white man 's eye had ever before beheld that flood whose banks are now inhabited by busy millions . The Indians informed him that all the region below consisted of dismal , endless , uninhabitable swamps . De Soto , world-weary and woe-stricken , died upon the banks of the river . In its fathomless depths his body found burial . These cruel adventurers , insanely impelled in search of mines of gold , founded no settlements , and left behind them no traces of their passage , save that by their cruelties they had excited the implacable ire of the Indian against the white man . A hundred years of earth 's many griefs lingered slowly away , while these vast solitudes were peopled only by wandering savage tribes whose record must forever remain unknown . In the year 1641 , some French envoys , from Canada , seeking to open friendly trade with the Indians for the purchase of furs , penetrated the northwest of our country as far as the Falls of St. Mary , near the outlet of Lake Superior . The most friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes were encountered . This visit led to no settlement . The adventurous traders purchased many furs , with which they loaded their birch canoes : established friendly relations with these distant Indians , and greatly extended the region from which furs were brought to their trading posts in Canada . Eighteen more years passed away , over the silent and gloomy wilderness , when in 1659 , a little band of these bold and hardy explorers , in their frail canoes , with Indian guides , paddled along the lonely , forest-fringed shores of Lake Ontario , ascended the Niagara River to the Falls , carried their canoes on their shoulders around the rapids , launched them again on Lake Erie , traversed that inland sea over two hundred and fifty miles , entered the magnificent Strait , passed through it to Lake St. Clair , crossed that lake , ascended the St. Clair River to Lake Huron , and traversing its whole length , a distance of three hundred miles , reached the Falls of St. Mary . Here , at the distance of more than a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numerous and powerful bands of savages , these hardy men passed an inclement winter . Amidst rocks and gloomy pines they reared their hut . Game was abundant , fuel was at their door , the Indians were hospitable , and they wanted for nothing . One event only darkened these wintry months . The leader of the band became lost in the woods and perished . In the spring the men returned rejoicingly to Canada , with their canoes laden with the richest furs . They also brought such reports of the docility and amiability of the Indians , as to inspire the Christians in Canada with the intense desire to establish missionary stations among them . Five years passed away , when Father Claude Allouez , with a small band of Christian heroes , penetrated these wilds to proclaim the glad tidings of the Gospel . Two years after , he was followed by Father James Marquette , a noble man , whose name will never die . As the explorations of Marquette opened the way for the still more wonderful excursions of La Salle , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something in blood . The Marquette family had been illustrious in France from time immemorial . Generation after generation , many of its members had obtained renown , not only for chivalric courage , but for every virtue which can adorn humanity . Their ancestral home was a massive feudal castle on an eminence near the stately city of Leon . The armorial bearing of the family commemorates deeds of heroic enterprise five hundred years ago . They were generally earnest Christians . James Marquette was born at the ancient seat of the family in the year 1637 . His mother was a woman of fervent piety and of unusual strength and culture of mind . Her brother , John Baptiste de la Salle , was the founder of a system of Christian schools for the gratuitous education of the poor . Thousands were thus instructed long before the present system of public schools was introduced . It was to the instructions of his noble mother that James Marquette was indebted for his elevated Christian character , and for his self-sacrificing devotion to the interests of humanity , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian world . At the age of seventeen this noble young man , resisting all the brilliant allurements the world opened to one of his wealth and rank , consecrated himself to the service of religion by entering the ministry in the Catholic Church , in which he was born and educated , and by whose influences he was exclusively surrounded . Two years were devoted to intense study . Then , for twelve years , he was employed in teaching and in many laborious and self-denying duties . As was natural , with a young man of his ardent nature and glowing spirit of enterprise , he was very desirous of conveying the glad tidings of the Gospel to those distant nations who had never even heard of the name of Jesus . Canada and its savage tribes were then attracting much attention in France . Wonderful stories were told of the St. Lawrence River , and of the series of majestic lakes , spreading far away into the unknown interior , and whose shores were crowded with Indian tribes of strange aspect , language , and customs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the 20th of September , he landed , on the banks of the St. Lawrence , at a little hamlet of French log-cabins and Indian wigwams , called Quebec . He was then but twenty-nine years of age . There was , at that time , another missionary , M. Allouez , on an exploring tour far away upon the majestic lakes of the interior . With adventurous footsteps he was traversing prairie solitudes and forest glooms , upon which no eye of civilized man had ever yet looked . His birch canoe , paddled by Indian guides , glided over solitary waters hundreds of leagues beyond the remotest frontier stations . There was quite an important trading-post at the mouth of Saguenay River . This was a remarkable stream , which entered the St. Lawrence about one hundred and twenty miles below Quebec . It came rushing down , from unknown regions of the north , with very rapid flood , entering the St. Lawrence at a point where that majestic river was eleven miles in width . Here the French government had established one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons of the year it presented an extraordinary wild and picturesque aspect of busy life . There were countless Indian tribes , clustered in villages along the banks of the St. Lawrence , the Saguenay , and their tributary streams . In the early summer , the Indians came by hundreds , in fleets of canoes  --  men , women and children  --  to this great mart of traffic . They came in their gayest attire , reared their wigwams on the plain , kindled their fires , and engaged in all the barbaric sports of Indian gala days . The scene presented was so full of life and beauty , that the most skilful artist might despair of his ability to transfer it to the canvas . Father Marquette took his station at this point . Here for twelve years he patiently labored , trying to teach the Indians the way of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ . Full of enthusiasm , and naturally endowed with a very enterprising spirit , his heart glowed with zeal as he listened to the narrative of Father Allouez , of populous tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , Superior . These tribes had never heard of the mission of the Son of God , to save a lost world . They had but very faint conceptions of the Heavenly Father . Marquette could not resist the impulse to carry the Gospel to these realms of darkness . It is difficult for us now to form any adequate conception of the little hamlet , at the mouth of the Saguenay , where Marquette commenced his missionary labors . The log-cabins of the French , their store-house , and , most prominent of all , the cross-surmounted log chapel , were clustered together . At a little distance , on the plain , were hundreds of Indian wigwams . Bark canoes , light as bubbles , were seen gliding over the still waters , which were there expanded into a beautiful bay . The glooms of the gigantic forest , spreading back to unexplored and unimagined depth , added to the sublimity of the scene . There seemed to be no apprehension of hostility on either side . The intercourse between the two parties of civilized and uncivilized men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , to the modes of life of the Indians . They shared in their games , married the daughters of their chiefs , and in all points endeavored to identify the interests of the natives with their own . M. Marquette had a remarkable facility in the acquisition of languages . There was a general resemblance in the language of all the tribes on the St. Lawrence . He could very soon speak fluently with all . Taking Indian guides with him , he commenced tours in various directions , paddled by Indians in the birch bark canoe . He visited tribe after tribe , met the chiefs at their council fires , slept in the wigwams , administered medicines to the sick , and , with zeal which no discouragement could chill , endeavored to point the living and the dying to that Saviour who taketh away the sins of the world . After spending two years in these labors , he obtained an appointment to connect himself with a mission established nearly a thousand miles west , far away upon the shores of Lake Superior . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Montreal . The distance was one hundred and eighty miles up the river . The voyage was made in a birch canoe , with three boatmen to aid him in paddling it against the stream . They could proceed about thirty miles a day . The voyage occupied about a week . There were Indian villages on the banks where they occasionally slept . At other times they encamped in the forest , the night wind lulling them to sleep , as it sighed through the leafless branches , which the returning sun of spring had scarcely yet caused to bud . At Montreal there was a little cluster of cabins and wigwams , presenting a very different aspect from the stately city which now adorns that site . After a short tarry there , waiting for a suitable guide , to traverse more than a thousand miles of almost pathless wilderness , a party of Nez-Perce Indians , from Lake Superior , came down the river in their canoes . With them Marquette embarked . It was a wonderful voyage which this gentleman , from the refinement and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddled up the Ottawa River a distance of nearly four hundred miles . Thence through a series of narrow streams and minor lakes , they entered Lake Nipissing . Descending the rapid flood of French River , through cheerless solitudes eighty miles in extent , they entered Georgian Bay . Crossing this vast sheet of water over an expanse of fifty miles , they saw the apparently boundless waves of Lake Huron opening before them . The northern shores of this inland sea they skirted , until they reached the river St. Mary , which connects Lake Superior with Lake Huron . Here two missionary stations were established . One was near the entrance of the river into Lake Huron , about forty miles below the celebrated Falls of St. Mary . The other was at Green Bay , an immense lake in itself , jutting out from the northwestern extremity of Lake Michigan . Father Marquette reared his log-cabin in the vicinity of a small Indian village , on the main land , just south of the island of Mackinaw . He named the station St. Ignatius . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were about two thousand souls in the tribes immediately around him . With great docility they listened to his teachings , and were eager to be baptized as Christians . But the judicious father was in no haste thus to secure merely their nominal conversion . The dying , upon professions of penitence , he was ever ready to baptize , and to administer to them the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper . With the rest he labored to root out all the remnants of their degrading superstitions , and to give them correct ideas of salvation through repentance , amendment , and trust in an atoning Saviour . Gradually Marquette gathered around him a little band of loving disciples . For three years he labored with them cheerfully , joyously . His gentle and devoted spirit won , not merely the friendship of the Indians , but their ardent affections . He was just as safe among them as the most beloved father surrounded by his children . Three years this good man remained in these lonely wilds , peacefully and successfully teaching these benighted children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much exercised with the thought of exploring the limitless and unknown regions south and west . He had heard rumors of the Mississippi , the Father of Waters ; and his devout mind peopled the vast realms through which it flowed with the lost children of God , whom he perhaps might reclaim , through the Gospel of Jesus , who had come from heaven for their redemption . The Governor of Canada was desirous , for more worldly reasons , of exploring these regions , where future empires might be reared . Even the Indians knew but little respecting this great and distant river . There was much uncertainty whether it ran south , into the Gulf of Mexico , or west , emptying into the Gulf of California , which Spanish explorers had called the Red Sea , in consequence of its resemblance to that Asiatic sheet of water , or whether it turned easterly , entering the Atlantic Ocean somewhere near the Virginia coast . In the spring of the year 1673 , Governor Frontenac sent a French gentleman , M. Joliet , from Quebec , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Marquette on board and set out to find and explore the downward course of this much talked of river . M. Joliet was admirably qualified for this responsible enterprise . He was a man of deep religious convictions , had spent several years among the Indians , was a very courteous man in all his intercourse with them , was thoroughly acquainted with their customs , and spoke several of their languages . As to courage , it was said that he absolutely feared nothing . The good father writes , in reference to his own appointment to this expedition : " I was the more enraptured at this good news , as I saw my designs on the point of being accomplished , and myself in the happy necessity of exposing my life for the salvation of all these nations . Our joy at being chosen for this enterprise , sweetened the labor of paddling from morning till night . As we were going to seek unknown countries , we took all possible precautions , that if our enterprise were hazardous , it should not be foolhardy . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had frequented those parts . We even traced a map of all the new country , marking down the rivers on which we were to sail , the names of the nations through which we were to pass , and the course of the great river . " On the 13th of May , 1673 , this little band , consisting of M. Joliet , Father Marquette , and five boatmen , in two birch canoes , commenced their adventurous voyage . They took with them some Indian corn and jerked meat ; but they were to live mainly upon such food as they could obtain by the way . The immense sheet of water , at the northwestern extremity of Lake Michigan , called Green Bay , is one hundred miles long by twenty or thirty broad . The boatmen paddled their frail canoes along the western border of this lake until they reached its southern extremity , where they found a shallow river , flowing into it from the south , which they called Fox River . They could propel their canoes about thirty miles a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encampment . Upon some dry and grassy mound they could speedily , with their axes , construct a hut which would protect them from the weather . Carefully smoothing down the floor , they spread over it their ample couch of furs . Fish could be taken in abundance . The forest was filled with game . An immense fire , blazing before the open side of the hut , gave warmth , and illumined the sublime scene with almost the brilliance of noon-day . There they joyously cooked their suppers , with appetites which rendered the feast more luxurious to them probably than any gourmand at Delmonico 's ever enjoyed . Each night Father Marquette held a religious service , which all reverently attended . Prayers were offered , and their hymns of Christian devotion floated sweetly through those sublime solitudes . The boatmen were men of a gentle race , who had been taught from infancy to revere the exercises of the church . They came upon several Indian villages . But the natives were as friendly as brothers . Many of them had visited the station at St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquette and his labors of love . These children of the forest begged their revered friend to desist from his enterprise . " There are , " they said , " on the great river , bad Indians who will cut off your heads without any cause . There are fierce warriors who will try to seize you and make you slaves . There are enormous birds there , whose wings darken the air , and who can swallow you all , with your canoes , at a mouthful . And worst of all , there is a malignant demon there who , if you escape all other dangers , will cause the waters to boil and whirl around you and devour you . " To all this , the good Marquette replied , " I thank you , dear friends , for your kind advice , but I can not follow it . There are souls there , to save whom , the Son of God came to earth and died . Their salvation is at stake . I would joyfully lay down my life if I could guide them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox River impeded with many rapids . To surmount these it was necessary often to alight from their canoes , and , wading over the rough and sharp stones , to drag them up against the swift current . They were within the limits of the present State of Wisconsin , and found themselves in a region of lakes , sluggish streams , and marshes . But there were Indian trails , which had been trodden for uncounted generations , leading west . These they followed , often painfully carrying their canoes and their burdens on their shoulders , for many miles , from water to water , over what the Indians called the Carrying Places . At length they entered a region of remarkable luxuriance , fertility , and beauty . There were crystal streams and charming lakes . Magnificent forests were interspersed with broad and green prairies . God seemed to have formed , in these remote realms , an Eden of surpassing loveliness for the abode of his children . Three tribes , in perfect harmony , occupied the region  --  the Miamis , Mascoutins , and Kickapoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . River and lake , forest and prairie were alike alive with game . To their surprise they found that the French missionary , Father Allouez , had reached this distant spot , preaching the Gospel , eight years before . The Indians had received him with fraternal kindness . He had left in the centre of the village a cross , the emblem of the crucified Son of God . " I found , " Marquette writes , " that these good people had hung skins and belts and bows and arrows on the cross , an offering to the Great Spirit , to thank him because he had taken pity on them during the winter and had given them an abundant chase . " No white man had ever penetrated beyond this region . These simple , inoffensive people seemed greatly surprised that seven unarmed men should venture to press on to meet the unknown dangers of the wilderness beyond  --  wilds which their imaginations had peopled with all conceivable terrors . On the 10th of June these heroic men resumed their journey . The kind Indians furnished them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest to a river , about ten miles distant , which they called Wisconsin , and which they said flowed westward into the Father of Waters . They soon reached this stream . The Indians helped them to carry their canoes and effects across the portage . " We were then left , " writes Marquette , " alone in that unknown country , in the hand of God . " Our voyagers found the stream hard to navigate . It was full of sand-bars and shallows . There were many islands covered with the richest verdure . At times they came upon landscapes of enchanting beauty , with lawns and parks and lakes , as if arranged by the most careful hands of art . After descending this stream about one hundred and twenty miles , they reached the mouth of the Wisconsin River , and saw the flood of the Mississippi rolling majestically before them . It was the 17th of June 1673 , Father Marquette writes that , upon beholding the river , he experienced a joy which he could not express . Easily they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitudes below . But to paddle back against the swift-rolling tide would try the muscles of the hardiest men . Still the voyagers pressed on . It was indeed a fairy scene which now opened before them . Here bold bluffs hundreds of feet high , jutted into the river . Here were crags of stupendous size and of every variety of form , often reminding one of Europe 's most picturesque stream , where " The castled crags of Drachenfels , Frown o'er the wide and winding Rhine . " Again the prairie would spread out its ocean-like expanse , embellished with groves , garlanded with flowers of gorgeous colors waving in the summer breeze , checkered with sunshine and the shade of passing clouds , with roving herds of the stately buffalo and the graceful antelope . And again the gloomy forest would appear , extending over countless leagues , where bears , wolves , and panthers found a congenial home . Having descended the river nearly two hundred miles they came to an Indian trail , leading back into the country . It was so well trodden as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It speaks well for the Indians  --  for the reputation which they then enjoyed  --  that Marquette , with his French companion , M. Joliet , far away in the wilderness , seven hundred miles from any spot which a white man 's foot had ever before trod , should not have hesitated alone to enter this trail in search of the habitations of this unknown tribe . They left all their companions , with the canoes , on the bank of the river . " We cautioned them , " writes Father Marquette , " strictly to beware of a surprise . Then M. Joliet and I undertook this rather hazardous discovery , for two single men , who thus put themselves at the discretion of an unknown and barbarous people . " These two bold adventurers followed the trail in silence for about six miles . They then saw , not far from them , upon a meadow on the banks of a small stream , a very picturesque group of wigwams , with all the accompaniments of loafing warriors , busy women , sporting children , and wolfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the distance of about a mile and a half , upon a gentle eminence , there was another village of about equal size . As the Indians had not yet caught sight of them , they fell upon their knees , and Father Marquette , in fervent prayer , commended themselves to God . They then gave a loud shout , to attract the attention of the Indians , and stepped out into open view . The whole community was instantly thrown into commotion , rushing from the wigwams , and gathering in apparently an anxious group . After a brief conference they seemed to come to the conclusion that two unarmed men could not thus approach them , announcing their coming , with any hostile intent . Four of their aged men were deputed to go forward and greet the strangers . They advanced with much dignity , not uttering a word , but waving , in their hands , the pipes of peace . As it afterwards appeared , they had often heard of the arrival of the French in Canada , of the wonderful articles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their long black gowns . The name of Blackgowns was the one with which , in all the tribes , they designated these preachers of the Gospel . When they had come within a few paces of the strangers , they regarded them attentively and waited to be addressed . Both M. Joliet and Father Marquette understood that these ceremonies indicated friendship . Father Marquette broke the silence by inquiring " To what nation do you belong ? " " We are Illinois , " one of them replied , " and in token of peace we have brought you our pipes to smoke . We invite you to our village , where all are awaiting you with impatience . " The Frenchman and the four Indians walked together to the village . At the door of one of the largest wigwams , one of the ancients stood to receive them . According to their custom , on such occasions , he was entirely unclothed . This probably was the savage mode of indicating that there were no concealed weapons about the person . This man , with his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " How beautiful is the sun , O Frenchmen ! when you come to visit us . All our people welcome you , and you shall enter all our cabins in peace . " He then led them into the wigwam . A large concourse remained outside in respectful silence . Only the principal men entered the wigwam . Mats were provided , for the guests , in the centre . The rest took seats around . The calumet of peace was passed . All in turn partook of the smoke of the weed which both the civilized and uncivilized man have prized so highly . While thus employed , a messenger came in from the head chief , who resided in the village on the eminence to which we have alluded . He brought a message from the chief , inviting the strangers to his residence . " We went with a good will , " writes M. Marquette . " The people , who had never before seen a white man , could never tire looking at us . They threw themselves upon the grass , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran ahead , and then turned and walked slowly back to examine us . All this was done without noise and in the most respectful manner . " The chief was standing , with two venerable men , at the door of his residence . The three were entirely destitute of clothing . Each one held the calumet of peace in his hand . The guests were received with smiles and a few cordial words of welcome . Together they all entered the spacious wigwam . It was very comfortable and even cheerful in its aspect , being carpeted , and its sides were lined with mats ingeniously woven from rushes . The Frenchmen , as before , were placed upon central mats , while all the dignitaries of the village silently entered and took their seats around . The chief rose , and in a few very appropriate words bade the strangers welcome to his country . Again the pipe of peace was presented to them and passed the rounds . M. Marquette , who , as we have said , was quite at home in all matters of Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " We have come as friends to visit the nations on this side of the great river . " In token of the truth of these words , he made the chief a handsome present . He then added , " God , the Father of us all , has had pity on you , though you have long been ignorant of Him . He wishes to become known to all nations , and has sent me to communicate His will to you , and wishes you to acknowledge and obey Him . " Another present was handed the chief . He then continued , " My king , the great chief of the French , wishes that peace should reign everywhere ; that there should be no more wars . The Iroquois , who have been the enemies of the Illinois , he has subdued . " Another present was given , in confirmation of the truth of these words . In conclusion of this brief yet comprehensive speech , he remarked , " And now I have only to say that we entreat you to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea into which the great river runs , and of the nations through whom we must pass on our way to reach it . " The chief rose , and addressing Father Marquette , said , " I thank thee , Blackgown , and thee also , " bowing to M. Joliet , " for taking so much pains to come and visit us . Never has the earth been so beautiful to us , and never has the sun shone so brightly upon us as to-day . Never has our river been so calm or so free from rocks . Your canoes have swept them away . Never has our tobacco had so fine a flavor , or our corn been so luxuriant as we behold it to-day , now that you are with us . " Then , turning to a little Indian captive boy , at his side , whom they had taken from some hostile tribe , and had adopted into the family of the chief , he added : " Here is my son . I give him to you that you may know my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon all my nation . Thou knowest the Great Spirit who has made us all . Thou speakest to Him and hearest His word . Ask Him to give me life and health , and to come and dwell with us , that we may know Him . " He then led the little captive to the side of M. Marquette . This was in return for the first present . Holding in his hand a calumet very highly carved and ornamented with feathers , he presented it to the father , saying : " This is the sacred calumet . It signifies that , wherever you bear it , you are the messengers of peace . All our tribes will respect it , and will protect you from every harm . " The bowl of the pipe was of some highly polished red stone . The stem , elaborately decorated , was of a reed about two feet long . " By this present , " said he , " we wish to show our esteem for your chief , whom we must all revere after the account you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth presents consisted , so far as we can judge from the rather obscure narrative , of two thick mats , one for each of the guests , to serve them for beds on their voyage . At the same time the chief said : " I beg of you , in behalf of the whole nation , not to go any farther down the river . Your lives will be in the greatest peril . " I replied , " Father Marquette writes , " that I did not fear death , and that I esteemed no happiness greater than that of losing my life for the glory of God , who made us all . But this , these poor people could not understand . " The council now broke up , and a great feast was given . It consisted of four courses . The first much resembled what is called in New England hasty pudding . It consisted of Indian meal , and corn pounded fine , and boiled in an earthen pot , and was eaten with melted fat . The master of ceremonies took some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite neatly made , fed the two Frenchmen as a mother feeds a child . The second course consisted of three boiled fishes . Carefully the bones were removed , and the Indian who served them placed the food in the mouths of their guests as before . He blew upon it , to be sure that it was sufficiently cool . For the third course there was brought forward a large baked dog . This was considered a great delicacy , and was deemed the highest compliment which could be shown to a guest . But the prejudices of the Frenchmen were such that they could not eat dog , and this dish was removed . The fourth course consisted of fat and tender cuts of buffalo meat . This also was placed in their mouths as parents feed a child . There were three hundred wigwams in the village . After the feast the guests were led into each one of them , and introduced to the inmates . As they walked through the streets a large crowd accompanied them . Some men , officiating as a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people not to press too close , and not to be troublesome . Many presents were made them of belts and scarfs woven from hair and fur , and other small articles of Indian manufacture , brilliantly colored and richly embroidered with shells . They had also knee-bands and wrist-bands which were quite ornamental . That night the guests slept in the wigwam of the chief . The next morning they took leave of their generous entertainers . The chief himself accompanied them to their canoes , followed by a retinue of nearly six hundred persons . We can not record this friendly reception without emotion . How beautiful is peace ! How different would the history of this world have been but for man 's inhumanity to man ! CHAPTER II . The First Exploration of the Mississippi River . River Scenery . The Missouri . Its Distant Banks . The Mosquito Pest . Meeting the Indians . Influence of the Calumet . The Arkansas River . A Friendly Greeting . Scenes in the Village . Civilization of the Southern Tribes . Domestic Habits . Fear of the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had astronomical instruments with which they ascertained , with much accuracy , the latitude of all their important stopping places . As they state that the two villages , which they visited , were on the western side of the Mississippi , at the latitude of forty degrees north , and upon the banks of a stream flowing into the Great River , it is supposed that these villages were upon the stream now called Des Moines , which forms a part of the boundary between Iowa and Missouri . The Indians called the villages Pe-ou-a-sea and Moing-wena . They were probably situated about six miles above the present city of Keokuk . It was three o'clock in the afternoon , of a day near the end of sunny , blooming June , when our voyagers resumed their adventurous tour . Nearly the whole tribe they had visited stood upon the bank to bid them adieu . They floated along through a very dreary country of precipitous rocks and jagged cliffs , which quite shut out from their view the magnificent prairie region which was spread out beyond this barrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently inaccessible , they saw , with surprise , two figures painted in very brilliant colors and with truly artistic outline . They thought that the painting would have done honor to any European artist . The figures were of two rather frightful looking monsters , about the size of a calf , in red , green , and black . Stoddard , in his history of Louisiana , says that these painted monsters , between the Missouri and the Illinois Rivers , still remain in a good degree of preservation . " As we were discoursing of them , " writes Father Marquette , " sailing gently down a beautiful , still , clear water , we heard the noise of a rapid , into which we were about to fall . I have seen nothing more frightful . A mass of large trees , entire , with branches , real floating islands , came rushing from the mouth of the river Pekitunouei , so impetuously that we could not , without great danger , expose ourselves to pass across . The agitation was so great that the water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the rush and the roar of the incoming billows of the terrible Missouri , the most tremendous river upon this globe . It enters the Mississippi through a channel half a mile in breadth , rushing down with a sort of maniacal fury , from its sources among the Rocky Mountains at the distance of three thousand and ninety-six miles . Its whole course , from its rise to its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico , is four thousand three hundred and forty-nine miles . More than two hundred and fifty years after this , Mr. George Catlin ascended this river in the first steamer which ever ventured to breast its torrent . It took the steamer three months to ascend to the mouth of the Yellowstone , two thousand miles from the city of St. Louis . At this point the American Fur Company had erected a very substantial fort , three hundred feet square , for the protection of their property against the savages . The banks of the stream were lined with the villages of the Indians . Their wigwams were of a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and picturesque aspect . Crowds of weird-like savages would often be collected on the bluffs , watching the appalling phenomenon of the passing steamer . The Missouri is different , perhaps , from any other river in the world . Its boiling , turbid waters rush impetuously on , in an unceasing current , for hundreds of leagues , with scarcely a cove , an eddy , or any resting place where a canoe can be tranquilly moored . The Indian name of the river signifies Muddy Water . It is so opaque , like a cup of chocolate , that a newly coined shilling , placed in a tumbler , can not be seen through the eighth part of an inch of the water . For nearly a thousand miles the whole bed of the stream was impeded with gigantic trees , torn from the rich alluvial banks , forming snags and sawyers and rafts , through which , often with difficulty , the steamer cut her way . Every island and sandbar was covered with dreary looking masses of driftwood of every conceivable variety . This desolate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aspect of marvellous beauty often presented on the banks . It was almost a fairy scene . Hills and vales , bluffs and ravines , were continually presented in successions of sublimity and beauty which charmed the eye . Prairies were often spread out before them of boundless expanse , upon which vast herds , often numbering thousands , of buffaloes , elks , and antelopes , were seen grazing . In the gloomy forests , wolves were roaming . Mountain goats bounded over the cliffs . And at times , the air seemed darkened with the myriad birds which rose from the tall grass . There was one twelve-pound , and three or four eight-pound cannon on board the steamer . At every village which was passed , the banks would be crowded with the astounded natives . Mischievously , the captain would order all the cannon to be simultaneously discharged . The effect upon the terrified savages was ludicrous in the extreme . They were all thrown into utter consternation . The more devout threw themselves upon the ground , and , hiding their faces , cried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and the children , ran screaming back into the prairie , or behind the hills . Occasionally , a little band of veteran warriors , the bravest of the brave , would stand their ground , ready to meet the terrors of even a supernatural foe . " Sometimes , " writes Catlin , " they were thrown neck and heels over each other 's heads and shoulders  --  men , women , children and dogs ; sage , sachem , old and young , all in a mass  --  at the frightful discharge of the steam from the escape-pipe , which the captain of the boat let loose among them , for his own fun and amusement . " As our voyagers , in their birch bark canoes , passed the mouth of this wonderful stream , they had no conception of the scenes which were transpiring in thousands of Indian villages on its far-distant waters . They began now to think , from the course of the Mississippi , that it must flow into the Gulf of Mexico . They had however learned , from the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as they called it , Pekitanouei , five or six days ' sail , they would come to a very beautiful prairie , ninety-five miles long . This splendid country , which was represented as an Eden of loveliness , the Indians said could be easily crossed , carrying their canoes . They could then take another river which ran southwest into a small lake . This was the source of another large and deep river , which emptied into the western sea . In subsequent years , this description of the Indians was found to be unexpectedly correct . By ascending the Missouri to the Platte River , and following that stream to its source among the Rocky Mountains , the traveller is brought within a few leagues of the Colorado , which flows into the Gulf of California . Having passed the dangerous rush of the Missouri , as it entered into the Mississippi , and floating upon the surface of their combined waters , they came , after the sail , as they judged , of about sixty miles , to the mouth of another large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystal purity , flowing in from the east . The Indians very appropriately called it Wabash , which signified Beautiful River . The French subsequently called it La Belle Riviere . We have given it the name of Ohio , appropriating the name Wabash to one of its most important tributaries . The voyagers learned that this stream was fringed with a succession of Indian villages . The various tribes were peaceful , averse to war . In one district there was a cluster of twenty-three villages ; in another , of eighteen . But alas for man ! It would seem that the fallen children of Adam were determined that there should be no happiness in this world . The ferocious Iroquois would send their war parties , hundreds of miles through the wilderness , to make unprovoked attacks upon these unwarlike people . They would rob them of their harvests , wantonly burn their wigwams , kill and scalp men , women , and children , and carry off captives to torture and burn at the stake , in barbarian festivities . Near the mouth of this river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors of red , purple , and violet . Father Hennepin rubbed some of the red upon his paddle . The constant use of that paddle in the water , for fifteen days , did not efface the color . This was a favorite resort of the Indians to obtain materials for painting their persons . They now entered the region of that terrible pest , the mosquito . Elephants , lions , tigers , can be exterminated . The mosquito bids defiance to all mortal powers . The Indians would build a scaffolding of poles , a mere grate-work , which would give free passage to smoke . A few pieces of bark , overhead , sheltered them from the rain , and the excessive heat of the sun . Upon these poles they slept , kindling smouldering fires beneath . They could better endure the suffocating fumes which thus enveloped them and drove away their despicable tormenters , than bear the poison of their stings . The voyagers were greatly annoyed by these insects . As they were thus swept down the infinite windings of the stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current , they perceived one morning , much to their surprise , a small band of Indians on the shore , armed with guns . The savages seemed very much at their ease , and waited the approach of the canoes . Father Hennepin stood up and waved toward them his peace calumet , with its imposing decoration of feathers . His companions held their muskets in readiness to repel any assault . Drawing near the shore , the father addressed them in the Huron language . They did not understand him , but made friendly signs for the party to land . The Indians led the Frenchmen into their wigwams and feasted them upon buffalo steaks , with bear 's fat , and some very delicious wild plums . It appeared that these Indians were a band of warriors , probably from the Tuscarora nation . They had seen the Spaniards , on the Florida coast , and had purchased of them guns , axes , and knives . They kept their powder in strong glass bottles . From them they learned that a ten days ' voyage down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean . The indefatigable missionary endeavored to give them some idea of God , and of salvation through Jesus Christ , who came to seek and save the lost . And now , with renewed courage , our adventurers entered their canoes and resumed their paddles . The prairies , which had so long delighted their eyes , gradually disappeared , and the dense forest lined both sides of the stream . It was very evident , however , that upon the other side of the forest-crowned eminences , the prairies continued to extend in all their sublimity and beauty ; for they often heard the bellowing , as the roar of distant thunders , from thousands of wild cattle roving the plains . They had now descended to nearly the thirty-third degree of north latitude , when they came to a large Indian village , situated upon a plain raised but a few feet above the level of the water . These Indians had undoubtedly received some great outrage from the Spaniards ; for no sooner did they catch a sight of the Europeans than they were thrown into great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were evidently aware that a few men , armed with the dreadful musket , might overpower a large number who wielded only the Indian weapons of warfare . These warriors were armed with bows and arrows , javelins , and war clubs . They seemed to know that the invisible bullet could strike with death far beyond the reach of any of their missiles . They moved therefore with great caution . In those southern latitudes the birch tree , from whose bark the canoes of the northern Indians were made , did not thrive . Their boats were made of large logs , hollowed out and neatly shaped . They were often ornamented with infinite labor . Some of the warriors prepared to overwhelm the strangers with a shower of arrows from the land . Others embarked in their larger boats to ascend the river , and others to descend , so as to cut off all possibility of retreat . As the voyagers drew near the shore , Father Marquette stood up in his canoe , though exposed to imminent danger of being pierced by their arrows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , as he writes , imploring the aid of " our patroness and guide , the Blessed Virgin Immaculate . And indeed , " he continues , " we needed her aid , for we heard , from afar , the Indians exciting one another to the combat by continual yells . " In the terror and tumult of the moment the calumet had not been seen . But as soon as some of the chiefs caught sight of it , they rushed into the water , threw their bows and arrows into the canoes , which they seized and brought to the shore . Father Marquette and M. Joliet were so familiar with the customs of the Indians that they understood this to be a friendly movement , and they no longer felt any great anxiety ; though they were aware that , through some sudden outbreak of the savage sense of revenge , they might lose their lives . The good father addressed them in six Indian languages , none of which they understood . At last an old man came forward , who spoke a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Indians several valuable presents , and informed them of their desire to find the way to the ocean . " They perfectly understood our meaning , " writes Father Marquette , " but I know not whether they understood what I told them of God , and the things which concerned their salvation . It is a seed cast in the earth , which will bear its fruit in season . " The Indians , in return , presented them with corn pounded into meal , and some fishes . They said that , at some distance farther down the river , there was a large village called Akamsea ; that there they could learn all they wished to know respecting the course and the out-flow of the Father of Waters . The voyagers slept in the wigwams of the Indians during the night , though the father confesses that it was not without some uneasiness . The Akamsea , to which the Indians referred , was what we now call Arkansas . It is supposed that this village was near the Indian village of Guachoya , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a previous volume of this series , breathed his last , one hundred and fifty years before . In the narrative which has descended to us of that ill-fated and cruel expedition the historian writes : " The same day , July 2 , 1543 , that we left Aminoya , we passed by Guachoya , where the Indians tarried for us in their canoes . " It was at Aminoya that De Moscoso , who succeeded De Soto , built his little fleet of seven strong barges , with which the Spaniards descended , in a voyage of sixteen days , to the mouth of the river . The Spaniards were as ignorant of the sources of the mighty river upon which they were sailing , as were the French of the termination of the majestic flood , which they had discovered nearly two thousand miles , far away amidst the lakes and prairies of the north . The next morning , at an early hour , the Frenchmen resumed their voyage . A party of ten Indians accompanied them , leading the way in one of their large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Illinois language , also went with them as an interpreter . When they had descended the river nearly thirty miles , and were within about a mile and a half of the Arkansas village , they saw two boats , crowded with warriors , push out from the shore , and advancing to meet them . The keen eyes of the savages had probably discerned the Indian boat which led the frail canoes of the Frenchmen . They knew that persons thus approaching could come with no hostile attempt . The chief of this party , distinguished by his gorgeous dress , stood up in his boat , and , waving the plumed calumet , sung , in a very plaintive but agreeable tone , some Indian ode of welcome . He came with smiles and friendly signs alongside of the two birch canoes which kept close together . First , having taken a few whiffs from the pipe , he presented it to them to smoke . Then , having given them some bread , made of Indian meal , he made signs for them to follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as we have before described , as a protection from the mosquitoes . It also afforded a cool shelter from the rays of an almost tropical sun . The ground floor was carpeted with very fine rush mats . In the centre of this spacious awning , the Frenchmen were seated , as in the post of honor . The head chief , with his subordinates , surrounded them . Then the encircling warriors , several hundred in number , took their seats . A motley but perfectly orderly crowd of men , women , and children gathered around as witnesses of the scene . Fortunately there was a young warrior there who had travelled , and who was much more familiar with the Illinois language than the old man who had accompanied the voyagers as interpreter . " Through him , " says the faithful missionary , " I first spoke to the assembly by the ordinary presents . They admired what I told them of God , and the mysteries of our holy faith , and showed a great desire to keep me with them to instruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , they said that it could be easily reached , in their canoes , in ten days . They , however , stated that they knew but little about the nations who inhabited the lower part of the river , because they were their enemies . These Indians had hatchets , knives , and beads . This proved that , in some way , they had held intercourse with Europeans . Upon being consulted on this question , it appeared that they had obtained them through the Spaniards in Florida and Mexico . They warned the voyagers not to go any farther down the river , as they would certainly be attacked and destroyed by the war parties of these hostile bands . While this conference was going on , which continued for several hours , the Indians were continually presenting their guests with plates of food , which consisted principally of meal-pudding , roast corn , and dogs ' flesh . The Indians were very courteous . But it was not a powerful or war-like tribe . They often had but a meagre supply of food , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in pursuit of game . Their main reliance was upon corn . They sowed it at all seasons , raising three crops a year . While some fields were just sprouting , others were in the soft and milky state suitable for roasting , and other fields were waving with the ripe and golden harvest . These southern tribes were generally much more advanced in the arts than those farther north . They manufactured many quite admirable articles of pottery for household use . It is said that some of them were hardly inferior in form and finish to the exquisite vases found in Herculaneum and Pompeii . Still they were in many respects degraded savages , of loathsome habits , but little elevated above the brutes . Many of the men wandered about without any clothing . The women were not regarded with any honor . They were beasts of burden , dressed in wretched skins , without any ornaments . Their wigwams were long and wide , made of bark , with a single central entrance . Almost like the cattle , they slept together at the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground . From the description of Father Marquette , we should infer that , in this melancholy village , the chiefs alone enjoyed the luxury of sleeping upon poles enveloped with suffocating smoke to drive away the mosquitoes . " We ate no fruit there , " writes Marquette , " but watermelons . If they knew how to cultivate their grounds they might have plenty of all kinds . " In the evening M. Joliet and Father Marquette held a conference in reference to their future course . They had ascertained that they were at 33 deg. 40 ' north latitude . The basin of the Gulf of Mexico was at 31 deg. 40 ' . Though the Indians had said that they could reach the sea in ten days , it was manifest that they could easily accomplish the distance in four or five . The question was consequently settled that the Mississippi ran into the Gulf of Mexico . To decide this point was the great object of their voyage . Spanish outrages had exasperated all the Indians along the southern coast . The voyagers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent peril of their lives . Should they thus perish , the result of their discoveries would , for a long time , be lost to the world . They feared the Spaniards even more than they did the savages . The Spaniards , jealous of the power of France , would certainly hold them as prisoners , if they could take them , and would not improbably put them to death to prevent the fact of their having descended the whole course of the Mississippi from being known . They therefore wisely determined to retrace their steps with all energy . On the 17th of July they left the village of Akamsea , near the mouth of the Arkansas River , to stem the strong current of the Mississippi on their return . At high-water the vast flood , a mile in width , rushed along at the rate of five or six miles an hour . They found it very difficult to force their way against this current . We have no particular account of the incidents of their long and laborious return voyage . When they had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the Illinois River . The Indians informed them that this would be a shorter route to Lake Michigan than to go up the Mississippi still farther to the Wisconsin River . They therefore entered this stream , which takes its rise within six miles of the lake . In the glowing account which Father Marquette gives of this river , he writes : " We had seen nothing like this river for the fertility of the land , its prairies , woods , wild cattle , stags , deer , wild-cats , bustards , swans , ducks , parrots , and even beavers . It has many little lakes and tributary rivers . The stream on which we sailed is broad , deep , and gentle , for sixty-five leagues . During the spring , and part of the summer , when the rivers are full , the portage is only a mile and a half in length . " They ascended the Illinois until , by a short portage , they could transport their canoes across the prairie to the Chicago River . Descending this stream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands , but which was then only a dreary expanse of marshy prairie , they paddled up the western coast of Lake Michigan until they reached the mission at Green Bay , about the middle of September . About two months were spent in the toilsome voyage from Arkansas . General Wool , Inspector-General of the army of the United States , has made , from a personal acquaintance with the route , the following estimate of the distances of the several stages of this eventful journey : From Green Bay up Fox River to the portage 175 miles From the portage down the Wisconsin to the Mississippi 175 " From the mouth of the Wisconsin to the mouth of the Arkansas 1087 " From the Arkansas to the Illinois River 547 " From the mouth of the Illinois to Chicago 305 " From Chicago to Green Bay , by the lake shore 260 " Total 2,549 The accompanying fac-simile of a map attached to Marquette 's Journal , reduced from the original , and which we take from Mr. Sparks 's brief but admirable sketch of Marquette 's Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route he pursued . The dotted line from the Mississippi to the Illinois , marked " Chemin du retour , " is evidently a mistake , added by some other hand . It is clear , from the narrative , that the voyagers returned up the Illinois River . Father Marquette , who was never known to utter a murmuring word , and who was serene and cheerful amidst the sorest trials , was so utterly exhausted by the toils of the expedition that he could proceed no farther than Green Bay . Here M. Joliet separated from him and continued his route , in a birch canoe , along the vast expanse of Huron , Erie , and Ontario , and down the St. Lawrence to Montreal . In descending the rapids of the river his canoe was over-set and all his papers lost , he narrowly escaping with his life . He subsequently dictated , from memory , a few pages of the incidents of the voyage ; but the manuscript of Father Marquette alone remained to tell the wondrous story . This was sent to France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true grandeur of that valley he had entered , extending from the Alleghany ridges to the Rocky Mountains . Still , when the tidings of his wonderful discoveries reached Quebec , the exciting intelligence was received with the ringing of bells , with salvos of artillery , and , most prominent and important of all , by nearly the whole population , led by the clergy and other dignitaries of the place , going in procession to the cathedral where the Te Deum was sung in thanksgiving to God .

A Winter with the Savages . Journey to the Kankakee . The Great Council on the Prairie . Interesting Incidents . The Escort of Savages . The Death Scene . Sublime Funeral Solemnities . Father Marquette spent the winter and the whole summer of 1674 at Green Bay , actively engaged in the services of the mission , though in a very feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably genial and companionable , fond of pleasantry , ever greeting others with pleasant words and benignant smiles . He had promised the Illinois Indians that he would return to them , to teach them the religion of peace and good-will brought to the world by the Son of God . His health being somewhat recruited , he set out , by direction of his superiors , with two boatmen , Pierre and Jacques , to establish a mission among these Indians , who were anxiously awaiting his arrival . The mission at Green Bay was at the southern extremity of that inland sea . Taking their canoe and all their effects upon their shoulders , they crossed the peninsula , which separated the bay from the lake , through an Indian trail about thirty miles in length . They then launched their canoe upon the broad surface of Lake Michigan . The cold gales of November had now begun to plough the surface of this inland sea . Their progress was very slow . Often the billows were such that the canoe could not ride safely over them . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trudged along the shore , bearing all their effects upon their shoulders ! Ice formed upon the margin of the water , and several snow-storms impeded their march , adding greatly to their discomfort . But not a repining word escaped the lips of Father Marquette . It was but a dismal shelter they could rear , for the night , on the bleak shore . Through this exposure his health began rapidly to fail . It took them nearly four weeks to reach the mouth of the Chicago River . They ascended the river several leagues , until they came to a small cluster of Indian wigwams . The savages were poor , but few in number , and their abodes comfortless . But Pere Marquette was so sick that they could go no farther . These Indians were of the Miami tribe . Here the voyagers built a small log-cabin , and , destitute of what many would deem the absolute necessaries of life , passed the remaining weeks of the dreary winter . One would suppose that the lone missionary must at times have contrasted painfully his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancestral castle in which he was cradled . A few wretched wigwams were scattered over the snow-whitened plains , where poverty , destitution , and repulsive social habits reigned , such as is perhaps never witnessed in civilized life . His home was but a cabin of logs , with the interstices stuffed with moss . The roof was covered with bark . The window was merely a hole cut through the logs . In storms a piece of cloth hung over it , which partially kept out wind and rain . The fireplace was one corner of the room , with a hole in the roof through which the smoke ascended . Often the state of the atmosphere was such that the cabin was filled with smothering smoke . A few mats , woven coarsely from bulrushes , covered a portion of the earth floor . A mat was his bed . A log , covered with a mat , was his chair ; his food was pounded corn , and fishes and flesh of animals , broiled on the coals ; his companions , savages . Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for the baronial splendors of his ancestors . It was two hundred years ago . Father Marquette has received his rewards . His earthly labors and sacrifices were for but about twenty years . For two hundred years he has occupied a mansion , which God reared for him in heaven . There he is now , with his crown , his robe , and his harp , with angel companionship . And there he is to dwell forever . There is something exceedingly beautiful in the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ . God , in the person of his Son , came to earth and suffered and died to make atonement for human sin . All who will abandon sin , and try to live doing nothing wrong , and endeavoring to do everything that is right , He will forgive , and make forever happy in heaven . This is the Gospel ; the Good News . God is no respecter of persons ; but in every nation , he that feareth him and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him . The loitering Indians , ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , in the cabin of the sick Christian teacher . And when he told them of that happy world where they shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more , and where God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes , the truth came home to their hearts , and became its own witness . And yet here , as elsewhere , the Gospel of Jesus found its bitter antagonists . With the Indians , as in every city and town in Christendom , there were those who did not wish to be holy . They hated a Gospel which demanded the abandonment of sin . These men , with bloody tomahawks and gory scalping knives , and who , from infancy , had been practising the hideous war-whoop ; who consider the glory of their manhood to depend upon the number of enemies they had slain , and whose greatest delight consisted in listening to the shrieks , and witnessing the convulsions of their agonized victims at the stake , denounced the Christian teacher , as the Jews denounced the Son of God , crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking in languor , which both he and his companions supposed to be a monition of speedily approaching death . And yet he was a cheerful and happy man . All incomers at his cabin were greeted with smiles . Death had no terror . Brighter and brighter grew the path , as he drew nearer to the celestial city . His log-cabin was continually crowded with those who sought instruction . The two humble companions who attended him were devout men , though uneducated , and in life 's lowly station . They joined heartily in the devotions of the cabin . The voices of the three were joined in matins and vespers , and floated sweetly over those dreary wastes , where such heavenly strains had never been heard before . Louis XIV . was then upon the throne of France . He was one of the greatest , most powerful , most opulent of all earthly monarchs . The wealth and the genius of earth could construct nothing more grand than his palaces at Marly and Versailles . His banqueting-hall was unsurpassed by any other hall ever reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his galleries , are still visited by astonished and admiring thousands . And yet no one , familiar with his life , will deny that Father Marquette , in his log-cabin , surrounded by Indian wigwams , probably passed a happier winter than did Louis XIV. , amidst the most dazzling splendors which ever surrounded a mortal . Christmas came . It was made by the three a season of special devotion , that God would so reinvigorate Father Marquette , as to enable him to fulfil his promise , and visit the Illinois Indians , and teach them the Gospel . These devotions were called a Novena , which was a nine days ' prayer-meeting . Their prayers were heard . Contrary to all reasonable expectation , he so far regained his strength as to be able , on the 29th of March , to resume his journey . The chill winds of departing winter still swept the plains . Storms of sleet often beat upon them . The ground , alternately thawing and freezing , was frequently whitened with snow . And still these heroic men , with chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their journey was slow . Sometimes they floated upon the stream . Again they followed the Indian trail through forest and prairie . After traversing a route about a hundred and fifty miles in length , they reached , on the 8th of April , the Kankakee River , an important tributary of the Illinois . At this point , which is now in the present county of Kankakee , and near where the village of Rockport stands , the Illinois Indians had their large and populous village . The missionary was received , we are told , as an angel from heaven . He assembled all the chiefs of the tribe , with the renowned warriors , that with imposing ceremonies he might announce to them the object of his coming , and impress them with the momentous importance of his message . There was no wigwam sufficiently capacious to accommodate such a multitude as the occasion would assemble . Near the village there was a smooth , verdant , beautiful prairie , richly carpeted with the velvet green of early spring . On a mild and sunny morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children  --  were seen crowding to the appointed station . The chiefs were dressed in truly gorgeous habiliments , of plumes , skins richly embroidered and fringed , and brilliantly colored . Their robes were more showy than any court-dress ever witnessed at Windsor Castle or the Tuileries . The warriors , with proud demeanor and stately tread , marched along , with quivers of arrows at their backs , and bows in their hands . Tomahawks and scalping knives were ostentatiously displayed , and the scalps of enemies dangled at their javelin points , as badges of their nobility . Of these they were more proud than were ever English , French , or Spanish grandees of the decoration of stars or garters . The women and the dogs came next . They were alike regarded as necessary drudges to bear burdens , and to be fed with the refuse which their masters left . Then came the boys and girls , many of them half naked , shouting , laughing , racing , engaging in all the uncouth merriment of a savage gala day . The spot selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion of the people and their times . The ground was covered with mats , made of the skins of bears and other animals . Posts were planted , draped and festooned with green boughs . Upon each of the four sides of the square , the good father , who had ever been taught to regard with the utmost veneration the Mother of Jesus , hung a picture of the Blessed Virgin , that all might gaze upon her sad yet beautiful features . Father Marquette took his seat upon a mat , in the centre of the enclosure . Then the chiefs , and the veteran warriors , who in many a bloody foray had won renown , took their seats around him . Silently and with the dignity becoming great men , they assumed their positions . The young men , who had not yet signalized themselves , and who were ever eager to go upon the war-path , that they might return with their trophies of gory scalps , to receive the applause of the nation as braves , came next . In respect to the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our fallen race , there is but little difference between the civilized and uncivilized man . I was once breakfasting with one of the most distinguished officers of a European army . To my question whether the officers generally wished for peace or war , he replied : " War , of course . In times of peace promotion comes slowly . But upon the battle field promotions are very rapidly made . " The young warriors counted about fifteen hundred . Outside of their circle , the women and the children were clustered . It was estimated that the whole population of the village amounted to about three thousand . The Illinois Indians were at war with the Miamis , among whom Father Marquette had passed the winter . The Illinois chiefs had obtained of the traders a few guns . Immediately upon Marquette reaching their village , they hastened to entreat of him powder and ball , that they might fit out an expedition against their foes . Father Marquette rose at the council , and after presenting the chiefs with some valuable gifts , in token of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do them good , addressed them in substance as follows : " I have not brought you any powder or balls . I do not wish you to fight your brethren the Miamis . You are all the children of the same Father . You should love one another . I have come to tell you of God , and to teach you to pray . God , the Great Spirit , came to the world , and became a man , whose name was Jesus . He died upon the cross to atone for the sins of all men . And now , if you will cease to sin ; if you will love your Father , the Great Spirit , pray to Him and do everything in your power to please Him , He will bless you , and when you die will take you to dwell with Him and will make you happy forever . " Such was , in general , the address of Father Marquette . Such was ever , in substance , his teaching . Jesus the Christ , and Him crucified , was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar exercises . The Indians crowded around the father constantly . They listened to his teachings with respectful and apparently with even joyful attention . He was pale and emaciate . Even the Indian could perceive , from his feeble voice and emaciate steps , that he was not far from the grave . On Easter Sunday , the faithful missionary , with solemn and imposing ceremonies , took , if we may so speak , spiritual possession of the land , in the name of Jesus Christ . The rapidly failing health of the missionary , rendered it expedient for him to endeavor to return to his friends at Green Bay . The poor Indians really mourned at the idea of his departure . Time hung heavily upon their hands . They had but little to think of , and but little to do . Loitering indolently around , from morning till night , it was a great source of enjoyment to them , to crowd the large wigwam they had built for the father , to listen to his words , to question him , and to witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were therefore much troubled at the thought of his departure , and were but partially comforted by his repeated assurances that he would either soon return again , or send some one else to continue the mission which he had thus commenced . Slowly and feebly he set out on his long journey back to Green Bay . It was ninety miles from Kankakee to the southern extremity of Lake Michigan . They could paddle in canoes over a portion of the route . But there were also weary miles of portage which they had to pass over , through Indian trails , carrying their canoe , and all their effects , upon their backs . It was a severe undertaking for a sick man , who was so feeble that even if a horse could have been provided for him to ride , he could scarcely have held himself upon the saddle . A large party of the Indians accompanied the father , on this weary journey to the lake . They administered to his wants with the tenderest care , relieving him of every burden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encampments , they provided for him a shelter , kindled his fire , cooked his food , and spread for him a couch of leaves and twigs . When they reached a small stream , which ran into the lake , they placed him as comfortably as possible in his canoe , and intrusting him to the care of his two faithful boatmen , Jacques and Pierre , bade him an affectionate farewell . The savages , after these deeds of almost Christian kindness , returned to their wigwams , to sharpen the edges of their tomahawks , the points of their javelins , the barbs of their arrows ; and were soon , with hideous yells , rushing upon their foes the Miamis , burning , killing , scalping  --  performing deeds of cruelty which ought to cause even demons to blush . Father Marquette was too weak to wield the paddle . He reclined in the bottom of the canoe , with his head slightly elevated , so that he could see all the beauties of the scenery through which they were passing . His prayer-book was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful and happy . His companions have testified to the wonderful amiability , gentleness , and joy he maintained . He told them plainly that he should die upon the voyage , but encouraged them to bear courageously all the hardships they were to encounter on the way , assuring that the Lord would not forsake them . As his attendants plied their paddles he read prayers to them , sang sweet hymns of devotion , and in many fervent utterances commended them and himself to God . He was in no pain . His eye sparkled with animation . His soul was triumphant . It may be doubted whether , on the broad continent of North America , there were , in these hours , an individual to be found more happy than he . It was one of the mornings of lovely May , when this frail birch canoe , with its three inmates , emerging from a small stream , entered upon the ocean-like expanse of Lake Michigan . On the north and the east the majestic inland sea spread out to the horizon , with no bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the eastern shore of the lake , on their return voyage , though their outward voyage had been by the western shore . They had still a journey of three hundred miles before them . Father Marquette was so weak that he could no longer help himself . He could neither move nor stand , and had to be carried from the canoe to the shore like an infant . At each encampment the attendants would draw the canoe , with Father Marquette in it , gently upon the beach . They would then hastily rear a shelter , spread for him a couch of the long and withered herbage , and lay him tenderly upon it . The only food they could prepare for the fainting invalid , was corn pounded into coarse meal , mixed with water , and baked in the ashes , with perhaps a slice of game broiled upon the coals . Thus they moved along , day after day , expecting almost every hour that the death summons would come . On Friday evening , the 27th of May , 1675 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the morrow he should take his departure for his heavenly home . He gave them minute instructions respecting the place he wished to be selected for his burial ; directed how to arrange his hands and feet , and how to wrap him in his robes , for he could have no coffin . While one was to read the burial service the other was gently to toll the small chapel bell which he bore with him on his mission . The canoe was gliding along near the shore , as the father gave these instructions , reclining upon his mat . The setting sun was sinking apparently into the shoreless waters of the lake , in the west . They were all examining the land , the boatmen searching for a suitable spot for their night 's encampment , and the father looking for a good place for his dying bed and his burial . They came to the mouth of a small , pleasant river , which presented a sheltered cove for their canoe . There was an eminence near by , crowned by a beautiful grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land . It had a sunny exposure , drained of moisture , and composed of just such soil as seems suitable for a grave . Father Marquette pointed to the eminence in the lone , silent , solitary wilderness , and said , " There is the spot for my last repose . " The boatmen ran their canoe up the mouth of the river , a few rods , and landed . Hastily they threw up a frail camp , kindled a fire , spread down a mat for a couch , and placed their revered spiritual father upon it . He was then left entirely alone , with his God , while his companions were engaged in unloading the canoe . They were silent and sad , for they could not but perceive that the dying hour was at hand . When they returned , Father Marquette gave them his last instructions . " I thank you , my dear companions , " he said , " for all the love and tenderness you have shown me during this voyage . I beg you to pardon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also say to all my fathers and brethren in the Ottowa mission that I implore their forgiveness for my imperfections . I am now very near my home . But I shall not forget you in heaven . You are very weary with the toils of the day . I shall still live probably for several hours . I wish you would retire and take that rest which you so greatly need . I will call you as soon as the last moments arrive . " They left the cabin with stricken hearts and weeping eyes . The dying Christian was left alone with his God . Who can imagine the peace and joy which must then have filled his heart and suffused his eyes . The victory was won . Death was conquered . The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof were waiting at the door of the humble cabin , to transport the victor , through the pathways of the stars , to his throne and his crown . Glorious death ! Blissful journey ! Three hours passed away , and his feeble voice was heard calling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck of each one , and drawing him gently down imprinted a kiss upon each cheek . Then , taking the crucifix , which he ever wore around his neck , he placed it in the hands of one of them , requesting him to hold that emblem of the atoning sacrifice of his Saviour before his eyes until the last moment . Then , inspired with the faith of Stephen the Martyr , clasping his hands and fixing his eyes upon this memorial of God manifest in the flesh , in fervent prayer he said : " O Lord God , I thank Thee for the boundless grace Thou hast conferred upon me in permitting me to die in the service of Jesus Christ Thy Son . O God , I thank Thee , that I have been His missionary ; and that I am permitted to die , in a cabin , in the depths of the forest , and far removed from all human aid . " There were a few moments of perfect silence . No sound fell upon the ear but the gentle breathing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I know that my Redeemer liveth . " Again he said , in accordance with the faith which he had received from childhood , " Mary ! Mother of Jesus my Lord , remember me . " Suddenly he raised his eyes from the crucifix and looked upward , as if a vision of wonderful glory was bursting upon his entranced view . His countenance shone radiant with joy . A sweet smile was upon his lips . Without a struggle , without a sigh , his soul took its flight to its home in heaven . He had fallen asleep . " Asleep in Jesus ! Far from thee , Thy kindred and their graves may be . But thine is still a blessed sleep , From which none ever wake to weep . " His two bereaved companions wept bitterly . They laid out the body as directed ; wrapped it in the threadbare garments it so long had worn , and having dug the grave , placed the revered remains within it . While one devotedly covered the body with its mother earth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to prayer . They remained upon the spot until the next day . A large cross was made , and planted firmly in the ground , in a position which would attract the attention of all passing along the shore of the lake . The two faithful boatmen , Jacques and Pierre , then , after kneeling upon the grave in fervent prayer , returned to their canoe and continued the long journey to Green Bay . They reached the mission in safety , with their sad tidings . Father Marquette died at the early age of thirty-eight . He had spent twenty-one years an earnest , self-denying minister of Jesus Christ . Twelve of these were in France . Nine were devoted to the savages of the New World . At the early age of nine years , he became an earnest Christian . Every Saturday was , with this wonderful child , a day of fasting and prayer . There were quite a number of Christian Indians at the Mackinaw mission . They had long known Father Marquette , and revered and loved him . A band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shores of Lake Michigan , upon a hunting excursion . They sought out the grave of Father Marquette . They took up the remains , carefully enclosed them in a box of birch bark , placed them in one of their canoes , and paddled them , three hundred miles , to the mission of St. Ignatius . A convoy of canoes , thirty in number , in single file , formed this wonderful funeral procession . It is doubtful whether such a scene was ever before witnessed on this globe . For more than ten days this band of Indian hunters , in their picturesque costume , silently and solemnly paddled along the shores of the lonely lake , that the remains of their beloved pastor might repose where they could visit the spot , and honor them with their testimonials of gratitude . As they approached the shore , where the mission was established , with its cross-surmounted chapel , surrounded with Indian wigwams , a courier was sent forward rapidly , in a canoe , to announce the arrival of the cortege . The whole community promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by Fathers Nouvel and Pierson , who were Superiors of the two missions , one to the Ottawas , and one to the Hurons , which were located side by side . Interrogations were first made to verify the fact , that the body they bore was really that of Father Marquette . The two ecclesiastics then chanted the sublime anthem , " Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee , O Lord . Lord , hear my voice ; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications . " The canoes were still on the water , while quite a throng of the Indians crowded the shore . With the customary religious ceremonies , the body was conveyed to the chapel . It remained there for a day , covered with a pall . On the morning of the next day , which was the ninth of June , the remains were deposited in a grave , in the middle of the log chapel , which we infer had no floor but the earth ; there to repose until the trump of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves shall come forth . CHAPTER IV . Life upon the St. Lawrence and the Lakes Two Hundred Years Ago . Birth of La Salle . His Parentage and Education . Emigrates to America . Enterprising Spirit . Grandeur of his Conceptions . Visits the Court of France . Preparations for an Exploring Voyage . Adventures of the River and Lake . Awful Scene of Indian Torture . Traffic with the Indians . The Ship-yard at Lake Erie . About two hundred years ago , a young man , by the name of Robert de la Salle , crossed the Atlantic to seek his fortune in the wilds of Canada . He was born on the 22d of November , 1643 , in the city of Rouen , the ancient capital of Normandy , 1 France . He was the child of one of the most distinguished families , and enjoyed all the advantages of social and educational culture which the refinement and scholarship of those times could confer . He was by nature a thoughtful , pensive young man , whose soul was profoundly moved by the unsearchable mystery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , in the religion of Jesus , a partial solution of the sublime drama of conflict , sin , and sorrow which is being enacted on this globe , and which has no solution whatever but in the revelations of the Bible . 1 De La Salle among the Senecas , in 1669 . By O. H. Marshall , Buffalo Historical Society . Born almost beneath the shadow of the great cathedral of Rouen , and of an ancestry which from time immemorial had been the children of the Catholic Church , and instructed from infancy by revered ecclesiastics of that communion he almost as a matter of necessity accepted Christianity as presented to him in the ritual of the Church of Rome . Nature had endowed him with a restless , enterprising spirit , which led him eagerly to plunge into those wild and perilous adventures from which most persons would have turned with dismay . La Salle received an accomplished education in one of the best seminaries in Europe . Upon graduating , he received from the professors a testimonial of his high intellectual attainments and his unblemished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France for Canada . His object probably was to accumulate a fortune by the barter of European commodities for the furs and skins obtained by the Indians . He pushed forward to the frontiers , established trading houses , and in the well-freighted birch canoe , explored remote lakes and rivers . At that time the whole of the great northwest of this country was an entirely unknown land . No one knew whether the continent was one thousand or ten thousand miles in breadth . It was the general impression that the waves of the Pacific were dashing against the rocks a few miles west of the chain of great lakes which fringed the southern shores of Canada . La Salle was meditating an expedition up the St. Lawrence , through the majestic chain of lakes to Lake Superior , from the western end of which he confidently expected to find easy communication with the Pacific Ocean . There he would again spread his adventurous sail , having discovered a new route to China and the Indies . There was grandeur in this conception . It would entirely change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French possessions in the New World valuable beyond conception . This all-important route , between Europe and Asia , would be under the control of the French crown . M. Frontenac , an ambitious and energetic Frenchman , was then governor-general of Canada . He entered cordially into the plans of La Salle , conferred frequently with him upon the subject , and was sanguine in the expectation that , by this great discovery , his own name would be immortalized , and he would secure the highest applause from the Grande Monarque , Louis XIV . As early as the year 1660 , the Indians had reported , at Quebec , that many leagues west of the great lakes there was a wonderful river , the Great River , the Father of Waters , the most majestic stream in the world , flowing from the unexplored solitudes of the wilderness in the north , far away into the unknown regions of the south . One day a birch canoe , with a little band of hardy , wayworn voyagers , French and Indians , came paddling down the swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach where the little cluster of dwellings stood , called Quebec . They brought the startling intelligence that Father Marquette , a great and good man whom all knew , had discovered the Great River , which the Indians called the Mississippi , and had followed down its majestic current for hundreds of leagues , until he had reached the thirty-third degree of latitude . He had ascertained , beyond all question , that it emptied its flood into the Gulf of Mexico . This important discovery , it was claimed , gave to the French , according to the received law of nations , the whole valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries , however great that valley might prove to be . This intelligence was received with every demonstration of public rejoicing . It gave , as it was supposed , to France a new world of boundless resources . The garrison band played its most exultant airs . Salvos of artillery echoed along the majestic cliffs . There was feasting , dancing , and singing , and the spacious church was thronged with worshippers praising God with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a new impulse and a new direction to the ambition of La Salle . He at once conceived the idea of establishing a series of military and trading posts along the whole length of the lakes , and upon all the important points of the great river and its tributaries . But even then he was but little aware how magnificent was the realm which these tributaries watered . He would thus , however , in the name of the King of France , take military possession of the whole territory . Governor Frontenac gave his most cordial approval to the gigantic plan . His own mind was greatly excited by the thought of the grandeur of a chain of forts extending from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico . He urged La Salle to go immediately to France , seek an audience with the king , lay the plan before him , and seek the royal patronage . The renowned Colbert was then minister of finance and marine . The governor furnished La Salle with letters to the minister which would secure for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recrossed the ocean . It was the year 1675 . His plan at once attracted attention , and he was cordially received by both minister and king . The courtiers rallied around him with much enthusiasm . The king , having honored him with the title of chevalier , authorized him to rebuild , on the shores of Lake Ontario , Fort Frontenac , which was falling to decay , and invested him with the office of seignory or governorship of the fort and its adjacent territory . The sublime plan which La Salle thus proposed , could only be carried into execution by the continuous labors of many years . La Salle returned to Canada full of bright dreams for the future . For more than two years he was employed in rearing the walls of Fort Frontenac and improving the region around . This important post occupied a commanding position near the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario . At the close of the year 1677 he again returned to France , to report the progress he had made . His reception by the court was even more cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors and more extended privileges . On the 14th of July , 1678 , he sailed from Rochelle for Quebec . He took with him an Italian gentleman , by the name of Tonti , as his lieutenant , and a party of thirty men . After a two months ' voyage , they landed at Quebec on the 15th of September . Then , paddling up the swift current of the St. Lawrence , they passed the little cluster of log-cabins surrounded with Indian wigwams at Montreal , and after a voyage of between three and four hundred miles reached Fort Frontenac . This was indeed a post far away in the wilderness . It was strongly built , with four bastions on the northern side of the entrance to the lake , at the head of a snug forest-fringed bay , where quite a fleet of small vessels could be sheltered from the winds . It was a very curious spectacle which was then witnessed upon this remote frontier of civilization . The unbroken wilderness , where wolves howled and bears roamed , spread in apparently unbroken gloom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enclosing within its palisades a number of cabins , which the garrison occupied , and which were stored with goods suitable for traffic with the natives . There was a small green meadow spread around , which was covered with wigwams of every picturesque variety . Groups of Indians , of various tribes , were moving about . The warriors were painted and plumed , and many of them very gorgeously attired . Women , young and graceful girls , and little children , were clustered around the camp fires , some with busy hands usefully employed ; others shouting and sporting in all the varieties of barbaric pastimes . It was an instructive scene , emblematic of this fallen world . The frowning fort , with its threatening armament , proclaimed that sin had entered the world with its war and blood and misery , making man the direful foe of his brother man . The crystal stream and lake ; the azure of the overarching skies ; the bright , serene autumnal day ; the foliage , the verdure , the picturesque wigwams ; the peaceful employments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry children , showed that our ruined Eden still retained some of those glories which embellished it before man rebelled against his Maker . La Salle , on his return from Europe , in the autumn of 1678 , had brought with him a select company of sailors , carpenters , and other mechanics . At Quebec a number of Canadian boatmen joined him . These men he sent forward to Fort Frontenac , which was now virtually his castle , with the surrounding territory his estate . The boats were heavily laden with all articles for trading with the Indians , and with all the essentials for building and rigging vessels . He soon followed them , in an open birch canoe , with one or two companions . It was a long and perilous river voyage , paddling up the swift current of the St. Lawrence between its thousand islands , struggling against its rapids , and seeking for the eddies along its lonely forest-fringed shores . Several times they came near being wrecked , with inevitable death . At the close of the day it was always necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with hardy men , fond of adventure , these were pleasures rather than pains . With their axes , in half an hour they could construct a sheltering camp . A brilliant fire would dispel all gloom , with its wide-spreading illumination . The fragrant twigs of the hemlock furnished a soft couch . Here they cooked their suppers , sang their songs , told their stories , and , free from all care , probably experienced at least as much pleasure as is usually found in parlors the most sumptuous . Indian villages were quite profusely scattered along the banks of this majestic river . The scene was often quite exciting as the canoe of the voyagers approached one of these clusters of picturesque wigwams in the evening twilight . The Indians were fond of the song , and the dance , and the blaze of the bonfire . The whole expanse of river , cliff , and forest , would be lighted up . Shouts of barbaric revelry echoed through the sublime solitudes . And the warrior , the squaw , and the pappoose , flitted about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Indian wigwams , at night , the voyagers almost invariably found hospitable refuge . The Indians were generally friendly . The traffic which the French traders introduced was of inestimable value to the poor savages . And even those who were disposed to look with suspicion upon the encroachments of the white men , were overawed by the thunderings and lightnings of their death-dealing muskets . There were fishes of delicious flavor in the stream , and game in great variety upon the banks . These viands , with the food they took with them , furnished breakfasts and suppers which they deemed even sumptuous . The fort was reached in safety . On the 18th of November , La Salle sent a small vessel of ten tons burden , with a deck , to go to the farther end of Lake Ontario , a distance of about two hundred miles , and to ascend the Niagara River until the falls were reached . The vessel contained about thirty workmen , with provisions and implements for erecting a fort and building a vessel beyond the falls at the extreme eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as possible , they were to transport their effects along an Indian trail , in the wilderness , several miles above the falls and the rapids , until they reached comparatively still water at the opening of the lake . Here , in mid-winter , they were to construct their fortified magazine , and build a vessel for their vast inland tour through almost unknown seas , in search of the distant Mississippi . Even then this continent was so little known that many supposed that the Mississippi emptied into the Pacific Ocean , and that thus the long-sought-for route to China would be found . Only about ten years before , in the year 1669 , La Salle , on an exploring tour with a party of missionaries in birch canoes , had discovered these falls . M. Galinee , in his journal of the expedition , writes : " We found a river one eighth of a league broad , and extremely rapid , forming the outlet from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario . The depth is extraordinary , for we found close to the shore , fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles long . It has , from ten to twelve miles above its embouchure into Lake Ontario , one of the finest cataracts in the world . All the Indians say that the river falls from a rock higher than the tallest pines . We heard the roar at the distance of ten or twelve miles . The fall gives such momentum to the water , that its current prevented our ascending , except with great difficulty . The current above the falls is so rapid , that it often sucks in deer and stags , elk and roebuck , endeavoring to cross the river , and overwhelms them in its frightful abyss . " This is the earliest description of the falls on record . At this time nearly the whole of the present State of New York was a dense , unbroken wilderness . It is very evident , that among the Indians there were , as in every community , good men and bad men . But on the whole , the condition of humanity among the savages must have been dreadful . What are we to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation and distinction depended upon the number of human scalps , torn from the slain victims by his own hands , with which he could fringe his garments ? On this tour La Salle visited the Seneca Indians in Western New York , where the beautiful cities of civilization and Christianity now adorn the landscape . Here they witnessed one of the most tragic spectacles of savage life . Some warriors arrived in one of the villages with a prisoner . He was a finely formed young man , about nineteen years of age , from the Shawnee tribe residing near the Scioto River . They had clothed their victim for the sacrifice . Anxious that he should endure the torture as long as possible , they had treated him tenderly , that his bodily strength might not be weakened . He had been given , according to their custom , to an aged Indian woman , in place of her son who had been killed . It was at her option to adopt him or to cause him to be put to death by torture . She chose the torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which was occupied by La Salle and Galinee . The two Frenchmen visited him in the evening . Three women were wailing the death of their relative who had been killed , and were heaping imprecations upon the victim through whose tortures they hoped to avenge the death of the one who had been slain . The Christians pleaded earnestly for him , and offered large rewards to obtain him as a guide to conduct them to the Ohio . All was in vain . At the earliest dawn of the next morning , a group came rushing into La Salle 's cabin to announce that the torture was about to commence . They went out and found the victim entirely stripped of his clothing , and so bound to a stake that he could move for a distance of two or three feet . The whole band  --  men , women , and children  --  were gathered exultingly around , to enjoy the cruel pastime . The poor boy well knew what he had to undergo , for he had probably often assisted in similar scenes . M. Galinee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold some conversation with the captive . The victim , pale and terror-stricken , entreated the Frenchmen to intercede for him , that his execution might be postponed until the next day . Again they renewed their efforts to save the boy . They offered to pay a large amount of their most valuable effects for his ransom . But the Indians shook their heads and said , " It is our custom : he must die . " A large fire had been kindled near by . In it there was a long gun-barrel heated to a red heat . An Indian warrior , a staid , sober man , came forward with much dignity of manner , and taking the red-hot gun-barrel pressed it upon the soles of the victim 's feet , and moved it slowly up his legs . The skin and flesh smoked and crackled under the terrible infliction . The agony was such that the poor boy could not refrain from loud shrieks , and he was thrown into the most convulsive contortions . The savages  --  the stern men , the women , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the shrieks and witnessed the agonizing struggles of their victim , they clapped their hands , and danced and shouted in fiend-like exultation . The heated iron was passed over his whole body , from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head . There was not a spot left which was not blistered and roasted . And still they carefully avoided touching any vital point , that the horrible torture might be continued as long as possible . For six hours this poor creature endured every variety of agony which diabolical ingenuity could inflict . I will not continue the narration . It is too harrowing to be contemplated . But it is needful to go thus far to show what the Indians were without the Gospel . Galinee writes : " At length they knocked him down with a stone , and throwing themselves upon him , cut his body in pieces . One carried off his head , another an arm , a third some other member , which they put in the pot to boil for a feast . Many offered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world better to eat ; but no one desired to try the experiment . " In the evening all assembled in the public place , each with a stick in his hand , with which they began to beat the cabins on all sides , making a very loud noise , to chase away , they said , the soul of the deceased , which might be concealed in some corner to do them injury . " This scene took place in Western New York , a mile and a half west of Boughton Hill , but about two hundred years ago . Surely the religion of Jesus has improved the condition of humanity . La Salle and Galinee , unable to endure the spectacle , retired , in anguish of spirit , to their cabin . " As I was praying to God , " writes Galinee , " and very sad , La Salle came and told me that from the excitement he saw prevailing , he was apprehensive that the Indians might insult us , and that we had better return to the canoes . " Hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . La Salle joined his companions at the head of Niagara River , on the borders of Lake Erie , on the 29th of January , 1679 . The river , above the falls , was a sheet of ice , resembling a plain paved with fine polished marble . While many of his men had been employed building a vessel to be launched upon the lake , others had boldly explored all the surrounding region , purchasing of the Indians furs and skins . The winter was intensely cold , and the snow was deep . There was a small cluster of Indian wigwams on the Niagara River below the Falls . The Indians , men , women and children , received La Salle and his party even affectionately . They took the strangers into their warm cabins , spread bear-skin couches for them , to sleep with their feet toward the fire , and fed them with their daintiest bits of game . White-fish were taken in great abundance at that place , and were deemed in flavor equal to the golden brook-trout . The floating ice endangered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to a safe place upon the beach , just below those towering cliffs which fringe so large a portion of this wild river . This spot was near the present site of Queenstown , on the western side of the stream . All the goods were to be transported through a trail of the forest , encumbered with snow , around the falls , a distance of about twenty miles , on the shoulders of men . The Indians , with fraternal kindness , aided in these herculean labors , and were amply repaid for days of toil , by a knife , a hatchet , or a few trinkets , as valuable to them as are diamonds and pearls to a duchess . La Salle constructed a fortified depot at this place , to serve as a base for future operations . Here he could store such additional supplies as he might order from Fort Frontenac . Strange as it may seem , it appears that he could leave priceless treasure in a frail log-hut , thus far away in the wilderness , under the protection of the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had La Salle been captured in battle , would have shouted and leaped for joy in seeing him writhing and shrieking beneath fiend-like tortures . Such is fallen man . He is the ruin of a once noble fabric . But many fragments of his former grandeur still remain . There is no philosophy , save the religion of the Bible , which can explain these discordances . On the 20th of January , 1679 , La Salle , with his long train of heavily laden men in single file , reached his large log-cabin and ship-yard in the midst of a dense forest on the shore of Lake Erie . They brought upon their backs provisions , merchandise , ammunition , and materials for rigging the vessel . The dock-yard  --  it could hardly be called a fort  --  was about six miles above Niagara Falls , on the western side of the river , at the outlet of a little stream called Chippewa Creek . The men there had been employed in erecting their hut , cutting ship timber , and preparing the ground for building their vessel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very week of his arrival , laid the keel of his vessel , and with his own hand drove the first bolt . He had no thought of encroaching upon the lands of the Indians , or of erecting any forts in antagonism to them . The object of his expedition was solely to make discoveries in the name of France , to establish trading stations for the purchase of valuable furs of the Indians , and to erect throughout the region he traversed military posts , over which the banners of France might float , which would prove that by the right of discovery , the region belonged to France and not to England . The foe to be guarded against was the British Government , not the Indian tribes . With characteristic sagacity , La Salle summoned a council of the chiefs of all the neighboring tribes , and addressed them in substance as follows : " I come to you as a friend and a brother . I wish to buy your furs . I will pay you for them in guns and powder , knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles as you want . Thus you can do me good , and I can do you good . We can be brothers . I am building a vessel , that I may visit other tribes , purchase their furs , and carry to them our goods . Let us smoke the pipe of friendship , and shake hands . The Great Spirit will be pleased to see us , His children , love one another and help each other . I wish to establish a trading-post here , where I can collect my furs , where you can come to sell them . And here you will find mechanics who will mend your guns , knives , and kettles , when they get out of order . " These were honest words . They were convincing . All smoked the pipe and grasped hands in token of fraternity . The Frenchman was a benefactor , not an enemy . His life was to be carefully protected . Should he , from unkind treatment , refuse to come to their country , they could buy no more guns , or knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Frenchman . La Salle , while engaged in building his vessel , despatched several canoes along each shore of Lake Erie , to visit every Indian village and purchase their furs . Indian friends paddled the canoes and acted as interpreters . The arrival of one of these canoes at an Indian village was an occasion of universal rejoicing . Happy was the chief who could be honored by entertaining the white trader in his wigwam . The Frenchman was in no more danger in moving about amid their dwellings and forests , than he would have been in traversing the boulevards in Paris . A poor Indian would bring in some rich furs , to him scarcely of any value , but worth ten dollars in London or Paris . He would receive in exchange a strong , keen-edged pocket-knife , worth in London or Paris perhaps half a dollar , but to him worth ten times ten dollars . He would go home to his wigwam so happy that he could scarcely sleep . He would show his almost priceless treasure to his wife , his children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrows only with such an edge as a hard stone could afford , he was filled with inexpressible delight as the keenly cutting steel performed its wondrous work . The young lady of wealthy parents may rejoice when the grand piano first enters her father 's parlor . The fashionable matron may feel some degree of exultation as she regards the splendor of her newly furnished reception-room . But their joy was as nothing compared with the delight with which an Indian woman , for the first time in her life , hung a stout iron kettle over her cabin fire . La Salle named his vessel the " Griffin , " as that animal was one of the emblems on his family coat-of-arms . During the winter , while the vessel was on the stocks , circumstances required the presence of La Salle at Fort Frontenac . Promptly he set out for a journey on foot of three hundred miles through the snow and the woods . Two men accompanied him . A strong dog dragged a portion of the baggage on a sled . Wherever night overtook them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked their supper , wrapped themselves in furs , and fell asleep . He seemed to think no more of such a journey than a gentleman does now of a trip , in cushioned cars , from Boston to New Orleans . But nothing in this world ever goes smoothly a long time . In every man 's life it may be said , " Storm after storm rises dark o'er my way . " Several boats laden with supplies bound from Frontenac to Niagara were lost in tempests on the lake . This caused great embarrassment . Provisions even became scarce . The laborers would have suffered for food but for the services of Indian hunters who brought in deer and other game . The fur trade was becoming a matter of great importance . There were many private traders and companies engaged in the traffic , who were alarmed in view of the magnitude of the operations contemplated by La Salle , and of the monopoly which had been granted to him by the king . Here again we see the dark side of human nature . These men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians against La Salle , even to burnings and massacres . They said to the savages : " La Salle wishes to take possession of your whole country . He is building a fort at Niagara , and another at Erie . He is building a large vessel , that he may explore all your distant lakes and large rivers . He will erect his strong forts upon every commanding spot . These forts he will garrison with armed men , well provided with muskets , and big guns whose roar is like that of thunder . Then he will take your lands and bring in white men by thousands , and you will all be killed or driven away . " Your only safety is in destroying the forts at Niagara and Erie , and in burning the vessel he is building , before it is launched . We will not trespass on your lands . We will build no forts . We will bring to your villages , in our canoes , all the goods you want and will buy all your furs . Thus you will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them visited the encampment , and with a suspicious eye watched all the movements . There were two parties formed , the friendly and the unfriendly . La Salle was embarrassed . He might be attacked . His little handful of men would need a strong fortress for their protection . But to strengthen his works would confirm the fears of his foes and add to their number . An Indian woman revealed to him a plot to set fire to his brigantine on the stocks . He kept a careful watch , ordered all his men to be secretly ready for a surprise , and pushed forward the building of the vessel with all vigor . Early in April the vessel was launched . The sublime Te Deum resounded through the solitudes of the forest as thanksgivings were offered to God for the success of the enterprise thus far . Prayers were breathed forth that God would guide and bless the vessel and its crew . The vessel was moored at a safe distance from the shore . All the men swung their hammocks on board their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the savages . CHAPTER V. The Voyage Along the Lakes . The Embarcation . Equipment of the Griffin . Voyage through the Lakes and Straits . The Storm . Superstition of the Voyagers . Arrival at Mackinac . Scenery there . Friendship of the Indians . Sail on Lakes Huron and Michigan . Arrival at Green Bay . The well-freighted Griffin sent back . On the 7th of August , 1679 , the Griffin spread her sails for her adventurous voyage into the vast unknown . Her armament consisted of five small cannon , two of which were of brass , and three clumsy guns called arquebuses . The vessel was of but sixty tons burden . Most of the men had muskets for taking game . The current in the river , where the vessel was moored , was very rapid . But by aid of a fair wind , and twelve men pulling by a rope on the shore , all difficulties were overcome , and the Griffin entered triumphantly the broad expanse of Lake Erie . As the anchor was raised and the canvas spread , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three arquebuses , and all the muskets . Such an uproar was never before heard in those silent wilds . An immense number of Indians crowded the shore . They gazed with astonishment , awe , and indefinable dread upon the novel spectacle . The whole company of Frenchmen embarked , being thirty-four in number . None were left at Erie . But at Niagara , as the magazine at Queenstown was called , Father Melethon remained , with one or two laborers , to receive such supplies as might be forwarded to that place . Three missionaries accompanied the expedition , Fathers Hennepin , Zenobe , and Ribourde . They were venerable and good men , ready at any moment to lay down their lives in advocacy of the Christian faith . Lake Erie is about two hundred and sixty miles long , and from ten to sixty broad . They ran along the northern shore of this majestic inland sea , and on the third day reached its western bounds , where they cautiously entered the mouth of the strait through which flows the waters of all the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mile broad . As canoes alone had thus far passed over its surface , it was necessary for them to feel their way with much care . La Salle gave the strait the name of Detroit . Soon entering another lake , twenty-four miles long by thirty broad , he gave it the name of St. Clair , in honor of the saint whose name appears in the calendar of the church for that day . Passing safely over the shallow waters , the Griffin entered another strait , about thirty miles long , to which La Salle gave the name of St. Clair River . The current was strong , and the navigation perilous . Gigantic steamers now run through from Lake Erie to Lake Huron in a few hours . It required thirteen days for the Griffin to accomplish the passage . The whole distance is about ninety miles . Lake Huron opened magnificently before them . The route along the shore of the lake to its head , where it receives the waters of Michigan and Superior , is about three hundred and sixty miles . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the voyagers was slow . They were impeded by calms and head winds . It was often necessary to cast the lead and to watch for rocks and sand-bars . They had but just entered upon Lake Huron when they encountered one of the severest tempests which ever swept that stormy lake . The whole ship 's company were devout Catholics . In those dark days both the fathers and the crew were alike disposed to call upon the Virgin Mary and the saints to aid them , rather than upon God . Father Hennepin tells us that the stout soul of La Salle quailed before the horrible tumult which threatened to engulf him . They all alike fell upon their knees and addressed their prayers and their cries to St. Anthony of Padua . They solemnly vowed that if he would intercede with God and obtain their rescue , they would , in the newly-discovered countries , erect a chapel in his name . St. Anthony was called the patron of mariners , and therefore his aid was especially invoked . Greatly was their confidence in the saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds dispersed , the sun shone forth in all its autumnal glory , and with a fair wind pressing their sails they glided along over a smooth sea , skirting the southern shore of the lake , past mountains and valleys , prairies and forest , which presented every variety of picturesque beauty . At the extreme northwestern extremity of Lake Huron , near the point where the lake receives the waters of Lakes Michigan and Superior , there was a large island , whose swelling hills were crowned with a dense forest . This island was called by the Indians , from its peculiar form , Mackinac , or the Turtle , sometimes Michilimackinac , or the big Turtle . On the 27th of August , 1679 , the Griffin ran into a beautiful little bay in this island . It was a lovely summer 's day , serene , sunny , and cloudless . The waters of the bay , fringed with forest-crowned hills , were as placid as a mirror . There was quite a village there of wigwams . Naked children were sporting upon the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women , were gliding swiftly in all directions . The scene opened before the eyes of the voyagers like a vision of enchantment . Nearly ten years before , Father Marquette , inspired by apostolic zeal , had traversed this whole distance in a birch canoe . Several Indians accompanied him as boatmen and interpreters . Upon the main land , across a narrow strait , he had established a mission-post among the Hurons . The Indians at Mackinac thus knew something of the white men . With wonder they gazed upon the " great wooden canoe . " They crowded on board the Griffin with every testimonial of confidence and friendship , and when one of the cannon was fired , and its roar reverberated through the forest , they were astonished , but not frightened . Though this remote village seemed so peaceful and happy , the strong palisades which surrounded it proved that the voyagers had not yet got beyond the vestiges of Adam 's fall . Those defences spoke of midnight assaults , of savage yells , of tomahawks , scalps , blood , misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of outward appearance upon the minds of men , dressed himself in a very rich scarlet cloak fringed with gold lace . With a plumed military cap upon his head , a long sword at his side , and an imposing escort of well-dressed and well-armed men , he was rowed ashore , to make a visit of ceremony to the chief . His reception was as hospitable and friendly as those untutored men were capable of giving . La Salle had sent forward several canoes of men , to collect all the furs they could on their way , and store them at Mackinac . These furs , upon his arrival , La Salle would transfer to the Griffin and send them back to Fort Frontenac , to be thence transported to Europe . But these men had bitterly disappointed him . Some of them had run away and joined the Indians , attracted by the apparently careless , easy life which the wigwam presented . Others had been bribed , by higher wages , to join rival trading parties . One of the canoes of deserters had pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite renowned in the early explorations of these remote regions , were situated on the strait which connects Lake Superior with Huron . After a short tarry at Mackinac , the sails of the Griffin were again spread , and passing through the strait between Mackinac and the main land , they entered the head of Lake Michigan . They coasted along its northern border in beautiful summer weather , and within pleasant view of the shore , until they came to an island where there was a pleasant , sheltered cove , at the mouth of Green Bay , a sheet of water which , through a broad entrance studded with islands , spread out on the west of Michigan , a hundred miles in length , by about twenty in breadth . A tribe of Indians , called Pottawatomies , inhabited this island . Here it was La Salle 's good fortune to find one of his large canoes , well freighted with furs . He had also laid in a large store at Mackinac . As he was soon to leave the Griffin , to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant and unknown rivers , he decided to send back the Griffin to Erie , with her rich freight of furs . At Erie they would be carried on men 's shoulders around the falls to Niagara , thence reshipped to Frontenac , and thence sent to Europe . He remained at the island a fortnight , freighting his ship . She commenced her return voyage with a pilot and five mariners . The value of the cargo was such as to make La Salle a rich man . Notwithstanding all his discouragements , his voyage had thus far been a success . Cheered with hope , he now prepared to resume his adventurous explorations in birch canoes . La Salle , having despatched the richly freighted Griffin from the mouth of Green Bay to his abandoned ship-yard at Erie , resumed his voyage in four heavily laden birch canoes . The company remaining with him consisted of seventeen men . His freight consisted of a blacksmith 's forge , mechanic tools , household utensils , merchandise , arms , and ammunition . A very skilful and intelligent Indian accompanied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western shore of Lake Michigan , landing every night to build their camp , kindle their fire , and cook their supper . Immediately upon landing , the Indian , with his musket on his shoulder , disappeared in the forest , and almost invariably soon returned with an ample supply of game . It was the 19th of September , 1679 , when the canoes left the mouth of Green Bay . The stormy days of autumn were approaching , when these northern lakes were often ploughed by fierce gales . The island from which they set out was several leagues from the main land . They had no sails . Their boats were propelled only by the paddle . The first night , before they reached the main land , dense clouds seemed hurrying through the skies and thickening over their heads . The wind increased into a gale . The blackened waters of the lake were lashed into foam-crested billows . The sun went down , and gloomy darkness curtained the sky and enveloped the sea . The spray dashed over them . Occasionally a wave would break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of the shore . It was a long sandy beach , with no cove , no indentation , into which they could run their boats . The surges , driven by the northeast storm , struck the shore so furiously that it seemed impossible to effect a landing ; and yet every moment they were threatened with destruction . In the darkness they kept as near together as they could , to help one another in case of disaster . Thus hour after hour passed ; as our voyagers , weary , hungry , cold , and drenched , struggled against the waves . A little after midnight the wind lulled . Watching their opportunity they ran their canoes upon the shore , and leaping into the water , carefully dragged them above the waves . The rain still fell . They unloaded each canoe , and so packed the precious contents that they could protect them from the rain by covering them with the canoes turned upside down . With their axes they soon constructed a frail camp . With the flash of powder they with difficulty kindled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every log was soaked . They threw themselves down to sleep upon the wet ground , and in their drenched garments , but with , their feet toward roaring fires . Accustomed as they were to exposure , these hardships must have caused severe suffering . The lurid morning revealed to them but a raging sea and a bleak and barren expanse , where no game could be found . Here , in their cheerless camp , they were detained by the wind and the rain four days . The only game their Indian hunter brought in , was a single porcupine . They found its flesh savory , though it afforded scarcely a mouthful for each man . The storm at length ceased . Again they launched their fragile canoes , and paddled along the placid waters . Soon another storm arose suddenly , and so severe , that they were glad to take shelter upon the lee side of a rocky island . There was no growth of timber with which they could build a camp , and scarcely sufficient fuel for a fire . Here , like shipwrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blankets , and huddled for shelter in the cavities of the rocks . Mercilessly they were pelted with rain mingled with snow . But again the clouds were dispelled ; the sun shone brightly . The mirrored waves of the lake invited them to its surface . Though sobered by their sufferings , they paddled rapidly along , hoping that a long calm was to succeed the storm . Their voyage was cheered by one bright and sunny day , when the angry clouds again began to gather to do them battle . The tempest rose so suddenly that they had no time to seek a harbor , but had to run their canoes through the surf on the shore . All had to leap into the waves to save the frail boats from being broken on the stony beach . This , their third landing , was near the point where the River Milwaukie enters the lake . They had not taken a large supply of provisions with them in their canoes , for they had hoped to find a supply of game by the way . Nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three Indians were seen in the distance ; but they did not venture to approach so formidable a looking band . Three men were sent , with the calumet of peace , to search for their villages and obtain food . They came to a cluster of deserted wigwams , where the sagacity of their Indian guide showed them an abundance of corn , concealed from the ravages of wild beasts , in cells under ground . These honest or politic men took all they wanted , and left behind them ample payment . In the evening twilight , as the boatmen were gathered around their camp fire , quite a group of Indians was seen cautiously approaching . La Salle advanced to meet them , with the calumet uplifted in his hands . As soon as the Indians saw this emblem of peace , all their fears were dispelled . They rushed forward like a joyous band of children , singing and dancing . They had been to their wigwams , found the treasures which had been left there , and their joy was inexpressible . They returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning the grateful creatures returned , bearing an abundant supply of game and corn . La Salle richly rewarded them . Nature seemed in sympathy with these blessings of peace , for the sun , emerging from the clouds , shone down serenely upon these children of a common Father , and the weary voyagers , greatly cheered , again launched their canoes upon the solitary lake . Thus they continued , day after day , paddling along the apparently interminable journey to the South . They passed the spot where the majestic city of Chicago now stands . It was two hundred years ago . Not even an Indian wigwam was seen to break the expanded and dreary solitude . A constant succession of storms was encountered until they reached the foot of the lake . Any one who has witnessed the grandeur with which the ocean-like billows of Lake Michigan often break upon the western shore , will wonder how it was possible for those frail canoes to ride over such surges . Every night it was necessary to land , and often the storm detained them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned to the eastward . Here they found a milder clime and more tranquil waters . Deer and wild turkeys were very abundant , and their Indian hunter kept them supplied with game . The trees were festooned with grape-vines , which were laden with the richest clusters of the delicious fruit . They found a spot at the foot of the lake so attractive in its landscape beauty , so abounding in fruit and game , that , weary as they were with their arduous voyage , they drew their canoes on shore for a few days of rest . The labor of one or two hours constructed a comfortable cabin for the accommodation of all . Fuel was abundant for the cheering camp fire . The lake furnished the choicest fish , and the forest supplied them with venison and every variety of game . Having feasted upon the most delicious of hunters ' fare , they wrapped themselves in their blankets , and enjoyed that rich sleep which is one of the greatest blessings of the worn and the weary . Moccasined footprints had been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Indians near . One of the men out hunting at a little distance from the camp , came upon a large black bear , which had climbed a high tree , and was feeding upon the luscious grapes . Taking deliberate aim he sent a bullet through the head of the bear , and the huge animal tumbled lifeless to the ground . It so happened that there was a large party of Indian hunters not far off , who heard the report of the gun . It was to them a very unusual sound ; for they were armed only with bows and arrows . Carefully concealing themselves , they followed the man as he dragged the carcass to the camp . It was evening . A brilliant fire illuminated the whole scene . They examined the encampment , counted the number of men , and saw at some distance on the beach , piles of precious goods , screened from rain by the canoes which were turned bottom upward over them . In the darkness of the night , two or three of them crept noiselessly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wakeful eye chanced to catch a glimpse of the shadowy form of an Indian stealing through the forest , and gave the alarm . All sprang to arms . La Salle had , as we have said , an Indian guide and hunter with him , from Green Bay . The Indian band proved to be from that vicinity . They soon entered into a conference with La Salle 's guide . The savages assumed great frankness and friendliness . One of the chiefs said : " We heard the gun and feared that a party of our enemies was approaching . We crept near your camp to ascertain whether you were friends or foes . But now that we know that we are among Frenchmen , we are with our brothers . We love Frenchmen , and wish to smoke with them the pipe of peace . " La Salle was cautious . He replied , " Let four of your men , and four only , come in the morning to our camp . " In the meantime he kept a careful watch . Four venerable men came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mutual pledges were exchanged , and they departed . It was not until after they had left , that the discovery was made that several valuable articles had been stolen . This entirely changed the aspect of affairs . La Salle , as energetic as he was conciliatory , resolved to have satisfaction . Fearing that if the affront were unavenged he would be exposed to new insults , he took several well-armed men , penetrated the woods and captured two Indians . Having led them as prisoners to his camp , he liberated one , and sent him to the chiefs of the band to say , that if the stolen goods were not immediately restored , the other captive would be put to death . The Indians , who seemed to have set a high value upon life , were appalled . They could not restore the goods . Many of them had been destroyed . The chiefs returned this reply . As the Indians greatly outnumbered the Frenchmen , they resolved to attempt to rescue the captive by force . In strong military array they advanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mound , surrounded by a sandy plain , where there was neither tree , rock , nor shrub , to protect the assailants . The bullet could be thrown much farther than the arrow . The hostile forces stood gazing at each other for some time . The chiefs saw that an attack was hopeless , and that advance was certain death . La Salle had no wish to redden his hands with their blood . In this emergence Father Hennepin in the peaceful garb of a priest went forward with the Indian interpreter and solicited a conference . Two old men advanced to meet him . With unexpected intelligence they proposed that the goods which could be restored , should be sent back , and that the rest should be amply paid for . This brought peace . Rich presents were interchanged , the Indians giving several beaver-skin robes . There were feasting and dancing and speech-making . All hearts were happy . Again the canoes were put afloat . Coasting up the eastern shore of the lake fifty or sixty miles they reached the mouth of St. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the second river in importance in the State of Michigan . It has a good harbor at its mouth , flows through an expanse of two hundred and fifty miles , and affords boat navigation for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles . Here the weary travellers found a port , after a voyage of forty days from Green Bay . Gloomy clouds of trouble now darkened around . His men , weary of their hardships , became mutinous . They remonstrated against continuing their journey into the depths of the unexplored wilderness , peopled by they knew not what hostile tribes . La Salle had ordered Lieutenant Tonti , with twenty men , to cross the head of the lake and meet him at that point by a much shorter route . The lieutenant had not arrived . It was feared that he was lost . At length he came . But he brought no tidings of the Griffin . Two months had elapsed since that vessel sailed from Green Bay . Her orders were , after discharging her freight at Niagara , to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furs . La Salle had embarked more than all his fortune in that vessel . There was no insurance in those days . He was deeply in debt to the traders in Quebec and Montreal . Fearful were his apprehensions that the vessel was lost . If so he was ruined , a hopeless bankrupt . The vessel was lost . No tidings of her ever reached any human ears . In some dreadful tragedy , witnessed only by God , the vessel and its crew sunk in the depths of the waters . While thus harassed with anxiety , the cold blasts of approaching winter swept the bleak plains . The rivers would soon be closed with ice . His provisions were exhausted , so that his party was entirely dependent for food upon such game as could be taken . Under these adverse circumstances the resolution of this indomitable man remained unshaken . Gathering his murmuring companions around him , he said : " I have set out to explore the Mississippi . If you abandon me I can not proceed . But I shall remain here with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , or disperse through the forest as you please . " The men continued to murmur . But for their own protection they worked diligently upon the fort . From this point La Salle intended to establish communication with his depot at Niagara . The boatmen also , who were earnestly devoted to the ritualism of the church , under the direction of the missionaries built a log chapel , where religious services were daily held . A numerous tribe of Indians , the Miamis , but to which the missionaries gave the name of St. Joseph 's band , had a flourishing village here . There were very friendly . From the fine boat harbor they could fish upon the lake , or , in pursuit of game , could paddle hundreds of miles up the forest-crowned river and its numerous tributaries . Day after day La Salle watched the horizon of the lake , hoping to catch a glimpse of the sails of the returning Griffin , bringing him supplies , and the tidings that his precious furs were safe and his fortune secure . Night after night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick . Thirty-three days of anxiety and toil thus passed away . The boatmen , who had come with Lieutenant Tonti , increased his number to over thirty men . At the point of land where the river entered the lake , there was a bluff , of considerable elevation and of triangular form , containing an acre or more of pretty level land . It was at that time covered with trees . This commanding position was chosen for the fort . Two sides were bounded by water . On the third or land side of the triangle there was a deep ravine . A breastwork of hewn logs was raised several feet high , enclosing a space eighty feet long by forty feet broad . And this all was surrounded by stout palisades . The fortress was artistically constructed , and could bid defiance to any attack by the Indians . It was also admirably selected to give the French command of the region , against any encroachments of the English . Through the whole month of November the men toiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkeys , deer , and bears , which their Indian hunter brought in . It was learned that the Griffin , which , it will be remembered , sailed from Green Bay , bound first to Mackinac , did not reach that port . The vessel must have foundered somewhere by the way . The natives on the coast had heard nothing of the vessel . Seventy days had now elapsed since she sailed , and all hopes of ever hearing from her again were relinquished . On the 3d of December the whole party of thirty-three persons , in eight canoes , left Fort Miami , as La Salle called his works , and paddled up the river , a distance of seventy miles , toward the south . Considerable time was lost in the endeavor to find the trail or portage which led across , westerly from the St. Joseph 's River , to the head waters of the Kankakee , which is the eastern branch of the Illinois River . La Salle , imprudently exploring alone , became lost in the forest . The darkness of a stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired his gun as a signal of distress ; but silence was the only answer . Soon he espied , in the distance , the light of a fire . It was the encampment of a solitary Indian , who had formed for himself a soft bed of leaves . Alarmed by the report of the gun , he had fled . La Salle appropriated to himself the cheerless quarters and slept soundly until morning . All the forenoon of the next day he wandered , and it was not until the afternoon that he rejoined his companions . He came in with two opossums hanging at his belt , which he had killed . At length their Indian hunter found the trail . They had gone too far up the river . The men took the canoes and the freight upon their shoulders , and carried them over the portage , of five or six miles , which the Indians had traversed for countless ages . Dreary in the extreme was the wintry landscape which now opened before them . The ground was frozen hard . Ice fringed the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For nearly a hundred miles the sluggish Kankakee flowed through a morass , which afforded growth to but little more than rushes and alders . Their provisions were nearly exhausted . No game could be found . They were hungry . Each night they landed , built their fires , and with scarcely any shelter wrapped themselves in their blankets for almost comfortless sleep . At length the river emerged from these dreary marshes and entered upon a large undulating prairie , treeless , but whose fertility was attested by the tall , yet withered grass . The scene became far more cheering . Though most of the herds , which in summer grazed these rich fields , had wandered far away to the south , their indefatigable hunter succeeded in shooting two deer and a stray buffalo , which was found mired . He also took several fat turkeys and swans . Thus , with revived spirits , the party , having paddled three hundred miles down the infinite windings of the Kankakee , entered the more majestic and beautiful river Illinois . The length of the stream from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and sixty miles , exclusive of its windings . As they were swept down by the current , they came to a large Indian village on the right bank of the river , near the present town of Ottawa . There were four or five hundred cabins , very substantially built , and covered with thick mats very ingeniously woven from rushes . Extensive corn-fields were near the village , but the harvest had been gathered in . Silence and solitude reigned there . Not a living being was to be seen . The inhabitants had all migrated , according to their custom , to spend the winter in more southern hunting-grounds . Large quantities of corn were stored away for summer use in dry cellars . La Salle removed fifty bushels to his canoes , hoping to find the owners farther south and amply repay them . It would have been of no avail to have left payment , for it would be carried away by any band of Indians who chanced to be passing by . The hunger of his men , in his judgment rendered the taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the site of Rock Fort , in La Salle county , Illinois . For four days they continued their course without coming in sight of any human being or any habitation . Yet they passed through scenery often very charming , presenting a wide-spread ocean of undulating land , with groves and lawns and parks smiling so peacefully in the bright sunshine . The morning of the 1st of January , 1680 , came . All gathered around the missionaries to commemorate the opening of the new year by religious services . Prayers were offered , hymns were chanted , sins were confessed , and the blessing of God was invoked upon their enterprise . At the conclusion of these devotions the canoes were again pushed out into the stream . On the fourth of the month they entered an expansion of the river where the breadth of water assumed the dimension of a lake . This sheet of water , now called Peoria Lake , was twenty miles long and three broad . At its foot they came upon a very large Indian encampment . La Salle presented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this point he decided to build a large boat to sail down the river . The loss of the Griffin , thus depriving him of his supplies , had frustrated all his plans . He built a strong fort , which he called , from his own grief , " Crevecoeur , " or the Broken Hearted . Here this extraordinary man left most of his company , and with five men , in mid-winter , set out to cross the pathless wilderness on foot , a distance of twelve hundred miles , along the southern shores of Erie and Ontario to Fort Frontenac . The wonderful journey , through storms of snow and rain , across bleak plains and morasses and unbridged rivers , was safely accomplished in about seventy days . He obtained the needful supplies , freighted several canoes , engaged new voyagers , and after innumerable perils again reached the head waters of the Illinois . Here he learned that his garrison at Crevecoeur was dispersed and the fort destroyed . This ended his hopes . He went back to Frontenac a disappointed but indomitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we must leave La Salle for a time , while we give an account of the expedition from Crevecoeur , up the Mississippi , and of the destruction of the colony . CHAPTER VI . The Expedition of Father Hennepin . Seeking a Northwest Passage . The Voyage Commenced . The Alarm . Delightful Scenery . The Indian Village . Entrance to the Mississippi . Appearance of the Country . The Midnight Storm . Silence and Solitude . A Fleet of Canoes . Captured by the Savages . Merciful Captivity . Alarming Debate . Condition of the Captives . Two days before La Salle set out from Crevecoeur , on his adventurous journey , through the wilderness , to Fort Frontenac , he despatched Father Louis Hennepin to explore the Mississippi River from the mouth of the Illinois to its source . So little was then known of this continent that La Salle had strong hopes that near the source of the Mississippi , another stream might be found , flowing toward the west , which , by a short voyage , would conduct one to the Pacific Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage to the Pacific might be discovered . On the morning of the 29th of February , 1680 , Father Hennepin , with but two companions , entered his birch canoe , to prosecute his grand and perilous enterprise . They were to explore unknown realms , crowded with savage tribes . They had their guns , not for attack or defence , but for taking game , with a good supply of ammunition , and with several hundred dollars worth of goods , to conciliate the savages by presents , and to exchange with them for provisions . With the early dawn they commenced their voyage . The day was fine , the river placid in its gentle flow , and the scenery , on both sides of the stream , of undulating hills , majestic forests , and wide-spread prairies , upon which herds of wild cattle were grazing , was picturesque and alluring in the extreme . As they rapidly descended the river , they met several parties of Illinois Indians , returning to their village at the head of the lake . Their canoes were laden with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians exchanged friendly greetings . The kind-hearted savages endeavored to dissuade them from their perilous voyage , assuring them , with all the wildest exaggerations of Indian superstition , that they would encounter birds as large as buffaloes , who would carry them in their talons as an eagle seizes a rabbit ; that there were enormous beasts in the river , doubtless referring to the alligators , who would dash their canoe to pieces , and devour a man at a mouthful ; then there were rapids and whirlpools from which they could not escape , and in which they would be surely engulfed ; and that if by any possibility they escaped , all these perils , they would fall into the hands of ferocious tribes , who would enslave them , torture them , cook them , and eat them . They entreated the Frenchmen to go back with them to their village , where they could live representations , and were strongly inclined to return . But Father Hennepin constrained them to press onward . As they descended the Illinois , they found the river deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , at times , expand to nearly a mile in breadth . Large trees crowned many of the gentle eminences which lined the stream . Upon ascending the hills , as they landed for their night 's encampment , they gazed , with delight in the gorgeous sunset , upon the magnificent prairies spread out before them as far as the eye could reach . There is nothing which earth has ever presented more beautiful than those Eden-like landscape resembling the ocean in expanse , which were thus for the first time , unveiled to the view of civilized men . Here and there groups of trees appeared , in small groves , as if planted by the exquisite taste of a landscape gardener . Herds of buffaloes , antelopes , and deer , grazed the herbage in countless numbers . Birds of every variety of song and plumage found here their paradise . And in these fair realms the children of Adam might have experienced joys hardly surpassed by those of their first parents in Eden , were it not for that inhumanity of man to man which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the curse of sin , Jesus the Son of God has suffered and died . And there can be no possible true happiness for the human family until the result of his mission shall be accomplished . Our voyagers , on the seventh day of their journey , having passed down the windings of the river , about two hundred miles , as they judged , came to a pleasant Indian village of about two hundred wigwams . These Indians had an eye for beauty . Their little cluster of homes was picturesquely situated upon a green plain , gently ascending from the banks of the river , which commanded a view of the water for some distance above and below . The prairie , in its grandeur , spread far and wide around . The village was about six miles above the entrance of the Illinois into the Mississippi River . The tribe was called the Maraos . The hospitable savages , who without any difficulty could have killed the Frenchmen and have taken possession of all their goods , treated the strangers as brothers , and urged them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see beautiful vestiges of the character of man before the fall . But alas ! we can never meet the children of Adam anywhere , or under any circumstances , without soon seeing the evidence of that fall when sin entered Eden , " Earth felt the wound ; and nature from her seat , Sighing through all her works , gave signs of woe That all was lost . " They heard fearful accounts of attacks by ferocious tribes rushing down upon them , plundering , burning , killing , scalping , with mercilessness which demons could not exceed . They were expecting soon another attack , and were then upon the point of abandoning their homes and emigrating to the other side of the Mississippi , to join , for their protection , another large and friendly tribe . Soon after Father Hennepin resumed his voyage , the Indians , according to his narrative , had their suspicions excited that he was conveying hatchets and guns to their enemies , either intentionally , or which might fall into their hands . They therefore sent a band of their swift-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intercept the canoe . This could hardly be considered contrary to the laws of warfare among civilized nations . The Indians had witnessed the lightnings and thunders of the white man 's guns , and the terrible energies of their death dealing-bolts . They might surely consider the canoe as freighted with goods which were contraband of war . We know not what reason Father Hennepin had for suspecting this movement of the Indians . He gives no proof of any such hostile design . It is not improbable that his suspicions were groundless . As he approached the narrow pass where he imagined the warriors to lie in ambush , he saw the smoke of the camp fires ascending from a grove which crowned one of the eminences . This certainly did not indicate any secret movement . He paddled close to the other side of the river , not only without being attacked , but without obtaining even a glimpse of his imagined foes . On the 8th of March they reached the Mississippi River . The broad flood , a mile in width , swept majestically along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with floating ice . The vast masses , two or three feet in thickness , and which could not be eluded , would speedily tear their frail birch canoe into fragments . At the mouth of the Illinois there was a gentle elevation , covered with the stately forest , which commanded a fine view of both of the rivers and of the adjacent region . Here the Frenchmen drew their canoe upon the shore , erected a camp , with open front , as a shelter from the cold north wind , built their fire , cooked their game , of which they found abundance all around , and waited patiently , four days , for the ice to run by . In the middle of the Mississippi River , nearly opposite the mouth of the Illinois , there were three small islands , covered with large trees and a dense , tangled growth of brush and vines . The heads of these islands were clogged , for a long distance up the river , with the deformity of immense rafts of drift logs , stumps , and trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing winds , with truly arctic masses of ice grinding by , and often ploughed up into great hillocks upon the sand-bars . At a short distance back from the river a range of hills or bluffs was seen . Between the bluffs and the river the meadow or bottom lands were often treeless , and evidently fertile in the highest degree . On the morning of the 12th of March the Mississippi was sufficiently clear of ice for these intrepid voyagers to venture to launch their canoe upon its surface . Slowly and cautiously they paddled up the stream , keeping near the shore and taking advantage of every eddy which could be found . Through vistas opening between the hills and woods occasional glimpses were caught of prairie regions beyond , whose solitude and silence were only relieved by the spectacle of grazing herds , and thousands of birds upon the wing . There were no signs of human life . Apparently eternal silence reigned over those Eden-like solitudes , disturbed only by the lowing of the herds and the varied notes of bird songs . As they continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of forest trees was so interlaced with vines and undergrowth as to render them almost impenetrable . Vigorously they plied their paddles , day after day , breasting the strong current of the river , encountering no incident of importance . Every night they landed , drew their canoe upon the grass , turned it over , so as to cover its contents from the rain and the dew , built their frail shelter for the night , kindled their camp fire , whose flame is ever as companionable as it is cheerful , cooked their supper , which they ate with the appetite and zest which labor gives , and then , having offered their vesper prayers and chanted their evening hymn , enjoyed that sweet sleep which is one of the greatest of all earthly blessings . At noon they always had a short religious exercise in their canoe . They often had mild and beautiful mornings , when the whole wide-spread scene of crystal waters , forest , and prairie seemed illumined with almost celestial radiance . Bird songs filled the air . The prairies seemed crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sights of violence or suffering met the eye . No discordant sound fell upon the ear . All was beauty , harmony , and joy . The landscape resembled our imaginings of the world before the fall , when it came fresh from its Maker 's hands , and all the morning stars hailed its birth . But again clouds , like marshalling armies , hurried through and darkened the sky . The tempest rose with its dirge-like wailing . The surface of the river was lashed into surges which threatened to devour them . The rain drenched them . The sleet cut their faces . Hastily they sought the shores . Frequently they had to paddle a great distance along the precipitous banks before they could find any place where they could land . Reaching at length the shore , they first covered their goods with the upturned canoe . Black night would already envelop them . Groping through the darkness , drenched with rain , and numbed with sleet , they would , with great difficulty , raise some frail protection against the storm . No fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throwing themselves upon the wet sod , hungry , shivering , and sleepless , they would anxiously await the dawn . The cry of the lone night-bird , and the howling of wolves , would be added to the discord of the angry elements . In such hours this globe did indeed seem to be a sin-blighted world , upon which had fallen the frown of its Maker . Amid such changes and toils as these , Father Hennepin and his companions , in their frail birch canoe , paddled along against the strong current of the Mississippi . They breakfasted with the earliest dawn , and continued their voyage through ever-varying scenes of sublimity and beauty , until late in the afternoon . Then they began to look eagerly for some sheltered nook suitable for their night 's encampment . The silence and solitude through which they passed , at times seemed pleasing , and again almost awful . For weary leagues , not a village , not a wigwam , not a solitary Indian , appeared . They seemed to be exploring an uninhabited world . The mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . With feelings akin to awe , they looked up the long reaches of streams , now known by the names of the Des Moines , the Iowa , the Rock River , and the Wisconsin . They wondered what scenes were transpiring far away upon the banks of these apparently solitary waters . They had ascended the Mississippi several hundred miles , when , about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of April , they were startled by seeing suddenly coming round a near headland , thirty large bark canoes , crowded with Indians , plumed , painted , and armed for battle . It was a gorgeous as well as an appalling spectacle . The blades of their paddles sparkled in the sunlight . The savages were dressed in the highest style of barbaric splendor . Their brilliantly colored feathers , fringed garments , and highly decorated bows , war-clubs and javelins , surpassed , in picturesque beauty , any of the ordinary military trapping of civilized life . The moment the savages caught sight of the Frenchmen 's boat , they simultaneously raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and struck the hearts of the voyagers with dread . Escape was impossible . Resistance was not to be thought of . The little fleet of canoes , descending the river by the aid both of the current and their paddles , approached with great rapidity . Father Hennepin stood up in his boat and in his hands extended toward the savages , the calumet of peace . Speedily he was surrounded , the calumet was snatched from him , and his canoe was taken to the shore , while all the others followed . During all the time the savages were raising frightful cries and yells , the signification of which , whether welcoming or threatening , could not be understood . It was probably near the mouth of the Wisconsin River that this capture took place . Father Hennepin had been so long among the Indians , visiting various tribes , and had so long been accustomed to contemplate his violent death as an event which might any day take place , that he was far more tranquil in mind than most persons could have been under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the savages . He presented him some tobacco , and then endeavored by signs to enter into conversation with him . The two head chiefs conferred together . They declined smoking the peace calumet , and were by no means cordial in their reception of the strangers . There was evidently a diversity of opinion among them , as to the disposition they should make of their captives . Three blows of the tomahawk would silence them all in death . Their bodies could be thrown into the stream , and their canoe , with all its freight , of such priceless value to the savages , would be in their possession . Probably some of them had visited the French forts , and knew how to use the musket , and appreciated its death-dealing power . Already they had examined every article in the canoe . They had inspected the rifles , and counted the store of bullets and powder . Such an acquisition would aid them inestimably in the war-path upon which they had entered . The young men clamored for this decision of the question . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the light of revealed religion , the dividing line between right and wrong must necessarily be faint . With these men , the pride of life consisted in the numbers of enemies they had slain . Inspired by this desire , they were now on the way to attack a neighboring tribe , to burn their homes , destroy their property , kill and scalp men , women , and children , and to take back some of the leading warriors , that they , their wives , and their children might enjoy the delight of seeing them put to death by diabolical torture . Why should they hesitate to tomahawk three white men who had crossed their path ? Why not rob and murder them , when by doing so they could acquire possessions of the greatest value ? But God seems to have implanted in every human heart some sense of right and wrong , some conviction of responsibility to a Superior Being . So far as Father Hennepin could understand their sign language , the chiefs informed him that they were going down the Mississippi to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The war party consisted of but one hundred and twenty braves . They intended to attack the village by surprise at night . In an hour they would accomplish their fiend-like deed of murder , scalping , and conflagration . Then , with their gory trophies and their prisoners , they would take to their boats and be far away up the river before there could be any rallying of the tribes in pursuit . Father Hennepin told them that the Miamis had been informed of their intended attack ; that they had abandoned their village , had fled across the Mississippi , and having joined another powerful tribe were watching for their approach . The savages on the shore surrounded their captives , and for some unknown reason frequently gave simultaneous utterance to the most unearthly yells . Father Hennepin affected great composure , assuming that he was among friends . He presented to the chiefs two large fat turkeys which he had shot coming up the river . Then , with his two companions , he built a fire , hung his iron kettle , and commenced boiling some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , and then all gathered in a group to hold a council . Father Hennepin secretly watched their proceedings with the utmost anxiety . Their speeches were accompanied with very much action . The debate was prolonged and vehement . He sufficiently understood the language of signs to perceive that they were divided in opinion , that while a part were in favor of putting them to death , others were urging that their lives should be spared . With one of his men he went to the canoe , took six axes , fifteen knives , and a quantity of tobacco , and advancing into the midst of the council presented them to the chiefs . He then took an axe , and bowing his head , made signs that the Indians might kill him if they wished to do so . This chivalric deed touched whatever there was of chivalry in the savage bosom . There was a general murmur of applause . Some of them had been roasting , at a fire near by , some beaver 's flesh . One of the savages ran , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a plate of birch bark , with a sharpened stick for a fork , put three morsels into the mouth of Father Hennepin and his companions . As the food was very hot , the savage blew upon it to cool it . He then set the plate before them , to eat at their pleasure . Still there was a degree of restraint on the part of the Indians , which indicated that there was by no means perfect reconciliation . There was much talking apart , and it was evident that the fate of the prisoners was not yet decided . The representations , however , which Father Hennepin had made , induced them to relinquish their contemplated enterprise , and to turn back from the war-path upon which they had entered . Just before night , one of the chiefs silently returned to Father Hennepin his peace calumet . This greatly increased their anxiety , as it was inferred that it was an act renouncing friendship . Savages and Frenchmen all slept alike on the ground and in the open air , by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the captives had no indication that they were abridged of their freedom . Still they had many fears that they were to be assassinated before the morning . The two boatmen , Auguelle and Ako , slept with their guns and swords by their sides . They declared that if attacked they would sell their lives as dearly as possible . But Father Hennepin said to them , " I shall allow myself to be killed without any resistance . I came to announce to the savages a God , who for the world 's redemption allowed Himself to be falsely accused , unjustly condemned , and cruelly crucified , without showing the least enmity to those who put Him to death . I shall imitate the example thus set me . " The night passed peacefully away , and the morning of the 12th of April dawned upon this scene so wild and picturesque . As all were gathered around their camp fires , cooking their breakfasts , one of the chiefs , Narketoba by name  --  presenting a hideous aspect in his barbarian military trappings , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hennepin and asked for the peace calumet . Receiving it , he filled the cup with tobacco , and having taken a few whiffs himself , presented it to one after another of the whole band . Each one smoked the pipe , though some with evident reluctance . The Frenchmen understood this to indicate that , for the present at least , their lives were to be spared . They were then informed that they must accompany the Indians up the river to their own country . " I was not sorry , " Father Hennepin writes , " in this conjuncture , to continue our discovery with this people . " CHAPTER VII . Life with the Savages . Ascending the River with the Savages .

Capricious Treatment . Triumphal Entrance . The Adoption . Habits of the Savages . Father Hennepin and his two companions reembarked in their canoe , and , oppressed with varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . The thirty large canoes , filled with their captors , surrounded them . The current was rapid ; the savages were seldom in a hurry , and their progress was slow . At night they always landed and slept in the open air , unless it was stormy , when they would sometimes construct for themselves a frail shelter . The devout ecclesiastic felt in duty bound daily to say his office , as it was called , in accordance with the rules of the Catholic Church . He had his breviary , composed of matins , lauds , vespers , and compline , or last prayer at night . These exercises he scrupulously performed . The superstitious Indians , seeing him open his book , and move his lips , imagined that he was practising some sort of incantation against them . Angrily they cried out against it , exclaiming , in their own language , " witchcraft . " Michael Ako , who had no ambition to receive a martyr 's crown , entreated him , if he must say his prayers , to say them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said he , " you will so provoke the Indians , that we shall all be inevitably killed . " Auguelle , who was more religiously inclined , joined in these entreaties , begging him to retire apart , morning and evening , into the forest for his devotions . But the suspicions of the Indians were aroused . They had a great dread of diabolical influences . Whenever he entered the woods a party followed him . He could get no chance to pray out of their sight . At length he said to his companions : " I can not dispense with my prayers , whatever may be the consequences . If we are all massacred , I shall be the innocent cause of your death , as well as of my own . " To accustom the Indians to his mode of worship , he commenced chanting the litany of the Virgin . He had a well-trained , melodious voice . The Indians were pleased with the novel strains floating over the still waters . Paddle in hand they paused to listen . Adroitly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to sing , and had sent him to them for their diversion . It would seem , on the whole , that the Indians treated their captives with remarkable kindness . The canoe of the Frenchmen was heavily laden with articles for trade , and there were but three to paddle . They therefore found it very difficult to keep up with the well-manned war canoes of the savages . The chief placed one or two warriors on board the Frenchmen 's boat , to help them stem the current . It was with difficulty that the little fleet accomplished more than twenty or twenty-five miles a day . The savages were collected from various villages , and it was quite evident that they were still divided in opinion respecting the disposition to be made of their prisoners . One of the chiefs took the Frenchmen under his special protection . He caused them , at each encampment , to occupy the same cabin with him , or to sleep by his side . But there was another chief who clamored for their death . He had lost a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howlings were heard , as he wailed piteously , endeavoring to stimulate his own passions , and to rouse his comrades to kill the Frenchmen , so as to seize their arms and avenge themselves upon the Miamis . But others , who were far more considerate , said , If we kill or rob these Frenchmen , we shall soon use up the few goods they have in their canoe , and no other Frenchmen will dare to visit us to bring us more . But , if we treat them kindly , and purchase their goods fairly , others will come , bringing a great abundance . Thus we can all sell our skins and furs , and supply the whole tribe with the things we so greatly need . As they were paddling along one day , a large flock of turkeys was seen feeding near the river . Cautiously Father Hennepin paddled near them , and one of his boatmen , taking careful aim , struck down three with a single shot . The savages , who had watched the proceeding with intense interest , were amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a gun discharged before , though the knowledge of the arrival of the French , and the wonderful power of their guns , had been widely spread through the tribes . The canoes were all paddled to the shore . With the deepest interest they examined the dead turkeys , and reexamined the musket . The unseen bolt had struck them down at twice the distance their arrows would reach . An arrow could have killed but one . The bullet had killed three . " Manza ouacangege , " exclaimed one of the chiefs , in astonishment , which signified , The iron has understanding . The situation of the Frenchmen was very peculiar , as they hardly knew whether the savages regarded them as prisoners or not . Father Hennepin was still pursuing his original design of exploring the sources of the Mississippi . If the Indians were truly friendly , their companionship was an element of safety , and was to be desired . In order to test the question whether he was his own master , and could follow his own will , he suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi to its mouth . He might thus find a short passage to the Indies , though he admits that he thought it more probable that it emptied into the Gulf of Mexico , than into the Red Sea . The chiefs however , promptly signified that they could not consent to be thus deprived of the pleasure of his company . Though the Indians paddled all day long , with great vigor , against the current , not stopping even to eat until their night 's encampment , they never seemed at all fatigued . There was an ample supply of game for food . Having reared their frail shelters , if it rained , kindled their fires and cooked their suppers , they invariably had a war dance , each smoking in turn the war calumet . This was distinguished from the peace calumet by different colored feathers . Their whoops and yells were hideous . And there was something indescribably mournful in the wailings of those who had lost relatives during the war . Fortunately for the French , all their expeditions had thus far been conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been killed or wronged by them . They had proved only great benefactors to the Indians . Had a solitary Indian been killed by any Frenchmen , these captives , in revenge , would have been put to death with tortures of the most diabolical cruelty . Had any Miami warriors fallen into the hands of these savages , awful would have been their doom . Father Hennepin and his companions could not but shudder as they listened to the wailing yells of those who mourned their dead , and witnessed the fiend-like expression of their countenances and gestures . With the earliest dawn , after the night 's encampment , some one gave a whoop , which instantly brought every man to his feet . No time was lost in washing or dressing . They generally , as a measure of protection against their enemies , endeavored to encamp upon the point of an island . While some went out to hunt for game , others replenished the fires , and cooked the breakfast , while still others sought the neighboring eminences to discover whether there were any smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered their birch canoes , which they did not leave until the close of the afternoon , when they landed for another night 's encampment . Thus for nineteen days they continued ascending the river . Father Hennepin estimated that they had made between three and four hundred miles . One afternoon , as the thirty canoes were being paddled up the stream in a long line , a large bear was seen swimming across the river , a little above them . The canoes in advance promptly surrounded him , and he was speedily killed . Upon dragging him ashore he proved to be a monster in size , and very fat . It so happened that they were opposite a very beautiful prairie . The head chief , whose name was Aguipaguetin , ordered all the canoes ashore for a grand feast . The warriors decorated themselves with paint and feathers , and after partaking of what they considered a sumptuous feast , commenced the wild orgies of the war dance , with hideous yellings and contortions . They all leaped about on the greensward of the prairie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their feet , in measured tread . The wailing for the dead was blended with their discordant cries . One of the chiefs who was very loud in his demonstrations of grief for his lost son , and who had previously urged putting the Frenchmen to death , frequently in the course of the frantic dance approached the Frenchmen , and placing his hands on each one of their heads , uttered the most piercing dirge-like cries . Father Hennepin could not understand the significance of this strange ceremony , but he had many fears that it indicated violence to come . Hoping to conciliate the chief , he made him a very valuable present of knives , axes , beads , and tobacco in honor of the son whose loss he so deeply deplored . By these frequent presents , the small store of goods which the canoe could hold was rapidly disappearing . They were then on the borders of a wide expansion of the Mississippi resembling a lake . Father Hennepin gave it the name of Pepin , or the Lake of Tears , from the lugubrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , or day after , quite a large herd of buffaloes was seen swimming across the river . The enormous creatures , thus taken at disadvantage , were easily killed . Thirty or forty , pierced by arrows and javelins , were soon dragged ashore . The savages had another feast , from the tongues and other most delicate morsels of the animal . All the remainder was left to putrefy , or be devoured by wild beasts . The frail canoes were so crowded that there was no room to store away any game . Neither was there need to do so , for every day brought almost invariably a full supply . It required hunger , and an acquired appetite for such food , to make it palatable ; for it was eaten without bread or salt , or any other seasoning . Some days the Indians seemed very good natured . Again , with no known cause , they were morose and threatening . Even the chief who had protected them was as capricious in his conduct as a child . He would at times feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caress them . Again he would allow them , in a stormy night , to be driven from his cabin , to find such shelter as they could . Usually some Indians would be placed in their canoe to help them paddle . Again they would be left to struggle unaided against the rushing flood . The Frenchmen could not speak a word of the language of their captors , or understand a word spoken to them . It is probable that they often misunderstood the significance of signs . But there was no difficulty in perceiving the difference between smiles and frowns , between blessings and curses . On the nineteenth day of their navigation , the Indians reached one of their villages on the river banks . It was afterwards found that this spot was about twenty-five miles below a remarkable fall in the river , to which Father Hennepin gave , in honor of his patron saint , the name of the Falls of St. Anthony . This hamlet , far away in the north , was a cold and cheerless assemblage of savage homes . The families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slightly elevated above the brutes around them . There were several chiefs who had lost sons during the war . The captives were given one to each of three of them . Nominally , they were to be adopted in the place of the lost ones . In reality , they were slaves , to be driven farthest from the fire , to have the most scanty supply of food , in case of want , and in all things to endure the hardest fare . Having thus distributed their captives , the savages seized their property and divided it among themselves . They probably did not consider this an act of robbery , but since the Frenchmen had been graciously received as sons of the tribe , their goods should be appropriated to the public welfare . The village near the Falls of St. Anthony was but a temporary encampment . The tribe into whose hands the captives had fallen , was called Issatis . Their principal village was still farther up the river , nearly a hundred and fifty miles in a northwesterly direction . Probably in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their canoes at the Falls , and commenced the journey on foot , traversing an Indian trail which led through forest and moor , over prairie and mountain . It was indeed a wearisome and almost fatal journey to those newly adopted into such hardships of barbarian life . In those early days of spring , and in those high latitudes , it was often bitterly cold . There were remaining snow drifts , and deeper clammy mud and pools of water to be waded , skimmed over with ice , and freezing storms of rain and sleet . They encountered many rivers and swollen brooks , which they were compelled either to swim or ford . These streams , flowing down from unknown regions in the north , were often encumbered with large blocks of ice . There was but little game in those dismal forests , and on those sear and bleak prairies . The savages were pitiless , and would often give but a meagre portion to their adopted brethren . Father Hennepin often divested himself of his clothes , bound them upon his head , and swam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs would be so chilled and benumbed that he could scarcely stand . The blood would trickle down his body and limbs , from wounds inflicted by the sharp edges of the ice . The trail invariably led to spots where the crossings of the swollen streams were not very wide . Several of the Indians were men of gigantic stature . Father Hennepin was a tall man , but his companions were very short , and neither of them could swim . When they came to a ford where the water was over the heads of the short men these tall Indians would carry them across on their shoulders . When all were compelled to swim they would help the unfortunate men across on pieces of drift wood . The Indians seemed to have sinews of steel . They were alike insensible to hunger , to drenched garments , and to freezing blasts . The celerity with which they pressed on their way , astonished the Europeans . On several occasions Father Hennepin , while traversing the broad bleak prairie , was quite in despair . His trembling , tottering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to take another step , he threw himself upon the ground , declaring that there he must die . The rank and withered grass of the prairie was five or six feet high . Very deliberately one of the savages set fire to the grass . It burst forth in a consuming flame . " Now , " said he , " you may follow us or be burned to death . " On one occasion , when Father Hennepin had thrown himself upon the ground , in utter exhaustion , one of the chiefs of the party came to him , and pulling up a quantity of dried grass , made a soft bed for him to lie down upon . Then seating himself by his side , he took from his pocket two pieces of wood , very dry . One was a small block of cedar , with an indentation in the centre , about two thirds of an inch in diameter . The other was a round peg , five or six inches long , which fitted into the hole in the block . This block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the socket , spun it round with wonderful rapidity between his two palms . Soon smoke began to appear , then a few sparks were elicited , and then a gentle flame rose from the dust of the charred wood . He lighted his pipe , and after smoking for a moment , gave it Father Hennepin to smoke . He then put his hands affectionately on the Frenchman 's head , and moaned and wept . What did this all mean ? Were the sympathies of the savage excited , in view of the sufferings of the white man ? Were his tears caused to flow in anticipation of torture at the burning stake , to which he might suppose the victim to be doomed ? Or was this an act of barbarian mourning over some loved one lost in battle ? Father Hennepin could not interpret the deed . But he greatly feared that it indicated dreadful woes to come  --  sufferings , the thought of which was sufficient to agitate even a savage breast . After a weary journey of five days , this party of forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined village . It was far away in the northern wilderness , east of the Mississippi , which majestic stream had there dwindled into a rivulet . They were near the head waters of a river , since called the St. Francis . It was indeed a dreary and savage wild which they had penetrated , and from whose glooms the captives could not expect ever to emerge . In some way the inhabitants of the village had heard of the approach of the warriors , and quite a number of the women and children came out to meet them . In a sort of triumphal entrance , like that of the ancient Romans , they took Auguelle , dressed him as gorgeously as they could , in Indian costume , painted his face , daubed his hair with grease , and fastened upon his head a plume of eagle 's feathers , brilliantly colored . They placed a gourd in his hand , containing a number of round pebbles , which he was directed to shake for music , with the accompaniment of his voice , shouting a French song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were agreed in the conviction that it was good policy to do every thing in their power to conciliate their captors . The warriors were much chagrined in returning from their expedition without a single scalp , without a single captive from their enemies , without having even struck a blow . It was necessary for them therefore to make as much parade as they could of their French prisoners . Yet the most ignorant Indian of them all could not but perceive that there was not much to be boasted of in a hundred and twenty warriors having picked up three peaceful canoe men , who had made no resistance , who had never done them any harm ; who had come into their country as friends , making them rich presents , and who undeniably desired only to do them good . They could not utter the scalp halloo , nor the yell announcing that they were bringing victims for the stake . But they made the forest resound with their war-whoops , and with their shouts of triumph . During the absence of the war party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had gathered around their large quantities of dried grass , with which they intended to scorch and blister and consume the prisoners , whom they doubted not the victors would bring back . They were anticipating a grand gala day in dance and yell , as they witnessed the writhings of their victims and listened with delight to the shrieks which agony extorted . Father Hennepin and his companions were appalled as they looked at these stakes and these preparations for torture , and feared that they were to occupy the places prepared for the Miamis . They , however , concealed their fears , carefully abstained from the slightest indication of anxiety , and assumed that they were contented and beloved members of the tribe which had adopted them . It was about the 21st of April , 1680 , when these unfortunate men , who had been cradled in France , were led into the miserable hovels of this village of savages . They were all conducted into the wigwam of the principal chief . Here , much to their encouragement , the chief presented them his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , in a birch bark dish , some boiled wild rice , seasoned with dry whortleberries . Half-famished as the Frenchmen were , this was by no means unpalatable food . After this feast each one was conducted to the wigwam of the Indian by whom he had been adopted . These Indians lived in different villages several miles apart . The captives now found , much to their sorrow , that they were to be separated . Father Hennepin was adopted by the chief Aquipaguetin , and was conducted nearly three miles , often through marshes knee-deep with mud and water , till they came to a considerable stream , probably one of the upper tributaries of the St. Francis River . Here five wives of the chief , with their canoes , were obsequiously waiting the approach of their lord and master . A young son of the chief was also with them . The chief informed them all that he had adopted the white man in the place of the child he had lost ; and that his wives were to call him their son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women paddled the canoes down the dark stream fringed with gloomy evergreens and tangled underbrush , until they came to an island upon which there was a small cluster of cabins . Here was the residence of the chief . His wigwam was large , though but a single room , and was crowded with his wives and children . Father Hennepin was immediately presented with some boiled fish on a birch bark plate . But he was so very weak , from exposure , toil , and emaciation , that he could not rise from the ground without assistance . The medical practice of the chief was peculiar ; but either in consequence of it , or in spite of it , the sick man got well . A small hut , called a sweating cabin , was built , very tight . This was made more impervious to the air by covering it with buffalo skins . A large number of stones heated red hot were placed inside , which raised the temperature almost to that of an oven . The sick man crept in , followed by four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then began to wail and howl , probably to frighten off the evil spirits , who they supposed had invaded the sick man 's body . At the same time they commenced rubbing their patient violently from head to foot . The perspiration oozed from every pore , and fell from him like rain drops . The heat was intolerable . He nearly fainted , and was for the time greatly debilitated . This regimen was followed three times a week for two or three weeks , when , Father Hennepin writes : " I felt as strong as ever .

Vicissitudes of the Hunter 's Life . Anecdote . The Return Voyage . There was a singular combination of intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a small pocket compass , of which they stood in great need . When they saw him turn the needle with a key , they were awe-stricken , and whispered to one another that it was a spirit which had become obedient to the white man 's will . He had an iron pot , with three feet resembling a lion 's paws . This they never dared to touch , unless their hands were covered with some robe . What could have been the cause of this senseless fear , it is impossible to imagine . The same men on other subjects would reason with great logical acumen . The good ecclesiastic was still very anxious for the conversion of the Indians . He manifested more solicitude for their salvation , than for his own restoration to liberty or the preservation of his own life . He immediately entered upon the vigorous study of the language . Having learned that the phrase , " Taket chia biheu , " meant , " How do you call that , " he commenced compiling a dictionary . He had a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Fortunately he had paper and ink , and eagle 's quills were easily obtained . Hour after hour he spent inquiring the meaning of words and the names of things . The chiefs were quite pleased in teaching him and in seeing how fast he was acquiring the power of talking with them on all familiar subjects . His writing the words was an inexplicable mystery to them . They would often question him respecting the names of things . He would refer to his memorandum and then tell them correctly . This not only surprised but seemed to overawe them . Father Louis Hennepin was called , by his two French boatmen , Pere Louis . The chief who had adopted him was one day exhibiting to some chiefs who were visiting his wigwam , this wonderful power of the white man in recalling a difficult name , by looking at the characters he had written . Very solemnly he said : " There must be an invisible spirit who tells Pere Louis everything we say . " Neither of the other Frenchmen could write . The dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boatmen . He was a tall , fine-looking man , ever moving with that dignity which seems instinctive in one accustomed to command . The keen-sighted Indians were not slow in recognizing his superiority of rank , and all considered him invested with supernatural powers . Often , when it rained as they were wishing to go hunting , they would entreat him to sweep away the clouds . His invariable reply was , pointing to the skies , " The Great Spirit there controls all things . I have no such ability . " They stood in awe of his spiritual power , and their good feelings were won by his invariable serenity and kindness . They contributed beaver skins , to the value of about one hundred dollars , which they presented to him to induce him to remain and take some wives and have a richly furnished wigwam . But he declined the present , saying : " I did not come among you to collect beaver skins , but to teach you to love and obey the Great Spirit . I wish to live as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he assumed that he came voluntarily among them , and that when the time came for his departure , no one would think of throwing any obstacle in his way . It was a time almost of famine with the Indians . The summer birds had not returned . Game was very scarce . There was great suffering for want of food . And these strangely inconsistent creatures , while affecting the greatest kindness , would conceal the little food they had , get up in the night and eat it secretly , leaving Pere Hennepin to the gnawings of hunger . " Although women , " he writes , " are for the most part more kind and compassionate than men , they gave what little fish they had to their children , regarding me as a slave made by their warriors in their enemy 's country , and they reasonably preferred their children 's lives to mine . " One day a deliberative council of Issati chiefs was held , to consult respecting various matters . Pere Louis , having been adopted into the tribe as the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was said . There was a very able chief , by the name of Ou-si-cou-de , who had manifested great esteem for the father . He rose and said : " We all ought to feel indignant in view of the insulting manner in which our young men treated Pere Louis on the way . They were young warriors without sense , and perhaps knew no better . They robbed him and wanted to kill him . They acted like hungry dogs , who snatch a bit of meat from the bark dish , and run . They abused men who brought us iron and merchandise , which we never had before . " Pere Louis had considerable medical skill , and had brought with him several simple remedies . He was ever ready to attend the sick , and his success in medical practice gave him great renown . A little child was dying . According to the belief of Father Hennepin , if it should die unbaptized , it was lost . But how could he baptize the heathen child of heathen parents . Great was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At length his kind heart obtained the victory over his theological creed . The solemn rite was performed with deepest emotion . Giving the child , a little girl , the Christian name of Antoinette , in honor of St. Anthony , he said : " Creature of God , I baptize thee in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . " To his great grief he could not say mass , for want of wine and the appropriate vestments , which had been taken from him . He however spread an altar cloth , which he had retained about his person , upon the body of the child . When the spirit had taken its flight , he gave the remains Christian burial . The news of the arrival of the Frenchmen in the villages of Issati , spread far and wide through the adjacent tribes . An embassy of Indians came to visit Father Hennepin from the distance of several hundred miles in the far west . They approached him with reverence , and had many questions to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their questions indicated much thought . " We live , " they said , " in a much milder clime , where there are immense plains and boundless prairies ; where herds of thousands of buffaloes roam , and where deer and turkeys and innumerable other kinds of game are found in abundance . There is no hunger there , for food can always be obtained . " They expressed the earnest wish to take Father Hennepin back with them . But his own tribe were just about to set out on a grand hunting excursion , to the sunny realms of the southwest . A hundred and thirty families , and also two hundred and fifty warriors , embarked in a fleet of eighty birch canoes , about the middle of July . The embarcation was a wondrous spectacle , such as civilized eyes have rarely beheld , and can never witness again . A canoe had been provided for the three Frenchmen . But the two Frenchmen were jealous of the extraordinary respect with which Father Hennepin was treated and refused to take him on board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended the St. Francis River , Father Hennepin stood upon the banks extending his hands in a benediction . Two Indians , passing by in a small canoe , seeing him thus deserted , paddled ashore and took him with them . This overloaded the canoe , and it began to leak . It required constant exertion on the part of Father Hennepin to bail out the water with a small birch cup , as fast as it ran in . The canoe did not weigh fifty pounds . Great care was necessary to preserve its equilibrium , for almost the slightest irregular motion of the body would upset it . At night all landed . Sleeping in the canoes , or navigating them in the dark , was impossible . Here again one of the strangest of earthly spectacles was witnessed . Beneath the gloomy pines which fringed the stream , countless camp fires were gleaming . Men , women and children were running about in all directions . Some were cooking the supper ; some , rearing frail shelters for the night . There was chattering and bandied jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , strutted about with lordly air . Michael Ako was a most graceless fellow , and it was his influence which had excluded Father Hennepin from the canoe . But Anthony Auguelle was much more devoutly inclined . He was ashamed of their conduct . In the evening he sought out Father Hennepin , and offered a poor excuse for not receiving him into their canoe , saying it was so small and frail that had three been in it , it would inevitably have been swamped . The father was not deceived , though he accepted the apology . After four days ' paddling down the St. Francis River , the little fleet reached its mouth , where it empties into the Mississippi . They crossed to the west shore of the great river , and encamped upon an eminence there . It was impossible for Father Hennepin to be very accurate in his estimate of distances . He judged that they were then about twenty-four miles above the Falls of St. Anthony . At this spot there was a forest of birch trees , and suitable wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes , which were frail and decayed , and in which they could not safely launch forth upon the turbulent flood of the Mississippi . The whole band consequently encamped for several days upon this eminence , to construct new canoes . The veteran hunters wandered through the forests and over the prairies , to hunt stags , deer , and beaver . The larger boys and girls brought to the encampment their arms full of birch bark , with carefully selected twigs for frames . The experienced women , with nimble fingers , joined the seams and fashioned the buoyant and graceful boat . All were busy . But the hunters were unsuccessful . They brought in but little game . The whole community was fed upon thin broth , and there was but little of that . Father Hennepin , accompanied by Anthony Auguelle , in their great hunger , wandered about searching for wild berries . They found but few , and those which they ate often made them sick . The surly Michael Ako refused to go with them . The tribe of Indians encamped in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of St. Francis River , numbered between four and five hundred souls . There was a great want of food in the camp . According to Father Hennepin 's estimate , they were about two hundred miles above the mouth of the Wisconsin River . He told the Indians that when La Salle left Crevecoeur for Fort Frontenac to obtain supplies , he promised to send to the mouth of the Wisconsin River , a reinforcement of men , with powder and guns , and very many other articles for traffic with the Indians . They therefore consented that he should descend the river to this point , to obtain the supplies . These strange men were too polite to intimate that they distrusted his word and considered this merely a plan devised for his escape , as it probably was . They however , furnished him with a canoe only sufficiently large to bear him and Anthony Auguelle , with their needful luggage . By this contrivance , Michael Ako was left behind as a hostage for their return . The two Frenchmen set out , in a birch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , of four hundred miles . The only articles they could obtain to take with them , to meet the casualties of the way , were a gun , fifteen charges of powder , a knife , an earthen pot , and two robes of beaver skins , as blankets for the night 's encampments . They safely reached the falls . Taking the canoe and freight upon their shoulders , they carried them along the well-trodden trail which constituted the portage . Here they found five or six of their Indian hunters . One of them had climbed a gnarled oak tree opposite the foaming cataract , and was offering the following prayer , which Father Hennepin took down on the spot . Peculiar moans and wails , as of penitence , were blended with the prayer . " O Thou who art a Great Spirit , grant that our nation may pass these Falls quietly without harm . Help us to kill buffaloes in abundance . May we take prisoners who shall serve us as slaves . Some of them we will put to death in thine honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . " At the same time this devout savage hung upon the tree , as an offering to the spirit of the falls , a rich robe of fur , gorgeously fringed and embroidered with porcupines ' quills , variously colored . A few miles below the falls , they met another party of four or five hunters . They were encamped upon a small island , and were feasting upon an abundance of buffalo meat . The Frenchmen paddled ashore and joined eagerly in the repast . Scarcely two hours had elapsed ere four or five more canoes were seen descending the river . Sixteen warrior hunters of their own party leaped ashore . They seemed to be very angry . Tomahawk in hand , they knocked their cabin to pieces , and seized all the meat . Father Hennepin was astonished , and inquired what this meant . One of the warriors , who professed to be his uncle , replied : " These men , contrary to our laws , have gone on a buffalo hunt before the rest . Thus , while they have furnished themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffaloes , and left us destitute . In punishment , we have a right to strip them . " The two solitary voyagers paddled down the stream , as they judged , one hundred and sixty miles . During this time they killed but one deer , which they shot as it was swimming across the river . The July heat was such that the flesh could be kept but for a few hours . They saw many turtles . But for a long time in vain they endeavored to take one . The timid animals would plunge into the water the moment they heard the least noise . At last they succeeded in taking one of them . But as Father Hennepin endeavored to cut off the turtle 's head , he came very near losing one of his own fingers in its sharp jaws . The Frenchmen were very hungry , and had paddled their canoe to the shore . While the father was endeavoring to dress the turtle to be cooked . Anthony , with his gun , went back into the prairie , hoping to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work , and behold , a gust of wind had swept the canoe from the shore out into the stream , and it was floating rapidly down on the strong current . Unless the canoe could be recovered , this would prove a terrible calamity . Not a moment was to be lost . Divesting himself of most of his clothing , he plunged into the stream , and being a strong swimmer , soon overtook the boat . It floated buoyant as an eggshell . He could not get into it . By pushing it before him he succeeded in effecting a landing , about half a mile down stream , and quite cut of sight of the spot he had left . In the meantime Anthony returned . Seeing the half-dressed turtle , and the father and the canoe both gone , he was thrown into a dreadful panic . He could not doubt that some hostile Indians had appeared and carried them both away , and that he was abandoned to perish of starvation . He went back into the prairie , to ascend an eminence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father Hennepin paddled up the stream with all possible diligence , drew the canoe well upon the shore , and had just reclothed himself , when he saw , near by , a herd of sixty buffaloes , swimming across the river . Anthony had the only gun . The father ran back into the prairie , shouting for him with all his might . It was indeed a joyful cry which reached the ears of Anthony . Eagerly he responded to it . They sprang into the canoe , pursued the buffaloes , and succeeded in shooting one . They towed him to the bank of the river . The father paddled , Anthony holding the huge carcass by the horns . But they could not drag the creature ashore . They could only cut off the tender morsels and leave the remainder to float down the stream . In consequence of their great hunger they ate so voraciously , that they were both made sick , and for two days could not leave their camp . Father Hennepin writes : " Never have we more admired God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find game . And when we did , could take but little meat with us , as our canoe was so small , and besides , the excessive heat spoiled it . When we embarked in the morning , we seldom knew what we should have to eat during the day . But the eagles , which were very common in those vast countries , frequently dropped from their claws large fishes , which they were taking to their nests ! " On the 11th of July , as they were paddling down the river in search of the mouth of the Wisconsin , they were startled by the sudden appearance of a large canoe descending rapidly upon them , containing eleven warriors . They proved to be the chief Aquipaguetin , and ten of his braves . This savage chieftain had been very unwilling that his adopted son should leave the tribe for this voyage , though the other Indians had given their consent . There was a frown on his brow , and severity in his tones , as he asked whether they had yet found the Frenchmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ate together . Then the chief and his party started off , leaving Father Hennepin behind , and with vigorous paddling drove their canoe rapidly down the stream . Rather menacingly the chief said that he would go to the Wisconsin River , and that if the Frenchmen were there , he would take charge of their goods . After three days ' absence , he again appeared , with his canoe of warriors , on his return . He had been to the mouth of the river . There were no signs of the Frenchmen there . He came back in a very unamiable mood . Father Hennepin had landed , and was alone in a frail cabin which he had reared as a shelter from the hot sun . Anthony had gone into the prairie for food . Father Hennepin writes : " Aquipaguetin , seeing me alone , came up tomahawk in hand . I seized two pocket pistols , which we had regained from the Indians , and a knife . I had no intention of killing my pretended father , but only wished to frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he had that intention . " Probably the savage had no such murderous designs . He informed his adopted son that there were no Frenchmen at the Wisconsin , and none had been there , and therefore urged his return up the river . There was no alternative . But Father Hennepin and Anthony could not keep pace with the eleven-oared , or rather paddled , canoe of the savages . They crept along slowly after them . They thus paddled up the swift current of the Mississippi two hundred miles , running the risk , Hennepin says , of perishing of hunger . They had but ten charges of powder left . These they divided into twenty , and succeeded in killing some wild pigeons . At one time , for two days , they had no food whatever , though they landed and searched for game . They found a fish whose flesh was almost putrid , dropped by an eagle . With bits of this they baited two hooks , which they floated from the stern of the canoe . Father Hennepin then fell upon his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relief . While praying , they perceived a strain upon the lines , and running to the canoe , drew in two fishes , so large that they could with difficulty take them from the water . They broiled pieces upon the coals , and the starving men made an abundant repast . The next morning they met the remainder of the Indians whom they had left above the Falls of St. Anthony . They were descending the river , in search of more southern hunting grounds . Michael Ako was with them . He had developed want of courage and energy which excited the contempt of the savages . There was a large number of canoes , composing this fleet , crowded with a motley group of men , women , and children . They had encountered herds of buffaloes , and were well supplied with food . Father Hennepin and Anthony again joined them , and accompanied them back down the river , as he says , about eighty leagues . But as we have before remarked , we can not place much reliance upon his estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable . The crowded canoes , the loathsome personal habits of the savages , elevated but little above the beasts , the blistering midday sun , the drenching storms and showers , the cheerless encampments , often upon the open prairie with no protection whatever from wind and rain , and the food often scanty , consisting of nothing but flesh , without any seasoning , boiled in earthen pots , or broiled upon the coals , must have rendered the excursion irksome in the extreme to civilized men accustomed to the comforts of European life . In our last chapter we left the Indians , several hundred in number , in a fleet of canoes descending the upper waters of the Mississippi , in search of game . The three Frenchmen were with them . They were somewhere near the mouth of the Wisconsin River . Conscious that they were trespassing upon hunting grounds which other tribes claimed , they practised the utmost caution to elude their enemies . There were two hundred and fifty warriors , thoroughly armed with all the weapons of savage warfare , who composed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected a spot where they could hide their canoes in the tangled brush which often fringed the banks of the river . Some warriors were sent to the tops of the adjacent eminences to see if there were any indications of hostile parties in the vicinity . They then pushed back twenty or thirty miles into the prairie land , where they almost invariably found herds of buffaloes grazing . Without horses to aid in the pursuit , and with only arrows and javelins as weapons , the killing of a buffalo was indeed an arduous task . Still , in the course of a few weeks , a hundred and twenty were slaughtered . They jerked the meat ; that is , they cut it into very thin strips and hung them in the sun over a smouldering fire , so that it was both smoked and dried at the same time . One day an Indian ran a splinter far into his foot , inflicting a very serious wound . Father Hennepin made a deep incision in the sole , to draw out the wood . He was performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes were approaching the camp . The wounded Indian immediately sprang upon his feet , seized his arms and rushed to meet the enemy , regardless of his swollen , throbbing foot . The alarm proved a false one . A herd of eighty stags in the distance had been imagined to be hostile warriors . The excitement being over , it was with very great difficulty the crippled savage could hobble his way back to the camp . When Father Hennepin and Anthony Auguelle rejoined the Indians , they were again separated , and each was taken into the family by which he had been adopted . In their voyaging , as they passed from point to point in the river , there was assigned to the father the duty of conveying in his small canoe , a shrivelled Indian woman , eighty years of age , and three little children . These long years had not sweetened the woman 's disposition . She was a terrible scold , and often threatened to beat the children with her paddle . Thus they wandered about in this successful buffalo hunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their village far up the St. Francis River . They were here not very far west of the western end of Lake Superior . As they were returning , two wandering members of the tribe came in , and stated that they had been to Lake Superior , that they found there five Frenchmen , and that when they told them that there were three of their countrymen with the Issati tribe , the Frenchmen were very anxious to come to them , as they could not imagine by what roundabout way they had reached those distant regions . Soon after , they met on the Mississippi River M. de Luth , with five French soldiers , descending the stream in a canoe . There is some confusion in Father Hennepin 's narrative here , so that it is impossible to ascertain at what point of the river the two parties of Frenchmen met . On the 14th of August they all reached the villages of the Issati . As they were ascending the river they passed the grave of an Indian warrior . Many of the savages cast upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departed . Father Hennepin , who understood the Indians thoroughly , spread upon it a blanket . M. Luth contributed nothing . The generous act of Hennepin was exceedingly gratifying to the Indians . Soon after their return , they had a great feast , Father Hennepin and M. Luth were both present . In the midst of the entertainment one of the chiefs , who was a relative of the deceased warrior , brought in a large buffalo robe , very softly dressed , one side being brilliantly embroidered with variously colored porcupines ' quills , while the curly wool remained upon the other . This robe was neatly folded , and upon it was placed a birch-bark dish filled with food . On this , as a tea-tray , he presented the dish to the father . After he had eaten the meat , the chief spread the robe over his shoulders , saying : " He whose body thou didst cover , now covers thine . He has carried tidings of thee to the land of spirits . Brave was thy act in his regard . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproached M. Luth for not having paid any tribute of respect to the remains of the dead . M. Luth replied that he covered the bodies only of those who were chiefs , of the same rank with himself . The chief replied : " Pere Louis is a greater captain than thou art ; for his robe is more beautiful than thine . We have sent his robe to our allies who are distant more than three moons ' journey from our country . " By his robe the chief meant the rich dress , embroidered with silver lace , which the ecclesiastic wore at mass , and which he called his " brocade chasuble . " This garment had so dazzled the eyes of the Indians , that they had appropriated it to themselves as of supernatural splendor . Toward the end of September , Father Hennepin informed the Indians that it was his wish and that of his two companions , to return with the five other Frenchmen to their own country ; and that then they would fit out expeditions laden with goods to trade with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the journey to Montreal by the route they must take , they estimated at twenty-four hundred miles . The eight Frenchmen set out in two canoes . They paddled down the St. Francis , and the Mississippi to the mouth of the Wisconsin . On their way they met a fleet of one hundred and forty canoes , filled with about two hundred and fifty warriors . The chiefs visited the Frenchmen , and treated them with greatest kindness . Entering the Wisconsin , they paddled up its lone and silent banks one hundred and twenty miles , as they supposed . They followed the same route which Father Marquette had previously pursued going in an opposite direction . They carried their canoes and their effects on their shoulders , across a portage of a mile and a half to Fox River . Here they reembarked , following a river of wonderful windings , and through a series of magnificent and beautiful lakes , and through a country which they described as charming in the extreme , until they entered the magnificent expanse of Green Bay , at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about twelve hundred miles of their journey . Father Hennepin writes : " I had not celebrated mass for over nine months , for want of wine . I had still some hosts . We remained two days to rest , sing the Te Deum , high mass , and preach . All our Frenchmen went to confession and communion , to thank God for having preserved us amid so many wanderings and perils . " They purchased for a gun , a canoe , large enough to contain them all . With this they paddled a hundred leagues , until they reached Mackinac . The blasts of approaching winter were beginning to sweep these cold regions . Here they spent the winter . At this point they found , as they expected , an important military and trading post . Many Indians , even from remote tribes , were continually coming and going . Father Hennepin engaged very earnestly in preaching to the French , and in trying to teach the Indians the Gospel of Christ . They were deeply impressed with the heroism he had exhibited in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been protected by the Great Spirit , for had any of the Indians attempted to go so far they would certainly have been put to death by these distant tribes . Early in April , 1681 , the father , with a few boatmen , set out on his long voyage to Fort Frontenac , at the extreme end of Lake Ontario . A broad belt of thick ice still fringed the shores of these northern lakes . For thirty miles they dragged their canoes over the ice of Lake Huron ; and then , as they came to thin ice , launched them upon this fresh water sea . They sailed along the lake a " hundred leagues , " closely following the shore , landing every night , and living mainly upon white-fish , which were caught in abundance , in twenty fathoms water . They passed " The Strait " and Lake St. Clair for " thirty leagues . " In the still waters of Lake St. Clair they killed with an axe , thirty sturgeons which had come to the shallow waters of the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottowa Indian chief , wan and woe-stricken , who told him that he had been unsuccessful in hunting , and his wife and five children had all starved to death . Emerging from " The Strait , " they entered Lake Erie , and paddled along its shores a hundred and twenty leagues . Carrying their canoes and effects upon their backs , they passed the great Falls of Niagara , and again took to the water , coasting along the southern shore of Lake Ontario . After a voyage of about ninety miles , they reached a large village of Seneca Indians , on the southern shore of the lake . It was the middle of May . These Indians had constant intercourse with the French in Canada , and were in cordial alliance with them . Father Hennepin attended a council of the chiefs , accusing them of having enslaved , as he had learned by the way , several Indians of the Ottawa tribe , who were also allies of the French . The chiefs made many apologies ; said that the deed had been perpetrated by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored to their tribe . One of the chiefs , named Teganeot , speaking in the name of all assembled in the council , presented Father Hennepin with several rich furs , which were valued at about twenty-five dollars . The father accepted the gift , but immediately passed it over to the son of the chief , saying : " I give it to you , that you may purchase such things as you need of the French traders . I can not accept any presents . But I will report your kind feelings to the French Governor . " Reembarking , they continued their voyage forty leagues , when they reached Fort Frontenac . Father Hennepin was received with great rejoicing , as one risen from the dead . After a short tarry , they again entered their canoes , and descending the rapids of the St. Lawrence , in two days reached Montreal , sixty miles distant from the fort . Here Count Frontenac resided . He was Governor of all the French possessions in the New World . " This governor , " Father Hennepin writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probity can receive a missionary . As he believed me killed by the Indians , he was for a time thunderstruck . He beheld me wasted , without a cloak , with a garment patched with pieces of buffalo skin . He took me with him , twelve days , to recover , and himself gave me the meat I was to eat , for fear I should eat too much , after so long a diet . I rendered to him an exact account of my voyage , and represented to him the advantages of our discovery . " CHAPTER IX . The Abandonment of Fort Crevecoeur . Departure of La Salle .

Infamous Conduct of the Young Savages . Flight of the Illinois . Fort Abandoned . Death of Father Gabriel . Sufferings of the Journey to Mackinac . It will be remembered that on the last of February , 1680 , M. La Salle left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , for his perilous journey of four hundred leagues , through the pathless wilderness , to Frontenac , at the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario . His chosen companion , Lieutenant Tonti , was intrusted with the military charge of the garrison . Fathers Membre and Gabriel , both inspired with the noblest spirit of missionary enterprise , were appointed to instruct and , if possible , to convert the Indians . They raised a pretty capacious log-cabin , which was both their residence and their chapel . This humble sanctuary was every day crowded with Indians from various tribes . A very large Indian village was on the shores of Lake Peoria , about half a mile from the cabin of the missionaries . Father Membre , a true apostle of Jesus Christ , wrote an account of the momentous scenes which transpired . To his narrative we are indebted for the facts which we now give . One of the chiefs , Oumakouka , adopted , according to Indian custom , Father Membre as his son . He ever welcomed him to a warm seat by his wigwam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Father Gabriel spent the most of his time in the fort with Lieutenant Tonti and the workmen , Father Membre , who was soon quite familiar with their language , devoted much of his time to the instruction of the Indians in their wigwams . This was the arrangement which La Salle had made . He felt that the wild and reckless spirits in the garrison needed the restraints of the constant presence of their spiritual father . Individuals might otherwise be guilty of violating the rights of the Indians , and thus the whole of the little community might be involved in ruin . The large Indian village where Father Membre exerted his ministry contained a population of about eight thousand souls . There were also a large number of villages within a circle of fifty miles in diameter , some of which belonged to other tribes . These the unwearied missionary frequently visited . All these Indians made their wigwams of mats of braided flat rushes . They were tall , well formed , and very skilful archers . But the good father does not give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were genuine loafers ; idle , excessively superstitious , quarrelsome , under scarcely any restraints of law , and they would steal everything upon which they could lay their hands . Their lands were exceedingly fertile that , with very slight labor , they had an abundance of corn . Pounded corn , mixed with water and baked in the ashes , would afford but a meagre repast in the humblest log-cabin . It was deemed all-sufficient in the wigwam . All who could afford it had several wives . They were as unfeeling as brutes . If a wife displeased her lord and master , he would mercilessly cut off her nose ; and with apparently as little concern as a dog-fancier trims the ears of a terrier . United with these execrable traits of character , there were others , to which we have already alluded , which were alluring . In the summer , the men often went without any clothing , except moccasins made of buffalo hide . These poor savages were engaged in almost incessant wars . Even the religion of Jesus , whose great mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not yet been able to obliterate these sanguinary propensities from the human heart . England , France , Germany , are great slaughterhouses , where millions of men have hurled themselves upon each other in demoniac strife . What , then , could be expected of savages . The Miamis of the north were organizing an expedition against the Illinois . The rumor reached the Indian village at Crevecoeur , and created great consternation . Lieutenant Tonti endeavored to inspire the Indians with a spirit of defence . He taught them how to surround their village with palisades , and influenced them to build a fort with intrenchments . Some of the French garrison , weary of the restraints of the fort , deserted , and wandered away among the Indian tribes ; and so incorporated themselves with the savages , in dress , in war-paint , in habits , and in taking Indian wives , that it required very close scrutiny to distinguish them from the Indians . The two missionaries , conscious that there was no substantial remedy for the ills of humanity but in the regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated , with increasing zeal , all their energies in the endeavor to make Frenchmen and Indians good men , new creatures in Jesus Christ . One of the Illinois chiefs , Asapista by name , became very strongly attached to good Father Gabriel , and adopted him as his son . This was quite a favor . The generality of the Indians , like the populace everywhere , were exceedingly fickle . The friendship and caresses of to-day might be hatred and the tomahawk to-morrow . The adoption of a stranger into the tribe , as the son of a chief , was a great security against any sudden outburst of suspicion , which might lead to massacre . The Gospel of Christ makes slow headway against the wickedness of man . As in our own enlightened times , the multitude listened , were respectful to their teachers , even reverenced them , but did not heed or obey . " With regard to conversions , " Father Membre writes , " I can not rely on any . There is in these savages such an alienation from the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anti-Christian morals , that much time would be needed to hope for any fruit . It is however true , that I found many of quite docile character . We baptized some dying children , and two or three dying persons who manifested proper dispositions . As these people are entirely material in their ideas , they would have submitted to baptism , had we liked , but without any knowledge of the sacrament . " During the summer , the Indians wandered about in large hunting expeditions . The missionaries accompanied these bands , seeking day by day opportunities to teach them . Father Membre also visited several remote tribes . He found much to discourage him . He said that their blindness and obduracy were quite indescribable . On the 10th of September , 1680 , when the Indians had generally returned from their hunting parties , and were loitering about in indolent groups , with nothing to do , an Indian , from an allied tribe , came rushing almost breathless into the village , with the tidings that a united army of the Iroquois and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already entered their territory , and were on the rapid march to attack their village by surprise . He also made the astounding assertion that M. La Salle himself was leading this band of hostile warriors . There was no foundation for this last statement excepting that the chief of the Iroquois wore a European coat and hat . This led the courier to think he was La Salle , whom he had seen similarly dressed . The Indians , accepting this statement , of course believed that there was treachery . Supposing the Frenchmen at Crevecoeur were prepared to join the invading army immediately upon its arrival , they resolved to tomahawk them all . The peril of the French was great . The Indians , like children , were apt to act first and think afterwards . The French were entirely unprepared for such a sudden change of feeling . But Lieutenant Tonti , whose presence of mind never forsook him even in the greatest perils , ran from the fort to the village , and assured the warriors that La Salle was not with their foes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the garrison , with their fire-arms , and accompany the warriors to repel the enemy . This caused another change of public sentiment . All looked to the French as their deliverers . In a few hours several hundred warriors , with the French , were on the march . The arrow from the bow is but a feeble weapon compared with the bullet from rifle . The Iroquois , having had much intercourse with the French in Canada , were many of them supplied with fire-arms . They were allies of the French , and were very anxious to preserve friendship with them . The Illinois Indians , being more remote , had not been able to obtain the efficient European instruments of warfare . The two parties approached each other ; and the Illinois , guided by Tonti , were placed in a commanding position to resist attack . The allies were much disappointed in finding their plan of assailing the village by surprise frustrated . They paused in the march ; and the two armies for some time looked each other in the face , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle was at least doubtful . So many of the Iroquois warriors were armed with muskets or rifles , and had become so skilful in the use of them that , in Indian warfare , dodging from rock to rock and from tree to tree , they were fully equal to the French . Whatever might be the result of the battle , it was certain that many on each side must be slain . Lieutenant Tonti called the chiefs of the Illinois around him , and , after quite an earnest colloquy , induced them to consent that he should go to the Iroquois chiefs and endeavor to avert hostilities . It was a perilous enterprise . While some of the Indian chieftains were of much moral worth , there were many savages who were miserable wretches , and over whom the chiefs had but very little control . Lieutenant Tonti , partly from necessity , partly from choice , was dressed mainly in Indian costume . As the European garments of the Frenchmen were worn out , they were constrained to supply their place with deer-skin jackets and leggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives . Thus Lieutenant Tonti , at the council of the chiefs , in general appearance resembled the rest . But the Christian Fathers always wore a long black gown . As we have mentioned , they were called by that name among all the tribes , " The Black Gowns . " Their teachings , their ministerings at the couches of the sick and dying , their utter renunciation of the character of warriors , and their self-denying devotion to the welfare of the Indians , had caused them to be generally revered . But , among the untutored tribes as in almost every village of our land , there were " certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , " who hated the clergy . Father Membre , with that calm , peaceful Christian chivalry which can not be surpassed amidst the tumult and carnage of the field of battle , offered to accompany Lieutenant Tonti on his mission of peace . The two opposing forces were facing each other , with the space of perhaps an eighth of a mile between them . Both parties were concealed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a warrior were visible , as he moved from one hiding-place to another . Lieutenant Tonti , holding high above his head , as a flag of truce , the gorgeously decorated calumet of peace , accompanied by Father Membre in his long , flowing black robe , boldly moved forward toward the Iroquois encampment . Several of the chiefs met him , and were surprised to find that he was a Frenchman . He addressed them in their own language , in substance as follows : " I bring you the calumet of peace . The Illinois , against whom you are waging war , are our brothers . They are the friends and allies of the French . The great father in Canada is the protector both of the Iroquois and of the Illinois . He can not see one destroy the other . " The chiefs were deeply impressed by this statement . It would be ruinous for them to bring down the terrible arm of the French power upon their nation . The French could withhold entirely from them arms and ammunition , and could supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such were the thoughts of the considerate chieftains . They perceived the necessity of heeding the remonstrance . But the reckless young men , who had their reputation as warriors to make , and whose hearts were glowing with the thought of returning to their village waving gory scalps as the trophies of their heroism , were resolved that there should be no peace . To render a battle inevitable they determined to kill the two envoys from the Illinois camp . A small band of these ferocious , savage young men , crept up , cautiously and unperceived , to a spot within arrow-shot of the place where the conference with the chiefs was held . Suddenly they discharged several arrows upon Tonti and Membre , which whizzed by , fortunately , without hitting them . The perfidious wretches then rushed forward , with gleaming knives . The chiefs interposed to save those who were under the sacred protection of the calumet . One young Indian , with vigorous arm and a gleaming knife , aimed a blow at the heart of Lieutenant Tonti . As by a miracle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , and the blood gushed forth from a fearful gash . But the point of the knife glanced from a rib , and did not penetrate the heart . All this was the work of an instant . The chiefs , veteran warriors , who had a reputation for honor to sustain , promptly drew their knives , surrounded the envoys with their protection , and drove off the assassins . Tenderly they bound up the wound of Tonti , expressed to him their grief and indignation , assured him that hostilities should cease and that they would immediately withdraw , with their warriors , back to their own village . The wounded lieutenant , aided by his clerical friend , returned to the Illinois camp , with the glad tidings that the Iroquois had consented to peace . Several hours passed , and the Iroquois bands , instead of retiring , were continually drawing nearer , in a very suspicious manner , apparently with the intention of surrounding the Illinois , and cutting off their retreat . The Illinois chief held another council , and requested Father Membre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of their conduct . Father Membre writes : " This was not a very agreeable mission to a savage tribe . Nevertheless , I made up my mind , and God preserved me from all harm . " The chiefs received him kindly . They were ashamed of the course which the warriors , notwithstanding their remonstrances , were pursuing . They said to him frankly : " Our real trouble is that we are starving . We expected to find abundant food in the Illinois village , and have consumed all we brought with us . Our march has frightened away the game , so that we can expect to find but little on our return . We are in danger of perishing for want of food . " Membre brought back this message . At his suggestion an abundance of food was immediately sent , on many heavily-laden shoulders , to the Illinois camp . The good father accompanied this peaceful embassage , and slept in the camp of the Illinois . Still the young savages were determined , if possible , to bring on a fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war-whoop , with the shrieks of women and children , falling beneath their tomahawks , was music to their ears . The burning wigwams , the mangled bodies , the bloody scalps , were pictures of beauty to their eyes . And , most glorious of all , to their purely unangelic natures , was the triumphant return to their village with prisoners to run the dreadful gauntlet ; and to writhe , and perhaps be forced to scream , beneath the fiend-like tortures of the stake . The next morning the Iroquois warriors , instead of turning their steps homewards , flocked , in large numbers , into the village of the Illinois . They were evidently bent upon picking a quarrel . They swaggered through the streets , insulted the women , trampled the corn-fields , and went even so far as to disinter , and knock about the bones of the dead . It soon became manifest to all , that a bloody conflict was inevitable . The chiefs directed all the women and children to retire as silently and unobserved as possible , and hide themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the vicinity of a trail which led quite directly to the Mississippi River . If the Illinois were defeated in the battle , they could by this line of retreat , cross the Great River , and take refuge with a friendly tribe upon the other side . Then the Illinois warriors , in a body , without venturing upon an engagement abandoned the village to the Iroquois , and commenced a precipitate flight to the Mississippi . They were not pursued . The Iroquois chiefs would not lead the young men in an enterprise which they deemed so dishonorable . As we have said , the control of the chiefs over the daring and lawless spirits of the young savages was feeble . The French garrison was greatly weakened by death and desertion . There was much reason to fear that the savages would fall upon them , and kill them all , for the sake of the plunder they would find in the fort . There was nothing to detain the missionaries . Upon the retirement of the Iroquois , they would be left in a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerical associates , Fathers Membre and Gabriel , held a consultation , and decided upon an immediate withdrawal . It was the 13th of September , 1680 . Their desire was to go back to Mackinaw , which station La Salle would necessarily revisit on his return from Frontenac , with reinforcements and supplies . Their numbers were so diminished , and their departure so hasty , that they all embarked in one frail canoe . The chiefs so far restrained the young savages , that no attack was made upon them . But the leaders of this feeble little garrison were well aware , that in all probability bands of the young men would pursue them , to lie in ambush at some narrow passage of the river , and cut them off , if possible . They left the fort about noon , packing in their canoe only a few articles of absolute necessity . All the afternoon they plied their paddles vigorously , ascending the Illinois River , and passing through the broad expanse of Lake Peoria . Their canoe was leaky and heavily laden . The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not venture to land until after dark , that the landing might not be seen by any foe , skulking through the forest along the banks of the river . They also took the precaution to seek their night 's encampment on the side of the stream opposite that which was occupied by the Iroquois band . At an early hour the next morning they resumed their voyage , still ascending the Illinois River . They had paddled along but a few hours , and had reached a point between twenty-five and thirty miles above the fort , when their dilapidated canoe leaked so badly , that they were forced to land , that they might repair it . They were on the borders of one of Illinois ' most beautiful prairies . The smooth and verdant expanse , extending to the horizon , was dotted with groves , presenting a landscape of enchanting loveliness . Father Gabriel , as he could be of no service in repairing the boat , decided to walk into one of the groves at a little distance from the river , with his prayer-book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely solitudes , worship his Creator . It was a temple for devout meditation and adoration such as no cathedral reared by man 's hand ever presented . It took all day to repair the canoe . Hour after hour passed away , and Father Gabriel did not return . His companions began to feel a little solicitude about his safety . Toward evening Father Membre set out in search of him . He was not in the grove . There were no traces of him to be seen . There were several groves in the distance ; and there were gentle eminences in the rolling prairie , behind which he might be concealed . The anxious father ascended one after another of these eminences , but nowhere over the vast plain could he catch any sight of the lost one . Again and again he shouted . The silence of the prairie was the only response to his cry . Greatly alarmed , he returned to his companions , who had now completed their repairs of the canoe . The whole party then set out on the search . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . All was in vain . Night had settled over the prairie , when they reassembled in great despondency at the canoe . Father Gabriel was greatly loved . He was a gentle , self-sacrificing man , of kindly words and generous deeds . The party crossed the river , as a precaution against an attack from any band of the Iroquois who might be following them . They then built a large fire , that its rays , shining far and wide over the prairie , might arrest the eye of the lost one , and guide him on his return . The morning dawned . Still there was no clue to the disappearance of Father Gabriel . The voyagers returned to the other side of the river , and lingered there until the middle of the forenoon . Lieutenant Tonti then said that it was clear that their companion had not wandered into the prairie and become lost ; for from any of the eminences he could have discerned the line of the river , nor could he have wandered so far as neither to have heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . It was certain that he had either been cut off by some prowling band of savages , or that he had decided to follow up the banks of the river on foot , intending to enter the canoe when it came along . In either case it was their duty to press forward on their journey as rapidly as possible . For a long time they heard no more of Father Gabriel . Finally they learned that some young savages , of the Kikapoo tribe , who were at war with the Iroquois , were prowling about when they caught sight of the father engaged in his devotions in the grove . His eyes were probably closed , and his whole soul absorbed in prayer . There is one advantage which the arrow has over the bullet . It performs its deadly mission without making any noise . The wily savages , unseen and unheard , crept near , and piercing him with their arrows he fell dead . They took his scalp , threw the body into a ditch , covering it with a few leaves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boastfully exhibited the scalp of the defenceless missionary , as that of an Iroquois warrior . To obtain this renown was the only object of the cowardly assassins in their murderous deed . Thus died Father Gabriel . He was the last scion of a noble family of Burgundy . He had renounced his inheritance , and all the brilliant prospects of a courtly life , to consecrate himself to the service of his Saviour , the Son of God . In his own country , his family name , his many virtues , and his entire devotion to the ministry upon which he had entered , had elevated him to high positions of influence and honor . All these he relinquished , after he had passed his three-score years , to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus to the savages of North America . He landed in Canada , in the summer of 1670 . For some time he was employed as chaplain of Governor Frontenac . Here he was untiring in his efforts to instruct the Indians . Having become in a good degree familiar with their language and customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vast and unexplored regions he was about to penetrate . The good old man was now seventy years of age . For forty years he had been earnestly engaged in preaching the gospel of peace on earth , and good will among men . And now the blessed hour had come when God sent his angel to take the victor in many a hard-fought spiritual conflict , to his home in heaven ; for God can convert even the wickedness of man into an agency for the accomplishment of His purposes . How sublime the scene of his departure . It was a serene , beautiful autumnal day . The deep blue of the overarching skies were embroidered , as it were , with fleecy clouds . The waters of the river , clear as crystal , flowed gently by . The luxuriant prairie , brilliant with the bloom of autumn , almost entranced the eye as a garden of the Lord . In a majestic grove the veteran Christian knelt , at peace with God , with himself , and with all the world . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all absorbed in prayer . Suddenly a shower of arrows pierce him , and he falls dead ! Dead ! do I say ? No ! He awakes to a new life of inconceivable vitality and grandeur . A retinue of angels are there , ready to receive him . In their blest companionship he takes his rapturous journey to the bosom of his Saviour and his God . " Oh , ' t is a glorious thing to die As dies the Christian , with his armor on . " The saddened voyagers , as they plied their paddles in ascending the river , all unconscious of the fate which had overtaken the beloved father , had still a journey of nearly two hundred and fifty miles before them , ere they could reach their friends . The dilapidated canoe soon failed them entirely , and they were compelled to abandon it . The remainder of the long journey was to be made on foot . Their destitution was alarming . They had no food but such as they could pick up by the way . Their clothing was old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been waiting for supplies to be brought them by La Salle . They had neither companion nor guide . The route they were to follow was in a northerly direction through the pathless forests , and over the pathless prairies , many miles west of Lake Michigan , to the missionary station at the foot of Green Bay . Father Hennepin had left his cloak in the canoe . They cut up the garment to repair their shoes and clothes . Often , in days of storm , they wandered bewildered and lost . They found but little game , for they were not professional hunters . Their food consisted mainly of acorns and roots . After a journey of fifteen days , and when almost starved , they were so fortunate as to kill a deer . Upon venison steaks they feasted luxuriously . At length they came to a little cluster of Pottawatomi wigwams . This powerful tribe occupied an extensive territory southwest of Lake Michigan . About ten years before , a delegation from the tribe had visited the French , and friendly relations were established between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ragged wanderers . They fed them with such morsels as could be fished from the pots of the Indians . The wigwams were comfortable , affording ample protection from wind and rain . The weary wanderers , who were scarcely able to stand , threw themselves upon mats before the wigwam fires and slept long , long hours of rich enjoyment . Somewhat recruited by the repose of a few days , they again took up their line of march . After the endurance of great fatigue and many sufferings , they at length reached the missionary station at Green Bay . Here they were received as brothers , and here they passed the winter . Early in the spring , as soon as the ice had disappeared from the bay , Lieutenant Tonti and Father Membre set out in a canoe , with a few boatmen , for the station at Michilimackinac . After a prosperous voyage of a few days , they reached that important point in safety . They had been there but a short time , when a small fleet of canoes came paddling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To their great joy they found that it was an expedition of La Salle , and that he was on board . He had a sad story to tell of disasters and sufferings , which we must reserve for our next chapter .

There he encountered tidings of disaster sufficient to crush the stoutest heart . The Griffin had foundered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All on board perished ; and the whole of La Salle 's fortune , consisting of ten thousand dollars ' worth of furs , had gone down into the bottom of the lake . The rumor reached Frontenac that La Salle had perished in his vessel . He had sent quite a fleet of canoes , laden with articles for the Indian trade , to purchase all the furs they could along the northern and southern shores of Lake Ontario . The canoe men heard the rumor of the death of La Salle , and treacherously appropriated to themselves all the goods with which they had been intrusted . Before setting out on his first excursion , he had sent to France for more goods , to the amount of five thousand dollars ; a very considerable sum in those days . The vessel laden with these articles , after having safely crossed the Atlantic , was driven upon one of the islands of St. Peter , and everything was lost . There was no insurance in those days ; La Salle did indeed experience the truth of the adage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energy , and noble character of the man was such that friends came to the rescue . The Governor was very desirous of continuing the exploration , to the mouth of the Mississippi , which La Salle had begun . It was his great ambition there to unfurl the banner of France , and there , in the name of his king , to take possession of the most majestic valley on this globe . Another small fleet of canoes was soon prepared , freighted with such articles , for use and traffic , as he would need on the expedition . The canoes , eight or ten in number , were large and strong . The party consisted of twenty-three Frenchmen and thirty-one Indians ; fifty-four , in all . The statement seems almost incredible that , of these Indians , ten were women , and three were children . But Father Zenobe , who accompanied the expedition , mentions that the Indians insisted upon taking the women , as servants , to cook their food , and to perform the drudgery at their several encampments . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was indeed an imposing spectacle , when , at an early hour of a still , sultry summer morning , this gayly decorated fleet of canoes pushed out from the little harbor at the fort , upon the mirrored surface of Lake Ontario . It was , to a considerable degree , a national expedition . The banners of France fluttered in the gentle breeze over all the battlements of the fort . The forests and the hills resounded with the roar of the salute from her heavy guns . Hundreds of Indians crowded the shore to witness the departure . The Frenchmen returned the salute by a discharge of their muskets and by three cheers . The canoes speedily disappeared behind a headland , as the voyagers , with their paddles , pressed forward upon one of the most extraordinary expeditions ever undertaken by man . The voyage along the southern shore of the lake proved to be very stormy . Again and again the gale and the surging billows drove them ashore . To the Indians , and to the Canadian boatmen generally , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men ; and to the Indians , the life to which they had been inured from infancy , and the only life they had ever known . Indeed the crew generally had no more thought of yesterday or tomorrow than the few dogs who accompanied them . The weight of responsibility rested only upon the minds of La Salle and his gentlemanly , highly educated ecclesiastical companions . When landing , for an encampment at night , or forced to take shelter from the storm , they easily drew their canoes up upon the greensward ; turned them over to protect the freight from the rain , entered a little distance , the dense , primeval forest , which from time immemorial had fringed the shores of the lake , and there speedily reared a shelter which , to them , presented all the comforts which the palatial mansion offers to its lord . They spread their mats upon the floor . They built their camp fires , whose brilliant blaze enlivened the scene . They cooked their suppers , of corn-bread and venison steaks , which health and hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked jokes , and enjoyed perhaps as much as the mere animal man is capable of enjoying . This is indeed the sunny side of such a life . But it is a real side . For such men it has a real charm ; charms so great that they reluctantly relinquish them for all that civilization can offer . But it must be evident to every reader of these pages , that this wandering , homeless life , has also its shady side . They , like all other men , had often occasion to say in the beautiful verse of Longfellow : " The day is cold , and dark , and dreary , It rains , and the wind is never weary , The vine still clings to the mouldering wall , At every gust the dead leaves fall , And the day is dark and dreary . " La Salle left Fort Frontenac on the 23d of July , 1680 , about two months before the abandonment of Crevecoeur by Tonti . In consequence of the series of storms , he was nearly three weeks in reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods were then carried around the falls , to the station called Fort Conti , which had been established at the head of Niagara River . He did not reach this station until about the middle of August . Fort Conti had become quite a resort of the neighboring Indian tribes for trade . Here La Salle intended to lay in fresh supplies of corn . The season had been an unfavorable one . The small crop annually raised by the thoughtless , indolent savages , was still smaller than usual , affording but a scant supply for the winter . The Indians were not disposed to sell . Many days passed away , and but little had been brought in . La Salle had quite a store of French brandy . He offered to exchange brandy for corn . The poor Indians , who would sell the clothes from their backs for intoxicating liquors , brought the corn in so abundantly , that the canoes were immediately filled . In one day sixty sacks were urged upon him . On the 28th of August , 1680 , the voyagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smooth expanse of water before them , paddled joyously along the northern shores of Lake Erie , ascended the Detroit River , crossed Lake St. Clair , passed through the Straits of St. Clair , and coasted along the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron , a distance of two or three hundred miles , until they reached the station at Mackinac , the latter part of September . The voyage from the head of Niagara River had occupied nearly a month . When the little fleet of birch canoes entered the harbor at Mackinac , Lieutenant Tonti had just abandoned his dilapidated birch canoe on the Illinois River , in his retirement from the fort , and , with his few companions , was struggling on foot through the wilderness west of Lake Michigan , seeking also the same refuge . La Salle , entirely unconscious of the disasters which had overtaken his garrison at Crevecoeur , reembarked , on the 4th of October . Following the same course he had pursued before , he paddled down the eastern coast of Lake Michigan , to the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be remembered , he had erected Fort Miami , on territory inhabited by the Miami Indians . It was a long voyage , with many obstructions from the autumnal storms , which seemed to be incessantly sweeping that bleak and harborless lake . After the tempestuous voyage of a month , he reached Fort Miami on the 3d of November . Eleven months before , on the 3d of December , 1679 , he had left that station , on his route to the Illinois River . Le Clercq says that four men were left in charge there . This is not sustained by other accounts . It is not probable that so small a number would have been left in a position so greatly exposed . But , however this may be , he found the Miami village in ashes , and all who dwelt in it dispersed . His log fort was also in utter ruin . It was a melancholy scene which met his eye ; another indication of man 's inhumanity to man . The St. Joseph 's River takes its rise in Indiana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Lake Michigan , it flows in a course of narrow windings , almost directly from the south . By paddling up this stream , in a canoe voyage of three or four days , or about seventy miles of our measurement , they came to a portage , five or six miles in length , by which they could reach the Kankakee River . This was an important tributary of the Illinois River . It will be remembered that it was by this stream that La Salle and his party , more than a year before , prosecuted their voyage to Lake Peoria . It was then , for much of its distance , rather a dismal stream , sluggishly winding through marshes lined with alders . Rapidly they paddled on , day after day , through a country of silence and solitude , until they entered the broader , deeper waters of Illinois River . Still , as they descended this beautiful stream , which presented as attractive situations for happy homes as perhaps earth could afford , they passed no Indian villages , no solitary wigwam , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site where the Indian village had formerly stood in its picturesque beauty , with six or eight thousand inhabitants swarming around , in the various costumes , and engaged in the diversified employments of savage life . Naught remained but smouldering ruins and trampled harvests . Man bitterest foe , his brother man , had been there , and had left behind but the traces of desolation , blood and woe . Neither wolf nor bear could have been more merciless , or could have left behind them ravages so dreadful . The dispersion of the garrison , and the destruction of all the works commenced and the stores deposited at Crevecoeur , was another blow upon the head and the heart of La Salle , apparently frustrating all his plans . He must have experienced emotions of the keenest anguish . But this remarkable man , invincible by the reverses of fortune , presented to his companions only a smiling aspect , and addressed them only with cheerful words . Having lost everything which he had expected to find at Crevecoeur , it became necessary for him to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prairie , and lake , of nearly five hundred miles . Immediately he reembarked his whole force , in his canoes , and commenced the laborious ascent of the stream he had just descended so pleasantly , borne along by the aid of the current . When they reached the mouth of the Kankakee , instead of following up that stream , they struck across the country , by a portage directly north , until they reached the Chicago River . Here they again launched their canoes and followed down the windings of the stream until they came to its entrance into Lake Michigan , where Chicago now stands . At this port La Salle found fragments of many war-scathed tribes , in a half-starving condition . They informed him that the terrible Iroquois ; composed of five united savage nations , and whose central power was in the vast territory south of Lake Ontario , had in overwhelming numbers invaded the valley of the Illinois . Many of their warriors were armed with guns purchased from the French . The feeble tribes fled in terror before them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night the hideous war-whoop resounded . Villages were burned , captives were seized , women and children were slaughtered , and thousands of fugitives , war-bereaved , woe-stricken , fled to the western side of the Mississippi to seek protection by being incorporated into friendly tribes in those apparently limitless realms . Around the lovely shores of Lake Peoria there had been seventeen flourishing Indian villages . These were all destroyed , in awful scenes of conflagration and massacre . The survivors fled beyond the Mississippi , six hundred miles from their desolated homes . And even to these regions the ferocious Iroquois pursued them , thirsting for blood and scalps . La Salle was a Christian . He was interested in the religious welfare of the poor Indians , as the only instrumentality by which they could secure for themselves pleasant homes on earth , and happy homes in heaven . He agreed with the missionaries , that if they wished to establish missions in those parts , with any hope of seeing Christianity make progress among the natives , they must secure them immunity from the horrors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining tribes in a firm union for a common defence . At the mouth of the Chicago River , La Salle was , as he thought , by the route he had taken , about one hundred and twenty miles from Lake Peoria . He reached this point probably some time in January 1681 . The lake , for some distance from the shore , was encumbered with ice . Fierce wintry storms swept the bleak prairies , and piled the snow in drifts . It was almost impossible to journey , either by land or water . La Salle and his party went into encampment upon the banks of the Chicago River , to wait a few weeks until the severity of winter was over . At the same time , though he knew not of it , the few remaining members of the garrison which he had left at Crevecoeur were seeking shelter from these piercing blasts , about a hundred miles north , in the wigwams of the friendly Pottawattomies . La Salle and his ecclesiastical companions improved these few weeks of leisure in seeking interviews with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in endeavoring to unite them in a strong confederacy . He assured them that if they would thus be true to themselves , the French would become their allies and send them efficient aid . It was not until the 22d of May that he was able to launch his canoes upon the lake . There was then a voyage of about two hundred and sixty miles before him . About the middle of June his fleet of canoes was seen , coming around a point of land , as the boatmen rapidly paddled into the harbor at Michilimackinac . Here La Salle met Lieutenant Tonti , Father Membre , and their associates , as we have mentioned in the last chapter . The good Father Membre writes : " I leave you to conceive our mutual joy , damped though it was by the narrative he made us of all his misfortunes , and of that we made him of our tragical adventures . Though La Salle related to us all his calamities , yet never did I remark in him the least alteration . He always maintained his ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprise . But La Salle , by a firmness of mind and constancy almost unequalled , was more resolute than ever to carry out his discovery . We therefore left , to return to Fort Frontenac with his whole party , to adopt new measures , to resume and complete our course , with the help of heaven , in which we put all our trust . " We have no detailed account of the long voyage back to Frontenac , or of the return voyage to the mouth of the Chicago River . In the meagre narratives which have descended to us , there are slight discrepancies which it is impossible to reconcile . Entering Lake Michigan at its northern extremity through the Straits of Mackinac , they paddled down the eastern coast , passed the mouth of St. Joseph 's River , rounded the southern curvature of the lake , and reached the mouth of the Chicago River on the 4th of January , 1682 . The winter in that region was short , but very severe . The Chicago River presented a solid surface of ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dragged by the men over the ice of the river . This journey in mid-winter , over a bleak and often treeless expanse , was slow and toilsome . Having reached the point where the portage commenced , they dragged their sledges , laden with the canoes , baggage , and provisions , across the portage to the Illinois River . They reached this point on the 29th of the month , having spent twenty-three days in the exhausting journey . They were , at that point , according to Father Membre 's estimate , two hundred and forty miles from the mouth of the Illinois where it enters into the Mississippi . Drawing their sledges upon the ice , they day after day followed down the lonely and silent stream , whose banks war had desolated . They passed the smouldering sites of many former villages , where only melancholy scenes of devastation met the eye . They reached Crevecoeur about the 1st of February . It would seem that La Salle , on his previous visit , had repaired the ruins there , so as to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found all things as he had left them . The river below Crevecoeur was free from ice . Having rested for about a week , in the enjoyment of warm fires , in their log-cabins , they launched their canoes into the Illinois River , and on the 6th of February reached the mouth of the river . They found the swollen flood of the Mississippi full of vast masses of ice , pouring down from the distant regions of the north . This detained them till the 13th of the month . They encamped at the same point where Father Hennepin had tarried . A short voyage of a day bore them to the mouth of turbid and turbulent Missouri . Here they landed at an Indian village , where they seem to have been very kindly received . It will be remembered that La Salle was still intent upon finding some short passage across the continent , of whose width he knew nothing , to the Pacific Ocean . He was much excited by the strange tidings he heard from the Indians here . They assured him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a range of mountains where the river took its rise ; that numerous and populous Indian villages were scattered all the way along the banks of the river ; that by ascending one of the mountain eminences , he would have a view of the vast and boundless sea where great ships were sailing . We can not now tell whether this was the mere fabrication of some imaginative savage , or whether such was the general opinion of the tribe . The next day , after a sail of about thirty miles , they reached another Indian village on the bank of the river . Here again they landed peacefully , and warmed the hearts of the savages by a few presents which were to them of priceless value . They journeyed slowly . They could not , in their crowded canoes , carry a large amount of provisions . Consequently they were under the necessity of making frequent stops to catch fish or to hunt for game . Not long after this visit of La Salle , a mission was established in this little village , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were converted to , at least , nominal Christianity . Continuing their voyage one hundred and twenty miles down the river , they came to the mouth of the Ohio . Here they made another stop to lay in fresh supplies . The friendly Indians there informed them they could find no suitable camping ground for a distance of nearly one hundred and fifty miles , the banks were so low and so encumbered with rushes and dense brush . The voyagers remained at the mouth of the Ohio ten days , sending out parties in various directions . One of the Frenchmen , Peter Prudhomme , wandering from his companions , did not return . There were many fears that he had been captured by the Indians , as some of the party had seen fresh Indian trails . The heroic La Salle was not disposed to abandon the man . He threw up some entrenchments for the protection of his company , and despatched several well-armed Frenchmen , with Indian guides , to follow vigorously the trail of the savages , for the recovery of the captive if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Salle tarried in his encampment at the mouth of the Ohio . On the 1st of March the detachment , sent in pursuit of the lost one , returned . They had seen and heard nothing of Peter . Five Indians , however , had been seen , two of whom were caught and brought into the camp . They knew nothing of the lost man . Receiving only friendly treatment , they seemed quite anxious that La Salle should visit their village , which they falsely assured La Salle was distant but a day and a half 's journey from the point where they then were . These Indians belonged to the Chickasaw tribe , which subsequently became quite prominent in the history of our land . With the Indians a day 's journey was about thirty miles . La Salle and Father Membre set out to visit the village , guided by the Indians . They do not appear to have had any hesitation in thus placing themselves entirely in the hands of the savages . But after having travelled day and a half through a country diversified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied that the Indians were deceiving them , and charged them with it . They confessed the deception , made some lame apologies for it , and confessed that their village was still at the distance of three days ' journey . Without any apparent reluctance they accompanied La Salle and Membre back to the camp . La Salle then sent one of the Indians to the Chickasaw village , with several presents , and to invite the chiefs to meet him , some hundred miles below , as he descended in his canoes . The other Indian consented to remain , and accompany his party down the river . Just as the voyagers were reembarking , the missing man appeared . He had been lost in the forest and for nine days had wandered in the unavailing search for his companions . Fortunately , the weather was mild , game abundant , and , as he had his gun with him , he did not want for food . Cheered by his return , they rejoicingly entered their canoes , and , with cloudless skies overarching them , pushed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms to them entirely unknown , and to a point they knew not where . It was a singular and a beautiful spectacle , which was presented by this flock of large birch canoes , eight or ten in number , filled with Indians , and Frenchmen in Indian costume , gliding down the broad , swift current of the river . The paddles glistened with the reflected rays of the sun . All were in health . There was no toil . New scenes of marvellous desolation , or beauty , or grandeur , were continually opening before them . They were well fed . The mind was kept in a state of delightful excitement . The French are proverbially good-natured and mirthful . Each night 's encampment presented a scene of feasting , bonfires and innocent joyous revel . These were indeed sunny days , and this was the poetry of travelling . The 3d of March , 1682 , came . They had then descended the river , as they judged , about one hundred and twenty miles below the mouth of the Ohio . They were approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arkansas Indians , situated on the western banks of the Mississippi . It was concealed from them by a bluff , and by a turn in the stream . An Indian , upon the lookout on the bluff , caught sight of the formidable looking fleet , far up the river , and , supposing it to be filled with hostile savages on the war-path , gave the alarm . The whole village was instantly thrown into a state of great excitement . The women and children fled back into the forest . The warriors grasped their arms and rallied for battle . As the fleet drew near , all unconscious of the commotion it had excited , the voyagers , not seeing a single Indian , were surprised to hear , on the other side of the bluff , the yells of apparently hundreds of savages . Their piercing war-whoops were blended with the loud beatings of a kind of drum which they had fabricated . Warned by these hostile demonstrations , La Salle guided his canoes to the other side of the river , which was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the village . With his customary caution , he immediately threw up some intrenchments , behind which his men , with their guns , could beat off almost any number of savages . He knew not but that hundreds of warriors would cross the river in their canoes , to make an impetuous assault upon him . Having thus guarded against surprise , and afforded the Indians a little time to recover from their first alarm , he then , unarmed , advanced to the water 's edge , and by friendly signs endeavored to invite some of the chiefs to come over to meet him . Several of the chiefs entered a large boat , called a periagua . It was made of the trunk of an immense tree , hollowed out , and carved and decorated with immense labor . Such a wooden canoe was capable of holding a large number of warriors . The chiefs crossed the river until they came to within a quarter of a mile of the shore , and then they stopped , and beckoned the strangers to come and meet them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative that it must have been Father Membre , in a canoe , to meet them . Two of his Indians paddled the boat , until they came alongside of the periagua of the natives . Father Membre , familiar as he was with several Indian dialects , could not speak their language . He however held out to them the calumet of peace , which at once won their confidence ; and he found no difficulty in communicating with them by signs . He invited the chiefs to accompany him back to the encampment . They were six in number . Retaining him with them , in the large periagua , they speedily paddled ashore , followed by Membre 's canoe , with the two Indian boatmen . Without any hesitancy , the six Indian chiefs entered into the redoubt which La Salle had thrown up . They appeared frank , unsuspicious , and cordial , and were made very happy by several presents which La Salle placed in their hands . They invited the whole party to cross the river to their village . The canoes were launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftains in their wooden boat . The whole adult male population of the village crowded the banks to receive them ; and with every demonstration of friendship . But the timid women and children kept cautiously in the distance . Eight or ten large birch canoes , from which more than fifty persons landed upon the beach , presented a very imposing appearance . They were nearly all armed with guns , not for aggressive warfare , but for hunting and protection . The natives crowded around the strangers , conducted them up to their wigwams , which were very pleasantly situated on a rich and tolerably well cultivated plain extending back from the river . The guests were regaled with the greatest profusion of barbarian hospitality . These Indians had attained a very considerable degree of civilization . They had quite a large number of slaves , whom they had captured from tribes with whom they were at war . The fertile fields around were quite well cultivated with corn , beans , melons , and a variety of fruits . Peaches were abundant . Large flocks of turkeys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very handsome race ; and it was observed that , while the northern Indians were generally moody and taciturn , these savages , beneath more sunny skies , were frank , generous , and gay in the extreme . CHAPTER XI . The Great Enterprise Accomplished . Scenes in the Arkansas Villages . Indian Hospitality . Barbarian Splendor . Attractive Scenery . The Alarm . Its Joyful Issue . Genial Character of La Salle . Erecting the Cross . Pleasant Visit to the Koroas . The Two Channels . Perilous Attack . Humanity of La Salle . The Sea Reached . Ceremonies of Annexation . For several days La Salle and his party remained with their hospitable friends the Arkansas Indians . On the 14th of March , 1682 , La Salle took possession of the country in the name of the king of France . He invested the ceremony with all the pomp he could command . An immense cross was raised in the centre of the village ; and the Christian 's God was recognized with anthems , prayers and imposing religious rites . Thousands of savages gathered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They had no conception of its significance . They supposed it a festival got up for their entertainment , as they would got up a war-dance to please their guests . As the cross was raised , Father Membre made some attempt to teach them the significance of this emblem of the way of salvation through faith in an atoning Saviour . He writes : " During this time they showed that they relished what I said by raising their eyes to heaven , and kneeling as if to adore . We also saw them rubbing their hands over their bodies , after rubbing them over the cross . In fine , on our return from the sea , we found that they had surrounded the cross with a palisade . " On the 17th of the month , the explorers reembarked , and continued their voyage down the river about eighteen miles , when they came to two other villages of the Arkansas tribe . Here they were again received with the utmost hospitality . Continuing their sunny voyage beneath cloudless skies and upon a glassy stream for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by an expansion of the river . This sheet of water seemed to be fringed with villages . There were forty on the east side of the lake , and thirty-four on the west side , upon its banks . All were picturesquely situated and , in the distance , presented an aspect of much beauty . The houses were well built , of clay mixed with straw baked in the sun . The roofs were constructed of canes quite gracefully bent in the form of a dome . Their beds or mats were raised on wooden bedsteads , and they had many convenient articles of household furniture . The bark of a tree furnished very fine white fibres , which they braided into blankets and other articles of dress . The head chief was an absolute sovereign , having the property and the lives of his subjects entirely at his disposal . A retinue of slaves attended him . He was luxuriously clothed , fed , and housed . The village of the chief was at a little distance from the banks of the lake . La Salle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace to pay his respects to the monarch . He encamped upon the borders of the expanded stream , and beneath the shade of his roof sought repose upon his mat . He , however , sent Lieutenant Tonti and Father Membre with presents to the chief . In return , several men were sent to La Salle , munificently laden with provisions and other gifts . Soon after , the king himself appeared in regal state . First came a master of ceremonies , with six pioneers , to remove every obstruction from the way , and to make the path level for the feet of royalty . They selected a spot upon which the monarch was to give audience to his guests . The ground was carefully smoothed , and carpeted with beautiful mats . The monarch soon made his appearance . He was richly dressed in white robes . Two officers preceded him , bearing plumes of gorgeously colored feathers . He was followed by another official , bearing two large plates of copper , highly polished . The king had the bearing of a gentleman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accustomed to absolute command , he had that peculiar air of self-possession and authority which seems to be the inheritance of those who can boast a long line of illustrious ancestry . It was the 22d day of March , 1682 . The scene presented was in the highest degree picturesque and beautiful . The widely expanded lake glittered in the sunlight as placid as a mirror . The villages of the Indians , clustered so thickly along the shores , were composed of substantial dwellings , whose roofs of curved canes , thatched with thick mats , were rounded into graceful domes . The barbarian splendor assumed by the monarch , the group of French adventurers , with their Indian companions , gathered near by , the thousands of the Taensa tribe , men , women , and children , standing at a respectful distance , silently gazing upon the scene , the little fleet of canoes upon the beach , and the encampment hastily thrown up  --  these combined to open to the eye a picture of peace and loveliness , which the pencil of the most skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed seem then and there , as though God had intended this for a happy world  --  for a world where his children might live together in paternal love , and with the interchange of the kindliest sympathies . Though in the early spring , the foliage beneath those sunny skies was in full leaf , and the flowers in full bloom . " The whole country , " writes Father Membre , " is covered with palm trees , laurels of two kinds , plums , peaches , mulberry , apple , and pear trees of every variety . There are also five or six kinds of nut trees , some of which bear nuts of extraordinary size . They also gave us several kinds of dried fruit to taste . We found them large and good . They have also many varieties of fruit trees which I never saw in Europe . The season was however too early to allow us to see the fruit . We observed vines already out of blossom . " The interview between the monarch and La Salle passed off very pleasantly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchanged . For four days the voyagers remained the guests of these friendly people . They rambled through their villages , entered their dwellings , and were abundantly feasted . The natives seemed very amiable , quite intelligent , and were far in advance , in civilization , of the nations or tribes farther north . Father Membre was much pleased with their candor , and with the clearness with which he thought they comprehended his instructions . They readily accepted his teaching of God ; and apparently comprehended , without any difficulty , the plan of salvation through an atoning Saviour . In truth , this doctrine is apparently the most simple and the most powerful which can be presented to the savage . All over the world , the necessity of an atonement for sin seems to be implanted in the human breast . And when the missionary teaches the savage that God , our Heavenly Father , in the person of His Son has borne our sins in His own body on the tree , the most ignorant can comprehend it , and the most wicked can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Salle and his companions , greatly refreshed by their delightful visit , resumed their voyage down the river . They descended very rapidly , by the aid of the current and the paddle . Having sailed about forty miles , they saw in the distance below them , a large wooden boat containing a number of Indians . The savages seemed alarmed as they caught sight of the fleet of canoes coming down so rapidly upon them . They plied their paddles with all diligence , and run into the eastern shore . La Salle , with his usual caution , landed upon the opposite bank . The two parties gazed at each other across the rolling flood , a mile in width . La Salle sent Lieutenant Tonti , in a canoe with several Indians , to carry to the boatmen the calumet of peace . While the Indians plied their paddles , he stood up in the canoe , waving toward the boatmen the plumed badge of fraternity . As Lieutenant Tonti was crossing the river , a large number of Indians were seen running in , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow-shot of the shore , he stopped , still presenting the calumet , which all the tribes seemed to recognize and respect . All suspicion was allayed . The savages , unapprehensive of any treachery , crowded their periagua , and the boat and the canoe , with the inmates on terms of the kindest fellowship , passed over to the French on the western bank . The two parties blended as brothers . The Indians were fishermen of the Natches tribe . They had a large village about nine miles inland , east of the river . Without any hesitancy La Salle , Father Membre , and a few others , accepted an invitation to accompany them to their village . There are some men so frank , genial , kind-hearted that they win affection at sight . La Salle was such a man . With no special effort to make friends , his nature was such that the savage and the civilized man alike were immediately won by the fascination of his presence . Father Membre gives frequent testimony to these peculiar attractions of the chivalric pioneer . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wigwams of these savages . They gave us as kindly a welcome as we could desire . The Chevalier La Salle , whose very air , engaging manners , and captivating mind , everywhere commanded respect and love , so impressed the hearts of these Indians that they did not know how to treat us well enough . They would gladly have kept us with them permanently . " For three days La Salle and his companions enjoyed the hospitality of these friendly natives . About thirty miles below the Natches Indians , there was another powerful tribe called the Koroas . They were friends and allies of the Natches . A courier was despatched to inform the chief of the Koroas of the arrival of the distinguished strangers , and to invite him to come and share in giving them a suitable welcome . He hastened to Natches with an imposing retinue of his head men . They also paid prompt homage to the dignity and the attractions of La Salle . Again a cross was erected , while admiring multitudes gazed admiringly upon the religious and civil pomp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cross , upon which was engraved the arms of Louis XIV . The Indians were delighted with the show , and with the memorial thus left of the visit ; though they could not comprehend the significance of the rite as taking possession of their country in the name of the King of France . La Salle and his companions returned to their canoes . The Chickasaw Indian who had accompanied them from their encampment near the mouth of the Ohio , and which they had named Camp Prudhomme , from the man who had been lost and found there , remained at the village of the Natches Indians . The journey of a few days would take him to his own tribe . The chief of the Koroas , having invited La Salle to visit his village , embarked with his suite , in their wooden boats , and descended the river in company with the French in their birch canoes . A sail of about four hours swept them down to the village , which was called Akoroa . It was beautifully situated on an eminence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with large fields of corn , whose spear-like leaves were already waving in the gentle breeze . The Indians were fond of ceremony . They held a council , presented the calumet , smoked the pipe of fraternity , made speeches which were but poorly understood , and exchanged presents . After a short tarry , the voyage was again resumed . The chief furnished them with a pilot , telling them that it would still require a voyage of ten days to reach the sea , and that the river broke into several channels or independent streams as it approached the Gulf . As the Indians considered thirty or forty miles a good day 's voyage in descending the river , it was estimated that there was a journey of between three and four hundred miles still before them . They were also informed that there were numerous tribes upon the lower river , but that they were generally well-disposed . On the 2d of April , when the canoes had descended the river about eighteen miles below Akoroa , the river branched into two arms or channels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and eighty miles in length . They had been directed to take the channel on the left . But it so chanced that there was a heavy river fog , and they did not see it . La Salle 's canoe was in the advance , and the canoe which held the guide happened to be far in the rear . Though the keen eyes of the Indian pierced the fog , and he did all in his power by signs to show them that they were wrong , the whole fleet followed its leader , and were swept along in the channel on the right . The reason why they were cautioned to take the left branch , was that the eight or ten tribes on the western banks were friendly , and would make them no trouble , while those upon the eastern branch were ferocious , and would be likely to attack them . They soon experienced the wisdom of the advice which had been given them . On the 2d of April , when they had descended the river about one hundred and twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river , fishing . The moment the savages caught sight of the fleet of canoes they fled . Immediately the forest seemed filled with the clamor of hideous war-whoops the beating of drums , and all other sounds of hostility . The branch of the river which they were descending , was here compressed into a narrow channel . A dense forest fringed both banks . It was evident that there were populous villages near by , for the warriors were seen rapidly gathering , as they ran from tree to tree to get good positions to overwhelm the canoes with their arrows . The bows were very strong . The muscular arms of the Indians would throw an arrow with almost the velocity and precision of a rifle bullet . These barbed weapons would tear their way through the birch bark of the canoes as if they were but sheets of brown paper . With appalling suddenness this cloud of war was marshalling its forces . It was sufficiently menacing to alarm the bravest heart . La Salle ordered all the boats to stop . He then sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calumet of peace . They received orders not to fire upon the savages under any emergence . As soon as the canoe came within arrow-shot , the savages , regardless of the calumet , let fly a shower of arrows upon them . Fortunately , they nearly all fell a little short , and no one was hit . With the utmost precipitation , the Frenchmen paddled back to their companions . La Salle then sent another canoe , with four Indians , bearing the calumet . They advanced with great caution , and met with the same hostile reception . He then directed the canoes to press as near the opposite bank as possible , to ply their paddles with all energy , and thus hurry by the point of peril . Humanely he ordered not a gun to be fired . He had no wish to engage in a battle in which nothing was to be gained . Very easily his sharp-shooters could cause many of those savage warriors to bite the dust , and thus lamentation and woe would be sent to many of those wigwams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdue the savages ; it would only exasperate them . He also remembered that he was to return , and that if the savages had received no harm at his hands , their spirit of revenge would not be aroused , and it would be much less difficult to establish friendly relations with them . Though the savages yelled , and ran franticly along the shore , and threw their arrows with their utmost strength , the canoes , swept along by the rapid current , and the sinewy strength of the paddles , all passed in safety . The kind-hearted La Salle must have congratulated himself that none were left behind to mourn . He afterwards learned that this inhospitable tribe was called the Quinnipissa . They had paddled down the stream but about six miles , when they came to other and still more deplorable evidences of man 's inhumanity to man . They found upon the banks the smouldering remains of a large village , which had recently been sacked and burned . It was evident that the inhabitants had been given up to indiscriminate massacre , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , or to add to the revelry of a gala day , in the endurance of demoniac torture . The ground was covered with the bodies of men , women , and children , in all the loathsome stages of decay . Sadly the voyagers rambled through these awful scenes for an hour , meeting with no living being , and then hurried on their way . This village , it was subsequently ascertained , was called Tangibao . Still they continued descending the river four days longer , without meeting any incident of importance . Their day 's sail averaged about thirty miles . It was always necessary to land for the night 's encampment . They had made , as they estimated , about one hundred and twenty miles from Quinnipissa when they came to the delta of the Mississippi . Here the majestic river divided into four branches . At this point they landed , and encamped in the midst of a dense and almost tropical forest , upon the bank , but slightly elevated above the surface of the water . In the morning La Salle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these three branches . He took the one on the extreme right , or the western branch . Lieutenant Tonti , with Father Membre , took the middle . The eastern branch , on the left , was assigned to Mr. Dautray . Upon reaching the sea , the canoes on the right and left were to turn toward the centre until they should meet the party of Lieutenant Tonti , whose route to the sea , it was supposed , would be a little shorter than that of either of the other two . They all found the water deep and brackish , and the current very slow . After sailing a few miles they tasted the salt of the ocean . Soon their eyes were gladdened with the sight of the open sea . It was mild , serene , beautiful summer weather . The region , as far as the eye could reach , was low and marshy , with no landmarks . The fleets were , however , all reunited in safety . La Salle having heard the report respecting the middle and eastern channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had descended . They then ascended this branch before they could find any dry and solid ground , suitable to afford a permanent foundation for the cross of Christ and the arms of France . On the ninth of April , they were all assembled on a ridge slightly elevated , for the celebration of this all-important ceremony . First , they raised a massive column , at the foot of which they buried a leaden plate , bearing an inscription in Latin , to the following purport : " Louis the Great Reigns . Robert , Cavalier , with Lord Tonti , Ambassador , Zenobia Membre , Ecclesiastic , and twenty Frenchmen , first navigated this river from the country of the Illinois , and passed through this mouth on the ninth of April , sixteen hundred and eighty-two . " The names of all the Frenchmen of the party were attached to this plate . La Salle then made a speech , which was carefully worded , and seems to have been recorded at that time . It was in substance as follows : " In the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission I hold in my hand , I take possession of this country of Louisiana , its seas , harbors , ports , bays , and adjacent straits ; and also of all the nations , people , provinces , cities , towns , villages , mines , minerals , fisheries , streams , and rivers , comprised in the extent of the said Louisiana , from the mouth of the great river called the Ohio , and this with the consent of the people dwelling therein , with whom we have made alliance ; and also of the rivers which discharge themselves therein , from the sources of the Mississippi to its mouth in the sea ; upon the assurance of all these nations that we are the first Europeans who have descended or ascended the said Mississippi . I hereby protest against all those who may in future undertake to invade any of these countries , to the prejudice of the right of his Majesty , acquired by the consent of all the nations herein named . Of this I take to witness all those who hear me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " To this the whole assembly responded with shouts of Vive le Roi and with a salute of fire-arms . The civic ceremony being thus ended , the transaction was now to be ratified with religious rites . By the side of the column , a massive cross had been erected . The devout La Salle , who was earnestly a religious man , took his position at the foot of the cross , and said : " His Majesty , Louis the Great , the eldest son of the Church , will annex no country to his crown without making it his chief care to establish the Christian religion therein . Its symbol must now be recognized . " Several Christian hymns were then chanted . The sublime strains of the Te Deum resounded through the arches of the forest ; and other ceremonies of the Catholic Church were performed with all the pomp which the circumstances would allow . Thus the great achievement was accomplished . According to the then existing law of nations , the whole valley of the Mississippi was annexed to France . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom of France comprises an extent not quite three hundred thousand square miles . It is judged that the valley of the Mississippi drains a region of one million square miles . Thus the pioneer , La Salle , conferred upon France a territory more than three times as large as the kingdom of France itself . CHAPTER XII . The Return Voyage . The Numerous Alligators . Destitution of Provisions . Encountering Hostile Indians . A Naval Battle . Visit to the Village . Treachery of the Savages . The Attack . Humane Conduct of La Salle . Visit to the Friendly Taensas . Severe Sickness of La Salle . His Long Detention at Prudhomme . The Sick Man 's Camp . Lieutenant Tonti sent Forward . Recovery of La Salle . His Arrival at Fort Miami . There was no game to be taken in the vast swamps at the mouth of the river . The provisions of the voyagers were nearly exhausted . They , however , chanced to find an abandoned Indian camp , where there was a small quantity of strips of the flesh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eagerly eating it , the Indians who accompanied them informed them that it was human flesh . It is needless to say that they could eat no more ; though the savages , who devoured it with much gusto , declared that it was exceedingly delicate and savory . On the 10th of April , the next day after the ceremony of annexation , they commenced their toilsome ascent of the river on their voyage back . Enormous alligators were often met with , sunning themselves on the sand-bars . The sharp-shooters soon learned where the bullet would strike a vulnerable point . For several days they lived mainly on wild potatoes and the flesh of alligators . The country was so low , and so bordered with almost impenetrable canes , that they could not hunt without making long delays . At length they reached the blackened ruins and the mouldering dead of Tangibao . The desolation remained complete . None had returned . It was a matter of the utmost importance , apparently of absolute necessity , that they should lay in a store of corn . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be many days without food , and thus perish . But a pint of corn , pounded into meal and baked in the ashes , would afford a hungry man a very nutritious dinner . And if so successful as to take some game , this bread gave great additional zest to the repast . On the thirteenth day , as they were slowly paddling against the stream , they saw , far away in the north , a great smoke , apparently from Indian fires . It was evidently not far from the region where the Quinnipissa Indians had so fiercely attacked them , but a few days before . Much apprehension was felt lest they should again be assailed . The passage against the rapid current was necessarily very slow . The Indians had large wooden boats , which they could fill with warriors , and being above them on the river , could completely cut off their retreat . La Salle sent one of the canoes forward to reconnoitre . As his Indian boatmen were paddling cautiously along beneath the dense foliage of the banks , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was thought best to capture them , if possible , and hold them as hostages for the good behavior of the tribe . This was not doing evil that good might come , for the measure was fully justifiable , in view of the attack which had been made upon them , and as the only means of preventing the effusion of blood . The men landed , and the swift runners caught the women and took them back to the fleet . It was then learned that the Quinnipissa Indians , a peculiarly warlike and ferocious race , had a large village but a little distance farther up the river . This village it was necessary to pass . There could be no doubt that the savages would fiercely assail them . As they could probably bring many hundred warriors into the conflict , and could make the attack not only from their capacious periaguas , but also from the shelter of the trees on the bank , the situation of the French seemed quite desperate . La Salle , in this emergence , drew his canoes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite bank . He hoped , by the aid of his captives , to open some communication with the foe . But the Indians had already learned of his approach . Again the hideous clamor of demoniac war was heard , as the noise of their rude drums and savage yells fell upon the ear . It was early in the afternoon of a day of almost tropical warmth and serenity , when all the voices of nature seemed to invite man to love and help his brother . Soon quite a fleet of massive boats was seen , descending the river , each boat crowded with twenty or thirty warriors , plumed and painted , and armed with bows and arrows , javelins , and clubs . They were yelling like demons , as if expecting by noise to rouse their courage to the highest point . La Salle himself , with two or three picked companions , pushed out in a canoe , and advanced to meet them . Though one or two guns were in the bottom of the canoe , to be used in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single canoe advancing to meet a fleet . La Salle stood up and waved the calumet , the sacred emblem of peace and friendship . The savages , thirsty for blood , paid no heed to this appeal . They redoubled their yells , and like a band of desperate villains as they were , shot a volley of arrows toward the one canoe with its three or four unarmed occupants . With new vigor the savages plied their paddles , being now sure of the capture of the strangers . The moment for prompt and decisive action had come . The guns were heavily loaded . One of the boats , larger and more richly ornamented than the rest , contained evidently the head chief . He was a man of herculean frame , dressed in the most gorgeous of barbaric attire . As he stood up in his boat , giving orders , he presented just the target , though at a great distance , to which a sharp-shooter might direct unerring aim . La Salle ordered one of his marksmen to strike him down . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff of smoke , a loud report , and the invisible bullet pierced the heart of the chief . The blood gushed forth in a torrent , and the warrior dropped dead in the bottom of the boat . The warriors were appalled , terrified . Never before had they heard the report of a gun . They knew not what had struck down their chief . No missile had been seen . None could be found . The savages were very superstitious . They thought this must be the work of witchcraft ; that they were attacked by evil spirits , whose power was invincible . They had seen the lightning flash , and the rising , vanishing cloud . They had heard the thunder peal . Their chief had been struck dead by some resistless bolt , at twice the distance to which any arrow could be thrown . It was folly to contend against such a foe . The next instant every one might be stricken down . They were seized with a panic . Instantly , heading the bows of their boats up the river , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companions , conscious that he had secured a truce only . He had still the village to pass ; and the current was so strong that he must pass very slowly . It was probable that the Indians would so far recover from their consternation , that some of the boldest would again assail his boats , from behind sheltering rocks and trees . The frail canoes might easily be pierced by their missiles , and the inmates thrown into the water . The savages would soon become accustomed to the report of the guns . Finding that rocks and trees protected them from the invisible bolt , they would all be emboldened ; and thus a general and prolonged attack , following them up the river , would cause their entire destruction . The utmost wisdom was still requisite , to rescue the party from these perils . La Salle loaded one of the women with rich presents of axes , knives , and beads , and sent her across the river in one of his canoes . By signs he told her to inform her tribe that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be friendly , and bring him in a supply of corn , he would liberate his three other captives , and pay liberally for the corn , in articles which would be of great value to the Indians . The next morning a large number of Indian warriors were seen approaching the encampment , where the Frenchmen had thrown up defences which would enable them to sell their lives dearly , were the savages determined upon their destruction . La Salle , as bold as he was humane , advanced alone to meet them , presenting the calumet . The Indians assumed a friendly attitude , entered into a treaty of peace , and invited La Salle , with his party , to visit their village . They also brought him a considerable store of corn . Though their manner was such as to lead La Salle greatly to doubt their sincerity , he accepted their invitation , first exacting hostages to remain in the camp until his return . He took with him Father Membre , his invariable companion on such occasions . The mild , fearless , heroic missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Indians had prepared us a feast in their fashion . They had notified their allies and neighbors ; so that when we went to enjoy the banquet , in a large square , we saw a confused mass of armed savages arrive , one after another . We were however welcomed by the chiefs ; but , having ground for suspicion , each kept his gun ready , and the Indians , seeing it , durst not attack us . " Toward evening , La Salle and his companion returned to the camp , still apprehensive that the Indians meditated treachery . They released the three women , whom they made very happy , with rich presents . A careful watch was kept through the night . Before the dawn of the next morning the sentinels reported that they heard a noise , as if a multitude of men were stealthily gathering in a dense growth of canes , but a short distance from the encampment . All were instantly summoned to arms . It was a gloomy morning , very dark , with moaning wind and gathering clouds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , behind the intrenchments which had been so prudently raised , when the shrill war-whoop burst from apparently hundreds of savage lips ; and from the impenetrable darkness a shower of arrows came whizzing through the air . They all fell harmless in and around the spot where the men stood , behind their ramparts , with muskets loaded and primed . Though the savages kept up an incessant yell , and threw their arrows almost at random into the narrow enclosure , they were so concealed by the darkness and the thick cane-brake , that not one was to be seen . The French kept perfect silence . Not a loud word was spoken . Not a musket was fired . It was very important that every bullet should accomplish its mission and lay a warrior dead in his blood . The Indians were to be taught that every flash and peal was the sure precursor of the death or the serious wound of one of their number . Soon the day began to dawn . With the increasing light the savages were revealed , as they dodged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guns . Deliberate aim was taken . The savages were very cautious in exposing themselves . The Frenchmen were perfectly protected from their arrows by the rampart of logs . For two hours this strange battle raged  --  twenty Frenchmen against hundreds of savages . Ten Indians were shot dead . Many others were dreadfully wounded with shattered bones . It is probable that every bullet hit its mark . Not an arrow of the savage had drawn blood . As the sun rose , revealing the deadly fire of the guns and the utter impotence of the missiles of the Indians , the savages were again thrown into a panic , and fled precipitately . La Salle , with nearly all his force , pursued them up to the village , where , with axes , he speedily demolished all their boats , so that they could not pursue , as he should continue his voyage . His men urged him to burn the village of his treacherous foes . But he refused , saying that he would inflict no farther injury upon them than was absolutely necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , battle , and blood , another night came , of darkness and rain . Enveloped in the shades of night , the French reembarked . Silently they passed the village . Not a savage " opened his mouth or peeped . " The storm passed away . And when the sun of another lovely morning shone down upon them , the voyagers were far beyond the reach of their cruel foes . Father Membre returned thanks to God that He had borne them , unharmed , through such great peril , and had restrained them from the exercise of any unchristian revenge . It was the morning of the 19th of April . For twelve days they continued breasting the current of the stream , as they laboriously paddled their way upward . Anxious to return to Quebec as soon as possible , with the tidings of their glorious achievement , they made no tarry at the many villages which were scattered along the banks . They often saw assemblages of Indians , who seemed to assume a hostile attitude . No attack was , however , made upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn , and stored away quite a quantity in a cache . They found it , on their return , in good condition , and it furnished them with a very opportune supply . They were surprised to see how rapidly the corn in the fields matured . Fields were passed on the 29th of March , where the tender blades were just sprouting from the ground . And now , in less than four weeks , the corn was fit to roast . They were told that , in fifty days from planting , it often ripened . A short tarry was made at the friendly village of the Taensa Indians , where they were again very hospitably entertained . On the 1st of May they resumed their slow and laborious voyage , and reached the Arkansas Indians about the 15th of the month . On the 16th La Salle took two light canoes , propelled by sturdy Indian rowers , and pushed on in advance of the rest of the party . He gave directions for the other canoes to follow as fast as they could . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birch canoe , in which one is exposed to the rays of the noonday sun , to the chill dews of morning and evening , to drenching showers and dreary days of clouds and rain , presents but few comforts to a man in sickness and suffering . He , however , succeeded , after a toilsome voyage of about ten days , in reaching his old encampment , which he had named Prudhomme , near the mouth of the Ohio River . Here his malady grew so alarming that he could go no farther . His party landed , drew their canoes up upon the grass of the prairie , repaired their camp , so as to make it an effectual protection from sun and rain , spread mats upon the ground , and made the sick man , who they feared was soon to die , as comfortable as possible . In such cases a camp was generally built in the form of a shed , with the front entirely open . This camp was on the eastern side of the river , facing the majestic stream and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , no medicine , no tender nursing , no delicate food to tempt a failing appetite . He could only lie patiently upon his mat , and await the progress of the disease , whether it were for life or for death . The silence and solitude of the river , the prairie , and the forest surrounded him . Strange must have been his reflections in those solemn hours , when he was anticipating the speedy approach of death , upon the banks of that wonderful stream which his enterprise had caused to be explored from its sources to its mouth . As in languor and suffering he reclined upon his couch , all the beauty and bloom of May , in a delightful clime , were spread around him . The silent flood swept by , rushing down a distance of countless leagues in the north , until , after a serpentine course of more than a thousand miles , through the most wonderful scenes of nature , and fringed with the villages of innumerable savage tribes , it was lost in the great Mexican gulf . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other . They brought in game , and were continually cooking and eating at the fire , which was kept in a constant blaze in front of the camp . Two days and nights were thus passed , when , on the 2d of June , the remaining canoes of the fleet were seen in the distance , approaching the encampment . They soon landed ; and the whole party , over fifty in number , presented to the eye a new scene of bustle and activity . La Salle was sinking , in the ever-increasing languor of something like typhoid fever . It was manifest that many days must elapse before he could leave that spot , and it was probable , in his own judgment as well as in that of all his companions , that he would there sink into that last sleep from which there is no earthly waking . In these trying hours , his serenity and trust in God did not forsake him . He called Lieutenant Tonti to the side of his couch , and directed him to take several canoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , as vigorously as possible , up the river three hundred miles to the mouth of the Illinois River . Then , ascending that , and its upper branch , the Kaskaskias , he was to cross by the portage to a tributary of the St. Joseph 's , and paddle down those streams to Fort Miami , where the St. Joseph empties into Lake Michigan . Thence by the lake he was to make his way to Mackinac . This required a journey of over a thousand miles . M. Tonti was furnished with documents addressed to Count Frontenac , Governor of Canada , giving a detailed account of the explorations and discoveries which La Salle had so successfully accomplished . Father Membre , with several others of the party , remained with the sick man . For more than a month the burning fever raged , and La Salle was brought to the verge of the grave . The fever then left him . For some time it was doubtful whether there was sufficient strength remaining for him to recover . Slowly he gained . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mats , in the bottom of a canoe , and , by short stages , resumed their voyage . They left Fort Prudhomme , and , following the same track which Tonti had pursued , did not reach Fort Miami , at the mouth of the St. Joseph 's River , until the end of September . But July and August were months of delightful weather . The scenery , rich with forest grandeur and prairie flowers , was varied and enchanting . Game was abundant . Ripe fruit hung on many boughs . Hospitable villages were scattered along the way , where the general voyagers were invariably received with kindness truly fraternal . The motion of the canoe , as the Indians , with brawny arms , paddled over the mirrored surface of the stream , was soothing and grateful to the languid , yet convalescent patient . In the cool of the beautiful mornings they could glide along the stream for a few leagues , then shelter themselves in some shady grove from the rays of the noonday sun , and in the cool of the serene evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek their night 's encampment . Thus pleasantly journeying , La Salle rapidly regained strength ; and when he reached Fort Miami he was restored to almost his customary vigor . He found the habitation called Fort Miami quite renovated by Lieutenant Tonti , and a few men left in garrison to receive him upon his arrival . Quite a cluster of Indian wigwams had also been reared there , giving a very animated and cheerful aspect to the spot . Father Membre , in describing the scenery through which they passed , in this ascent of the Mississippi and the Illinois , writes : " The banks of the Mississippi , for twenty or thirty leagues from its mouth , are covered with a dense growth of canes , except in fifteen or twenty places where there are very pretty hills and spacious , convenient landing-places . Behind this fringe of marshy land you see the finest country in the world . " Our hunters , both French and Indian , were delighted with it . For an extent of six hundred miles in length , and as much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent land , diversified with pleasing hills , lofty woods , groves through which you might ride on horseback , so clear and unobstructed are the paths . " These little forests also line the rivers which intersect the country in various places , and which abound in fish . The crocodiles are dangerous here ; so much so , that , in some places , no one would venture to expose himself , or even to put his hand out of his canoe . The Indians told us that these animals often dragged in their people , where they could anywhere get hold of them . " The fields are full of all kinds of game , wild cattle , does , deer , stags , bears , turkeys , partridges , parrots , quails , woodcock , wild pigeons , and ringdoves . There are also beaver , otters , and martens . The cattle of this country surpass ours in size . Their head is monstrous , and their look is frightful , on account of the long , black hair with which it is surrounded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and scarce inferior to wool . The Indians wear their skins , which they dress very neatly . They assured us that , inland , toward the west , there are animals on which men ride , and which carry very heavy loads . They described them as horses , and showed two feet , which were actually hoofs of horses . " We observed wood fit for every use . There were the most beautiful cedars in the world . There was one kind of tree which shed an abundance of gum , as pleasant to burn as the best French pastilles . We also saw fine hemlocks , and other large trees with white bark . The cotton-wood trees were very large . Of these , the Indians dug out canoes forty or fifty feet long . Sometimes there were fleets of a hundred and fifty at their villages . We saw every kind of tree fit for ship-building . There is also plenty of hemp for cordage , and tar could be made in abundance . " Prairies are seen everywhere . Sometimes they are fifty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many leagues in depth . They are very rich and fertile , without a stone or a tree to obstruct the plough . These prairies are capable of sustaining an immense population . Beans grow wild , and the stalks last several years , bearing fruit . The bean vines are thicker than a man 's arm , and run to the top of the highest trees . Peach trees are abundant , and bear fruit equal to the best which can be found in France . They are often so loaded , in the gardens of the Indians , that they have to prop up the branches . There are whole forests of mulberries , whose ripened fruit we began to eat in the month of May . Plums are found in great variety , many of which are not known in Europe . Grapevines and pomegranates are common . Three or four crops of corn can be raised in a year . " The Indian tribes , though savage , seem generally amiable , affable , and obliging . They have no true idea of religion by a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speak a different language . And yet they manage to understand each other . There is always some interpreter of one nation residing in another , when they are allies , and who acts as a kind of consul . They are very different from our Canada Indians , in their houses , dress , manners , inclinations , and customs . They have large public squares , games , assemblies . They seem mirthful and full of vivacity . Their chiefs have absolute authority . No one would dare to pass between the chief and the cane torch which burns in his cabin , and is carried before him when he goes out . All make a circuit around it with some ceremony . " The chiefs have servants and officers , who follow them and wait upon them everywhere . The chiefs distribute their favors at will . In a word , we generally found them to be men . We saw none who knew the use of fire-arms . They had no iron or steel articles , using only stone knives and hatchets . " This wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the part of the voyagers . Not one was even wounded . Father Membre attributes this , next to God 's goodness , to the tact and wisdom manifested by La Salle . As to the missionary fruits of this enterprise , the devoted ecclesiastic writes : " I will say nothing here of conversions . Formerly the apostles had but to enter a country , when on the first publication of the Gospel , conversions were seen . I am but a miserable sinner , infinitely destitute of the merits of the apostles . We must acknowledge that these miraculous ways of grace are not attached to the exercise of our ministry . God employs an ordinary and common way , following which , I contented myself with announcing , as well as I could , the principal truths of Christianity to the nations I met . The Illinois language served me for about three hundred miles down the river . I made the rest understand by gestures , and some term in their dialect which I insensibly picked up . But I can not say that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , perhaps some one , by a secret effect of grace , has profited , God only knows . All we have done has been to see the state of these tribes , and to open the way to the Gospel , and to missionaries . " CHAPTER XIII . Sea Voyage to the Gulf of Mexico . La Salle returns to Quebec .

Adventures in the Caribbean Sea . They Enter the Gulf . Storms and Calms . The Voyagers Lost . Father Membre 's journal abruptly terminates with the arrival of the party at Fort Miami . We have no detailed account of the adventures of La Salle during the next eight or ten months . We learn incidentally , that Father Membre was sent to Quebec , and thence to France , to convey to the court the tidings of the great discovery , and of the annexation of truly imperial realms to the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Membre left Fort Miami for Quebec . Thence he sailed with Governor Frontenac for France , where he arrived before the close of the year . La Salle remained with the Miami and the Illinois Indians , probably retrieving his fallen fortunes by extensive traffic in furs , of which he had , at the time , a monopoly conferred upon him by the king . At length , in the autumn of 1683 , he also returned to Quebec , and sailed for France , landing at Rochelle on the 13th of December . No man can , in this world , accomplish great results without exposing himself to malignant attacks . Bitter enemies assailed La Salle with venomous hostility . Their hostility was excited by the monopoly of the fur trade , which he enjoyed over all the vast regions he had explored . They despatched atrocious charges against him to the government , denouncing him as a robber , and denying the discoveries which he professed to have made . But Governor Frontenac and Father Membre were both at Versailles , and La Salle 's cause was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chevalier 's object , in this his return to France , to organize a colony to form a settlement in the earthly paradise which he thought that he had discovered on the banks of the Mississippi . He designed to arrange an expedition of such magnitude as would enable him to establish several permanent settlements , and also to explore more extensively the newly discovered country . The king and the court entered eagerly into plans , which promised to redound greatly to the glory of France . The reputation of La Salle , the grandeur of the undertaking , and a natural curiosity to visit scenes so full of novelty and wonders , induced several gentlemen of distinction and intelligence to embark in the enterprise . Among them was a younger brother of La Salle , with an ecclesiastic called M. Cavalier , and also a nephew . The king conferred a new commission upon La Salle , investing him with the powers almost of viceroyalty . The whole valley of the Mississippi , from Lake Michigan to the Gulf , was called Louisiana , in honor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of this almost limitless region . Seven missionaries accompanied the expedition , under the general supervision of Father Membre , whose virtues and eminent qualification for the station all alike recognized . Four vessels were equipped for the expedition . The first , called the Joli , was a man-of-war armed with thirty-six guns . The second was a frigate called the Belle . The king made a present of this vessel to La Salle . He had furnished it with a very complete outfit , and with an armament of six guns . The third , called the Aimable , was a merchant-ship of about three hundred tons . It was heavily laden with all those implements and goods which it was deemed would be most useful in the establishment of a colony . The fourth was a light , swift-sailing yacht , called the St. Francis , of but thirty tons . This vessel was also laden with munitions , supplies , and goods for traffic with the Indians . The whole number who embarked , including one hundred soldiers and seven or eight families of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care was taken to select good mechanics for the various trades . But , unfortunately , soldiers and seamen were engaged without apparently any reference to character . Thus some of the worst vagabonds of earth were gathered from the seaports of France to colonize the New World . Nothing with the quarrelsome race of man ever goes smoothly for any considerable length of time . Captain Beaujeu , a Norman seaman of great valor and extensive experience , was commander of the man-of-war , and , as such , was intrusted with the general direction and supervision of the vessels . He was a proud man , accustomed to authority , and he regarded La Salle and his party as passengers , whom he was conveying to their destination , and who , while on board his vessels , were to be subservient to his will . On the other hand , La Salle regarded Beaujeu as one of his officers , who was to be implicitly obedient to his directions . The idea never occurred to him that Beaujeu was to be taken into partnership , or consulted even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther than La Salle might deem it expedient to consult him or any other of his subordinates . With views so different , a speedy quarrel was inevitable . Beaujeu is represented as a man full of conceit , of narrow mind , and very irritable . La Salle was reserved , self-reliant , keeping his own counsel . Scarcely had the two men met , before they found themselves in antagonism . Before the vessels sailed , Beaujeu wrote to the king 's minister as follows : " You have ordered me , sir , to afford this enterprise every facility in my power . I shall do so . But permit me to say that I take great credit to myself for consenting to obey the orders of La Salle . I believe him to be a worthy man , but he has never served in war except against savages , and has no military rank . I , on the contrary , have been thirteen years captain of a vessel , and have served thirty years by sea and land . " He tells me that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tonti . This is certainly hard for me to bear . Though I am not now acquainted with the country , I must be a dull scholar not to obtain an adequate knowledge of it in a month after my arrival . I beg you therefore to give me a share in the command , so that no military operation may be undertaken without consulting me . Should we be attacked by the Spaniards , I am persuaded that men who have never commanded in war could not resist them , as another could do , who had been taught by experience . " Three weeks later , he wrote : " The Joli is prepared for sea . I hope to sail down the river to-morrow . It remains for M. La Salle to sail when he is ready . He has said nothing to me of his designs . As he is constantly changing his plans , I know not whether the provisions will be enough for the enterprise . He is so jealous , and so fearful that some one may penetrate his secrets , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already informed you how disagreeable it was for me to be under the orders of M. de la Salle , who has no military rank . I shall however obey him , without repugnance , if you send me orders to that effect . But I beg that they may be such that he can impute no fault to me should he fail to execute what he has undertaken . I am induced to say this because he has intimated that it was my design to thwart his plans . I wish you would inform me what is to be done in regard to the soldiers . He pretends that , on our arrival , they are to be put under his charge . My instructions do not authorize this pretence . I am to afford all the aid in my power , without endangering the safety of the vessels . " The ministry paid no attention to these complaints . They probably decided to leave the commanders to settle such questions among themselves . The four vessels sailed from Rochelle on the 24th of July , 1684 . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent tempest overtook them . The Joli lost her bowsprit . Consequently the little squadron returned to Rochefort . Having repaired damages , the fleet again set sail , on the 1st of August . La Salle and his suite , if we may so speak of his chosen companions , were on board the Joli , which Captain Beaujeu commanded . On the 8th of August the fleet passed Cape Finisterre , the extreme northwestern point of Spain . On the 20th they reached the island of Madeira . Captain Beaujeu wished to land here , to take in a fresh supply of provisions . La Salle said , emphatically , " No ! " " We have , " he said , " an ample supply of both food and water . To anchor there will cause us a delay of six or eight days . It will reveal our enterprise to the Spaniards . It was not the intention of the king that we should touch at that point . " Beaujeu was compelled to submit . But he was very angry and sullen . His sub-officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they were anticipating grand carousals in port . Sharp words were interchanged , and the quarrel became more bitter . On the 24th they reached the influence of the trade winds , which blow continually from east to west . On the 6th of September they reached the Tropic of Cancer . In crossing this line a custom had long prevailed of performing a rite called baptism upon all on shipboard who then crossed for the first time . The indignity was inflicted upon all alike , without any regard to character or rank . But , by giving the sailors a rich treat , one could secure for himself a little more moderation in the performance of the revolting ceremony . A very stout sailor , generally the most gigantic man of the crew , grotesquely dressed to represent Father Neptune , would come up over the bows of the vessel and seize his victim . First he would catechize him very closely respecting his object in crossing the line ; then he would exact an oath that he would never permit any one , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to baptism . Then he would dash several bucketsful of salt water upon his head . This was the mildest form of performing the rite . If the subject for the baptism were , for any reason , obnoxious to the sailors , his treatment was much more severe . He was greased and tarred and shampooed , and shaved with an iron hoop , and treated , in all respects , very roughly . On board this fleet , the passengers , including one hundred well-armed soldiers , greatly exceeded the number of sailors . La Salle , learning that the sailors were making great preparations for this baptism , resolved that he would not submit to such an indignity , and that his companions and followers should not be subjected to it . He therefore issued orders prohibiting the ceremony . This exasperated the sailors . Beaujeu openly advocated their cause . The seamen were compelled to submit . The antagonism between the two commanders was embittered . On the 11th of September they reached the latitude of St. Domingo . A dead calm soon ensued . The ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers died . After imposing religious rites , his body was consigned to its ocean sepulchre . The calm was succeeded by a storm . In the darkness and tumult of this tropical tempest the vessels lost sight of each other . Gradually the storm abated . The change of climate had caused much sickness . Fifty were in hospital on board the Joli , including La Salle and both of the surgeons . On the 20th , the grand mountains of St. Helena hove in sight , and the majestic bay of Samana opened before them . It still required a sail of five days before they reached the Port de Paix , on the northwestern extremity of the island . Here there was a very fine harbor , and here the French governor of the neighboring isle of Tortue had his residence . La Salle had letters to this governor , M. de Cussy , directing him to supply the fleet with everything it might need , and which it was in his power to give . For some unexplained reason Beaujeu silently declined obeying these orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paix , and doubling Cape St. Nicholas , a hundred miles distant at the western extremity of the island , circled around to the southern shore , and on the 27th cast anchor in a small harbor called the Petit Guave . The voyage thus far , from Rochelle , had occupied fifty-eight days . This unaccountable change of place for the rendezvous of the scattered vessels caused much embarrassment . We do not know what were the remonstrances of La Salle , or what was the defence of Beaujeu . The Joli had scarcely cast anchor in this remote and silent bay , when a large sail-boat , containing twenty men , who had caught sight of the ship , entered the port , and informed La Salle that not only Governor Cussy was at the Port de Paix , but also the Marquis of Laurent , who was governor-general of all the French West India Islands . This greatly increased the chagrin of La Salle for an interview with them would have greatly facilitated his operations . Religious ceremonies were , in a remarkable degree , blended with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor , all the ship 's company was assembled for divine worship , to return thanks to God for their prosperous voyage . La Salle , being convalescent , went ashore with a boat 's crew to obtain some refreshments , and to send intelligence across the island , to the governor , of his arrival at Port de Paix . In this message he expressed intense regret that he had not been able to stop at Port de Paix , and entreated the governor , if it were in his power , to visit his ship at Guave . In consequence of the number of sick on board , they were all landed , shelters were reared for them , and they were refreshed with fresh vegetables , fruit , and exercise in the open air . La Salle was still very feeble . A slow fever was consuming him . The conduct of Beaujeu caused him the greatest embarrassment . We should infer from the narrative of M. Joutel that there was no European settlement at the spot , and but very few native inhabitants , though all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessels which had been separated from the Joli by the storm , entered the bay , having probably learned from the natives , as they coasted along the shore , where the ship was . The whole of the eastern portion of the island was then held by Spain . As the three vessels were sailing along , two large boats , filled with armed Spaniards , pushed out from the shore and seized the smallest of the vessels  --  the St. Francis  --  and carried it off as a prize , with all its crew . This was a very heavy loss , as it deprived the expedition of supplies of which it stood greatly in need . The chagrin of La Salle was increased by the reflection that had Beaujeu obeyed orders and entered Port de Paix , the fleet would have rendezvoused there in perfect safety . The governor very loudly expressed his indignation , in view of the conduct of Captain Beaujeu . The state of mind of the captain may be inferred from the following extracts from a letter to the French minister , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickness of Chevalier La Salle , I should have no occasion to write to you , as I am charged only with the navigation and he with the secret . We have arrived here almost all sick . La Salle has been attacked by a violent fever , which affects not more his body than his mind . His brother requested me to take charge of his affairs . I excused myself because I know that when restored to health he would not approve of what I had done . " It is said that the Spaniards have , in these seas , six men-of-war , each carrying sixty guns . It is true that if the Chevalier de la Salle should not recover , I shall pursue different measures from those which he has adopted , which I do not approve . I can not comprehend how a man should dream of settling a country surrounded by Spaniards and Indians , with a company of workmen and women , without soldiers . " If you will permit me to express my opinion , the Chevalier de la Salle should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without attempting to conduct three vessels and troops across the ocean through seas utterly unknown to him . He is a man of great learning , who has read much , and has some knowledge of navigation . But there is a great difference between theory and practice . The ability to transport canoes through lakes and rivers is very different from that which is required to conduct vessels and troops over remote seas . " After a short delay in this lonely harbor , the fleet , now consisting of but three vessels , again spread its sails . It was agreed to direct their course to Cape St. Antoine , about nine hundred miles distant , at the extreme western point of the island of Cuba . Should the vessels be separated by a storm , they were to rendevous at that place . As the Aimable , a heavily laden merchantman , was the slowest sailer , it was decided that she should take the lead , the other two following . La Salle , with his brother , Father Membre , and some others , transferred their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also probably influenced by La Salle 's desire to escape from the uncongenial companionship of Captain Beaujeu . It was on the 25th of November , 1684 , that the voyage was resumed . Two days ' sail brought the fleet within sight of the magnificent island of Cuba . They ran along its southern shore , generally in sight of its towering mountains and its luxuriant foliage , but having the enchanting scenery occasionally veiled from their view by dense fogs . On the 1st of December they caught sight , far away in the south , of the grand island of Cayman . On the 4th of December , they cast anchor in a sheltered bay of the beautiful Island of Pines , but a few miles south of the Cuban coast . La Salle , with his companions , took a boat and went on shore . Several of the ship 's crew rowed the boat . As they approached the sandy beach , they saw an immense crocodile , apparently asleep , enjoying the blaze of a tropical sun . The boatmen drew near as noiselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . Fortunately the bullet struck a vulnerable point . The monster , after a few convulsive struggles , was dead . The sailors , eager for a taste of fresh meat , kindled a fire and roasted the flesh , which they found tender and palatable . There were no inhabitants at that point . The party separated in small groups , and wandered in all directions , lured by the beauty of the region , and feasting upon the rich tropical fruits which grew in spontaneous abundance . When about to reembark , two of the sailors were missing . Several guns were fired as signals for the lost men , but in vain . The boat returned to the ship . The next morning , at sunrise , a boat 's crew of thirty men was sent to search for the wanderers . At length they were found , thoroughly frightened , having passed a very uncomfortable night . The beauty of this island charmed all who beheld it . They were lavish in their praises of its luxuriance , its fruits , its game , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on the 11th , reached Cape Corrientes , one of the most prominent southwestern points of Cuba . Here again they ran into a solitary bay , which , in clustering fruits and vine-draped bowers , and birds on the wing , presented an aspect of almost Eden loveliness . They tarried but a day . Then , taking advantage of a breeze fresh and fair , they passed from the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico They had proceeded but about fifteen miles when the wind changed , and became adverse . For two days , by beating , they worked their way slowly against it . Captain Beaujeu took a boat , and came on board the Aimable , and insisted that the vessels should put back to Cape Antoine , and ride at anchor there until the wind should prove favorable . La Salle could not consider this measure judicious . But , weary of contention and anxious to agree with Beaujeu whenever he could , he reluctantly gave his consent . They ran back to the land , cast anchor , remained two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose , which was almost a tornado . The Belle dragged her anchor , and was driven violently against the Aimable , carrying away her bowsprit , and greatly injuring much of her rigging . The Aimable would have been sunk had she not cut her cable and escaped . The anchor was lost . On the 18th , the wind became fair . Having repaired damages as far as was in their power , the fleet again set sail . It was ten o'clock in the morning of a very delightful day . Directing their course northwesterly , they sailed , with a gentle breeze and occasional calms , nine days ' without seeing land or encountering any event of importance . On the 28th , land was discovered . It was but a few miles distant . It was evidently the continent of North America , and consisted of a long reach of low land , fringed with a dense forest , and elevated but a few feet above the level of the Gulf . A shallop was speedily equipped , and La Salle , with a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-armed , repaired to the shore to reconnoitre . Another boat , also similarly equipped , was ordered soon to follow . The Belle was directed to keep up careful soundings , and to range along the coast as near the shore as was safe . La Salle 's party soon reached the shore , and landed upon a very beautiful meadow . But they had no time for exploration . The freshening wind rolled in such a surf that there was great danger that their boat would be swamped . They were compelled hastily to reembark , and return to the ship . Slowly the vessels coasted along the uninviting shore , looking in vain for any inlet or any river 's mouth . On the 2d of January , 1685 , a dense fog settled down over the sea and the land , so enveloping the ships that no object could be seen at the distance of a few yards . La Salle ordered cannon occasionally to be fired on board the Aimable , to let the other two vessels know where he was . As there was scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet should be scattered . When the fog the next day was dissipated , the Joli was not in sight . Toward evening , however , the ship was again seen . In a few days they discovered an inlet , which La Salle carefully examined from the mast-head . He judged it to be the Bay of Appalachicola , then called Espiritu Santo , on the Florida coast . They therefore pressed on westerly , hoping soon to reach the Mississippi . To make it sure that he should not pass the mouth of the river , which , flowing through very low and marshy soil , was designated by no landmark , La Salle desired to send a party of thirty men ashore to follow along the coast . But the wind rose , and the surf dashed so violently upon the muddy banks , that a landing could not be effected . Slowly the fleet moved along until the 13th , when it was found necessary to land to take in water . A shallop was sent ashore , with five or six seamen , well-armed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any protection , and the surf still rolled in heavily . Though the dense forest spread its gloom far and wide around , there opened before them a small meadow of but a few acres , green , treeless and smooth as a floor . The boat was directed toward that spot . When within a gun-shot of the land , a troop of about a dozen savages , tall , stalwart men , entirely naked , emerged from the forest , and came down to the water 's edge . The surf was so high that there was much danger that the boat would be swamped in an attempt to land . The seamen therefore cast anchor , to consider what was to be done . When the savages saw that they were at a standstill , they made friendly signs , inviting the strangers to land . They waded out into the surf and beckoned to them . Apparently the boat could not pass safely through the surf . There was a large amount of drift-wood lining the shore . Several of the savages selected a large smooth log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each side , they clung to the log with one arm , while , with the other , they paddled . Without any hesitancy , unarmed and helpless , they clambered into the boat . When five were in , the seamen motioned to the others to go to another boat which was then approaching , and which conveyed La Salle . The savages seemed not to entertain the slightest suspicion of danger . La Salle was very glad to receive them . He hoped that they could give him some information respecting the river he sought . But all his efforts were in vain . Though he spoke several Indian languages , he could not make them understand him . They were all taken on board the vessel . With much curiosity they examined its wonders . They were feasted , and seemed quite at home in smoking the pipe of fragrant tobacco . The sheep , the swine , and the poultry , they had evidently never seen before . But when they were shown the skin of a cow , which had recently been killed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such animals before , doubtless referring to the buffaloes . Having received many presents , a boat was sent to carry them as near the shore as it was safe to go . The savages bound their presents upon their heads , and letting themselves gently down into the water , swam to the land . Marvellous must have been the stories which they narrated that night , in their wigwams , to admiring crowds . Quite a large group of Indians was seen gathered upon the shore to greet them , as they came back . La Salle had found it impossible to understand their signs . But his apprehensions were somewhat excited by the thought that they might have endeavored to indicate to him that he had already passed the mouth of the Mississippi . That evening the wind rose fresh and fair . Raising their anchors , and keeping near the shore , with frequent soundings , they pressed on toward the southwest . The next day came a dead calm . Each vessel floated on the glassy sea , " like a painted ship on a painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , encountering calms , when not a ripple was to be seen on the mirrored expanse , and fresh breezes , which tossed the ocean in billowy foam , and storms which threatened to tear the masts from the hulls . On the 14th of January they attempted again to effect a landing in the boats . But the surf prevented . They saw , however , upon a beautiful prairie , extending with its waving grass and gorgeous flowers as far as the eye could reach , vast herds of wild horses and buffaloes . All on board the vessels were greatly excited by this spectacle . They were eager to land , that they might enjoy the pleasure of an encampment and the excitement of hunting and the chase . The land was now found trending more and more to the south . They had reached a latitude considerably below that of the mouth of the Mississippi , as ascertained by La Salle , upon his first visit . The whole aspect of the country seemed changed . There were immense treeless prairies continually opening before them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses and buffaloes . At length they came to apparently the mouth of a small river . A boat was sent on shore , with orders to kindle a fire , as a signal , should they find a good place for landing . La Salle stood upon the deck of the Aimable , eagerly watching . Soon he saw the smoke curling up through the clear air of the prairie . Just as La Salle was entering his boat for the shore , the wind freshened and tumbled in such billows from the open sea that the boat , which had already landed , was compelled precipitately to return . The next morning the wind abated La Salle felt himself lost . He resolved to land , with a strong party , and make a thorough exploration of the region , that he might , by observation or by communication with such inhabitants as he might discover , find out where he was . He had many apprehensions that he had passed the mouth of the Mississippi , and that he was far in the west , skirting the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Treachery of Beaujeu . Accumulating Troubles .

The Indians Solicit Friendship . The Cruel Repulse . Sickness and Sorrow . Exploring Expeditions . The Mississippi sought for in vain . The altercation between La Salle and Beaujeu still continued . The chevalier feared that the captain designed to abandon him and return to France . Parties were formed , and the dispute on board the vessels was bitter . La Salle was convinced that he had passed the Mississippi . Others argued that they had not reached it . In fact they were beyond Matagorda Bay , in the southwestern part of Texas , and were within a hundred miles of the Rio Grande . A dense fog prevented the landing of the boat 's crew . La Salle insisting upon a return , the vessels coasted slowly along , a distance of about thirty miles , till they came to an inlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which proved to be Matagorda Bay . The expedition was now in serious trouble . Their provisions were nearly exhausted . They had thus far seen no settlement , on the American coast , from which they could obtain supplies . A large party was landed on the western entrance of the bay . They threw up a camp , and while some explored the prairie with their guns , others followed up the stream with their fishing rods . An ample supply of game , of great variety , was taken , and also an abundance of fish . All who could be spared from the ships hastened to the shore . The weather was delightful ; the scenery enchanting ; and the whole ship 's company , after so long an imprisonment in the crowded vessels , revelled in feasting and joy . " Uneasy lies the head which wears a crown . " La Salle , feeling keenly his responsibility for the success of the expedition , was heavily oppressed by care . One of the boats was sent up the bay , seven or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their search was in vain . A few springs of tolerably good water were found , from which they replenished their empty barrels . Ducks and other water-fowl were met in great abundance . The vessels were all anchored in the bay , near the shore , and for several days , in this sunny region , beneath cloudless skies , the voyagers generally enjoyed all the pleasures of the most delightful picnic party . La Salle saw increasing evidence that Beaujeu was intending to desert him . He was anxious to lay in supplies for a long voyage . La Salle wished to delay only to obtain provisions for fifteen days . He was satisfied that it would not take longer than that to return to the point where he now believed the mouth of the Mississippi to be . In this emergence he decided to have the vessels coast along near the shore , while he sent a chosen party of one hundred and thirty men , to march along upon the land . The adventurous band commenced its journey in a fog so dense that those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joutel , the historian of the expedition from the time it sailed from France until its close , led this party . The march was commenced on the 5th of February . Each man carried his pack upon his own shoulders . They kept along as near as possible to the sea . The first night they encamped on a slight eminence , where a large fire was built to signalize to the vessels their position . For a week they thus journeyed along , through marsh and prairie and forest , building each night their signal fires . During all this time they caught no sight of their vessels . On the 13th they came to the banks of a wide creek or bayou , which they had no means of crossing . The carpenters were immediately set to work in building a boat . The next day , while thus employed , the Joli and the Belle hove in sight . The short twilight of the tropics was then passing into night . A signal-fire was built , and seen by those on the ships . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companions , appeared . La Salle landed and visited the encampment . Having sounded the creek , he decided to bring the three vessels in , and to send a boat to explore inland , hoping that the creek might prove to be the mouth of some river . The channel was carefully staked out for the entrance of the vessels , safe anchorage chosen , and orders were issued for the three to enter at the next high tide . La Salle would give the signal from the shore , when they were to move . Captain Beaujeu sent back the insolent answer , " I can manage my own vessel without any instructions from Monsieur La Salle . " As this message arrived , a party of the ship 's company , who had been at some distance from the camp , came running in , much alarmed , saying that quite an army of savages was approaching . La Salle instantly called all his force to arms , that he might be prepared for any emergence . Though earnestly desirous of peace , he yet deemed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array , with muskets loaded , and the beating of drums , he led his band of about one hundred and fifty men , to meet the Indians . Both parties halted and faced each other , neither knowing whether the other wished for peace or war . La Salle directed ten of his men to lay down their arms , and advance toward the Indians , making friendly signs , and endeavoring to invite an unarmed party to meet them . The whole body at once threw down their arms , consisting of bows and javelins , and ran forward joyously , caressing the Europeans , according to their custom , by rubbing their hands first over their own breasts and arms , and then over the breasts and arms of their newly found friends . Six or seven accompanied a party of the French back to their encampment . La Salle , with the rest , accepted an invitation to visit the Indian village , which they represented as distant about five miles . Just as they were starting , La Salle turned his eyes toward the bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their store-ship the Aimable , which was left under the care of Captain Beaujeu , instead of following the channel marked out by the stakes , was paying no regard to them . He was greatly alarmed ; but there was nothing which he could do to repel the danger . He therefore , though in great perturbation , followed the savages to their village . It consisted of about fifty wigwams , erected upon an eminence but slightly elevated above the level prairie . The huts were built of mats or of the tanned skins of the buffalo . Just as they were entering the village , a cannon was fired from one of the ships . The savages were greatly terrified , and simultaneously threw themselves upon the ground , burying their faces in the grass . But La Salle reassured them , stating that it was merely a signal to him that one of his ships had come to anchor . Though La Salle was very vigilant to guard against any treachery , still the hospitality manifested by the Indians seemed sincere and cordial . The Indians feasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of thin slices of flesh dried in the sun and smoked . Their village was near the creek , and La Salle counted forty large boats , made of logs hollowed out , such as he had seen on the Mississippi . Upon returning to the camp , La Salle found his worst fears realized . The Aimable was driven aground , and under circumstances which rendered it almost certain that it had been done through the treachery of Captain Beaujeu . La Salle had marked out the channel by stakes , had sent the vessel a pilot , whom Beaujeu had refused to receive , and had stationed a man at the mast-head , who had given a loud warning , but whose cry was entirely disregarded . " Those who witnessed the manoeuvre , " writes Joutel , " were convinced , by irresistible evidence , that the vessel was wrecked by design , which was one of the blackest and most detestable crimes which can enter into the human heart . " The vessel was run upon the shore at the highest tide . All efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Aimable contained all the ammunition , the mechanic tools , and the farming and household utensils . But La Salle , ever rising superior to the blows of misfortune , still retained his firmness . Diligently he engaged in removing the stores from the wrecked ship . One of the shallops had been , as it was believed , treacherously destroyed . With the one shallop which remained , he succeeded , that afternoon , in removing from the ship to an encampment on the shore , the ammunition , a considerable portion of the mechanic tools , the farming and domestic utensils , and a few barrels of provisions . During the night a storm arose . The vessel was dashed to pieces . In the morning the bay was covered with barrels , chests , bales , and other debris of the wreck . While affairs were in this deplorable state , the savages , about one hundred and twenty in number , made another visit to the camp . The shores were strewed with articles of inestimable value to these poor Indians . Sentinels were stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to perpetrate any acts of violence . La Salle was in great want of more boats . The Indians had some , which were dug out from immense trunks of trees , of graceful form and rich carving , capable of carrying twenty or thirty men . As all the work on these boats had been performed with stone hatchets , almost an infinity of labor had been expended upon them , and they were deemed very valuable . La Salle sent two trusty men to the village of the Indians , to purchase , if they could , two of the boats . When they entered the wigwams , they found that a bale of blankets , which had drifted along the bay , had been picked up by the Indians , and divided among them . They made no attempt at concealment . Not having any clear views of the rights of property , they had no thought that they had done anything wrong in taking goods which they had found drifting in the water . The officers returned to La Salle with this report . Suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economize , as much as possible , in his expenditures . He therefore decided to send some men to the Indians , to endeavor to obtain two boats in exchange for the blankets and a few other articles which they had picked up . M. Hamel , one of Beaujeu 's officers , volunteered to go on this mission , with a boat 's crew , in the shallop of the Joli . He was an impetuous young fellow , with more bravery than prudence . Assuming that the Indians had stolen the blankets , and that they were to be browbeaten and forced to make restitution by the surrender of two of their boats , he advanced , upon his landing , in such menacing military array as to frighten the Indians . Most of them fled into the woods . He entered the deserted cabins , picked up all the blankets he could find , stole a number of very nicely tanned deer skins , and then , seizing two of the best boats , put men on board of each , and commenced his return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it a heroic achievement . As they were paddling slowly down the bay , the wind rose strongly against them . Night came on cold and dark . It became necessary to land and wait for the morning . They built a large fire . Wrapped in blankets , they threw themselves upon the grass around , with their feet toward the glowing coals , and soon all fell asleep . Sentinels had been stationed at a short distance from the fire , but they slept also . The Indians returned to their wigwams . They found their treasures gone and two of their best boats stolen . As night came , they saw in the distance the light of a camp fire , and understood full well what it signified . With silent tread , and breathing vengeance , they crept through the forest upon their sleeping foes . At a given signal , the forest resounded with the dreadful war-whoop , and a shower of arrows fell upon the sleepers . Two were killed outright ; two were severely wounded . The rest sprung to their arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrible power of the white man 's musket , did not wait for a battle . Having inflicted this deed of revenge , they suddenly disappeared . One of the men , M. Moranget , a nephew of La Salle , succeeded in reaching the encampment of his friends , though faint and bleeding . One arrow had inflicted a terrible wound , almost cutting its way through his shoulder . Another had cut a deep gash along his bosom . La Salle immediately sent an armed party to the spot . He was exceedingly chagrined by the cruel blunder perpetrated by his envoy . Though he could not blame the Indians , he knew full well that , their vengeance being thus aroused , they would , if they could , doom all to indiscriminate slaughter . It was necessary for him therefore to take the most decisive action in self-defence . The dead were buried . One man , helplessly wounded , was brought back to the camp . The others returned unharmed . This disaster took place in the night of the 5th of March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaujeu took advantage of them , and lost no opportunity of proclaiming them as evidence that La Salle was utterly incompetent to conduct such an enterprise as that in which he was engaged . Quite a number , who had formerly been friends of La Salle , ranged themselves on the side of Beaujeu , who now openly proclaimed his intention of abandoning the enterprise and returning to France . Still he continued to do everything in his power to embarrass the operations of La Salle . There were several pieces of cannon on board the Belle . But nearly all the cannon balls were in the hold of the Joli . Beaujeu , on the eve of his departure , refused to give them up , saying that it was inconvenient for him to get at them . About the 14th of March , Captain Beaujeu spread the sails of the Joli , and disappeared over the horizon of the sea , on his voyage to France . He took with him sixty or seventy of the company , and many stores which were deemed essential in the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred men , encamped upon the banks of an unknown inlet , and with one single small vessel , the Belle , anchored in the bay . To add to the gloom of his situation , the Indians were justly exasperated against him . The first thing to be done was to build a fort for defence . Thinking it not impossible that the broad creek he had entered might prove to be one of the mouths of the Mississippi , he decided to set out on an exploring tour up the river for some distance into the interior . Five boats , containing a well-armed party of about fifty persons , embarked upon this enterprise . La Salle himself took the command . About one hundred and forty persons were left behind in the fort , under the control of M. Joutel . Those who were left in garrison , were to employ their time in strengthening the fort , and in building a large boat on the European plan . The savages came frequently around the encampment at night , barking like dogs and howling like wolves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , a few men were at work at a little distance from the encampment , when they saw a large band of savages approaching . The workmen fled to the fort , leaving all their tools behind them . The savages gathered them up and retired . It was not safe to wander far for game . But fish was taken in great abundance from the bay . Early in April , the garrison was alarmed by the sight of a distant sail . It was feared that it was a war-ship of the hostile Spaniards , coming to destroy them . The vessel , however , passed by , without apparently seeing the encampment . Several tragic incidents ensued . One man was bitten by a rattlesnake . After suffering dreadful agonies he died . Another , who was fishing , was swept away by the current and was drowned . Fortunately , beds of excellent salt were found , formed by the evaporation of salt water in basins on the land . It must be confessed that the savages manifested much of a Christian disposition . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their desire that friendly relations might be restored . But La Salle , fearing treachery , and not having full confidence in the prudence of those he left behind , gave orders that no intercourse should be opened with the savages until his return . Early in May , quite a large party of Indians appeared near the fort . Three of them , laying aside their weapons , came forward and made signs that they wished for a conference . M. Joutel , instead of sending three unarmed men to meet them , invited them to come into the fort . Though they thus placed themselves entirely in his power , they , without the slightest hesitation , entered the enclosure . They quietly sat down , and , by signs , said that hunters from the fort had often been near them , so that they could easily have killed them . But they refrained from doing them any injury . M. Moranget , who had been so severely wounded , urged that they should be terribly punished , in revenge for the attack upon the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inexcusable . He gave them a very unfriendly reception ; and soon ordered them to depart . They had scarcely left the entrance gate , when he ordered several muskets to be fired , as if at them . They thought that they were treacherously fired upon , and fled precipitately . He then ordered several cannon-shot to be thrown to the eminence , where the large party was peacefully assembled . This scattered them . Such was the response to the Indians ' appeal for friendship . Thus insanely did the garrison establish open hostilities between the two parties , when it was evident that the Indians desired friendship . La Salle , in ascending the river , found a prairie region far more rich and beautiful than that occupied by the encampment at the mouth of the creek . He sent back two boats , with directions that about thirty of the most able-bodied men should remain to garrison the fort , while the rest , including all the women and children , were to embark , under M. Moranget , for the new location . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison to embark , with all the stores they could carry , in the Belle , and ascend the river many leagues , to join their companions in the new settlement , and to bury , in careful concealment , all the goods which could not be removed . But sorrows and troubles without number came . The blazing sun of summer withered them . Many were sick . All were languid , discontented , disheartened . The wood to build their huts had to be drawn three miles by hand . There was no heart for the work . Discontented men always quarrel . Even La Salle lost hope , and no longer displayed his customary energy and sagacity . Those who had professed to be good house-carpenters , were found to be totally ignorant of their business . Food became scarce . More than thirty in a few weeks died . These funeral scenes spread gloom over the whole encampment , and all wished themselves back in France . La Salle could intrust weighty responsibilities to no one . He was compelled to superintend everything , and even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this river La Vache , or Cow River , in consequence of the vast number of buffalo cows in which he saw grazing upon the banks . The spot chosen for the village or encampment , if we can judge from the description of M. Joutel , must have been quite enchanting . There was an elevated expanse , smooth and fertile , raised many feet above the level of the stream . An undulating prairie , covered with waving grass and flowers , spread far away for leagues toward the north and the west , bordered , in the distance , by forest-covered hills . The river flowed placidly upon the east , entering into the long and wide bay upon the south . Nothing could exceed the beauty of the prairie , waving in the richest bloom of flowers of every variety of tint . A large cellar was dug , that the ammunition and other valuables might be stored beneath the ground , as a protection against fire . La Salle , with a few companions , made several excursions of fifteen or twenty miles into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could give him information upon that point . Failing in all these , he decided upon a more extensive exploration . The property at the settlement now consisted of only two hundred muskets , two hundred swords , one hundred kegs of powder , three thousand pounds of bullets , three hundred pounds of lead , several bars of steel and of iron to be hammered into nails , and a tolerable supply of farming and mechanic tools . They had no ploughs , horses , or oxen . Without these , farming could be carried on only upon a very limited scale . They had , however , twenty barrels of flour , a puncheon and a half of wine , a few gallons of brandy , one or two swine , and one cock and hen . The exploring party of fifty set out in two bands , in October , from the bay , which he had named St. Louis . M. Joutel was left in command at the settlement , with the strictest injunctions to have no intercourse with the Indians . One band ascended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . Having ascended the river many leagues , and being fully convinced that it was not a branch of the Mississippi , they drew their boats upon the eastern shore , and all commenced their march , over the boundless prairies , with packs upon their backs , toward the rising sun . Ere long they saw in the distance an Indian village , consisting of a cluster of thirty or forty wigwams . It was delightfully situated . The Indians , in locating their villages , ever had a keen sense of landscape beauty . It is difficult to account for the fact that , under the leadership of La Salle , there should have been a battle . But it was so . We have no explanation of the circumstances . After a brief conflict , the savages fled , many being wounded and probably some killed , for they were accustomed to carry their dead with them on a retreat . La Salle and his party entered the abandoned village . They found , cowering in one of the wigwams , a woman who had been struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . A young girl was with her . Just after this , La Salle sent a party of six men to explore a stream . After a toilsome day the party encamped for the night . They built their fire , cooked their supper , and , without establishing any watch , wrapped themselves in their blankets for sleep . The next day they did not return . La Salle 's anxieties were roused . He set out in search of them . The dead bodies of the six were found , pierced with arrows , scalped , and half devoured by wolves . The details of this midnight tragedy were never known . Saddened by this calamity , yet striving to maintain cheerful spirits , the party pressed on their way . After many days ' march they came to another large river , which proved to be that which is now known as the Colorado , which empties into Matagorda Bay , more than four hundred miles west of the mouths of the Mississippi . As they were journeying along , one of the men , with blistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed his march , he found that the party was out of sight , and he could not overtake them . The grass of the prairie was higher than the men 's heads , and there were many tracks through it which were called buffalo streets . It was impossible for him to tell which path the men had taken . He was hopelessly lost . To follow either one of them might lead him farther and farther from his companions , where he would perish miserably . Night came . He fired his gun several times , but could get no response . He threw himself upon the grass . In the intensity of his anxiety , he could not sleep . All the next day and the next night , he remained upon the spot , hoping that his companions might come back in search for him . They did not return . He had been reprimanded the preceding day for some misconduct , and it was supposed that he had deserted . Almost in despair he retraced his steps , travelling mostly by night , through fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil and suffering , ragged and emaciate he at midnight reached the settlement . Many weeks passed away , and no tidings whatever were heard of the exploring party . One morning early in March , M. Joutel chanced to be upon the roof of a hut , when he saw far away on the prairie , eight men approaching . He immediately took a well-armed party and advanced to meet them . They proved to be a portion of the exploring band . They said that others were returning by another route . They were all in a deplorable condition . Their clothes were in tatters . Most of them were without hats . Their shirts were entirely worn out . All were rejoiced to see La Salle again . But he had no tidings to give of the long-sought-for river . The situation in which the colonists , with their greatly diminished numbers , now found themselves was appalling . They were utterly lost in the boundless wilderness of this new world . All communication with their friends in France was cut off . There was no hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find them , even if such search were undertaken . The Indians were hostile . Death would gradually diminish their numbers , and finally the remnant would either be exterminated or carried into captivity by the savages . To add to the affliction of La Salle , the Belle , the only vessel remaining to him , was wrecked and utterly lost . Several of the sailors were drowned ; and stores of inestimable value were destroyed . Father Le Clercq , in describing this untoward event , writes : " We leave the reader to imagine the grief and the affliction felt by the Chevalier La Salle , at an accident which completely ruined all his measures . His great courage even could not have borne him up , had not God aided his virtue by the help of extraordinary grace . " Until the loss of the Belle , he had been sustained by the hope that , in the last extremity , the remnant of his company might find their way back to St. Domingo , and thence to France . This hope was now extinguished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour . Having refreshed himself and his men , and obtained new articles of clothing , mainly by distributing the garments of the dead among the living , early in May , 1686 , the party again set forth . Those who remained behind employed themselves in strengthening the fortifications ; in unsuccessfully cultivating the soil , for most of the seeds would not sprout , and in the chase , laying in a store of jerked meat . They had several hostile rencontres with the Indians , in which the savages were invariably beaten , in consequence of the superiority of the weapons of the Europeans . But there was no harmony in the settlement . Loud murmurs ascended continually . Some denounced La Salle . Some defended him . The antagonistic parties were almost ready to draw their swords against each other . CHAPTER XV . A Trip toward Mexico . Arrangements for the Journey . The Departure . Indians on Horseback . Scenes of Enchantment . Attractive Character of La Salle . Visit to the Kironas . The Bite of the Snake . Adventures Wild and Perilous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Man Devoured by a Crocodile . The Return . Though La Salle was now more than four hundred miles west of the Mississippi River , he was still under the impression that he was east of that point . He therefore , in his blind search , directed his steps toward the setting sun . Father Douay , who accompanied this expedition , has given a detailed account of its adventures . After religious ceremonies in the chapel of the fort , the party , consisting of twenty persons , set out , on the 22d of April , 1686 . They took , for the journey , four pounds of powder , four pounds of lead , two axes , two dozen knives , two kettles , and a few awls and beads . On the third day out they entered one of the most beautiful prairies they had ever seen . To their astonishment they saw , on the plain , a large number of people , some on foot and some on horseback . Several of these came galloping toward them , booted and spurred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high state of civilization , having long held intimate relations with the Spaniards . They gave the Frenchmen an earnest invitation to visit them , in their village , which was about twenty miles distant . But as this would take them quite out of their course , the invitation was declined . Continuing their tour , they encamped at night , being careful to throw up around them entrenchments which would protect them from attack . The next two days they continued their journey over the prairie , until they reached a river , which La Salle named Robek . The amount of wild cattle seen was prodigious . Many of the herds numbered thousands . In a few moments they shot ten . The meat they cut into very thin slices , and dried in the blazing sun , over the smoke of a smouldering fire . Thus they were provided with nutritious food for four or five days . Crossing the Robek in a hastily constructed raft , after marching about five miles they came to another very beautiful river , wider and deeper than the Seine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no underbrush , presenting a park such as the hand of man never planted . In this Eden-like grove there were many trees laden with rich fruit . This river , which La Salle named La Maligne , they also crossed upon a raft . Passing through the forest beyond , they entered upon another extensive prairie . Continuing their tour through a country which they describe as full of enchantments , with blooming plains skirted with vines , fruit trees , and groves , they came to a river which they called Hiens , from one of their party , a German , who , in endeavoring to ford it , got stuck fast in the mud . Two men swam across with axes on their backs . They then cut down the largest trees , on each side , so that their branches met in the middle . By this bridge the party crossed . More than thirty times , during this trip , they resorted to this measure for crossing streams . " After several days ' march , " writes Father Douay , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we found a numerous tribe , who received us with all possible friendship ; even the women coming to embrace our men . They made us sit down on well-made mats , at the upper end of the wigwam , near the chiefs , who presented us with the calumet , adorned with feathers of every hue , which we had to smoke in turn . " The Indians feasted them abundantly , with the best of their fare , and presented them with some excellently tanned buffalo skins , for moccasins . La Salle gave them , in return , some beads , with which they seemed to be greatly delighted . Father Douay writes : " During our stay , Chevalier La Salle so won them by his manners , and insinuated so much of the glory of our king , telling them that he was greater and higher than the sun , that they were all ravished with astonishment . " Continuing their journey , they crossed several rivers , until they came to a large Indian village of three hundred cabins . Just as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer and shot one . The Indians , who heard the report and saw the deer fall dead , were terror-stricken . In a mass they fled to the neighboring forest . La Salle , to avoid surprise , entered the village in military array . Entering the largest cabin , which proved to be that of the chief , they found a very aged woman , the wife of the chief , who , from her infirmities , was unable to fly . La Salle treated the terrified woman with the greatest kindness , and by signs assured her that he intended no harm . Three grown-up sons of the chief , who were watching the progress of events with great solicitude , seeing no indication of hostile measures , cautiously returned . La Salle met there with friendly signs , and accepted the presented calumet . The young chiefs then called to their people in the distance , and all returned . The evening was passed in feasting , dancing , and all kinds of semi-barbarian festivities . Still La Salle did not venture to sleep in the wigwams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who might prove treacherous . He returned to encamp in a dense cane-brake , where no foe could approach without giving warning . In the night , some thought they heard approaching footsteps . But La Salle made it manifest that they were all on the alert , and the foe , if there were any foe approaching , drew off . The alarm was doubtless groundless . The next morning there was a repetition of all the tokens of friendship which were manifested the evening before . Continuing their route about thirty miles , they came to another Indian village . The savages seemed to have no suspicions whatever of the strangers . A party , seeing them approaching in the distance , came out to meet them as if they were old friends . They seemed to be quite gentlemanly men in their courteous and polished demeanor . They gave the strangers an earnest invitation to visit their village . These Indians had heard of the Spaniards , and of the atrocities of which they were guilty farther west . They were quite overjoyed when told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite eager to raise an army and march with the French to attack them . La Salle entered into a cordial alliance with these Indians , who were called the Kironas . He promised that he would eventually , if it were in his power , return with more numerous troops . It would appear that La Salle was now convinced that he would not find the Mississippi by journeying further west ; for he turned his steps toward the northeast . There was a large river near the village , across which the hospitable Indians paddled them in their boats . As they were crossing a beautiful prairie , their Indian companion , whose name was Nika , called out suddenly , " I am dead ! I am dead . " A venomous snake had bitten him , and the limb began instantly to throb and swell . In rude surgery , they , with their pocket-knives , cut out the flesh around . Deep gashes were cut near the wound hoping that the poison would be carried away in the free flowing of the blood . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were available in such cases . After much suffering , which the Indian bore with wonderful stoicism , he recovered from the perilous wound . Journeying on , day after day , they at length reached a broad river , whose current was so rapid that they saw , at once , that it would be very difficult to effect a passage . This was probably the Colorado , many miles above the point where they had touched it in one of their previous excursions . They made a raft . Most of the company were afraid to attempt to cross upon it . La Salle , with his brother Cavalier and one or two others , got on . As soon as they pushed out from the shore , into the middle of the stream , the swiftly rushing torrent seized them , whirled the raft around , and swept it down the stream with resistless velocity . In a few moments it disappeared , as the foaming flood bore it around a bend in the stream . " It was a moment , " writes Father Douay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again seeing our guardian angel the Chevalier de la Salle . " Several hours passed away . The men left upon the bank were in utter bewilderment . They knew not what to do . " The day was spent , " it is written , " in tears and weeping . " Just before nightfall , to their great joy , they saw La Salle and his party on the opposite side of the river . It subsequently appeared that the raft struck a large tree , which had been torn from the banks , and was almost stationary in the middle of the stream ; its roots , heavy with earth and stone , dragging on the bottom . By seizing the branches they dragged themselves out of the current , and by grasping the branches of other trees , overhanging the water , they at length , through a thousand perils , succeeded in gaining the eastern bank , several miles below the point where they had constructed the raft . One of the men was swept from the raft and swam ashore . The party was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing between them . On both sides the night was spent in great anxiety . Many were the plans suggested and abandoned , to form a reunion . In the morning , La Salle shouted to them across the river , that they must build two light rafts , of the very buoyant canes , and cross on them , promising them that he would send several strong swimmers into the river to aid them . One such raft was constructed . With fear and trembling five men ventured upon it . The raft was so light that it barely supported its burden . With long poles they succeeded in reaching the centre of the stream . Then two men from the opposite side swam out , and by their aid , with vigorous paddling , they safely reached the land , after drifting far down the stream . The most timid ones were left behind . They dared not venture the passage . La Salle , seeing their hesitation , ordered his men to pack up and continue their march , leaving them behind . The greater peril overcame the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They shouted across the river , begging for delay . Inspired by the energies of almost despair , they vigorously built their raft , and by noon all were happily reassembled to press on their way . For two days they moved slowly and laboriously along , cutting their way , with the two axes , through an immense forest of cane-brakes . On the third day an incident occurred which peculiarly illustrates the sagacity and endurance of the Indians . Their Indian hunter , Nika , who , as we have said , accompanied La Salle from Canada , left the party the day before they reached the river , in search of game . They had heard nothing from him since . It was in vain to search for him , and the party could not delay its march to wait for his return . On the evening of the fourth day after his absence , as the men were gathered around the camp fire , little expecting to see Nika again , he came quietly into the camp as composed as if nothing unusual had occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choicest cuts of venison , which he had dried in the sun , and nearly the whole of a deer which he had just killed . He had probably swum the stream , floating the venison across on a log by his side . And all this he had done , notwithstanding his wound from the bite of a snake and all the cruel surgery he had undergone . La Salle was so overjoyed to see again his faithful attendant and friend , that he ordered several guns to be fired in salute of his safe return . " Still marching east , " writes Father Douay , " we entered countries more beautiful than any we yet had passed . Here we found native tribes who had nothing barbarous about them but the name . Among others we met a very honest Indian returning from the chase with his wife and family . He presented Chevalier de la Salle with one of his horses , and some meat . He also invited all our party to his cabin . To induce us to visit him , he left his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and galloped off to his village to announce our coming and to secure for us a cordial welcome . " Nika , and another of the attendants of La Salle , accompanied him . The village was at some distance , so that two days passed before their return . The hospitable Indian came back with two horses laden with provisions . Several chiefs and warriors came back with him on horseback . They were all neatly and even beautifully dressed , in softly tanned deer-skins , tastefully fringed , and with head-dresses of waving plumes . In picturesque beauty their attire would favorably compare with the court dresses of most of the European monarchies . The principal chief rode forward , bearing conspicuously the plumed calumet of peace . La Salle had been slowly advancing , and the two parties met about nine miles from the village . After cordial greetings , the united band continued its march . When but a short distance from the cluster of native dwellings , an immense concourse of people was seen flocking out to meet the strangers . The young men were quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cordial , and the indications of sincerity so unquestionable , that no one entertained the slightest apprehension of treachery . La Salle and his party remained three days , enjoying the good cheer of this truly hospitable people . This very prudent commander encamped three or four miles outside of the village . He had no fear of the natives , but he had not full confidence in his own men . Any impropriety of the members of his party toward the females of the village , might suddenly turn their friendly relations into bitter hostility . There were apparently many pleasant families . The young maidens were generally of pleasing features , and graceful as sylphs in form . La Salle purchased several horses , which proved to be of inestimable value to him . The region which the explorers had reached was probably not far from Austin County , in the present State of Texas . It was a more highly civilized and more densely inhabited country than any they had hitherto passed through , in any portion of the continent . For a distance of sixty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miles apart , all prosperous , harmonious , and happy . Their cabins were large and commodious , frequently forty or fifty feet high , with dome-like roofs , in the shape of the old-fashioned bee-hives . They were made by planting very tall saplings in the ground , in the form of a circle . Their tops were bent down and bound together . This whole framework was very neatly and effectually thatched with the long grass of the prairie . The beds , consisting of soft mats , were ranged around the cabin , raised about three feet from the ground . The fire , seldom needed except for cooking , in that warm latitude , was in the middle . Each cabin usually accommodated two families . These Indians were called the Coenis nation . It was very evident that they had held some intercourse with the Spaniards . La Salle found among them silver coins , silver spoons , and various kinds of European clothes . Horses were abundant . A horse was readily exchanged for an axe . La Salle could only converse with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited them , though there was a settlement of them at the distance of about six days ' journey west . Several of their most intelligent men drew a map of the country upon some bark . They delineated a large river many days journey to the east , which La Salle had no doubt was the Mississippi . " The Chevalier La Salle , " writes Father Douay , " who perfectly understood the art of gaining the Indians of all nations , filled these with admiration at every moment . He told them that the chief of the French was the greatest chief in the world ; that he was as far above the Spaniards as the sun is above the earth . On his recounting the victories of our monarch they burst into exclamations of astonishment . I found them very docile and tractable . They comprehended well enough what we told them of the truth of a God . " After the refreshment of this delightful visit , the explorers continued their journey . After travelling about thirty miles , four of the men , during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their lot for life with the Indians . They were houseless and homeless adventurers , with no ties to bind them to the cares , toils , and restraints of civilized life . It is not surprising that they should have been charmed with the ease , abundance , and freedom of life in the wigwam . They probably became incorporated in the tribes , took Indian wives , and were heard of no more . At this encampment La Salle and his nephew , M. Moranget , were both attacked with a violent fever . They had frequent relapses , so that two weary months passed before the march could be resumed . During this long delay they did not suffer for food , for there was abundance of game , and of great variety . Their powder , however , began to fail them . According to their estimate , they were about four hundred and fifty miles , in a straight line , from their settlement . It was resolved now to hasten back . Their horses , which found abundant pasturage on the rich prairies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs and the burdens of all . They came to a river which it was necessary to cross by a raft . Indeed every few leagues they encountered such a stream . They generally swam their horses over . In this case , La Salle , with one or two of his men , was upon a light raft of canes . Suddenly an enormous crocodile , twenty feet in length , raised his head out of the water , and with one snap of his horrid jaws grasped one of the men by the waist and drew him under . As the monster sank , there was one short , wild shriek from the victim , a slight crimson tinge of the waves , and a small circling whirlpool marking the spot where the huge beast had gone down . Thus , in an instant , as by the lightning 's flash , another of the terrible tragedies of this tragic world had come and gone . On the 17th of October this wearied and diminished party reached the camp , after an absence of six months . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of joy and of sadness . Both parties had narratives to give of disaster ; and gloom impenetrable still hung over the feeble colony , so rapidly wasting away . In commenting upon this enterprise , Father Douay writes : " It would be difficult to find in history , courage more intrepid or more invincible than that of the Chevalier de la Salle . In adversity he was never cast down . He always hoped , with the help of heaven , to succeed in his enterprises , despite all the obstacles that rose against it . " CHAPTER XVI .

Vast Realms of Fertility and Beauty . The Joys and the Sorrows of such a Pilgrimage . The Assassination of La Salle and of three of his Companions . La Salle was now fully convinced that he was west of the Mississippi River . He resolved to set out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not less than two thousand miles . His design was to send tidings to France of his disasters , and thus to secure aid to be sent thence to his suffering and expiring colony . By pursuing his route toward the northeast , he was sure of eventually striking the Mississippi . He would then feel quite at home . Following up that stream and the Illinois , he could easily pass over to the lakes , and then reach Canada through regions with which he was quite familiar . More than two months were spent in strengthening the defences of the settlement , and in laying in stores of provisions for those who were to be left behind . At midnight of the 7th of January , 1687 , the whole company met in the little chapel for a solemn religious service , to implore God 's blessing upon the enterprise . The scene was very affecting . Nearly all were in tears . There were but few chances that those then bidding each other adieu would ever meet again . Those who left , and those who remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany him . Among those , were his brother , his ever-faithful Indian attendant , M. Douay , to whose pen we are indebted for the record of the last expedition , and M. Joutel , who kept a daily journal of the events of this journey . M. Douay wrote also quite a minute account of the expedition . Both of their narratives now lie before me . We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of either . There were but twenty French left behind , including seven women and children . La Salle gave them a parting address . Father Douay writes : " He made an address full of eloquence , with that engaging way so natural to him . The whole colony was present , and were all moved to tears . They were alike persuaded of the necessity of his voyage and the uprightness of his intentions . " The property left with the colonists consisted of seventy pigs , large and small , twenty hens and chickens , a few barrels of corn , which was carefully kept for the sick , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without balls . The heroic and devout Father Membre remained as the spiritual guide . M. Barbier was left with the secular command . La Salle drew up very minute directions for the administration of affairs during his absence . " We parted , " writes M. Joutel , " in a manner so tender , so sorrowful , that it would seem that we had a secret presentiment that we should never again see each other . Father Membre was deeply affected . He said to me that never before had he experienced a parting so painful . " It was the 12th of January , 1689 , when this truly forlorn hope set out upon its long journey . They took with them the five horses , bearing some articles of food and such things as they would need for their night 's encampment . The second day of their journey they came to a plain about six miles wide , which seemed to be covered with buffaloes , deer , flocks of wild turkeys , and every variety of game . Beyond the plain there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they found that it fringed a small river . Concealed by these trees , they succeeded in shooting five buffaloes which had come to the river to drink . They crossed the river on a raft , and camped a mile and a half beyond , in a drenching rain . The skins and meat of these animals were packed upon the horses . The skins , easily tanned , were of immense value in their subsequent lodgings . The next morning , the 14th , the sun rose in a cloudless sky . The prairie seemed spread out for leagues before them , covered with herds of buffaloes and deer , while immense flocks of turkeys and other birds of the prairie rose before them . About noon they saw , in the distance , an immense herd of buffaloes rushing over the plains as if mad . They conjectured at once that some Indian hunters were pursuing them . Their conjecture proved correct . Soon they saw a savage , on the full run , and very flat-footed , pursuing the herd . Hastily the load was thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , and galloping over the plain soon overtook the Indian , and led him back to the company . When the poor man saw himself surrounded by a group of white men , such as he had seen before , he was greatly terrified . And he had cause to be frightened . La Salle 's associates infamously urged that he should be put to death , in revenge for the murder of their companions by some unknown Indian band . The humane , magnanimous leader found it necessary to present to his reckless followers such motives as they could appreciate . He said to them : " We are but few in number . We have before us a journey of hundreds of miles through a region crowded with Indian tribes . If we rouse the vengeance of the savages , we shall all be cut off . Let us treat them with kindness , and thus we shall secure for ourselves kind treatment in return . " The cordial smiles and friendly signs of this truly good man soon dispelled apparently the great alarm of the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry guest , and smoking with him the friendly pipe , La Salle , assuring him of his desire to do harm to none , but good to all , dismissed him with presents which to the savage must have seemed almost like celestial gifts . Still the cautious Indian , accustomed to treachery , was evidently uncertain as to the fate which awaited him . As he withdrew , he cast anxious glances around , until he had attained the distance of a few rods , when he took to flight , with almost the rapidity of a deer . The travellers continued their route , and after an hour or two , overtook another Indian hunter . They caught him , and lavished upon him the same acts of kindness . As evening was approaching , they saw a large band of savages in the distance . Their attitude was somewhat menacing . When they caught sight of the little cluster of strangers , they separated into two parties , and advanced on the right and left , as if to surround them . When the two bands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The savages halted also . For a few moments they attentively regarded each other , no movement being made on either side . Then La Salle , laying aside his arms , walked slowly forward toward the party where the head chief seemed to be , making signs for the chief to come and meet him . The chief was a tall man of powerful frame , and richly decorated . He came cautiously forward , while the rest of his party followed slowly at a little distance behind . As soon as it was seen that the two chiefs met cordially , all came running together in the interchange of caresses and every mark of friendly greeting . Fires were built , food was cooked , pipes were smoked . There was feasting and dancing and shouting . It was a marvellous spectacle which was then and there presented of semi-civilized and full barbarian jollification . The savages were evidently delighted with their reception . They examined their presents with astonishment . With unfeigned joy they learned that La Salle intended to return and settle in their country ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would exchange with them for such articles as they had to part with . It was now the hour of evening twilight . The two parties separated , each going its own way . About a mile and a half in advance , there was a beautiful grove and a running stream . La Salle encamped there . With his customary prudence he threw up intrenchments , and established sentinels as if he were in the enemy 's country . They had but just established their camp , when they saw six savages approaching , following each other in single file . They came forward without any hesitation , as if visiting old friends . By signs they said that they had heard of the kind treatment their fellow countrymen had met with , and that they were brothers , not enemies . After a short and pleasant visit they retired , and the camp was left to undisturbed repose . In the morning , at an early hour , the march was resumed . There was before them a stream too deep to be forded . Not wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the west bank of the stream for several miles . Their route led through an enchanting region of lawn-like prairies and park-like groves . The river was fringed with trees of every variety , without any underbrush . There were many pretty little creeks to be crossed , which ran into the main stream . The water was pure , sweet , and clear as crystal . Occasionally they came to a cane-brake , through which they cut their way with axes . Their appetites were fed with abundance of game . The next day , the 19th , they made but a short journey , and experienced great fatigue in fording streams and cutting their way through cane-brakes . They came across a few deserted cabins of the Indians . During the slow progress of the day , their skilful Indian hunter Nika killed eight buffaloes . The most tender cuts were taken from them , and they there crossed the river by a ford . After traversing a few leagues , they came to another river , flowing through a low plain , elevated but slightly above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deluging rain . Here they encamped in the woods which bordered the river . They passed a comfortless night , and the storm detained them all the next day . On the 19th the rain ceased , but the fog continued . Their path led through marshy ground thoroughly soaked with rain , so that they often sank to their knees in the mire . Their feet were shod with moccasins made of the hide of buffaloes . These being alternately wet and dried , became stiff , and blistered their feet cruelly . Fortunately , they struck upon one of the " streets " made by the buffaloes , as in thousands they followed one after the other , crushing their way through the cane-brakes . These animals were , by instinct , good engineers , and invariably selected the most favorable routes . Still the voyagers were often compelled to wade through deep mire , and their sufferings were at times severe . On the night of the 19th , they fortunately came upon a ridge , where they could enjoy a dry encampment . They built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blistered feet , and during a few hours of refreshing sleep forgot their toils . As they awoke the next morning the river was again falling . Still they pressed on , entering upon another vast prairie covered with herds of buffaloes . At night they encamped upon the banks of a river too deep to be forded . On the 21st they ascended the banks of the stream , hoping to find a shallow spot where they could cross . Instead of this , they came to a place where the river flowed through a narrow and deep channel , with large trees on each side . They cut down two of these trees , so that their branches met in the middle , crossed on this bridge , and swam their horses over . On the other side , a beautiful country , of elevated , undulating prairie , opened before them . As they were preparing to encamp in the shelter of a grove , they heard voices , and soon beheld fifteen Indians approaching . The savages manifested no alarm , but in token of peace laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . They ate , smoked , exchanged presents , and went on their way rejoicing , promising to visit the camp again . The horses , as well as the men , were quite exhausted . They therefore remained , for a day of rest , on their very pleasant camping ground . During the day a band of twenty-two Indians came to them . They had shields impervious to arrows , made of the hide of buffaloes . They were at war with another tribe . They said that there were other white men , at the distance of ten days ' journey on the west , doubtless referring to the Spaniards . The interview was mutually pleasant , and La Salle obtained some important information in reference to the continuance of his route . Onward they pressed , day after day , with alternate sunshine and storm , through marsh and forest , over prairies and across rivers , without encountering any adventure of much importance until the 1st of February . That day they discovered , at a distance , an Indian village . La Salle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother and seven men , and set out to reconnoitre . They came to a village of twenty-five wigwams , very pleasantly situated . Each wigwam contained four or five men , besides quite a number of women and children . The Indians received their guests very hospitably , conducted them to the dwelling of their chief , and seated them upon mats of buffalo skins . A great crowd gathered within and around the cabin . The chief , after feeding them abundantly upon buffalo steaks , informed them that he had been expecting their arrival . Other Indians had told him that they were in the country , and that they were on a route which would lead them near his village . Perfect harmony prevailed . Presents were exchanged . The Indians were eager to give a nicely tanned buffalo robe for a knife or almost any trinket in the hands of the white men . But La Salle had no means of transporting the robes , which would prove so valuable in European markets . They continued their journey , often meeting with Indians , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany them during the march of a whole day . By the aid of the Indians , the very light frame of a canoe was constructed , which was easily packed and carried . By stretching over it the skin of a buffalo , from which the hair had been removed , they were furnished with a very buoyant boat , with which to cross the rivers . The horses could easily swim the streams . On the 10th of February , they saw before them a vast plain which had been swept by the flames . Thinking that they might not find game there , they made a halt of two days , to lay in a store of jerked meat . Resuming their journey , they soon passed the scathed region and entered again upon a country of bloom and verdure . On the evening of the 15th , they camped on the borders of a stream , where they saw evidences that a band of savages had recently passed that way . The next morning La Salle took his brother and seven men , and followed a well-trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short walk , they came upon a cluster of fifty or sixty cabins . His reception was , as usual , cordial in the extreme . The leading men of the village were courteous in their bearing and intelligent in reference to matters relating to their own country . They gave the names of twenty tribes or nations , through whose territories La Salle had already passed from his settlement , which he called St. Louis . On the 17th , one of the horses fell , and sprained his shoulder , so that he had to be left behind . For several days the journey was somewhat monotonous . They made about twenty or twenty-five miles a day . Indian hunters were continually met with , and Indian villages entered with essentially the same rites of friendship and hospitality . From some of these Indians they heard tidings of those Frenchmen who had deserted . They were living in a very friendly manner among the Indians . On the 1st of March they came to an immense marsh , partially submerged in water . The intricate passage across it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide . Several of the Indians volunteered , and with great tenderness led them safely across . Passing the morass caused a delay of four or five days , as it could not be undertaken in a drenching rain which chanced then to be falling . On the 15th they emerged from this gloomy region and entered a country which , from the contrast , appeared to them remarkably beautiful . Here they encamped for a brief rest . Nika brought in word that he had killed two buffaloes , and wished to have a couple of horses sent to bring in the meat . A party of five was sent out , led by M. Moranget , who was a rash and irritable man . There were three men who had accompanied the hunter , and who were cutting up and drying the meat , in preparation for transporting it to the camp . At the same time they were cooking for themselves some of the choicest pieces . When Moranget reached the place and found the men feasting , as he thought , rather than jerking the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity . The men chanced to be the very worst and most desperate in the camp . Moranget accompanied his denunciations with still more irritating actions . He took from them the delicious morsels which they cooked . Four men , for another had joined them , greatly enraged , sullenly abandoned their work , and retiring a short distance agreed to avenge themselves by killing Moranget , and also by killing Nika and another man who was the valet of La Salle . Both of these men were friends and supporters of Moranget . They waited till night . All took their supper together . It was the night of the 17th of March . Though in that genial climate the weather was serene and mild , a rousing fire was found very grateful in protecting them from the chill of the night air . With the fading twilight the stars shone down brightly upon them , and , surrounded by the silence and solemnity of the prairie and the forest , they were soon apparently all asleep . One of the murderers , Liotot , cautiously arose as by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping toward Moranget , with one desperate blow split open his skull from crown to chin . The deed was effectually done . And yet with sinewy arm blow followed blow , till the head was one mass of clotted gore . The other two were despatched in the same way . The three remaining conspirators stood , with their guns cocked and primed , to shoot down either of the victims who might succeed in making any resistance . There is some slight discrepancy in the detail of these murders . It is said that Moranget , upon receiving the first blow , made a convulsive movement , as if to rise ; but that the valet and the Indian did not stir . One crime always leads to another . The conspirators , having perpetrated these murders , now consulted together as to what was next to be done . Moranget was the nephew of La Salle . The valet and the Indian were his devoted friends . Their death could not be concealed . It was certain that La Salle would not allow it to go unavenged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long and perilous journey through the wilderness , there could be no doubt that as soon as they should reach a French military post they would all die upon the scaffold . They decided to return to the camp , enlist a few others on their side , kill La Salle , and others of his prominent friends , when unsuspicious of danger ; and thus involving all the rest in their own criminality , effectually prevent any witnesses from rising against them . Probably in some degree tortured by remorse , and trembling in view of the task which they had undertaken , they remained for two days , the 18th and 19th , where they were , ostensibly employed in jerking the meat . La Salle , not knowing how to account for this long absence , became uneasy . He decided to go himself , taking a few others with him , to ascertain the cause . To his friends he expressed serious apprehensions that some great calamity had happened . M. Joutel was left in charge of the camp , and La Salle , with Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost ones . Father Douay gives the following account of the tragic scene which ensued : " All the way La Salle conversed with me of matters of piety , grace , and predestination . He expatiated upon all his obligations to God , for having saved him from so many dangers during the last twenty years that he had traversed America . He seemed to me to be peculiarly penetrated with a grateful sense of God 's kindness to him . Suddenly I saw him plunged into a deep melancholy , for which he himself could not account . He was so troubled that he no longer seemed like himself . As this was an unusual state of mind with him , I endeavored to rouse him from his lethargy . " Two leagues after , we found the bloody cravat of his valet . He perceived two eagles flying over his head . At the same time he discerned some of his people on the edge of the river . He approached them , asking what had become of his nephew . They answered incoherently , pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We proceeded some steps along the bank , to the fatal spot where two of his murderers were hidden in the grass , one on each side , with guns cocked . One missed Monsieur de la Salle . The one firing at the same time shot him in the head . He died an hour after , on the 19th of March 1687 . " I expected the same fate . But this danger did not occupy my thoughts , penetrated with grief at so cruel a spectacle . I saw him fall , a step from me , his face all full of blood . He had confessed and performed his devotions just before we started . During his last moments he manifested the spirit of a good Christian , especially in the act of pardoning his murderers . " Thus died our wise commander , constant in adversity , intrepid , generous , engaging , dexterous , skilful , capable of everything . He , who for twenty years had softened the fierce temper of countless savage tribes , was massacred by the hands of his own domestics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the prime of life , in the midst of his enterprises , without having seen their success . I could not leave the spot where he had expired , without having buried him as well as I could . After which I raised a cross over his grave . " In reference to the burial , Joutel gives a little different account . He says : " The shot which killed La Salle was the signal for the accomplices of the assassin to rush to the spot . With barbarous cruelty they stripped him of his clothing , even to his shirt . The poor dead body was treated with every indignity . The corpse was left , entirely naked , to the voracity of wild beasts . " Both of these accounts may be essentially true . The barbarities practised by the assassins may have preceded or followed the hasty burial of Douay . Father Douay , in his account , continues : " Occupied with these thoughts , which La Salle had a thousand times suggested to us , while relating the events of the new discoveries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of His Providence , uncertain still what fate He reserved for us , as our desperadoes plotted nothing less than our destruction . We at last entered the place where Monsieur Cavalier was . The assassins entered the cabin unceremoniously , and seized all that was there . I had arrived a moment before them . I had no need to speak ; for as soon as Cavalier beheld my countenance , all bathed in tears , he exclaimed aloud : " ' Ah , my poor brother is dead . ' " This holy ecclesiastic , whose virtue has been so often tried in the apostolic labors of Canada , fell at once on his knees . I myself , and some others did the same , to prepare to die the same death . But the murderers , touched by some sentiment of compassion at the sight of the venerable old man , and besides half-penitent for the murders they had committed , resolved to spare us , on condition that we should never return to France . But as they were still undecided , and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them often say to one another , that they must get rid of us ; that otherwise we should accuse them before the tribunals , if we once had them in the kingdom . " The leader of these desperadoes , a wretch by the name of Duhaut , at once assumed the supreme command . The company now consisted of but seventeen . The timid ones , trembling for their lives , feigned entire devotion to the cause of the assassins . Duhaut ruled with an iron hand . It was manifest that the least indication of an insubordinate spirit would lead to instant death . Some of the best men were for organizing a conspiracy to assassinate the assassins . But the priest Cavalier continually said no , repeating the words , ' Vengeance is mine . I will repay , saith the Lord . ' " It is impossible to determine the precise spot where the murder of La Salle and his companions took place . We know that it was several days ' journey west of the Cenis Indians , whose territory extended along the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore conjectured that it must have been near one of the streams flowing into the Brazos , in the heart of Texas , probably not far from where Washington now is . CHAPTER XVII . The Penalty of Crime . Nature 's Storms . The Gloom of the Soul . Approach to the Cenis Village . Cordial Welcome . Barbaric Ceremonials . Social Habits of the Indians . Meeting with the French Deserters . Traffic with the Indians . Quarrel between Hiens and Duhaut . The Assassins Assassinated . Departure of the War Party . Fiend-like Triumph . The March Resumed . The morning of the 21st ushered in a day of gloom , wind , and rain . Nature , in the moaning storm , seemed in sympathy with the sadness which must have oppressed all hearts . Silently they toiled along , drenched with the falling rain , until noon , when the storm became so severe that they were compelled to halt . They threw up their camp in a deep and dark ravine . The murderers could have no rest . They were in continual fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Father Douay , M. Joutel , and La Salle 's brother the Chevalier , knew full well that the murderers had the strongest possible incentive to kill them also . There is no storm so desolating , so ruinous to all happiness , as sin . Could these voyagers have continued their journey with fraternal love , its material obstacles could all have been pleasantly surmounted . But henceforth , for them , there were no more sunny skies , no more blooming prairies , no more joyous gatherings and feastings around the camp fire . Journeying on , through a gloomy country , and in sombre weather , they came , on the 24th , to a river . Most of the party swam across . Father Douay , M. Joutel , and Cavalier could not swim . Some friendly Indians came along and , swimming by their side , helped them over . A journey of four days more brought them to a large village of the Cenis Indians , on a stream which they called by the same name . The region was beautiful . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interspersed with groves of a great variety of majestic trees . They frequently met with Indians , from whom they always received kind treatment . Most of the men encamped a few miles from the village , M. Joutel was sent , with three others , to purchase from them , if possible , some corn . One of the men thus sent forward was Hiens , one of the original conspirators with Duhaut . M. Joutel was annoyed in accompanying a murderer on this mission , but it was not safe to make any remonstrance . Duhaut kept careful guard over all the effects . He intrusted a few hatchets and knives to his envoys , with instructions to purchase corn , and , if possible , a horse . They had not gone far before they saw three savages approaching them on horseback . One had a hat and cloak , which he had probably obtained in some way from the Spaniards . The other two were entirely naked . The three had panniers closely woven of fibres of cane , and filled with corn meal pounded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chief , with the meal as a present , and to invite the strangers to visit his village . After smoking together , and the Indians having received some knives and beads in return for their gift , the united party set out for the village . It was still some distance to the village . Night had come . The horses of the travellers were weary and hungry . They therefore encamped in a rich meadow , by a rippling stream . Two of the Indians returned to their village . One remained with the strangers . The next morning they went forward , and were conducted by their Indian companion to the cabin of the chief . They were received with very unusual courtly etiquette . About a third of a mile from the village there was a very large building , which we should call the town house , or the city hall . It was constructed as the place for the gathering of all their great public assemblages . The floor was very neatly carpeted with finely woven mats . A very imposing procession was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this council house . First in the procession came all the men of the village , venerable in character and age . They were richly dressed , in very tasteful picturesque garments , of softly tanned deer-skin . These robes and leggins and scarfs were of different colors , of brilliant hue , and were profusely decorated with fringes and embroidered with shells . They wore plumes of colored feathers upon their heads , which waved gracefully in the gentle breeze . In their hands they held javelins , or bows , with quivers of arrows suspended on their shoulders . On each side of the ancients , who were twelve in number , there were files of warriors , as if for their protection . They were all young men of admirable figure , painted and dressed , and armed as if on the war-path . The procession being thus formed in front of the chief 's cabin , and the whole population of the village , many hundred in number , men , women and children , gathered around to witness the spectacle , M. Joutel and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be received by the ancients and conducted to the council house . These venerable men greeted them with much formality . Each one raised his right hand to his head , and then performed a peculiar series of bows . They then embraced each one , gently throwing their arms around the neck . This ceremony was followed by the presentation of the pipe of friendship , each one taking but a few whiffs . The cortege advanced to the council house . The guests were seated on couches in the centre . The ancients , silently and with much dignity of movement , took seats around them . A large multitude crowded the vacant spaces . They were feasted with the choicest viands of the Indians , boiled corn meal , cakes baked in the ashes , and truly delicious steaks of venison . Presents were interchanged , and kind speeches made , mainly by signs . M. Joutel informed them that it was his great desire to obtain corn for their long journey . They said that their supply was short , but that in a neighboring village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an abundant supply . They also signified their readiness to accompany their guests to this village . A large party set out together . The trail led along the banks of one of the branches of the Brazos . The region was delightful , the soil fertile , and quite a dense population blessed with abundance , peopled the lovely valley . It might have been almost an Eden , but for the wickedness of fallen man . This powerful tribe the Cenis , was at war with another tribe , called the Cannohantimos . Frequently the valley would be swept by an irruption of fierce warriors , with gleaming tomahawks and poisoned arrows and demoniac yells . Conflagration , blood , and shrieks of misery ensued . The valley , which God had made so beautiful for his children , those children had converted into a Gethsemane , where all the fiends seemed struggling . But our travellers passed up this valley in one of the serene and blooming spring mornings . There was a lull in war 's tempest , and a heavenly Father 's smile illumined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were met with all along the route . Many of these dwellings were sixty feet in diameter . They afforded perfect protection from wind and rain , were neatly carpeted , and gave ample accommodation often for four or five families . One central fire , which was never permitted to go out , was common for all . There were no partitions . Each family occupied a certain portion of the space , and slept on comfortable beds , raised a foot or two from the floor . They were naturally a very amiable people among themselves , and lived together on the most brotherly terms . In cultivating the fields they worked together . Often a hundred men and women would meet to plant the field of one man . They would spend six or seven hours in carefully digging the field with wooden forks , and in planting seeds of corn , beans , melons , and other vegetables . They would then have a feast , provided by the one in whose behalf they were laboring . This would be followed by games and dances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the seed . These children of the prairie must have found , in these co-operative labors , far more enjoyment than the solitary farmer can find in his lonely toils . Thus this band would pass from field to field throughout the whole village . M. Joutel says that , so far as he could learn , they did not seem to have any definite idea of God . They had certain shadowy notions of some being or beings above themselves , but apparently did not consider that these beings took any special interest in scenes occurring here below . Upon the subject of religion it could hardly be said that they had any definite idea . They had no temples , no priests , no worship . Their minds were in a state of vacuity . In this respect they were much in the condition of mere animals . They had certain ceremonies , the meaning of which they could not explain , except that such was their custom  --  that their fathers did so . Be it remembered that this is the account which is given of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . There are well-authenticated accounts of some Indians , who were in the habit of daily prayer . They reached the village in the early evening . Couriers had preceded them to announce their coming . The principal men came out and conducted them to a cabin , which had been prepared for their reception . After supper and a social pipe , the guests were left to the repose which they greatly needed . The cabin assigned to them was one of the largest in the place . It had belonged to a chief who had recently died . A gentle fire was burning in the centre . There were several women in the cabin , attending to sundry household duties . The guests slept soundly . The next morning was the 1st of April , 1687 . The fathers of the village again called upon the strangers with much courtesy of demeanor , and brought them an ample breakfast . Presents were exchanged , and a very fine horse was purchased for a hatchet . The day was spent in purchasing corn , which was placed in panniers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here were found three Frenchmen who , a year before had deserted from La Salle . With painted faces , and in the dress of savages , no one could distinguish them from others of the tribe . The fact that in one year they had almost entirely forgotten their native language , seems at first thought almost incredible . But it must be remembered that they were vagabond sailors , with no mental culture , who could neither read nor write , and with whom language was merely a succession of sounds , which were very easily obliterated from the memory . M. Joutel sent his companions back to the camp with the corn which had already been purchased , while he remained to obtain more . Alone in the cabin , far away in the wilderness , the companion of murderers , and a very uncertain fate before him , he could not sleep . At midnight , as he was reclining upon his mat , absorbed in thought , he saw , by the light of the fire , an Indian enter the cabin , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat near where M. Joutel was apparently sleeping . M. Joutel spoke to him . He made no reply ; but arose and took another seat near the fire . M. Joutel , being sleepless , followed him , to enter , if possible , into conversation . Fixing his eyes earnestly upon the taciturn Indian , he saw , to his surprise , that he was one of the French deserters whom he had formerly known very well . His name was Grollet . He informed M. Joutel that he had a comrade by the name of Ruter , who did not dare to come with him , from fear that he should be punished by La Salle , of whose death they had not heard . " They had , " writes M. Joutel , " in so short a time so entirely contracted the habits of the savages , as to become thorough savages themselves . They were naked , and their faces and bodies were covered with painted figures . Each of them had taken several wives . They had accompanied the warriors of the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enemy , which had given them great renown . Having expended all their powder and bullets , their guns had become useless . They had therefore taken bows and arrows and had become quite skilful in their use . As to religion , they never had any . The libertine life they were now practising was quite to their taste . " Grollet seemed much moved when he heard of the death of La Salle and the others . Upon being questioned whether he had ever heard the Indians speak of the Mississippi , he said that he had not , but that he had often heard them speak of a very large river , about five days ' journey northeast of them , and upon whose banks there were very many Indian tribes . The two next days M. Joutel continued purchasing corn . It could not be bought in large quantities , but many families could spare a little . On the 8th of April he returned to the camp , with three horses laden with corn . During this delay the murderer , Duhaut , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French military or trading post , accompanied by the witnesses of his crime , was certain death . To attempt to kill all those not implicated in the murder , would be a very serious undertaking ; especially as they were now on their guard , and the assassins had begun to quarrel among themselves . Duhaut formed the plan of turning back , with his confederates , to the settlement which they had left at the bay of St. Louis . Where he designed to build a vessel and to sail for the West India Islands , The persons whom Duhaut greatly feared were Father Douay , M. Joutel , La Salle 's brother , M. Chevalier , and a young man who was called Young Chevalier . The head murderer now adopted the policy of separating these men from the rest of the company , that he might freely talk with his confederates of his plans . M. Joutel and his associates were also well pleased with this arrangement , for they too could now talk freely . Duhaut tried to compel the other party to go back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not force them , and that they were resolved to continue their journey to the French settlements , and that thus they might send an armed ship to capture the murderers ; he resolved to continue in their company . Probably he hoped that some opportunity would occur in which he could cut them off . There were five men who were active participants in the assassination . Duhaut , the instigator , Hiens , who was the next most prominent in the plot , and three others , who were rather their tools , Liotot , Tessier , and Larcheveque . The rage of Hiens was kindled only against Moranget . He was willing to kill Moranget 's two companions that they might not be witnesses against the murderers . He would conceal their bodies , and would have it understood that they had wandered away and become lost , or that they had been captured by the Indians . Liotot was appointed to strike the fatal blows upon Moranget and his companions with the hatchet , while the others stood ready , with their guns , to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Salle was contrary to the wishes of Hiens . Duhaut and Larcheveque waylaid him . They both fired nearly at the same moment . The bullet of Larcheveque , either intentionally or by accident , passed wide of its mark . Duhaut 's bullet pierced the brain . There was no sympathy between Hiens and Duhaut . When the latter so arrogantly assumed the command , Hiens became very restive , and was waiting for an opportunity to dethrone him . Trembling in view of the peril of approaching the French settlements , and having no disposition to imbrue his hands any farther in the blood of innocent men whose conduct had only won his regard , he was extremely anxious to return to the bay of St. Louis . Finding that Duhaut had altered his plan and had decided to continue on the Mississippi , he took one or two of his companions aside and deeply impressed them with a sense of the danger they would thus encounter . They conspired to kill Duhaut and his most resolute supporter Liotot . Hiens then entered into a secret alliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his plans , he would stop the march of the party toward the Mississippi , and with several others would join them , with their all-powerful muskets , in a hostile expedition they were about to make against a neighboring tribe . He also enlisted , in co-operation with his plans , the French deserters who had already become savages . Thus strengthened , and with twenty-two well-armed savages in his train , he sought Duhaut . In brief words he thus addressed him : " You have decided to go on to the French settlements . It is a danger which we dare not encounter . I therefore demand that you divide with us all the arms , ammunition , and goods we have . You may then pursue your own course and we will pursue ours . " Without waiting for any reply he drew a pistol and shot Duhaut through the heart . The miserable man staggered back a few steps and dropped dead . At the same moment one of his accomplices , Ruter , with his musket , shot down Liotot , inflicting a mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonies , Ruter advanced and discharged a pistol-shot into the convulsed body . Douay writes , " His hair , and then his shirt and clothes took fire , and wrapped him in flames , and in this torment he expired . " It was the intention of Hiens also to kill Larcheveque , but he , terror-stricken , escaped by flight . A small hole was dug , and the two dead bodies were thrown in and covered up . M. Joutel was present , and witnessed this dreadful scene . He writes : " Those murders took place before my eyes . I was dreadfully agitated , and supposing that my death was immediately to follow , instinctively seized my musket in self-defence . But Hiens cried out : " ' You have nothing to fear . We do not wish to harm you . We only avenge the death of our patron La Salle . Could I have prevented his death I certainly should have done so . ' " The savages were astonished at this scene . They were not at all prepared for it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders which they had committed ; and that as Duhaut and Liotot had resolved to take with them all the guns and ammunition , it was necessary to kill them that Hiens and his associates might join the Indians in their war party . This statement seemed to give entire satisfaction . Hiens was now the leader of the rapidly dwindling band . He informed them that he should take several of his companions , with the guns and ammunition , and accompany the Indians on their military expedition . In the meantime , until his return , they were to remain in charge of friendly Indians . Thus they were virtually prisoners . Their means for continuing the journey were taken from them . Probably Hiens intended that they should never return to France . Early in May , the war party commenced its march . Hiens accompanied the warriors , with four of his party , and two of the French deserters . This made seven Frenchmen , well armed with powder and ball . As they were to encounter foes who bore only bows and arrows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition . Each one of these had a horse . Hiens exacted a promise , from those he left behind , that they would not leave the village until his return . A fortnight passed away . Those who remained were encamped at a little distance outside of the village . They were frequently visited by the men and the women , who ever manifested the most friendly feelings . They could converse only by signs , and their attempted communication of ideas was not very satisfactory . On the 18th of the month a great crowd came rushing out to the encampment . The men and women were painted and decorated . Their smiling faces , songs , and dances indicated plainly that they had received tidings of a great victory . For several hours , there was exhibited a very picturesque scene of feasting , smoking , and barbarian jollity . In the midst of these wild festivities , a courier arrived , stating that the victorious army was returning , and that they had killed more than forty of their enemies . The next day they arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French with their muskets . They found the foe drawn up in battle array in a dense grove . Approaching within musket-shot , but not within arrow-shot , the French with deliberate aim shot down forty-eight of the foe . The rest in terror fled . The shouting Cenis pursued . They took a large number of women and children as prisoners , most of whom they instantly killed and scalped . Two mature girls they brought back with them to subject to fiend-like torture . One of them had been cruelly scalped . Faint and bleeding she could endure but little more . An Indian , borrowing a pistol from a Frenchman , deliberately shot her through the head , saying : " Take that message to your nation . Tell them that ere long we will serve them all in the same way . " The other maiden was reserved for all the horrors of demoniac torture by the women and the girls . These were arranged in a circle . The poor girl was led into the middle of them . They were all armed with strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell tumultuously upon her , like hounds upon a hare . She soon dropped to the ground beneath their blows . They thrust their sharp sticks into her body . With sinewy arms these savage women beat her in the face , over the head , upon every part of her frame until her body presented but a mangled mass of blood . As she lay upon the ground scarcely breathing , a burly Indian came forward , and with one blow of a club crushed in her brain . The next day there was another great celebration . Great honor was conferred upon the French who had caused the victory . The Indian warriors had done but little more than kill the women and children whom they had taken prisoners , and scalp all the slain . After several speeches were made by their orators , a procession was formed . Each warrior had a bow and two arrows in his hand , and was accompanied by one of his wives , who , like a servant or rather like the squire of the knights of old , waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's chivalric achievements . The whole day was devoted to barbarian feasting and carousing . Hiens the next day held an amicable conference with M. Joutel and his friends , to come to some agreement as to their future operations . " I am not willing , " he said , " to return to the French settlements . It would inevitably cost me my head . But I am willing to divide all our property equally between the two parties . Those who wish may accompany Joutel ; others may remain with me . " The division was made . M. Joutel , Father Douay , M. Cavalier , and his nephew , young Cavalier , and three others , De Marle , Tessier and Barthelmy , composed the party which was to return to the French settlements . Thus the band of twenty which had left the bay of St. Louis had dwindled down to seven . They had three horses , thirty hatchets , five dozen knives , thirty pounds of powder , and thirty pounds of bullets . Three Indians volunteered as guides for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that M. Joutel was about to undertake so long and perilous a journey , with so small a band , he was astonished , and did everything in his power to dissuade him from such an enterprise . " If you will remain with us , " said he , " we will give you cabins and wives , and food in abundance . The dangers before you are appalling , not only from hostile Indians , whose territories you must pass through , but from the innumerable difficulties of broad rivers and deep marshes you must encounter by the way . " M. Joutel and his companions were firm . Very reluctantly the chief consented that the three Indian guides should , for a time , accompany them . It was about the 25th of May , when they resumed their march from the village of the Cenis . The second day they came to a broad river , which they crossed on a raft , swimming their horses . The country was quite densely populated . They daily passed cabins and villages of the Indians , but encountered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these villages . All are essentially the same with those which we have already narrated . Day after day , with occasional halts in consequence of rains , the travellers pressed on , through the month of May and to the middle of June . Their route was generally in a northeastern direction . Their path led them through a rugged country of forests , ravines , and rivers . The average territory of each Indian tribe was about twenty miles square . Friendly Indians were always found to guide them , as it were , from post to post on their way . CHAPTER XVIII . The Close of the Drama . Ludicrous Scene . Death of M. Marle . Sympathy of the Savages . Barbaric Ceremonies . The Mississippi Reached . Joyful Interview . Ascending the River . Incidents by the Way . The Beautiful Illinois . Weary Detention . The Voyage to Mackinac . Thence to Quebec . Departure for France . Fate of the Colony . The latter part of June they approached a village , when a large number of men came out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians insisted upon carrying the Frenchmen into the village upon their backs , saying that it was their invariable custom in the reception of guests . They were constrained to submit . Seven savages stooped down , and each one received one of the guests upon his shoulders . Others led the horses . M. Joutel was a very tall man and very heavy . He also carried a gun , two pistols , some powder and lead , and several articles of clothing . The savage who undertook to carry him , was a small man , so that M. Joutel 's feet almost touched the ground . As he tottered beneath his burden , two other savages came to his aid , helping to sustain him by the legs . Thus he had three porters . The Frenchmen , whose vivacity seemed never long to forsake them , found it very difficult to restrain their laughter in view of the ludicrous spectacle they presented . It was three-quarters of a mile to the village . The porters , quite exhausted , surrendered their burdens in the cabin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them none at all . They brought water , saying that it was their custom to wash their guests , but as they perceived that the Frenchmen were encumbered with garments , they would wash only their faces . After this ceremony , they were placed upon a platform about four feet high , and addressed in long speeches of welcome . As usual there was smoking , feasting , and the exchange of presents . They then opened a very successful traffic with the Indians for the purchase of corn . These Indians had never heard the report of a gun . They were astonished in view of the deadly power of the invisible bullet ; and they implored the strangers to remain with them and aid them in a war expedition . Though M. Joutel was the historian of this expedition , they seem , by common consent , to have regarded La Salle 's brother , M. Cavalier , as their leader . He informed the Indians that they must hasten on their way , but that they hoped , ere long , to return and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other articles to exchange for their furs . This pleased them greatly . A melancholy accident occurred at this place . M. Marle went into the river to bathe . Accidentally he got beyond his depth and was drowned . The savages manifested the deepest sympathy on the occasion . They rushed to the spot in large numbers , plunged into the water , regained the lifeless body , and with mournful wailings bore it back to the village . They watched with intensest interest the rites of Christian burial . The grave of the unfortunate man was in a beautiful grove , on the banks of the river . His mourning companions raised over the spot a cross , the touching emblem of the great atoning sacrifice for sin . " It is our duty to testify , " writes M. Joutel , " to the kindness of this affectionate people . Their humanity , manifested in this sad accident , was very remarkable . Their sympathy in our grief was greater than we could have experienced in any part of Europe . " There were four very pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inhabitants seemed to be united in the most fraternal alliance . And yet these people , who could be so gentle , tender and sympathetic in receiving their friends , could be as merciless as demons in torturing their enemies . On the 30th of June , the travellers again took up their line of march . There was a wide river , near by , to be crossed . They had spent several days in this village , receiving unbounded acts of politeness and hospitality from the people . The men and the women alike vied in delicate attentions , such as could not have been expected from savages . There was a broad and deep river near by to be crossed . The chief and a large escort of the natives accompanied them to the river , and paddled them over in their canoes , swimming the horses . M. Chevalier , in taking leave of his friends , gave them some rich presents , not forgetting to make the women happy in the gift of some gorgeous beads . Several Indians guided the party to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here again they were received in the cabin of the chief with unbounded hospitality . After being welcomed with their many ceremonials of greeting , guides were furnished to accompany them to the next tribe . Thus they pressed on , day after day , with but occasional delays . Their route lay through a very rich country , abounding with deer and turkeys and prairie chickens . Village after village they entered . Tribe after tribe they met . But everywhere they encountered the same invariable hospitality . On one occasion a group of singers came to their cabin , and treated them with a serenade of plaintive music . At the same time one of their number crowned M. Chevalier with a beautiful head-dress of colored plumes . The ceremony , on this occasion , was very elaborate , in which the females as well as the men took an active part . Two girls , of remarkably graceful form , and whose symmetric limbs were but slightly veiled , were brought , evidently without any intentional immodesty , into such affectionate contact with M. Chevalier , as greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians did not expect that their wealthy guests would receive these attentions without making them some return . They seem to have regarded themselves as abundantly rewarded by a gift of a hatchet , four knives , and a few beads . They regarded the French as superior beings , and were amazed and awed by the report of the guns , and the deadly flight of the bullet . They entreated the strangers to remain with them , offering them cabins and food and wives . They had reached a broken , hilly country , with ravines and forests , and Indian trails leading in many directions . Guides were greatly needed ; and guides were always furnished . On the evening of the 24th of July , they came to the banks of a river of unusual flood and breadth . To their surprise and delight they saw , upon the opposite bank , a large cross , and near by a spacious log-cabin , such as the French were accustomed to rear at their stations . " No one , " writes M. Joutel , " can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We threw ourselves upon our knees , and with tearful eyes thanked God for having so safely led us . We had no doubt that those on the opposite shore were Frenchmen , and the cross proved that they were fellow Christians . " The inmates of the log-cabin caught sight of the strangers . Probably their dress indicated that they were not Indians . They fired two muskets as a salute . The salute was promptly returned . Immediately several canoes pushed off , from the opposite bank , paddled by Indians , and in which the travellers saw two men in European dress . They were two Frenchmen , M. Charpentier and M. Launay , both from Rouen . Their station was on the northern bank of the Arkansas River , not far from its entrance into the Mississippi . Lieutenant Tonti had established the post , that he might receive news from La Salle 's expedition . In this interview , as in nearly all the scenes of earth , joy and grief were blended . The travellers felt that now they were safe , and that return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the death of La Salle , for he was revered and loved by all who knew him . There was quite a large number of Indians at the station . They unloaded the horses , brought up the baggage , and men and women crowded around with unfeigned joy . After a short time the Indians all left the cabin , and the white men held a conference together , narrating past events . Lieutenant Tonti had stationed six men at that post . They were to remain there until they should receive tidings of La Salle 's landing at the mouth of the Mississippi . As the months passed away , and they heard nothing of his expedition , four of the party went to fort St. Louis on the Illinois River , leaving but two behind . It was decided that it was best to conceal the death of La Salle until it could be communicated by his brother , Chevalier , to the court in France . In the meantime the impression was to be left that he was still superintending the affairs of the settlement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the log-cabin of the French there was quite a group of Indian wigwams . The chief soon came and invited the newly arrived strangers to dine with him and his chief men . Mats were spread in the large cabin of the chief , and an ample feast provided . At the close of the entertainment M. Cavalier addressed them , in substance as follows : " We accompanied the Chevalier La Salle from France , to establish a settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi River . We left our colony on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , and are on our way to Canada . We have passed through the territories of very many tribes , who have all treated us in the kindest manner . It is our intention to return from Canada to the mouth of the river , with a large supply of merchandise . The people , through whose countries we have passed , have furnished us with guides . We ask the same favor of you , with canoes to ascend the river , and with a supply of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you for all the supplies with which you may furnish us . " All this was very easily said , through an interpreter . The chief expressed his surprise that they could have passed through so many tribes without having been either killed or robbed . He said that he would immediately send couriers to the other villages of his tribe , to inform them of the wishes of the Frenchmen and to decide what could be done to aid them in their object . M. Joutel gives a very alluring account of the situation and structure of this village . It was delightfully situated on an elevated plain commanding an extensive view of the river and of the adjacent country . The wigwams were substantially built , presenting very comfortable interiors . The region around was almost crowded with buffaloes , deer , antelopes , and a vast variety of prairie and water-fowls . Fruit trees and vines were abundant , and they were richly laden with their delicious burdens . Extended fields were waving luxuriantly with the golden corn . Fish of many kinds were taken from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen of the historian gives of this favored land . The tribe at that point was called the Arkansas . They occupied four large villages . Two of these villages were on the Arkansas River , and two upon the Mississippi . These savages did everything in their power to testify the pleasure with which they received the strangers . Some of their ceremonies were so tedious that the guests would gladly have avoided them . A delegation of the chiefs , from the other villages , was soon assembled . A very formal council was held . It was decided that the four villages should furnish one large boat , and one man from each village to aid in navigating it , and also the needful supply of food . One of M. Cavalier 's party , M. Barthelmy , who was a young man from Paris , weary with the long journey he had already taken , and charmed with the friendly character of the natives and the Eden-like region they had found , decided to remain there . The horses also were left . They had , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the Arkansas to the mouth of the Illinois . They had travelled , according to their estimate , seven hundred and fifty miles from their settlement on the Gulf . The French party had now dwindled to five persons . The boat in which they embarked was forty feet long . Fifteen Indians , men and women , entered the boat with them , to accompany them a part of the way . The windings of the river were such that it required a voyage of several leagues to reach its mouth . It would seem , from the narrative , that they reached a village at the mouth of the river on the 29th . Here they exchanged their large and heavy periagua , for two light canoes , with which to ascend against the swift current of the Mississippi . The next day they made twenty-four miles , and reached Cappa , the last village of the Arkansas on the Mississippi . Here the chief contrived to detain them a day , that the Indians might enjoy a few hours of barbaric festivity . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five Frenchmen and four Indians . The rapidity of the current was such that they were frequently compelled to cross the river to take advantage of the eddies . Sometimes , at points in the river , the flow was so swift that they were compelled to land , and carry the canoes and all their luggage on their shoulders around the point . The first night they encamped upon an island for greater security . The Indians in that vicinity had a bad reputation . The hardships of this voyage were very great . It was necessary for each one to ply the paddle with the utmost energy . They had often marshes to wade , dense forests to cut their way through , and desert plains to traverse beneath the rays of a blistering sun . Weary days and nights came and went . Long accustomed to every variety of wilderness life , there was no novelty to charm them . On the 19th of August they reached the mouth of the Ohio . Occasionally they landed to shoot a buffalo or a deer or a turkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which caused the Frenchmen great alarm . Should the Indians stealthily , at night , take the canoes and descend the swift current of the stream , pursuit would be impossible , and the travellers would be left on the banks of the river , in a truly deplorable condition . This rendered it necessary for them to keep a constant watch , with their arms in their hands . In this state of anxiety they continued their laborious voyage until the 30th of August , when they reached the mouth of the Missouri River . On the 2d of August they passed the famous painting on the rocks to which we have before alluded . On the 3d of September they joyfully left the Mississippi , and entered the more placid current of the Illinois. 2 They judged it to be one hundred and eighty miles from the Ohio to the Illinois . 2 M. Douay says , the 5th of September . These slight discrepancies in dates are very frequent . Upon this river they found a great and delightful change of scenery . The richest verdure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prairies , and lawn-like groves crowded with game , constantly regaled the eye . The gentle flow of the river greatly relieved them from the fatigue of the paddle . Day after day they ascended the charming stream . Night after night they enjoyed encampment in lovely groves , beneath serene skies , and feasting upon the choicest game . They frequently came to villages and encampments of the Illinois Indians , with whom they felt entirely at home . On the 11th of September a solitary Indian came down to the bank of the river , and hailed them . They understood his language , and informed him that they had come from M. de la Salle , and that they were bound to the station , farther up the river . He ran back to the encampment with the news . The whole multitude came rushing down to the river , with joyous shoutings ; and several guns were fired by them in salute . The salute was returned from the boats . This was a band of the numerous tribe of Illinois Indians from the region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have mentioned , was called St. Louis . The Indians said that Lieutenant Tonti was not then at the fort , but that he had accompanied a party of their warriors in an expedition against the Iroquois . They urged the voyagers to land and take some food with them . But the Frenchmen declined . Being now so near what they deemed their journey 's end , they were eager to press on their way . At two o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday , the 14th of September , 1687 , the weary and way-worn travellers reached the trading and military post of St. Louis . Compared with the humble wigwams of the Indians , the fort assumed majestic proportions , standing upon an eminence which commanded an extensive view of the region around . A group of Indians was gathered upon the bank . When informed that the strangers were from the settlement of La Salle , they ran back to the fort with the joyful tidings . Immediately a Frenchman was seen , rushing down to the river , followed by a tumultuous group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fort , where we found three Frenchmen . They inquired of us of the Chevalier de la Salle . We informed them that he had accompanied us a part of the way , and that we had left him about one hundred and twenty miles south of the great Cenis nation ; and that he was then in good health . In that statement there was nothing which was untrue ; for M. Cavalier and I , who said this , were not present at his death . He had left us in good health . I have already spoken of the reasons which induced us to conceal his death until we should arrive in France . " Upon entering the fort , the first movement was to go to the chapel in a body , with prayers and the Te Deum , to return thanks to God , for having conducted them so safely on their long and perilous way . La Salle was universally beloved and revered . His noble bearing , his winning deportment , his familiarity with Indian languages , his authority derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pure and sincerely devout spirit , caused him to be regarded as eminently the great man of the pioneers in this new world . He was Alonzo did everything in his power to redeem the captives , and that he ordered the dead to be buried , weeping over their misfortunes , and praying most earnestly for the salvation of their souls . Such was the wonderful career of La Salle . Next to Columbus , he was the most illustrious of the pioneers of the New World . It would be difficult to find , in history , any one who has displayed in a higher degree the noble qualities of energy , courage , and perseverance , combined with the more gentle virtues of tenderness , humanity , and amiability . Adversity seemed to have no power to dishearten him . His character was pure , and we have no reason to doubt that he was in heart a sincere Christian . In the past history of our country , there are but few names which are entitled to stand so high on its roll of fame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ END .
