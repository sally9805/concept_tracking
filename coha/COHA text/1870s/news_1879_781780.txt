txt There is good news for persons who have a prejudice against dying . A German doctor has discovered the elixir of life . Whether it is the same elixir that was used by the Count ST . GERMAIN or an entirely new one is not known , but that the German doctor has discovered a medicine which , if- regularly taken , will prolong life indefinitely , there can be no sort of doubt . Mr. TILDEN can use the elixir and live to claim the Presidency for a thousand years to come , and Gen. BUTLER can walk down the corridors of time in the direction of the Governorship of Massachusetts , sustained by the elixir of life , until he surpasses the years of METHUSELAH . One would naturally suppose that in order to prepare this priceless elixir the resources of a chemical laboratory and the skill of an able chemist would be required . This would be a mistake . The elixir is prepared solely by nature , without any advice or assistance and is purely vegetable . It is simply the juice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon-juice , we shall live forever . The German doctor ? let us call him Schneider  --  has proved this to his perfect satisfaction . Statistics , experiments , the binomial theorem , comparative philology , in short all sorts of scientific tests , have been triumphantly used by him to establish the truth of the proposition that lemon-juice is the staff of life , and we may assume , without hesitation , that the length of any man 's life varies directly as the number of lemons which he consumes . There must , of course , be a systematic method of taking lemon-juice . According to Dr. Schneider , one must begin the daily use of lemons at the age of 20 . From his twentieth to his thirtieth birthday , a man who wishes to live forever must use one lemon daily , either by eating it as he would an orange , or by drinking the juice in the shape of lemonade . From his thirtieth to his fortieth year he must use two lemons daily . During every additional decade of his life he must double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventieth and eightieth years he would require thirty-two daily lemons , and after reaching a hundred years his daily consumption of lemons for the ensuing ten years would be two hundred and fifty-six . At this ago he would be as strong as an average man of 24 years ; and so lone as he might persevere in the use of the lemon elixir his strength would undergo no diminution . Now , that Dr. Schneider has called our attention to the wonderful preservative effects of lemon-juice , we can understand the meaning of phenomena which have hitherto puzzled thinking men . Every one must have noticed the fact that the old women who sell lemonade on the street corners during the hot weather never leem to die or to grow any older . Year after year they appear in their accustomed places and supply successive generations with warm and weak lemonade . We know now that it is lemon-juice which sustains these perpetual old women . Some of them probably sold lemonade to the . Dutch small-boys of NewAmsterdam , and they will doubtless survive to slake the thirst and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have all of us wondered why it is that the train-boy who infests railway trains , and renders traveling a torture to the soul as well as a trial to the body , is never killed by any accident , but is always rescued , even from under the wreck of telescoped cars , with his basket of prize packages and his armful of unreadable novels , uninjured . The train-boy deals in lemons , and there is not a particle of doubt that in the seclusion of the baggage car he fairly soaks his interior with the prophylactic lemon-juice . It is , of course , due to a constant consumption of lemon-juice that acidulous maiden ladies of advanced years live on untouched by time , and survive the affectionate relatives that have been anxious for years to heap " floral offerings " upon their coffins . Wo need not think it wonderful that Dr. Schneider has discovered the almost miraculous properties of lemon-juice . The only wonder is that his discovery was not anticipated by HIPPOCRATES or that eminent medical man 's earliest professional associates . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory it is possible to prolong life indefinitely with lemons , there is a practical difficulty in the way of following Dr. Schneider 's prescription after one reaches an age much beyond a century . A man may be able to eat 128 , or even 256 , lemons daily , if he risas early and goes to bed late . He may thus live to see his one hundred and twentieth year , but beyond that date life can be prolonged only at a heavy outlay in lemons , and an amount of labor which only the most determined men will venture to undertake . From his one hundred and twentieth to his one hundred and thirtieth year the disciple of Dr. Schneider : Lutist manage to use 512 lemons daily , or an average of 3814 per hour , provided he works at them .. ixteen hours daily . If he undertakes to live a century and a half , he will find himself face to face with 2,043 lemons every day , and in order to attend the second centennia : celebration of his birthday , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65,536 daily lemons . In order to get through this terrible task , he must work sixteen hours a day , and consume 910 lemons  --  and a piece of lemonpeel  --  every minute . It may be safely affirmed that no man can do this  --  not even if he has practiced for years the great feat of dining in five minutes at a railway restaurant . In spite of the excellence of Dr. Schneiders theory , we must admit that until the capacity of the human mouth and stomach is greatly improved , even lemons can not prolong life much beyond 150 years . Still it is a great thing to be able to live a century and a half . We may expect to see an immediate and enormous rise in the price of lemons , followed by the bankruptcy of life insurance companies and the suicide of the heirs of rich uncles . Dr. Schneider ? though of course , under his right name ? will achieve lasting fame , and the medical profession will execrate his memory forever .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
