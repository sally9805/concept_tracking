txt It was just about dusk last evening when a Tutus reporter arrived at Graystone , the Summer residence of ex-Gov . Tilden , near Yonkers , and the Governor was just returning to the mansion with some guests after a stroll about the grounds and down the terraced hills toward the river . Entering the receptionroom , Mr. Tilden was a little out of breath after climbing the steen ascent , down which he said ho and his friends had been rambling to a distance of 300 feet below the summit on which the house stands . He said he had passed nearly the whole day in taking physical recreation , driving in the morning and riding on horseback for an hour or two in the afternoon , and laughingly added that he was improving his digestion . Going into the library , the Governor 's writing-table was littered with papers and writing materials , and on the lounge lay two open volumes of a rare edition of " Walpoliana , " enriched with interleaved antique and modern engravingsrelating to the life and times of Horace Walpole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything in respect to the statement published yesterday in the Bror/d , and made by Mr. Cyrus W. Field , in an interview with a reporter at Saratoga . The Governor said he had not seen the statements , and that if they related to the grievances lately set forth by Mr. Field , regarding elevated railway stock transactions , he did not think the subject required any further notice at his hands . The reporter having a copy of the World in his hand , ran over the points of the article in question , and the Governor said he did not see that there was anything there that required answering , most of what Mr. Field said being in reply to and contradictory of some portions of the statement made by Mr. Tilden in the interview printed in Tim TIMES of Saturday last . The reporter then asked , " Have you any objection Governor to saving whether you took an interest in Mr. Field 's purchase of elevated railroad stock for the purpose of influencing legislation on that subject , or influencing any decision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have no objection whatever , " replied Mr. Tilden . " No suggestion was made to me that I should attempt to influence either , and no engagement was made by me to use any influence with either . The truth is that the company was not in need of any legislation and did not contemplate , at that time , obtaining any new legislation whatever . It had everything which it could desire , so far as the legislative power could grant authority to build the roads in contemplation or as then projected . " The reporter asked what question was thenbefore the Court of Appeals , and Mr. Tilden replied : " The question pending in the Court of Appeals was as to the constitutionality of that legislation conferring these authorities . If the Court of Appeals decided that the law was unconstitutional , the Legislature could not cure the defect . If it decided that the law was valid , no legislation was needed . Of course , the decision of the question then pending before the Court of Appeals was important to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and the right to construct the Third-avenue line . I in no manner meddled nor attempted to meddle with the action of the Court of Appeals on tha t question . I neither did nor could , have helped the company with that court if I had desired to do so . Indeed , in a few days after I acquired my interest in the stock and bonds of the company , I sailed for Europe , and was absent from the country until long after the Court of Appeals bad rendered its decision . I bad never heard that Mr. Field had any motive in offering me a share of the stock except the motive be stated the other day , which was to reduce the risk he would have assumed in taking the whole of the stock himself . He had already offered it to Mr. Vanderbilt , as he admitted the other day , and I understand he had also sought to interest Mr. Jay Gould and Drexel , Morgan &; Co. in the investment , and it was after all these parties had successively declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preceded the purchase , that Mr. Field sought me out . " " Mr. Field , " suggested the reporter , " speaks as though you never could have been interest : ed in the investment except through him . Have you any objections to stating how you came to invest in it I " " The negotiation for the purchase of the interest in the stock and bonds which were afterward bought by Mr. Field was repeatedly proposed to me before it was submitted or proposed to him , but I was rather disinclined to ' engage in it . for reasons not now necessary to mention . Mr. Field several times called on me while he was getting up the negotiation , to talk about the property and the negotiation for the purchase of this interest . At last , when ho had made the purchase , he called again on me , threw down his contract on the table and said . I 'll give you until tomorrow morning to decide whether you will take half of that purchase . ' I was indifferent on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called to get my answer , I told him I would take half of the purchase , and I did so . It was offered to me and accepted by me , not as a favor in any sense , and without any condition whatever . If the decision of the Court of Appeals had been adverse there would have been some loss  --  if the decision was favorable it opened the way to engage in a very large , new , difficult , and uncertain undertaking . It turned out that , oven after the favorable decision by the Court of Appeals , nobody wanted to take the securities or furnish the money . There was a negotiation with Junius Morgan to advance money on the bonds at 60 , with the option of a year to take them at 75 , but he ultimately declined the proposition , and it became apparent that the road must be built by those who had their money already in it , and by nobody else . Even in January , 1878 , when it was decided to offer to the stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to take more them one-half of the amount that was offered to us , and it was with considerable difficulty and delay that new parties could bo found to go in on the same terms . After the road was built everybody said , ' Why did n't you tell rue I ' but when the subscriptions wore offered on the same terms on which the stockholders put their money into it , none of these parties , to whom it afterward looked so desirable , made their appearance . " " What does Mr. Field mean or refer to in speaking of your bad faith ' ? ' Were you under any engagement or understanding that you would not sell your stock without consulting him I " asked the reporter . " I was not under any such engagement , expressed or implied , " responded Mr. Tilden . " He undoubtedly contemplated selling largely of his own stock in Europe , and I understand that he so stated at a meeting of the Board of Directors . He was under no limitation as to how much he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done anything with it that he pleased to do , without my having any right whatever to complain . The idea that a man , holding his own stock free and contemplating the sale of it , can claim that it is ' bad faith ' in another stockholder to sell , who has made no agreement not to sell , is simply ridiculous . But .1 did n't intend to waste words on anything so preposterous , or say anything more than simply to reply to your inquiries respecting other points on this topic which are new . " In response to a question concerning Mr. Field 's assertion that Mr. Charles J. Canda was rejected as a Director in the organization of the Manhattan Company because he was not " a man of brains " and was a " mere cipher , " Mr. Tilden said he could not attempt to reply to certain of Mr. Field 's ill-natured and discourteous personal criticisms , among which this was one , but that Mr. Candi ' , was a man well known in the business community , which would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that question , and tin he was specially fitted for such a position , as was by reason of such fitness that Mr. Cand was originally appointed one of the Commis sioners of Rapid Transit .
