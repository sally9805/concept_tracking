txt There was a full attendance in the Assembly fer the first time at any Monday evening session this Winter , owing , probably , to the expectation that the Railroad Committee would report on the Erie bill . The Committee did not report , however , but promised to do so to-morrow . THE NEM - YORK VIADUCT BILL . The Viaduct Railroad bill was up as the special order in Committee of the Whole . and several amendments were proposed . The first was by Mr. WEED , of Clinton , to the effect that no person should be a director of the road who was not a stockholder , and that at least five millions of dollars should be subscribed , and ten per cent . thereof paid in , independent of the City 's subscription of five millions . before the Company should be permitted to organize . This was voted down , or . at least . declared to be lost by the Chairman , Mr. MOSELEY , of Kings , who refused to notice Mr. WEED 'S call for a count , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. ALVORD , of Onondaga , proposed the next amendment , to the effect that the Company should not consolidate with the Hudson River , the Erie , or any other railroad already built or hereafter to be built , and should not lease their road or become the lessees of any other road . This amendment was carried . Mr. WEED then offered an amendment that the plans and specifications for the road should receive the assent of the Governor , instead of permitting the Mayor and Commissioner of Public Works to overrule his objections . This was lost , and other amendments were about being proposed when a motion was made and carried that the Committee rise and report progress on the bill . It was evident from the discussion on these amendments that the Ring have determined to put this bill through at all hazards . The /five millions of dollars which the City is authorized to subscribe , and of which they are to have the handling . is too big a stake for them to lose . Speaker HrrchmAs and Tom FIELDS engineered the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was offered . They made use of their favorite argument when any Ring job Is to be put through , that the bill related exclusively to New-York , and country members had no business to have any opinions about it . When , in answer to this , it was shown that the bill authorized the construction of a railroad in every county of the State ; the Ring advocates lost their temper and resorted to threats . HITCRMAN informed the rural members that New-York " intended to have this bill anyhow , " and it was useless for them to make any opposition to it , and FIELDS went still further , and said " we are going to pass this bill precisely as it came from the Senate . " In opposing WEED 'S amendments , FIELDS said the " gentleman was only building houses for other people to live in . He might delay the bill , but he could n't prevent its passage . " This was construed to mean that WEED 'S opposition would result in encouraging the " strikers " to demand a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass the bill whateverimight be the cost . Mr. SWEET called attention to the fact that the bill , as it came down engrossed from the Senate , centained a clause not in the printed bill on file , authorizing the Board o/ Supervisors of any county to bond the county in aid of the road . Mr. RUSTED , of Westchester , and others protested strongly against this provision , which was declared to be a stretch of authority never before conferred on the Supervisors of any county . FIELDS at first denied that there was any such provision in the bill , but a second reading by the Clerk showed it was there , and how it got there nobody knows , as no such amendment was adopted in the Senate . The public can judge from this what tricks are to be resorted to in order to get the bill tinkered to suit the purposes of the Ring . while the threats of the Spealir and FIELDS show plainly that the measure is to be carried through the Legislature by wholesale bribery .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
