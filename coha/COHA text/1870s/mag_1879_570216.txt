ARTICLE 11. - THE MINISTRY TO THE POOR. * B* the poor I understand those who are wholly , or in part , destitute of all or some of the necessaries of life ,  --  food , shelter , aud clothing ,  --  and whose lives , in their general condition and tendency , are marked by unwise management and low , gross forms of wrong doing . The first of these characteristics is the result of a want of judicious instruction in regard to a wise ordering of life ; the second marks the absence of correct Christian teaching . I shall treat of the poor in this double sense , as alike destitute of moral and material good . By so doing I narrow the subject but little and practically treat of the mass of the lower classes . This appears : 1 , From facts observed in the experience of charitable individuals and societies , and from the statistics of alms-houses and prisons ; 2 , From the tendency in the condition and surroundings of the poor to the impairment of character . 1 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time relieve the applicant for charity at their doors find that their charity and good offices have been bestowed upon those whose misery is equaled only by the depravity of their lives . This is the evidence of those whose knowledge of the actual condition of the poor is limited , and whose opportunities for investigation are few . It is , also , the testimony of charitable societies and their agents , eye-witnesses of the circumstances and lives of the pauper class , that generally speaking , poverty and vice exist together . Seventy-five per cent . of the inmates of poor houses are degraded in character . An equal per cent . of the criminals confined in prisons belong to the poorer classes . 2 . The tendencies natural to a life of poverty are towards the impairment of character . Consider the loss of self-respect resulting from a low social position and dependence * It may be well to mention that the author of this Article has had unusual opportunities for becoming acquainted with the condition of the poor , and that the suggestions which be makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EKGLANDER. // upon others ;  --  the demoralizing home surroundings of the close tenement where often one room and one bed must suffice for a large family ;  --  the temptation to supply destitution from the abundance of others , and to forget want and sickness , the miseries of the present and the forebodings for the future in the dram shop ;  --  and the absence of sound , moral , and religious teachings , counteracting the force of these surroundings . If we consider these influences , we must admit that the tendency of a class of people living under them will be to a loss of character . The statement , therefore , has reasonable grounds , and will be accepted by those who examine it carefully in the light of these two arguments ; the vast majority of the poor are destitute in the double sense indicated . It must not be understood that all the poor are such as these , neither that sympathy should not exist for them . The vice and the ill-management are misfortunes equally with the poverty . They may and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false idea that crime must be dealt with harshly and that its recognition presup* poses the absence of pity . It is doubly false and hurtful that when found in connection with and resulting from destitution it should be pitilessly dealt with . The second element in my characterization of the poor is insisted upon , not from a lack of sympathy or from a desire to remove the evils of their condition by severe measures , but because truth demands it ; because a right solution of the great problem of how the poor shall be elevated , and the increase of poverty be turned to a decrease , demands it ; because I believe that ignoring it does and will prove fatal in every effort to uplift the masses ; since it is the cause , in a great degree , of poverty , and blocks the way in all attempts to remove the evil . The physician must know the disease , no matter how painful and disgusting its features , if he would effect a cure . I pass now to a consideration more in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose all successful labor for them . The worker among them finds first that they are poor ,  --  mn need of food , shelter , or clothing , or of all these ; poor today , to-morrow , this week and next , this year and next year . The task of caring for them promises to be as long as their // lives . Assistance-something for nothing-is given ; at once all efforts to help self cease ; charity becomes a resource for sloth . To encourage this is to encourage crime . The applicant for charity has been fed , but in this very act he has become degraded . Better that the body be destroyed than the soul . Such a method of relieving want being rejected as unwise and injurious , it is determined to furnish work for the aid given . Jmmediately the multitude crowd in from all directions , not only from one district or city , but from all the surrounding country . Who shall obtain employment for these vast numbers ? But if employment be found , the pauper laborer , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps unreliable ; must be watched ; he may steal , and withal he expects a trifle more pay than the ordinary workman . " Jist a bit in charity , if yer plases . " Many employers , with experience of this kind , would prefer to contribute liberally to a charitable fund , and employ men who work well and faithfully . It is impossible to relieve the destitute by supplying work . How then shall their distress be relieved ? I ask this question not with the intention of answering it in this place . I do not venture to assert that I can answer it . In the proper place , however , I shall make an attempt . It is only desired here to emphasize the fact that the poor are poor , and that he who would wisely relieve their poverty undertakes a most difficult task . In the second place , the worker among them finds that some are intemperate . All efforts for relief of their poverty are futile , so long as this habit exists . Again , some are without self-respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They grovel at the feet of a fellow-being with the brutishness of beasts . They are unclean , . reveling in filth . Many are liars , persistently adhering to the most apparent falsehoods ,  --  an evil as destructive to character as it is difficult to eradicate . Many are petty thieves ; petty because they have not the ability , daring , or opportunity for greater crimes . Many of the women and young girls , children ,  --  victims of panperism ,  - -  are low class prostitutes , while the more intelligent and attractive of them become mistresses and inmates of brothels . Some // are slothful ; want easy work and little of it . Very many are improvident and wasteful ; giving a large part of their means for the purchase of luxuries ; providing an abundance for today and trusting to some providential interposition for the supply of to-morrow 's needs . And , finally , some are possessed of all these characteristics ; and all are without that teaching , both secular and religious , which reaches mind and heart , carrying with it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone degrading but which oppose all efforts to rise , when made either by those who are under their destroying influence , or by those who hold forth the hand of help . It is decided then to provide secular and religious teaching . They shall be given such secular teaching as will lead them to respect themselves , to save money and food , to keep their homes and persons clean , to make provision for the future , and other matters of like nature . Who shall do it , and how shall it be done ? They must have religious instruction . God in Christ must be shown to them . The purity of that Sinless Life will breathe into them new life and new desires . Vice will be supplanted by righteousness . This teaching must be the greatest means for their elevation . Then , with another and a different character , with hatred for sin ,  --  for any thought or action unworthy one who aims to be as the pure Jesus ,  --  with the spiritual helpfulness which the Redeemer of fallen man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be that there will come a new ambition , a new strength by which the temporal needs will be supplied . " Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you . " Religious instruction is above all needful . With every definite step , however , towards this end , difficulties seemingly insurmountable present themselves * difficulties arising from those whom it is intended to teach , and from teachers , and from method . The Christian worker finds in pushing forward to definite results , that some are infidels . Many are indifferent to the claims of God upon them , a result chiefly of the deadening influences of their surroundings , and partly of ignorance . Others are of Roman Catholic extraction and tendencies , though not attendants on the services of that church , or if attending // but rarely . There are , also , those of Protestant extraction and tendencies who occasionally or never attend religious services . Tbe infidels , of whom comparatively speaking there are few , will combat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axioms of Christian truth . The iRoman Catholic insists on finding Christ in a Roman Catholic Church and Bible , from the lips of a priest or in mere outward forms and ceremonies . If the worker is an extremely conscientious and zealous Protestant , he considers one with such views as no better or even worse than the infidel . The Protestant , it would seem , might be sent to a church service with a simple direction as to time and place . At the church door , will the usher , with the teachings of the second chapter of James fresh in his memory , meet him ? Will he most courteously show him in his rags and vile odors to one of the best seats , whose other occupants may be the wealthiest , most cultivated , and delicately sensitive of the church members ? After the service , will the pastor stand by the door and give the stranger a most cordial greeting ? Will this be the case ? By no means ! Viewed suspiciously as he enters ,  --  after a delay of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be found again in such a place  --  the usher shows him to a seat in some out of the way spot , reserved for the poor-made a pauper in God 's house ! Men intuitively believe that God is no respecter of persons . The occupant of the pauper seat rarely makes two visits , except he is one who looks for some temporal gain . But , is it said , he should be clothed and given a few pointed hints on pride . The pauper 's seats should be done away with . He should be seated not among the best class of the congregation , but among the middle class . There can be no objection to this method of seating nor to the hints in regard to pride . One difficulty , however , is that if all the poor are clothed who will promise to attend church services on that condition , the funds of charitable societies will soon run short ? But the chief difficulty is that the clothing is received as a price paid for presence at church , the payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most appear to think the debt is paid by an attendance of one or two Sabbaths , after which they are not usually seen until new clothes are required . In many par // ticulars it may be shown to be unwise to bring the poor into church by a course such as this . Thus it is evident that great obstacles are in the way of providing religious instruction for this class within the regularly appointed places of worship . Thousands of them are for these reasons practically excluded from our churches . It is folly for one to go among them day by day , repeating , " Be good , be good ! " It is true the personal appeal is necessary , bat it will only be effective in connection with wise , regular , and permanent teaching . In summing up , I may say briefly that the poor , with respect to religious instruction , are divided into two great classes , those of the Roman Catholic and those of Protestant tendencies . The one who succeeds in imparting Christian truth to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , will find that his chief thought and effort must be directed with reference to these classes . It remains for the Christian worker , in making use of all wise and possible means for overcoming the poverty , vices , and misfortunes of the lower classes , to consider their condition in age , sex , and relation to each other . First we observe the married paupers . One who studies the evils and causes of pauperism can not but notice in how large a proportion they are found in unwise marriages . A young man and woman marry , with no just provision for themselves or a family . Jn a few years sickness or ill management or loss of work draws them into pauperism . Year by year children are born ; some to die , tortured into an early death , others to live , nursed and educated in the want , ignorance , and vices of poverty . Soon they are young men and women . Early marriages are the rule among them . Poverty is united with poverty ; ignorance with ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , they bring into the world beings more degraded than themselves , a generation for the prison and the poor-house . This is one of the most fruitful sources of pauperism . It can not be overlooked . Yet it is in this age and nation of liberty most difficult to overcome . Again , we observe that there are several classes of the young who must be reached and educated by means peculiarly adapted to each-boys , young men , girls , and young women . Each of // these classes has special temptations , and needs . The boys have the temptations of their homes and of the streets , to which no small part of their leisure time is given . They may be seen crowding about the doors of low theaters and drinking saloons , quick to see and imitate the degrading vices practiced before them . They smoke and chew tobacco , quarrel , use profane and indecent language , vividly picturing not only their present , but their future life . A few short years hurry past ; they are young men , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were restrained on the one hand by their parents and friends ; on the other , by society at large , which does not grant to boys the privileges it allows to those of larger growth . As young men , they break forth into excesses wilder because of the restraint of earlier years , and the squalidness and ignorance in which they have been nurtured . Some of them close their career as criminals , many as paupers . In regard to the girls and young women , T desire only to note the fact that they constitute distinct classes , with peculiar wants and circumstances . I have now set forth in general and in detail the condition of the poor , and the obstacles which oppose their elevation . I have done this in order that by knowing their actual condition , we may understand better the greatness of the task of elevating them , and intelligently set ourselves to devise the necessary remedies , or by examining those which are presented , we may be able to decide how well they will meet the intended ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that many of the existing means for removing the evils of pauperism are futile and pernicious . II . I pass to a consideration of the second part of the subject , with some apprehension . I am well aware that many of my views will be disputed . I know that in some respects they may be imperfectly stated , and that it may be , if they were put into practical application , that experience would prove them unwise in some particulars . Yet I present them with the firm belief not only that they would solve this great problem , if carried energetically into execution , but that they may be carried into operation , even in localities where numerous agencies are already engaged in relieving the poor . The end to be attained is to make this degraded mass of pauperized humanity selfrespecting , // self-supporting , upright , God-fearing citizens . This end must be secured by educating and Christianizing mind and heart , by careful , persistent , and thorough teaching of such moral , religious , and other truths , as will feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new life , and enaWe them to know why the new way is better than the old . The efforts must be systemized . They become thus : 1 . A society represented by a committee , with treasurer , secretary , and managing worker . This committee should be composed of both men and women . The society ought not to be under the official care of any church or churches . The committee should be one of management , so far as concerns the obtaining and disbursing of funds , and the enlarging or en gaging in work , but of advice , so far as regards the details of the work as carried on by the workers . In some parts the work must be conducted exclusively by women , hence the necessity of their codperation . The society should not be officially connected with any church organization , for many reasons . In the present condition of charitable and missionary work among the poor , it would be impossible to make such a connection , and were it possible , it would be nnwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an obstacle to successful work among Roman Catholics , and narrow it to a sect . The committee should advise , not direct the workers , for the reason that the ablest should be workers , and one in the midst of the details of an enterprise knows best what is wise to be done . He should also , not be held under restraint , by the thought that he is acting on the plans and orders of another . Freedom of action , within certain limits , is necessary . Such restraint as will answer all wise purposes will be found in the power which the committee possess of managing the funds . There will be occasions , frequently , when the worker finds his judgment at fault , and when he needs and must have the advice of a committee of those who from their knowledge and interest are able to direct him wisely . The work of the society should be of two kinds : that of planting in other localities branches of like organization and aims , and that of subdividing and adapting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of // the work may require . The planting of new societies need not be considered at length ; the method of doing this as well as the necessity , provided the parent society accomplishes the ends for which it was established , are equally apparent . The second and chief work requires an extended treatment . It is the real work of the society . It brings us into hand to hand conflict with the evils of poverty ; its various details must be as carefully laid and adjusted to one another as those in the plan of a great battle . The divisions of labor may be carried on under several departments , some with organiza* tions having a direct responsibility to the general societyothers wholly or in part independent . In creating any of these departments the society must be convinced first of its necessity , and secondly of the impossibility of successfully doing the work desired under any of the already existing departments . 1 . The missionary department consists of as many workers as the extent of the field to be covered demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churches , both Protestant and Roman Catholic . It should organize Sabbath schools and preaching services in such localities as may require them . In naming these Sabbath schools and preaching stations neither the word mission or any word which conveys a kindred idea should be used . Too much care can not be taken to exclude anything which encourages religious pauperism . By means of the Sabbath schools and the preaching stations all the difficulties which oppose permanent religious instruction are removed . If one is found whose dress will allow him , without causing any uncomfortable state of mind either to himself or others , to attend the church in whose district he resides , he should be directed thither and kept in view until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings . If his lack of suitable clothes makes it impossible for him to attend a regularly appointed place of worship , he may be attached to the preaching station till such time as he may be fitted to attend the church . The Roman Catholic may be directed tt his own place of worship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their church hold is by no means the Roman Catholic idea . The missionary in directing // and urging them to attend a church of their own choosing secures their confidence and an entrance to their homes and minds . Working in harmony with an intelligent priest , he surely if not rapidly disarms them of their false notions concerning religion : and though a Protestant , is all the more a Christian in teaching the real spirit of the greatest truths of Catholicism in the attempt to make them better men and better Christians . There may be differences of great moment between Roman Catholic and Protestant theology and church polity , but the true Christian worker will desire more to make a good Christian than a poor Protestant . Thus may be removed the difficulties which arise from the Roman Catholic and Protestant tendencies of these people as well as those which result from want of proper clothing . The missionary may also give such secular teaching as may be found to be expedient . This may take the form of week-day popular lectures on such topics as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor-familiar addresses on economy , health , the effects of uncleanness , impure air , and intoxicating liquors . Addresses on these and like topics , presented in an attractive form , together with judicious encouragment of the truths advanced , in the personal contact at their home-where there may be further explanations-will be found to supplement in a most necessary way the religious instruction . 2 . The second department is that of Law and Order . Its duties are to urge the enactment and enforcement of suitable laws to prevent the vices of poverty : to send colonies of the poor to the unoccupied lands of the west ; to encourage the building of alms-houses and work-houses where scant food and bard work should be the rule enforced in all cases with kindness and firmness . It would also discourage indiscriminate and hurtful alms-giving . This department should work in harmony with the police courts . It should examine and aid in the work of reformatories for boys and girls . Briefly , it would be the duty of this department to urge such aid as the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pauperism . // imposters who lie and beg and steal from person to person and house to house , could thus be effectually dealt with . This department need not , and perhaps should not , give aid ; but it should , after an investigation into the character of the applicant and the truth of his story , send him to one of the relief societies already in existence . This relief may be given at times by work , at times by a loan in which the smallest sum should be parted with in such a manner as to impress upon the mind that it is as difficult to borrow as to earn . Without doubt the one asking alms will be unworthy and a non-attendant on religious service8 . No doubt he will most ingeniously and persistently deny his wrong doing and have excuses plausable and numerous for his absence from church services . He must be turned over to the missionary department upon which the burden of the effort to reform will come . No matter if he can not be convicted at once of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and wise Christian instruction . He must be borne with patiently . The utmost kindness , firmness , and gentleness must be used . The fear of God , the truth of God , and the love of God must be constantly held up before him . But if after long continued and repeated trials no hopeful advance is made in his condition he must be turned over to the " law and order " department , and be dealt with by the courts . Possibly a slight experience of the punishment of the law may rouse him . In many cases it will have such an effect . If* however , neither law or gospel will work his reform he should be given into the hands of the law , and treated as a criminal . There are very few who-when careful and conscientious efforts are made - would pass through this sifting process and prove to be unredeemable reprobates . In the mean time his family , should he have one , could be under the influences of other departments of the society . 4 . The boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive froat the departments already named , should have a special department for their help . As to boys , the dangers which they meet are those which have been referred toof the streets . To overcome this , a room may be opened and supplied with games of such a kind as to interest boys , books , illustrated papers , music , and other attractions . Free // admission may be given during those hours when the boys are on the streets , which is usually during the evenings of the week . As much as possible beneath every amusement let there be hidden some instruction . Every idle boy in a city or town may be drawn for more or less time into a room of this kind . Once within the room , the power of those who manage it begins . They there become acquainted with the boys ; they speak with them on the streets ; they visit them at their homes ; they are the guardians of their idle moments . Their power may be unlimited . Not only do they keep the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways they exert a strong , healthful influence over them . This is not a religious influence , which can not wisely be exercised from the fact that many of these boys are Roman Catholics . If visits at their homes should show that they are without religious teaching , the missionary department may provide such teaching . As the boys develop in character and show a certain aptness for a particular manner of life , they should be directed and cared for so as to secure their interest in the future . Some will prove to be fitted for trades , others for a country life . Again , some might be trained to become the soldiers and sailors of the nation . With the young men a different and yet a somewhat similar method of procedure may be adopted . Rooms in like manner may be provided , with books , papers , and games . The young men might pay a small part of the expenses , and manage the details of their organization . Some trained worker might have the general direction of the rooms ; exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . He should give them such direction and teaching as their needs demanded . The amusements would attract and hold the more careless . The desire to improve would attract others . The teaching would satisfy that desire . The friendship existing between the general director and the young men would give him a power by which he could inspire and mould their future . 5 . A fifth department will be necessary for the work among the girls and young women . The workers in this department should be women . Its management should be in many respects similar to that of the department which we have just described . The girls and young women , brought together by the desire // of entertainment , may be instructed in all those industries which will be of use to them , either in obtaining a support or in their home life . As in the case of the boys and young men , so with these : influences can be thrown about them creating new and right desires , which will shape their lives . 6 . A sixth department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put in circulation useful information . There are very few of the lower classes who can not read . Hence printed and pictorial instruction is possible , and of great value . It must be borne in mind , however , that the instruction which takes this form must be made attractive , and distributed in a judicious manner . A religious tract thrown within the door of a poor hovel may do good , but the most natural sup . position is that tract , time , and money are thrown away together . The object is to place within the minds of those whom it is desired to teach certain ideas . Any method which does not clearly secure this object , should be abandoned . Any right means which secures this end should be encouraged , and adhered to , against all opposition . Light fiction is often the best dress for truth , which is to be given to the unthinking masses . The Police News may be a better medium than a religious tract . This department will cooperate with the missionary department in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more or less under the advice and direction of the missionary workers . Without question , in the practical workings of this scheme , other departments will be found to be necessary . It is believed , however , that those which have been indicated will include the essential parts of the work . III . The success of a plan such as this will depend almost wholly upon those whose hearts and minds carry it into execution . Plans may be devised without a flaw . If true men are wanting , they will faiL But if men and women are found with keen minds and brave hearts , methods which fall far short of perfection , will in their hands produce the desired results . This brings me to a consideration of some characteristics which should mark the workers . There are some elements of character which the managing worker should be specially endowed with . He must not only work , and be capable // of working in any department , but he must create and direct the work of the departments . He must be both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great undertaking which requires the cooperation of many minds , can succeed by relying on force , or the power of his position , to enforce his wishes . He must have the respect and confidence of those who labor with him for a common end . Each one of them must feel that he who directs can and will do whatever is ordered , if the one directed fails . Hence the chief worker must have the confidence of all classes , the poor , the workers whom he directs , and those who supply the means , upon whom the society relies for support . This confidence presupposes knowledge on his part of the actual condition of the poor , and of the multitudinous details by which their destitution is to be relieved . He must have an intuitive insight into human nature , by which he may understand the lower classes , select his workers , and keep the various ones who labor in the different departments working successfully and harmoniously . He must possess the power of keeping those about him at work . Large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the good of mankind , because they need directing . Whoever has the power of placing them in a field of labor with such directions as will produce quick and sure results , has an invaluable aid . He must have unusual mental and bodily activity . The innumerable demands upon his power for rapidly devising expedients , and quickly executing them , will necessitate this activity . These are the special endowments of the one who is the general in ctiief , whose heart and brain inspire and direct the work . Of the worker , in general , it may be said first , that he must be actuated by the spirit of soldierly obedience  --  a feeling that he is under God an instrument to overcome evil . He must be willing to be and to do anything that may be required of hitn . He thinks never of self , but always of God 's work and results . If he is one of the parts of a great machine , he works on silently and patiently , obeying to the letter the master power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes from him , he pushes it on with tireless activity . Yet though in a sense a soldier or a wheel within a great machine , he is so only at times as occasion may require . He // never forgets that the loyalty he owes to the entire work is ioy. alty to the spirit rather than to the letter . He works more effectively with the passage of each day . Nothing is overlooked ; nothing is forgotten . He is never satisfied with the attainments he may have made . Open and frank in all his ways he deals with men and means in an open , frank manner . The object to be attained is the removal of eviL No valuable time is occupied in spinning nicely shaded thoughts into words descriptive of how it may be accomplished . Somehow , and at once he must and does gain the desired end . He is of the poor , not above them . He recognizes the priceless worth of the soul , and that it is greater than the body . He never for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor . He accompanies one handful of temporal good with five of spiritual . He believes that man in his normal state possesses powers by which he can provide for himself , and that he is in duty bound to do this . He watches sharply anything that tends to create poverty and its consequent vices , such as low theatricals , brothels , liquor selling , Sabbath breaking , and other evils of like nature . And finally he aims to be in all things like Christ , and especially is he filled with that love which inspired the Saviour of man ; that patience , that unwearied perseverance in well doing amid good and evil report .
