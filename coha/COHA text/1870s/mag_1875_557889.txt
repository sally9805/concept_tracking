Campaigning with Max . CAMPAIGNING WITH MAX . UNION CITY was not a city at all : it wa : * hardly a village , and " Disunion " would have been its fairer designation . It lay in the woods at the crossing of two railroads , one pointing toward Mobile and one toward Memphis , but neither leading anywhere . There was a tradition that trains had once been run upon each , but many bridges had had to be rebuilt to make the short line to Columbus passable , and the rest was ruin ; for Forrest had been there with his cavalry . The land was just so much raised above the broad swamp of Northwestern Tennessee that whisky with men to drink it , and a Methodist Church South with people to attend it , were possible . With these meagre facilities for life , and the vague inducement of a railroad-crossing , Union City had struggled into an amphibious subsistence ; but it had never thriven , and its corner lots had but feebly responded to the hopes of its projectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were well-nigh iinpenetrable , and the occasional clearings were but desolate oases in the waste of marsh and fallen timber . The roads were woodtrails leading nowhere in particular , and all marked a region of the most scanty and unfulfilled promise . General Asboth , seeing ( by the map ) that it commanded , two lines of railroad , sent us to occupy this strategic point , and we gradually accumulated to the number of twenty-five hundred cavalry and four thousand infantry ; drawing our regular supplies from Columbus , and occupying our time with a happy round of drills , inspections , horse-races , cockfights , and poker . It was not an elevating existence , but it was charmingly idle , and we passed the serene and lovely autumn of 1863 in a military dreamland , where nothing ever came to disturb our quiet or to mar our repose with the realities of war . We built ourselves houses , we shot game for our tables , we made egg-nog for our evenings , and we were happy . The charm of camp life - with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the troops for a reward - made even this wilderness enjoyable . I had the advantage of seniority and command , and the physical comforts that naturally gravitate toward a commanding officer did not fail me . My house , built with the mouse-colored logs of a rebel block-house , covered with the roof of the post-office , and floored and ceiled with the smoke-mellowed lining of the Methodist church , was broad and low and snug . Its windows , also taken from the sanctuary in question , were set on their sides , and gave to each of the two rooms wide , low-browed outlooks into the woods and over the drill-ground , that would have made worse quarters agreeable . The bricks of an abandoned domestic fireside built a spacious fire-place across an angle of each of the rooms , and the clay of the locality plastered all our chinks " to keep the wind away . " I have seen more pretentious houses and more costly , but never one in which three chosen spirits -I had , in a happy moment , selected Voisin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the getting out of the simple and virtuous life of a cavalry head-quarters . We were at peace with all the world ( Forrest was in Mississippi ) ; our pay was regular , our rations were ample , and Asboth had been ordered to Pensacola . Old A. J. , his successor , - every inch a soldier , and a good fellow to the very core , - used sometimes to roll up his camp mattress and run down from Columbus for an inspection . Those are marked days in our memories . He was a lynx in the field , and wry buttoning roused him to articulate wrath ; but he unbuckled his sabre at the door , and brought only geniality within , a mellow 396 // geniality that warmed to the influences of our modest hospitality , and lasted far into the night ; and then , when the simple and inoffensive game was over , and its scores were settled , the dear old boy - usually with a smile of conquest wandering through his gray beard - would unroll his bundle before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy days , and still happier nights ! Naturally , in such a life as we led at Union City , our horses formed a very important element in our occupation and in our amusements . Soon after our arrival at Columbus , an event which had taken place a few months before , a spanking mare that I had bought to replace Ruby had gone hopelessly lame , and it became again important to all who were concerned in my peace of mind that a satisfactory substitute should be found for her . There was still in my stable a little thoroughbred ( Guy ) , who , though excellent in all respects , was a trifle under my weight , and not at all up to the rough riding that was a necessary part of our army life . He could go anywhere , could jump any practicable barrier , was fleet and sound , and in all respects admirable , but he was made for a lighter weight than mine , and , except for show and parade riding , must mainly be used to carry Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend favored me . In a second search , in which most of the officers of the regiment took a lively interest , there was found , in Frank Moore 's Battalion of the Second Illinois Cavalry , a tall , gaunt , lean , haggard , thoroughbred-looking beast , which had been captured from Merryweather 's men in Western Tennessee . He was not a handsome horse , nor was he to the ordinary eye in any respect promising , but a trial showed that he had that peculiar whalebone character , and wiry , nervous action , which come only with blood , and without which no horse is really fit for the saddle . The chances were very much against him . He did not possess the first element of beauty , save in a clean-cut head , a prominent eye , a quick ear , a thin neck , sloping shoulders , high withers , and the brilliant activity that no abuse had been able to conquer . He was held in abeyance until a careful examination of the two thousand horses at the post showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal there for my purposes . Since he had come into the army he had been in the possession of a private soldier , who had done much scouting duty , and he had been initiated successfully into the scrub racing which Illinois soldiers much affected . The serious amount of one hundred and forty dollars was hazarded in the venture , and he was transferred to our stable . That increment of value which always follows the purchase of a new horse came rapidly in his case , and it needed only a few gallops on the breezy bluffs beyond Fort Halleck to install him as prime favorite among the head-quarters mess . He was deemed worthy of the noble name of Max , and under Ike 's careful grooming he returned daily toward the blooming condition that only Second Illinois abuse had been able to subdue . In an early race with The Hun we were ingloriously beaten , but The Hun rode a marvelous little blood mare , blooming with hundreds of bushels of oats , and with two years of careful handling . Max , though beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with time and good treatment he would be ready for a more successful trial . During his period of tutelage , and while he was kept from all excessive exertion , he was inducted into the mysteries of the art , to him quite new , of jumping timber . Columbus had been occupied by Rebel and Union soldiers since the outbreak of the war , and its fences , far and wide , had all disappeared , but nowhere in the world was there a greater variety nor a more ample stock of fallen trees , whose huge boles made capital leaping-bars ; and over these almost daily for some months , beginning with the smaller ones and going gradually to the largest we could find , Max learned to carry a heavy weight with a power and precision that even Ruby could not have excelled . During all this time , ample feed , good 1875. 897 // shelter , regular exercise , and a couple of hours of Ike 's hand-rubbing daily , worked an uninterrupted improvement in limb and wind and sinews and coat , until by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become the pride of the camp . He was over sixteen hands high , of a solid dark bay color , glistening like polished mahogany , and active and spirited as a horse in training for the Derby . At Union City the head-quarters horses were stabled under a capital shed close at hand , and all that master 's eye and servant 's labor could accomplish for their care and improvement was lavished upon them , so that during our long months ' stay , we were among the best mounted men in the Western army . Our pleasure riding , and our work , was through swampy wood-roads , over obstructions of every sort , and across the occasional grass farms , with their neglected rail fences . The weather was almost uninterruptedly fine , our few visiting neighbors were miles away from us , the shooting was good , and the enjoyment we got from our vagabond life in camp was well supplemented by the royal rides we alinert daily took . Naturally , in a camp full of idle men given largely to sport , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Max and Guy were conspicuous by their successes until , long before the close of our leisurely career , but only after they had hung my walls with spurs and whips and other trophies of their successful competition with all comers , both were ruled out by the impossible odds they were obliged to give . The actual military service required was only enough to convince me that Max was a heast of endless bottom and endurance , and that , accidents apart , he would need no help in any work he might be called on to perform ; for the rest of the war , with much duty of untold severity , I habitually rode no other horse for light work or for hard , for long rides or for short ones , on the march or on parade ; and with all my sentiment for his charming predecessors , I had to confess that his equal as a campaigner had never come under my leg . He would walk like a cart-horse at the head of a marching column , would step like a lord in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a town as though vain of all applause , would leap any fence or ditch or fallen timber to which he might be put , would fly as though shot from a gun in passing along the line ; and when , whether early or late , he was taken to his stable , would eat like a hungry colt and sleep like a tired plow-horse . In all weathers and under all circumstances he was steady , honest , intelligent , and ready for every duty . I had ridden before , at home and in the army , horses ideally good ; I have ridden since , over the hunting country of Warwickshire and Northamptonshire , horses that were counted of the best , but never , before or since , have I mounted such a magnificent piece of perfectly trained and perfectly capable horseflesh . On one occasion , at Union City , word was brought in that a flag of truce from Faulkner had arrived at our picket line , and I rode out for a parley over a trifling matter of an exchange of prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company escorting him , had originally come from our neighborhood and had belonged to Merryweather 's " band . " As Max trotted up to their bivouac , he was greeted with cries of recognition , and a lieutenant of the company was kind enough to warn me that I had shown them a stronger inducement than they had hitherto had to make an attack on our position ; for , since Frank Moore had captured the horse I rode , they had determined to regain him at any risk . Happily , this laudable wish was never fulfilled , and Max remained , in spite of the devices they may have laid for his recapture . During the five months of our stay at this post , we made some hard scouts in a hard country , and we held a good part of West Tennessee under strict surveillance , but the most memorable feature of all our scouting was generally the welcome dismounting under the wide eaves of our own house ; not , I hope , that we had grown effeminate , but a 898 April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers little that memory can cherish , and prepares one for a sensation on the near approach of comfort . But five months of such life is enough , and I was not sorry when the order came that I must go for a soldier again . Sherman was about to advance eastward from Yicksburg , destroy the lines of railroad by which Forrest received supi ) lies from the fertile prairie reo'ion of Northern Mississippi , and strike the Rebellion a blow in the pit of its stomach . A. J. was to take all my infantry down the river , and the cavalry was to move to Colliersville , on the line of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad , joining a considerable cavalry force gathering there under Sooy Smith and Grierson ; thence we were to move southeasterly through Mississippi , to engage Forrest 's f&amp;rces and to meet Sherman 's army at the crossing of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad at Meridian . We lay in camp more than a week , ready to move , but awaiting orders . The country ( a very wet one ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march and the thaw came together , on the 22d of January . We were to cross the Obion River ( and bottom ) at Sharp 's Ferry , twenty-three miles southwest of our camp . The command consisted of the Fourth Missouri ( with a battery ) , Second New Jersey , Seventh Indiana , Nineteenth Pennsylvania , and Frank Moore 's Battalion of the Second Illinois ; in all about twenty - five hundred well - mounted men present for duty . The roads were deep with mud and slush , and every creek was " out of its banks " with the thaw . We reached the ferry only at nightfall of the 23d , over roads that had hourly grown deeper and more difficult . Two regiments had crossed , through floating ice ( eight horses at a trip ) , by a rope-ferry , and at nine o'clock in the evening , under a full moon and a summer temperature , I crossed with staff and escort . The river was already so swollen that we landed in two feet of water , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away on the upland . The first mile was only wet and nasty , and the trail not hard to follow . Then we came to the " back slough , " thirty feet wide , four feet deep , and still covered with four inches of ice . Those who had gone before had broken a track through this , and swept the fragments of ice forward until near the shore they were packed in for a width of ten feet or more , and to the full depth of the water . I can make no stronger statement than that we all got through safely , only wet to the skin . How it was done I do not pretend to know . Some went in one way and some in another . All I can assert is that my stalwart old Max , when he found himself standing , belly deep , in broken ice , settled quietly on his haunches and took my two hundred pounds with one spring on to dry land four feet higher than his starting point and twelve feet away , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who carried Ike , scrambled over the top of the broken ice as only he or a cat could do . The others fared variously . All were drenched , and some were hurt , but all got to the shore at last . Then came the hour - long tug to get my ambulance through , with its store of tent - hold gods , and we started for our remaining four miles . The trail , even of cavalry , is not easily followed by moonlight when covered with half a foot of water , and we lost our way , reaching camp , after fourteen miles of hard travel , at four o'clock in the morning . The river was still rapidly rising , and word was brought that Karg* , with more than half the brigade , would have to make a detour of fifty miles and cross the three forks of the Obion far to the eastward , joining us some days later , near Jackson . So we idled on , marching a few miles each day , camping early , cooking the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable friendship of the rebel population by forced contributions of subsistence , and leading , on the whole , a peaceful , unlaborious , and charming picnic life . Finally , taking Karg6 again under our wing , we pushed on , resolutely and rapCampaigning with Max. // idly , over flooded swamps , across deep , rapid rivers , and through hostile towns , to our rendezvous ; whence , under the command of two generals , and as part of an army of eight thousand well-mounted cavalry and light artillery , and all in light marching order , we started for our more serious work . The chief in command was a young and handsome , but slightly nervous individual , who eschewed the vanities of uniform , and had about himself and his horse no evidence of his military character that could not be unbuckled and dropped with his sword-belt in case of impending capture . He was vacillating in his orders , and a little anxious in his demeanor ; but he had shown himself cool and clear - headed under fire , and seemed resolutely bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome army . It would be tedious to tell all the adventures of our forward expedition ; how we marched in three columns over different roads , each for himself , and with only a vague notion where and how we should meet , and how we should support each other . As it afterward proved , the details of the order of march had been given to the commanders of the other brigades , while I had been forgotten ; so that the whole advance was vexed with crosspurposes and with the evidences of a hidden misunderstanding . The contretenips that thus came about were annoying , and , in one instance , came near being serious : as we were going into camp at Prairie Station , my advance reported having come in sight of the campfires of the enemy ; a skirmish-line was sent forward , and only on the eve of engaging did they discover that we were approaching Hepburn 's brigade , of our column , which had reached the same point by another road . The first days of our march in Mississippi were through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country as was ever seen outside of Southern Missouri . Its hills were steep , its mud was deep , its houses and farms were poor , its facilities for the subsistence of a protecting army like ours were of the most mea gre description , and its streams delayed us long with their torrents of bottomless muddy water , fast swelling from the thaw that had unlocked the snow of all the deep-buried hills and morasses of their upper waters . We built ferry-boats and swamped them , built bridges and broke them , and slowly and painfully , horse by horse , transferred the command across the nasty river beds . Tippah Creek detained us and kept us hard at work all day and all night , and we reached the Tallahatchie at New Albany barely in time to ford our last man across before it rose to an impassable depth . And then for two days we pressed forward , in company with the whole column , through the rough , rocky , and wooded country , reaching Okolona only at nightfall . Here we struck the marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with milk and honey . An interminable , fertile , rolling prairie lay before us in every direction . The stern rule of the Confederacy had compelled the planters to offset every small field of cotton with a wide area of corn , until the region had become known as the granary of the Southern army . Not only must every land-owner devote his broadest fields to the cultivation of the much-needed cereal , but one tenth of all his crop must be stacked for public use in cribs at the side of the railroad . It was an important incident of our mission to destroy everything which directly or indirectly could afford subsistence to the rebel army ; and during the two days following our arrival at Okolona , whiTe we marched as far south as West Point , the sky was red with the flames of burning corn and cotton . On a single plantation , our flanking party burned thirty-seven hundred bushels of tithe corn , which was cribbed near the railroad ; no sooner was its light seen at the plantation houses than hundreds of negroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired the railbuilt cribs in which the remaining nine tenths of the crop was stored . Driven wild with the infection , they set the torch to mansion-house , stables , cottongin , and quarters , until the whole vii-400 April , // lage-like settlement was blazing in an unchecked conflagration . To see such wealth and the accumulated products of such vast labor swept from the face of the earth , gave to the aspect of war a saddening reality , which was in strong contrast to the peaceful and harmless life our brigade had thus far led . In all this prairie region there is no waste land , and the evidences of wealth and fertility lay before us in all directions . As we marched , the negroes came en masse from every plantation to join our column , leaving only fire and absolute destruction behind them . it was estimated that during these two days ' march two thousand slaves and one thousand mules were added to our train . The incidents of all this desolation were often sickening and heart-rending ; delicate women and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glowing with pride in the valor of Southern arms and the certainty of an early independence for their beloved halfcountry , found themselves , before nightfall , homeless , penniless , and alone , in the midst of a desolate land . Captain Frank Moore , the Cossack of our brigade , went at night to an outlying plantation , of which the showy mansionhouse stood on a gentle acclivity in the edge of a fine grove . Here lived alone with an only daughter , a beautiful girl , a man who had been conspicuous in his aid to the Rebellion , and whose arrest had been ordered . The squadron drew up in front of the house and summoned its owner to come forth . He came , armed , sullen , stolid , and determined , but obviously unnerved by the force confronting him . Behind him followed his daughter , dressed in white , and with her long light hair falling over her shoulders . The sight of the hated " Yanks* ' crazed her with rage , and before her father could reply to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him wildly , " Do n't speak to the villains ! Shoot ! shoot them down , shoot them down ! " wringing her hands , and screaming with rage . The excitement was too much for his judgment , and he fired wildly on the troops . He was riddled through VOL . XXXV. - NO. 210. and though with bullets ; and as Moore turned away , he left that fine house blazing in the black night , and lighting up the figure of the crazy girl as she wandered , desolate and beautiful , to and fro before her burning home , unheeded by the negroes who ran with their hastily made bundles to join the band of their deliverers . Moore 's description of this scene in the simple language that it was his unpretending way to use , gave the most vivid picture we had seen of the unmitigated horror and badness of war . As an instrument of destruction in the enemy 's country , our raid had thus far been more successful than we could have anticipated ; but we had come for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications that its main purpose would be a failure . Our commander had evidently no stomach for a close approach to the enemy , and his injunctions at Colliersville that we were to try always to " fight at close quarters ! " " go at them as soon as possible with the sabre ! " and other valorous ejaculations , were in singular contrast to the impressions he evinced as the prospect of an actual engagement drew near . Forrest was in our front with about our own number of cavalry , but without artillery , of which we had twenty good pieces . The open country offered good fighting ground , and gave to our better drilled and more completely organized forces a decided advantage , even without our great odds in artillery . There lay before us a fair opportunity for dispersing the most effective body of cavalry in the rebel service ; and , could we effect a junction with Sherman , we should enable him to divide the Confederacy from Vicksburg to Atlanta . One of the most brilliant and damaging campaigns of the war seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement , on a fair field , with an inferior force . Yet all of us who were in a position to know the spirit with which we were commanded were conscious of a gradual oozing out at the finger ends of the determination to make a successful fight , and it was a sad night for us all when at West Point . with our skirmish-line steadily engaging // the rebel outposts , an order came to retreat with all expedition toward that we were to fall back before day- Memphis . break toward Okolona . When we left Okolona we left hope qwq bordering woods , and kept up a steady rain of fire well over our heads , where we heard that pfwit-pfwit - pfidt ! of flying bulkGs which , happily , has no relative in the whole chorus of sounds , and which is heard above all the din of battle , and is felt through every remotest nerve . At the command " Forward ! " excitement ran down the line , and there was a disposition for an immediate rush . But " Steady - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up in turn by the company officers , brought back all the effect of our three years ' discipline of the drill-ground . Later , " Steady - right dress - gallop ! " accelerated the speed without disturbing the alignment , and then , at last , " Charge ! " and with a universal yelling and brandishing of sabres we went forward like the wind . I then felt how mad a venture we had undertaken , for before us was the enemy , it is true , but the enemy behind a high and stout , staked and ridered rail fence . As we drew very near this , still under heavy fire , which now at the short range was telling , the command became conscious that the six-foot fence would withstand our shock , and it wavered . I turned to my bugler to sound the recall , when I saw him out of the corner of my eye , his white horse rearing literally to his full height and falling backward with a crash that must have killed the poor boy at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was running . The officers , being the best mounted and generally the lightest weights , soon reached the front , and " Steady - right dress - trot ! Steady - right dress - trot ! " was repeated along the line , until the drill - ground precision was regained , and then " By fours - right about - wheel ! " and we stood facing the enemy again , ready for another advance . Max had been struck by a grazing bullet and had been plunging heavily , but the wound was not serious and he was soon quieted . We now saw that our charge , futile though it seemed , had done its work . The advance of the enemy was checked ; the sight of troops that could retire and re 403 form for a new attack seemed to have a stunning effect upon them . Practically the engagement was ended . Subsequently , one of Forrest 's staf*officers told The ilun that the size of the division whfeh had charged was variously estimated at from five to ten thousand , but that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not more than two thousand . In fact , we were less than six hundred . Forrest 's report of the battle of Pontotoc states that the engagement was ended " by a cavalry charge of the enemy , which was repulsed . " There was still some sharp scrimmaging , and we had to make two or three more squadron and company charges to drive away small attacks upon our retreating guns , but the battle , as a battle , was over , and Forrest 's whole advance had been checked and ended by six hundred Fourth Missouri Dutchmen , galloping , yelling , and swinging their sabres at several thousand men well secured behind a rail fence . I had before , in drillground charges , seen old soldiers and experienced officers jump down and run away from a fence on which they were sitting to watch the advance of charging cavalry which they knew must wheel before coming within five rods of them ; but I had never supposed that hot-blooded soldiers , in the full excitement of a successful attack , could be unnerved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could by no possibility reach them . Our first setting out had driven back a thin skirmish-line which had to cross the fence under high speed ; this , doubtless , aided in the d*-&amp;icle ; the charge had stunned them , but it was the rally that stopped the pursuit . The rest of our march was without interesting incident all the way to Memphis , but it was almost incessant , day and night ; without incident , that is , that it is worth while to tell here , but our days and nights upon the road were filled with annoyance and disgust , arid with a store of unhappy and ludicrous memories that will last the life-time of . all who knew them . Campaigning with Max. // One day , at New Albany , Max and I were feeding and sleeping in the door of an old mill while the command was slowly crossing the antiquated bridge over the Tallahatchie , when I was awakened by Grierson 's riding up in great alarm , calling upon me " for God 's sake " to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being cut to pieces in the rear , and I must give him the full road for his retreat . 1 had always been a respectful subordinate , but none of us were then in the best temper ; I did not believe a word of it , and I frankly told him so . Even old Max pricked up his ears and snorted as if in derision . Almost as we were talking , there came an aid from Hepburn saying that he had found a good supply of forage and would be glad to go into camp for the night . But there was no camp to be thought of for that tired crew ; the bogey of incessant pursuit loomed up portentously close upon our rear-guard , and sent its shadow deep into the bowels of our commander , who was miles away in the advance , and who would allow us only the fewest possible hours in the very dead of night for hasty cooking and scant repose ; and we were a worn and weary lot as we finally went into camp at the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost dismounted . I had lost fifteen hundred good horses , and my men , who had been eager and ready for a successful campaign , were 1*roken in spirit and sadly weakened in discipline . All who had had to bear the brunt of the hard work needed for themselves and their horses absolute rest for days ; but being called into the city the morning after our arrival , my eyes were greeted with the spectacle of General Sooy Smith , no longer ill , and with no trace of shame or annoyance on his face . He had shed his modest and prudent attire , and shone out with all the brass radiance of a full-fledged major-general . From this time until the Fourth Missouri cavalry was mustered out of service , our head-quarters were in the immediate neighborhood of Memphis , and our life was much more active than it had been at Union City . Not very much is to be said for Max during this time , except in connection with the Sturgis expedition , beyond the fact that we lay long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used faithfully , and , so far as lie was concerned , with eminent success . The more frequent necessity for duty , the great labor of re-mounting , reorganizing , and re-drilling the command , united with the greater publicity of our position to lay some restraint on our mode of life , and to make our conduct more circumspect . Still we were not miserable , and the neighborhood of a large town has , to a well-regulated headquarters ' mess , its compensations as well as its drawbacks . Sturgis 's expedition to Guntown and back - especially back - has passed into history , and its unwritten memories will always remain with those who took part in it . Guntown is far away in Northeastern Mississippi . It is not laid down on the map of the country , but it lies just across the Tishamingo Creek , and it consists mainly of two plantation houses and a school-house . Our stay there was not long , and we were too much occupied to study the locality minutely , but it is my impression that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . We were a force of about nine thousand infantry , cavalry , and artillery , - some black and some white , some good and some bad , - sent out by Sherman as a tub to the Forrest whale ; a diversion to keep this commander from joining Hood in Northern Georgia ; though I doubt if even General Sherman in his moments of wildest enthusiasm anticipated just the issue that followed . Our march out was not rapid , and it was well ordered . We were allowed to take our train , and old John Ellard 's four stupendous mules drew our head-quarters ' wagon , well laden with the comforts we had accumulated during a long service , including a brand new , well-furnished , and abundantly stored campchest that had just arrived from St. Louis . So far as the comforts of a home 404 April , // for five youngsters can be stored in one mule-wagon , we were well supplied for a campaign of any length ; and judging from the mess-tables to which we were invited , others of the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the town of Ripley , a rather pretty New England-looking village , but like all Southern towns at that time , entirely devoid of men and overflowing with women of the most venomous and spitefiil sort , who did all in their power to add to the interest of the Sunday evening we passed in their company . We had some light skirmishing on our arrival , but whoever it was that attacked us withdrew and left us in undisturbed possession of the comfortable rooms and fire-places of the town . Our next day 's march brought us to a large open plantation on a commanding hill , whence our evening scouting parties soon found the enemy posted in some force and apparently disposed for an engagement . It seemed always Forrest 's plan to select his own fighting ground , and the plan of our commanders to gratify him . Sturgi* committed the usual folly of trying to hold every inch he had gained , and of forming his line of battle on the head of the column and under fire . ) Ve breakfasted at three in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command had the advance . The enemy allowed himself to be easily driven until half past eight , when he made some show of resistance . At this time the last of our regiments could hardly have left the camping-ground , and probably a judicious retreat would have drawn Forrest 's whole force back to the open country we had left . But " retreat " was not yet written on our banners ( of that day ) , and orders came from our general to support the advance-guard , form line of battle , and hold our position . So far as the cavalry brigade was concerned this was easily done , and we got into good line near the edge of a wood without difficnlty . Here , for four mortal hours , or until half past twelve , we carried on a tolerably equal warfare , both sides blazing away at each other with little effect across the six hundred yards of cleared 405 valley that lay between two skirts of wood . So far as the endurance of our troops was concerned , this engagement could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly thinning . Several desperate charges were made on our position , and were repulsed with considerable loss to both sides . Pending the arrival of the infantry it would have been folly for us to attempt a further advance , but had we been properly supported , or , better , had we at once fallen back upon our support , we might have given , as the post bellum reports of Forrest 's officers show , a better ending to the day 's work . It was only at half past twelve , when our ammunition was reduced to five rounds per man , and when our battery had fired its last shot , that the infantry began to arrive , and then they came a regiment at a time , or only so fast as the Forrest mill could grind them up in detail . They had taken our place , and we had withdrawn to their rear , where we were joined by one after another of the defeated or exhausted infantry regiments . Little by little the enemy pressed upon us , gaining rod after rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a splendid colored regiment , reached the field of battle at double-quick , breathless and beaten by their own speed , barely in time to check the assault until we could cross the creek and move toward the rear . The retreat was but fairly begun when we came upon our train of two hundred wagons piled pell-mell in a small field and blocked in beyond the possibility of removal . With sad eyes we saw John Ellard cut his traces and leave all that was dear to us , tents , camp-chest , poker-table , and all that we cherished , to inevitable capture . The train was our tub to the whale ; and while Forrest 's men were sacking our treasures , and refilling the caissons of all our batteries , which they had captured , we had time to form for the retreat , more or less orderly according as we had come early or late off the field . The demorallzing roar of our own guns , and the howling over our heads of our own shells , together with the sharp rattle of musketCampaigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddened the ignominious flight of the head of oar column , though , for some reason , the enemy 's advance upon us was slow . All that long night we marched on , without food and without rest . At early dawn we reached Ripley , where we panind for breath . Max had been ridden almost uninterruptedly for twentyfour hours , and for four hours had done the constant hard work that the supervision of a long line in active engagement had made necessary ; and he was glad to be unsaddled and turned for fifteen minutes into a scantily grown paddock , where he rolled and nibbled and refreshed him self as much as ordinary horses do with a whole ni0ht 's rest . The ambulances with our gx ; oaniug wounded men came pouring into the village , and to our surprise , those women , who had so recently given evidence only of a horrified hatred , pressed round to offer every aid that lay in their power , and to comfort our suffering men as only kind-hearted women can . With the increasing daylight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ever on , marching all that day , our rear-guard constantly engaged , and hundreds of our men being captured , thousands more scattering into the woods . My lieutenant-colonel , Von Helmrich , who had been for twentyeight years a cavafry officer in Germany , and who , after thirteen months in Libby Prison , had overtaken us as we were leaving Memphis , was recaptured and carried back to Richmond , - to die of a good dinner on his second release , ten months later . At nightfall , the pursuit growing weak , we halted to collect together our stragglers , but not to rest , and after a short half-hour pushed on again ; and all that interminable night , and until half past ten the next morning , when we reached Colliersville and the railroad , reinforcements and supplies , we marched , marched , marched , without rest , without sleep , and without food . The cavalry-men were mainly dismounted and driving their tired jades before them , only Max and a few others carrying their riders to the very end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar stables and backyards of the little town . Most other officers whose service had been as constant as mine had had extra horses to ride for relief , but I had never yet found march too long for Max 's wiry sinews , and trusted to him alone . He had now been ridden almost absolutely without intermission , and much of the time at a gallop or a rapid trot , for fiftyfour hours . I had had for my own support the excitement and then the anxious despair of responsible service , and Ike had filled his haversack with hard-bread from J*hn Ellard ' * abandoned wagon ; an oc*sjonal nil*ble *t this , and unlimited pipes o1 tobac* , *d*o*ified me in my end*ance pf the work ; but Max had had in the *ole* time not the half of what he woul'a have made light of for a single meal . I have known and have written about brilliant feats of other horses , but as I look over the whole range of all the best animals I have seen , I bow with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this superbly useful brute . There is an elasticity in youth and health , trained and hardened by years of active field-service , which asserts itself under the most depressing circumstances . Even this shameful and horrible defeat and flight had their ludicrous incidents , which we were permitted to appreciate . Thus , for instance , during a lull in the engagement at Guntown , I had seated myself in a rushbottomed chair under the lee of a broad tree-trunk ; a prudent pig , suspecting danger , had taken shelter between the legs of the chair , leaving , however , his rear unprotected . Random bullets have an odd way of finding weak places , and it was due to one of these that I was unseated , with an accompaniment of squeal , by the rapid and articulate flight of my companion . During our last night 's march , my brigade having the advance , and I being at its rear , Grierson ordered me to prevent the pushing ahead of the stragglers of the other brigades , who were to be recognized , he reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps ) . The order was peremptory , and was to be enforced even at the cost of cutting the offenders down . Grierson 's adjutant was at my side ; we were all sleeping more or less of the time , but constantly some hatted straggler was detected pushing toward the front , and ordered back , - the adjutant being especially sharp-eyed in detecting the mutilated sugar- loaves through the gloom . Finally , close to my right and pushing slowly to the front , in a long-strided walk , came a gray horse with a hatted rider , - an india-rubber poucho covering his uni form . I ordered him back ; the adjutaut , eager for the enforcement of the order , remonstrated at the man 's disobedience ; I ordered again , but without result ; the adjutant ejaculated , " Damn him , cut him down ! * ' I drew my sabre and laid its flat in one long , stinging welt across that black poncho : " -I who are you hitting ! ' * Then we both remembered that Grierson too wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment of a good - nature so great that an evening reunion in Memphis over a dozen of wine won his generous silence .
