txt Within the last few months our popular vocabulary has been enriched by the phrase at the head of this article . Not that the phrase was unknown before ; it has doubtless been long current among those who of old were called " the fancy , " and of later days , " sporting men ; " but it had not come into general vogue , or even within the range of general knowledge . A year ago it would have been necessary to explain to the average reader ? say an intelligent woman  --  what gate-money meant ; now , none so ignorant as to be inapprehensive of its significance . That significance , it must be confessed , does not speak well for the " muscular Christianity " of our day and country . For it shows that athletic sports have not only sunk to the lowest possible level , but that this degradation of them ( is recognized and accepted by those who profess to be their devotees .. This is to be deplored ; for it takes from athletic contests all the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well that lads and young men should ride , and walk , and row , and play ball , and fence , and even box , and that they should practice these sports with skill and with spirit ; it is well , perhaps , that they should become skillful billiard-players , although extraordinary skill in that game is almost as perilous as great dexterity at cardsis to weak-natured men . It is , perhaps , well that there should be set contests in these games , even although they involve challenges , and have resulted in " champions " ; nevertheless , it must have occurred to many hearty lovers and eager practicers of good athletic games , that at least quite as much sport , and health , and enlivenment are got out of them when they are played among friends and daily companions at any convenient time , as when they are worked up into exciting contests and grand occasions , and there are solemn umpires and a cheering , paying crowd of spectators . But the truth is that this business of contests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , outside the school play-ground , ( and perhaps even that place should not be excepted , ) to a mere struggle , often accompanied by a mean shuffle , for money . The Olympian and the Athenian games were occasions of the highest interest for all Greece ; a victory there made a man a hero for a year and distinguished for life ; it carried joy to the hearts of his father and his mother . But the prizes were at one a crown of olive leaves , at the other a crown of pine leaves ; there was no gate-money at Olympia or at Corinthia . Imagine the expression of countenance of a modern " champion , " actual or prospective , at being asked to contend for a crown of pine leavesil It is , however , not the contestants only who " go in for " athletic sports as a means of getting money . Almost always the keepers of public houses are interested in the contests , are the backers of the men , and the real fomenters of the whole affair ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gate money , and the profit of the liquors sold at their bars , which is often a very considerable sum . Recently , walking has come into favor with these persons ; and for good reason . A contest at cricket , or at base-ball , or a rowing match , or a billiard match , is over in a short time  --  generally one day , sometimes two or , at most , three , are enlivened by the crowds that assemble on these occasions ; but a walking-match can be extended over two or three or four weeks , and the gatemoney and the drinks are multiplied in proportion . The performance of Mrs. ANDERSON resulted in a small fortune to the publican who was the party chiefly in interest . The attractiveness of these walking-matches shows the desperate straits in which many people must be for amusement . The interest of a race between horses or men , on laud or water , that even of a fight , whether of cocks or men , can be understood ; but the pleasure of seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like any other man , tand only with the added knowledge that he has done a certain distance so many times before and will probably do it so many times again within a given time , it would be difficult to explain to a rational man who has vigor enough in himself to enjoy a smart walk of a mile or two or more . Into this walking business Mrs. ANDERSON 'S share of gate-money has tempted  --  inevitably  --  other women to rush . The money in prospect is , of course , their only inducement ; and with their motives we have nothing to do . But , the effect of such exhibitions is objectional in every point of view . In countries where women are treated with less respect and tender , ness than they are here , the sight of a woman tasking her physical powers day after day for the amusement of a coarse drinking crowd of menmight not he so deplore , ble as it is here ; but here , among American men and women , it is sad and shocking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just that form of physical exertion for which women are least fitted . If a woman is by chance able to go through such a struggle , she is exceptional , but by no means therefore admirable , even physically . It is to be hoped that this method of collecting gate-motley will be very short-lived . We regretted to observe that even the Inter . collegiate contest had fallen into being a mat. ter of gate-money . From the beginning of tide project we regarded it with little favor , and pointed out that such effect as it might have would not be in the direction in which our students need pressure , that of quiet , thorough , individual work , and we had occasion to remark that the contests showed the young gentlemen to be more in need of some other training of e personal nature than that in rhetoric and elocution . But we hardly expected to see these contests so soon lapse into mere shows for money , or to see the dead walls of New-York placarded with great yellow posters announcing them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be said that without gate-money the contests could not be supported ; to which it may be replied that the necessity for their support , in that manner at least , does not appear . Not unkindred with this unpleasant academical topic is the entertainment given by Harvard students to pay the expenses of their crew in their contest with Oxford and Cambridge . Outside of the narrow circle directly interested , we are sure that this announcement was seen with regret . If Harvard students can not af. ford to send a crew to England , it is no shame to them ; but to give a sort of public charity concert for that purpose is certainly not to their honor . If the " international " question as to superiority in rowing is of such great importance , it is is important enough to have its expenses provided for in a more reserved and decorous manner . And the question presents itself whether " gentlemen and scholars " of all kinds , and in all places , might not well give up these public contests for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatherers of gate-money , enjoy athletic sports amour themselves , and only for their own sake .
