ARTICLE 11. - TIlE STUDY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE . ANCIENT writers have left us a curious account of the conquest of Great Britain , which the Roman Emperor , Caligula , projected , but cau hardly be said to have achieved . A large number of meu were marched to the coast of the narrow seas which sunder the island from the continent . The troops were drawn up in battle array , the charge was sounded ; then , after these imposing preparations were ended , the soldiers were commanded to fall at once to work and gather the shells lying on the shore . With these spoils of the vanquished ocean , as he complacently termed them , the Emperor returned to Rome , and no doubt found there admirers eager and able to celebrate his courage in disregarding established methods of carrying on war , and the unexampled success which had attended his exploits . Some such course of action , followed by some such result , has not unfrequently formed part of the history of many modern reformers in their work of overthrowing old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently , though vaguely it is true , of the glorious achievements that are to be accomplished . Old things , they tell us , are passing away ; the golden age of instruction is about to be ushered in ; and the adage that there is no royal road to learning will be quoted no Inore . We have only to wait until the new macadamized highway to wisdom , constructed with all the modern improvements , is laid open for travel , in order to find our soldiers marching easily from victory to victory . So , with drums beating and banners flying , army after army sets out to demolish ancient strongholds of erroneous education , and to rear over their ruins the standard of the pure and perfect system . We read in the newspapers that the assault has been begun ; we hear details of the battle that is raging ; we await with anxiety the result , and are at last assured that a glorious victory has been gained . But when we come to inquire what has actually been accomplished , to ask // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is only a collection of shells that has been gathered . And yet so numerous are the imperfections in existing systeins of instruction , that it is melancholy to think that so much honest effort to remedy these defects should , through imsunderstanding and misdirection , come to nothing . Above all , it is painful that men , who talk so long and learnedly of the evil of studying other languages , should not have as yet thought it worth while to suggest some satisfactory plan of studying their own . For in no department of education is there a louder call for reform than in the one which has been taken as the subject of this Article . To assert that to the members of an Englishspeaking race no language can be so important and no literature so interesting as their own , would not be likely to subject any man to the accusation of making a statement either very original or very striking : and yet , if one considers solely the actual amount of attention paid in our schools to both our language and literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never occurred to any human being before . So thoroughly , indeed , has this particular branch of learning been neglected , that the very ideas in regard to the proper method of its study , which to the outside world of scholars will appear commonplace and matter of course , will to many of those engaged in the business itself of teaching , seem radical and revolutionary . For of all the cultivated languages to which , with us , the attention of students is directed , English is the one in which the least instruction has been given , and in which the little that has been given has been of so unsatisfactory a quality . In a large number of our institutions of learning , it is , strictly speaking , not taught at all ; and it is in very few , indeed , if in any that the study has been carried on in a scientific spirit . Assuredly it is no wild statement to make , that in many of our colleges a man might go through a four years course , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of Shakespeare or Milton ; and there are still very few of our schools in which he would ever be reduced to the necessity of reading a single line of their works . It is undoubtedJy quite true that not everything can be studied in a four years course , though that fact has apparently es // caped the attention of some . But without entering into any argument as to the comparative importance of different branches of learning , it is sufficient to say , that with us , men sometimes make use of Latin , Greek , French , or German , but they always speak English ; that they are occasionally lawyers , clergymen , physicians , engineers , and chemists . and as such are necessarily conversant with the literature of their respective professions ; but they all without exception are members of an English-speaking race , or at least of an English-speaking people , and as such are bound to be acquainted with the literature of the language they hear and employ . For it is here that the men of all occupations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ground ; it is here that tastes , however diverse in other respects , can feel the bond of a common sympathy and the unity of a common interest . Yet up to this time no attention has been paid to these considerations . In our schools , scarcely any preliminary preparation has been furnished . The student either picks up at hap-hazard any knowledge he may acquire of the structure of our own tongue , or he does not acquire it at all : and where insP uction is ostensibly given in the literature , it is in most cases taught at rather than taught . If these seem to be strong statements , we hope in the course of this Article to make it cleat ' to every thinking man that they are neither exaggerated nor unjust . No one , indeed , will see his way clearly to any reformu in this matter , unless he fully comprehends how thoroughly existing systems have solved the problem of how not to do it ; unless he is fully persuaded in his own mind that English should never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it is given at all . The subject , therefore , naturally divides itself into three parts , First , what is the study which in our schools now usually goes under the name of " English Language and Literature , " and what is its value ? Secondly , what should the study be ? and thirdly , how should it be carried on ? Nearly all our higher institutions of learning go upon the principle that the whole duty of man , so far as regards instruction in English , has been fully and faithfully performed , when some exercises in composition have been required of the // student , and when some manual of our literature has been gone over . This , at present , seems to he the Ultiina Thule upon which our educational pilots have fixed their eyes ; it is but few ot them that dream of the possible existence of a continent beyond . The subject of essay- writing , as it is only indirectly connected with this question , need not be spoken of for the present . But as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he derived from the study of textbooks treating of English literature , as from them alone the student usually gets all the knowledge which , as a student , he does get , it will be well to ascertain precisely the value of all such manuals , arid to examine critically the nature and importance of the information they furnish . Histories of every literature do unquestionably have a certain value : yet it can hardly be doubted that in the vast majority of cases they are immensely overrated . To some it will seem almost a sacrilege to deny the value of works of this kind , held , as many of them are , in high repute . Yet in spite of the great scholars who have buen employed in the composition of them , there can hardly fail to lurk in every reflecting mind a suspicion that there must necessarily be a vast deal of deception in the l ) retensions which such histories make , and in the results they purport to accomplish . When we consider how immense is the literature of any one cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings of any great author before , in any proper sense , they can he said to be understood ; how long a term of years is required to master any one system of philosophy ; how vast is the number of inferior writers , whose works are of value , if not so much in themselves , for the effect they have had upon their own and , upon succeeding times : when we hear all these things clearly in mind , and many other things closely related to them , we can hardly fail to find ourselves feeling considerable distrust of all histories of literature , of the accuracy of the knowledge they impart , of the justice of the criticisms they make , and of the general conclusions to which they come . For most of those who have written these works are not content with the literature of any one people or of any one limited period , though either , if faithfully executed , is apparently a sufficiently arduous task for a life-time . But projects so // petty are usually spurned by authors of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climes . " There is no height which their strong-winged thought does not attempt to scale , no depth which the plummet of their wisdom is not disposed to sound . Sometimes one , uncommonly moderate in his ambition , contents himself with undertaking to give an account of the literature of four or five great nations through four or five centuries . Yet , under these circumstances there are croakers who will feel distrust ; for it is evident that , even in such a case , it is an impossibility , in these post-diluvian days , for any one man to go through with the mere physical labor of reading , in the most hasty mannei* the books of whose contents and character he professes to give an account , let alone doing any thinking about them . lit is a necessary inference from this that all histories of literature inust , to a large extent , be made np at second-hand , and consequently must to a greater or less degree be worthless , even as regards giving any exact knowledge of the contents of the books they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature of only one people comes under consideration . Yet in the case of our own language , how unsatisfactory , as a whole , are all the works upon the subject which have yet been produced , every scholar is painfully conscious : while for those designed for students , the best that can be said of any is , that it is not positively bad . Take , for instance , Shaw 's " Manual of English Literature . " We mention it because it is the text-book usually employed in American institutions of learning , and because it is , apparently , as good as any , if not better than all the manuals upon this subject , which have been gotten up for the use of schools . Yet numerous instances occur in this work of mistakes , or mather of misstatements , which it is charitable not to ascribe to ignorance , though doubtless they are due to it : for ignorance in the getter-up of a text-book is not simply a misfortune , it is a crime . Take for illustration Udall 's drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , hut possessing a curious interest as being the transition-play between the ancient mysteries and moralities and the modern comedy . Of this Shaw gives the following account . " The action takes place // 577 in London , and the principal characters are a rich and pretty widow , her lover , and several of her suitors , the chief of whom is the foolish personage who gives the title to the play . This ridiculous pretender to gayety and love , a young heir just put into possession of his fortune , is surrounded by a n umber of intriguers and flatterers , who pretend to be his friends , and who lead the dupe into all sorts *f absurd and humiliating scrapes ; and the piece ends with the return of the favored lover from a voyage which he had undertaken in a momentary pique . The manners represented are those of the middle class of the period , and the picture given of London citizen life in the middle of the sixteenth century is curious , animated , and natural " Shaw 's knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy itself ; but from reading the account of it in Collier 's History of Dramatic Poetry , and reading that too very carelessly . Now the actual facts of the case furnish a curious contrast to the foregoing statements . The scene is nowhere indicated ; it is merely a supposition that it is in London . The several suitors of the heroine spoken of in the account above given , dwindle to one in the play ; and the number of intriguers surrounding the hero suffers a similar reduction . There is not the slightest hint that the favored lover went off on his voyage in a moment of ' pique : until his return , there is no trace of disagreement between the betrothed couple . The author of Roister Doister was Master of ' Eton , and the play was doubtless written for the boys of that college to act  --  a proceeding which was quite the correct thing theit , though not likely to find many imitators just now in the heads of our great public schools . As might naturally be suspected , the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eunuch of Terence . To the Gnatho of that drama the Matthew Merrygreeke of the English play is an exact counterpart ; and uot only is one whole character borrowed , but one whole scene is closely imitated . Roister Doister attacks the home of Christian Custance , after she has rejected him , in precisely the same way as in the Eunuch Thraso prepares to assault the residence of Thais . The curious , animated , and natural picture of London life in the sixteenth century after Christ , belongs really to Athens in the // fourth century before Christ . At least we shall be hardly justified in supposing that in the former place and period it could have been natural , though it certainly would have been curious and animated for a rejected suitor to relieve his feelings by leading in broad daylight an organized storming party against the house of his scornful lady-love . But this comedy , however important in the history of literature , is not important in literature itself ; and it may therefore be well to consider our author 's description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spenser 's Fairy Queen is a poem familiar to every one by name , if not by actual knowledge : all of us have talked about it , and some of us have read it . Now , of the way in which the action opens , and especially of the leading hero , Prince Arthur , the following account is given . " This fabulous personage , " says Shaw , " is supposed to become enamored of the Fairy Queen , who appear s to him in a dream : and arriving at her court in Fairy Land , he finds her holding a solemn feudal festival during twelve days . At her court there is a beautiful lady , for whose hand the twelve most distinguished Knights are rivals ; and in order to settle their pretensions , these twelve undertake twelve separate adventures , which furnish the materials of the action . " Some of us , it was asserted , have read Spenser 's poem ; but it is certainly an open question whether the author of the above ever did . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded into these few lines , but it would certainly have been a matter of some difficulty . For insta*ice , Prince Arthur , unquestionably saw the Fairy Queen in a dream , for he says so himself ; but that is the only way he e'Ver did see her , for he never arrived at her court . But the introduction of the beautiful lady , for whose hand the twelve most distinguished Knights are striving , is a decidedly startling addition to the original story , and proves plainly that the mind of the historian was altogether f ee from the commonplace feeling that it was at all necessary to rigidly adhere to facts . The absurdity of the statement is evident at once to any one , who is only slightly familiar with the poem ; for in nearly every one of the six books which were completed , the hero is either furnished with a mistress on the start or finds one // in the course of his adventures . In addition to this , the Knight of the third book not only has a lover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case the question of suitorship becomes exceedingly complicated . Some may hesitate to believe that so gross a misrepresentation of a poem so well known could have passed all this time in a popular text-book unquestioned ; but the incredulity of all such will be speedily removed by a perusal of the poem itself . 1f however , the reading of the thirty-four thousand six hundred and forty-one lines which constitute the Fairy Queen be deemed too arduous a task for this limited life , let any one who doubts the assertions here made , examine the letter to Sir Walter Raleigh , which Spenser published as a sort of explanation of his allegory , and in which he gives an account o* his plot . We may be mistaken ; we may have overlooked pacts and incidents which would fully bear out the account above given ; but it is difficudt to disbelieve the statement of the author himself : for the unfortunate writer , unlike his reader , could never skip anything , and therefore had to know something about the contents of his poem whether he cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied indefinitely . Still they are of no importance except as illustrating the dishonesty with which works of this kind are apt to be put together-for they can not justly be said to be composed  --  and as showing the necessity of caution in the use which should he niade of the statements they contain . But granting , for the sake of the argument , that a text-book of English literature can be made absolutely accurate , there is nothing which can prevent it from being absolutely worthless , so far as regards the communication of any real knowledge upon the subject of which it treats . For such works deal merely with the externals of literature , they do not deal with literature itself . They profess to give no account of it beyond a catalogue of names and titles ; - and however valuable a catalogue may be for reference , it is not usually very spirit-stirring in its character , nor stimulating in its influence , nor very broadening in its effects upon the mind . The lives of authors , which are usually the only part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered , only indirectly connected with literature . They are not in themselves of any // special interest , they are not in themselves of more value than the lives of the common men about us : but they are made of interest and value through the reflex light they receive from and impart to the works which those authors have produced ; yet works of which the student has not necessarily read a single word . So the pupil might learn the contents of a manual of English literature by heart , and yet not have the slightest conception of what English literature really is , or of what it has accomplished . He would in such a case know the names of the authors , the times , when they lived , and the titles of their works ; but of what they have written , which is the one important thing to know , which is the only thing that can properly be termed literature , he may not have the shadow of an idea . And yet as this branch of learning is usually taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , corn paratively of little importance , while English literature itself remains an unopened volume . So far it has been assumed throughout that the student has really studied the text book faithfully . A* an actual fact it is a thing that is seld ni done faithfully , and in the few cases where from a sense of duty this unfortunately does take place , it is apt to be attended with feelings of disgust , which are liable to be most unjustly transferred to the whole subject of English literature proper . It could not well be otherwise . The manual is crowded with accounts of men and titles of books , of which the student has never heard befre , and which he never expects or cures to hear of again . The remembrance of them is purely and constantly an effort of will . The mind is burdened with names and dates , which are gladly forgotten as soon as the necessity of retaining them in the recollection is felt to be past . In such a study , indeed , it is nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exercise whatever of judgment or critical taste . One fact is followed by another fact with which it has no necessary connection , one title of a book by another , one name of an author by another . The student is jolted through English literature over a mental " corduroy road , " and the only permanent impression left upon the mind by it is of the discomfort of the // journey , and the only effect upon the life is the very solemn resolve never to take that particular trip again . At the same time there is no need of denying that such works have a certain value . They are useful in various ways , and especially to him who has become faniiliar with the wri* tings of any author or with the writings of any particular period , and is therefore naturally interested in all that relates to the men and the times with whose productions he is in a measure conversant . Nor is it at all improbable that they sometimes stim late students to read the work they are reading about , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward as a reason for preferring the history of the literature to the literature itself . The study of alchemy may induce one to take up the study of chemistry : yet it would hardly seem worth while to substitute the former for the latter , for the sake of such a possible occurrence . But works of this kind are often an unmixed evil , because they lead men to think they know something of English literature , when they only know something about it : and there is certainly no doubt that , looked upon as a contrivance to attain the maximum of display with the minimum of real knowledge , they are frequently quite invaluable . For it is not impossible to suppose that the student can commit to memory and retain in it , for a while at least , all the contents of his text-book . Accordingly , without having seen anything for himself , without having investigated anything for himself , he has , nevertheless , his mind stored with a multitude of facts , which , properly introduced and skillfully managed , will frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and with them he can occasionally make an imposiflg show in times like these , when conversation often assumes the form , not of an interchange of ideas , but of information ; when indeed , it not rarely becomes a sort of intellectual base-ball , in which one is liable to be stunned at any morn ent by some surprising statement , or knocked down by some unexpected fact . A temporary triumph in some verbal encounter may sometimes fall to the lot of him who has thus sacrificed genuine knowledge and insight for the display of second-hand information and criticism ; but no contrivance however skillful , no tact however exquisite can long hide the real nakedness which all shams must // in the end exhibit . The man whose acquaintance with European scenery is derived from resolutely staying at home and studying Murray 's guide books , may chance to correct in some unimportant particulars the most extensive and observant traveller . But who would compare for freshness , fullness , and accuracy , the knowledge acquired by the two ? We have laid so much stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may here and there diverge from it , this method of studying English literature is the one now almost everywhere in vogue , and because th' belief in it as the best method is widely spread and firmly held . in approaching the secnd part of our subject , much that has pre - viously been said will lead the reader to anticipate the answer belonging to the question as to what should be studied . A knowledge of English literature can not only be best gained by studying the works of English authors themselves , but it can be gained in no other way . It is necessarily a slow process of acquisition , but it is a thoroughly honest one . Whatever knowledge any one gets in this manner becomes an integral part of the man himself , and forms a center about which new accretions of knowledge constantly fasten . And it is a curious fact in connection with this , that we never think of studying any other language as we do the English . In Greek or Latin , in German or French , we read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , if taught at all , is made entirely subservient and subordinate to the knowledge of the literature itself . If the position taken is a true one ; if English literature can only be known by studying the writings themselves of English authors , some other considerations come immediately into view which have a vital relation to the subject . The first is , that such a study can not , from the nature of things , be corn plete . It is the work of a life-time , and in the limited number of hours assigned to it in our schools , there is no hope of covering more than a small portion of the ground . It becomes , therefore , a matter of first importance to know what we shall study . The only fair course must necessarily be , to confine the student to the greatest authors . For instance , Chaucer , Bacon , Spenser , Shakespeare , Milton , Dryden , Pope , may be // taken as the representatives of their times , and about them the literary history of their contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the attention of the student must be limited to the particular persons here mentioned . English literature is not so poor that it can never furnish more than one great name to a generation . But it is meant to be asserted that the works of the greatest writers , whoever they are , must be made exclusively the subject of examination . It might be interesting to know and read others ; but short as is life , a college course is much shorter , and it is not to be forgotten that the study of an inferior author necessarily involves to a greater or less extent the neglect of a superior . But , again , not all the works of the greatest writers can be studied . What rule shall we adopt in selection ? That does not seem a difficult matter , provided two things are kept clearly in view . The first is , that whatever is chosen shall represent fully and fairly the mind and spirit , the essential characteristics of the author ; the second , that it shall be complete in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part forming by itself a whole . A tale of Chaucer , a book of the Fairy Queen , a play of Shakespeare , anything which will enable the student to examine and to comprehend the movement of the writer 's mind , from the beginning to the end of a finished production , is indispensable to any thorough knowledge of his character and genius . " Elegant extracts " will not do the work required . Not to speak of the injury done to such extracts by violently wrenching them from their context , it is not simply unjust to the author , but it has n.o beneficial effect upon a many s own mind to study a great writer only in his moments of exalta .. tion . Indeed , it is difficult to see more than one conceivable use of these " typical selections " and so-called " elegant extracts . " As labor-saving inventions for getting up an acquaintance with an author without the drudgery of reading his works , they doubtless serve a certain purpose . They are better than nothing , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better than nothing , but something that is best of all We have said that a real knowledge of English literature can only be acquired by studying the works of English authors themselves ; that in our schools that study must be confined to // representative authors and should embrace complete works . We now advance one step farther and say that these authoi 's should be studied in the order of time . Th&amp; reasons for this course will appear at length in the third division of this subject . At the same time it is confessedly an open question whether in the present limited knowledge possessed by schoolboys of the structure of our tongue , it is desirable to begin with an author so ancient as Chaucer . But if he be regarded as an exception to the general rule , there can certainly be no objection to our entering upon this course with the writers of the Elizabethan era , who present no peculiar difficulties of construction or expression . Assuming that the writings themselves of English authors should be studied , the third and by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered ; - that is , how shall they be studied ? It is hardly necessary to say that in the present state of instruction furnished in our language and literature , any method proposed must be in great measure a tentative method throughout . In such a branch of study , as yet everywhere in its infancy , in many places not evei* recognized as existing at all , we can not expect to see developed at once the system and perfection of detail under which other branches of learning are taught , nor even to find it supplied with the mere mechanical apparatus of good text-books with which the labors of generations of scholars have enriched every other object of investigation embraced in the college curriculum . Everything at first will necessarily be crude , many things will be imperfect . We shall content ourselves here with proposing what seem the chief things required to be aimed at and to be accomplished to make the work both in teresting and profitable to the student . Others may be able to suggest other and better methods ; at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The first thing , then , that should be sought for in this study , is to put the mind of the scholar , so far as is possible , intosuch sympathy with the author he is reading , that he will ap preciate him fully and therefore enjoy him ,  --  appreciate him in his spirit , his style , his mauner of presenting his thoughts , in everything , indeed , even to his weaknesses , which displays the // essential characteristics of the man . There is nothing really so important as this . A close and constant intimacy with the words and ideas of a great writer , will not only save the individual from all vulgarizing tendencies of thought and expression , but can not fail to have an influence on the development of the character , such as is rarely to be attained by any other agency in instruction ; and the influence must necessarily be far greater in the case of an English author than of a foreign one , because in the latter the attention of the student is always more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language in which it is clothed . Such an intimate acquaintance with the works of a great writer is always followed by an enlargement of mind , by a purification of taste , by an increase in the power of expression , which are very marked , even when the study has been carried on in a desultoi ; y and unsystematic manner . And yet while this is the most important end to be aimed at , the end to which all else should be made subsidiary , it must be confessed that to securing it the direct instruction of the teacher can not much avail . Indirectly he may be of service ; but whatever of such benefit the student receives , must be acquired mainly by himself . Little can be directly done by the instructor , save to bring the weight of his own more cultivated taste to bear upon the mind of the scholar , to assist , to enlighten , and to stimulate . It follows in the second place as a direct corollary from this - for it is involved in any proper idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his method of treating it , should be studied . The arrangement of sentences , the subordination of parts , the logical sequence of ideas , the many independent lines of thought concentring in one grand result , all these should be pointed out and their relation to each other and to the end aimed at , clearly co.rnprehended . It is not always an easy work ; but it is in all cases one which most richly repays him who does it for the labor put forth . Thirdly , all books in English literature are more or less full of references and allusions to the political and military history of the times in which they made their appearance . There are , indeed , very few great works in our language , to the complete nuderstanding of which a respectable knowledge of the era in // which they were produced is not essential . The student should be required to look up the meaning and furnish the explana. tion of all such references aud allusions . The study of the literature thus becomes intermixed with the study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English authors in a chronological order becomes manifest . A separate portion of the life of a nation is not wrenched out by itself and considered apart from what follows and what l ) recedes , but is connected naturally with a past that has already been made the subject of investigation , and with a future for the investigation of which it paves the way . It is not too much to say that if the study of English literature is faithfully carried out , an indirect result of it will be , to give the student a fair degree of knowledge of the leading events of Englisb history . Directly connected with the foregoing is a fourth point . There are in every work allusions and references to incidents of past history , to stories of ancient mythology , to manners and customs long laid aside and frequently forgotten . The ordinary reader , when lie meets these , usually pays no attention to them , if he is not previously acquainted with what they mean . But the student must be taught to feel that his duty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command for the full comprehension of them , and can in consequence recognize the reason of their introduction by the author . Fifthly , along with the works he is reading , the student should be compelled to make himself acquainted with that external history of literature , which with us is generally the only thing taught in this branch of learning , but which as now studied , can hardly fail to be regarded as a waste of time . For our present method of teaching this violates the order of nature : it is only by some such plan as here proposed that instruction in it can ever be successfully given . That knowledge which , under the system usually adopted , is learned with disrelish and forgotten with speed , will under changed conditions be sought for with avidity and retained with ease . For it is a marked characteristic of our minds that the interest we feel in any book is always carried over in a greater or less degree to its author . As soon as we become engrossed in what he says // we wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , his relations with his contemporaries* the influence of other writers upon him , the influence he has exerted upon the men and manners of his own time . Under the system of studying the works themselves of great authors , all that a large number of students will really need in the investigation of literary history , will be direction . Stiniulus will be imparted by their interest in the author they are reading ; and the facts they gather in regard to the external life of the man and his times , will be treasured in the memory , because associated with that positive knowledge of his character and inner life which comes from familiarity with his writings . But as in the method here proposed , it is not designed to leave anything to chance , this will form no exception . During the process of reading any particular work of an author , the literary history of himself and his times can be made to pass in review . The failures he made , the successes he achieved , the influence he exerted upon the writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded or overthrew , the acts and lives of the most illustrious of his contemporaries , all these and kindred topics furnish a field for investigation which would be examined on their own account by some , but which should be required of all . Such matters , indeed , furnish the best and most legitimate subjects for those exercises in English composition which are everywhere made the object of so much attention in American colleges . It is hardly necessary to point out how important it is that under such circumstances the authors should be studied in the order of time . Sixth and lastly , we come now to one grand division by itself so broad , so vast , that only the merest outline of what is desirable , can here be given . We refer to the history of the language , its words , its phrases , its idioms , its grammatical forms , not less than the changing character of the influences which have affected diversely at divers times the style of those who have made use of it . For the sake of studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken up in chronological order . It is by that method that changes in the meaning of words , that the giving up of old idioms and the adoption of new ones , the discarding of ancient forms of // expression and their cropping-out in other times and under other circumstances , in fine , those grand mysterious processes of life and death , of ruin and regeneration , which in ever-recurring cycles are constantly going on in the history of every language , that all these can be clearliest observed and most vividly impressed upon the memory . To state the claims of this one department fully would require a separate Article ; we can do little more than mention it here . Yet it may be proper to say that in any system of study which sets out to give a genuine knowledge of the English language , Anglo-Saxon must be made compulsory . Not many years can elapse before this conclusion will be reached by all whose interest in higher education leads them to pay attention to this particular subject . Already , indeed , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . A knowledge of our primitive tongne throws in fact so much light upon the whole internal structure of our present language , that it is even now the easiest and surest method of securing an accurate acquaintance with the latter , and the time can not be far distant when the study of Anglo-Saxon will be regarded as an essential part of a complete English education . An indirect but most happy result of such a state of things will be the extermination of that vast and increasing swarm of so-called English grammars , which exasperate scholars and make life a burden to students . Every country school-master now feels called upon to lay down the laws of a language which , so far from writing elegantly , he can not ordinarily write correctly , and finds plenty of men to publish and to praise the crude conceptions of his own and the unwarranted inferences and blundering statements he has borrowed from others as ill-informed as himself Nothing but the ignorance of the public and the indifference of the educated , could have so long tolerated that almost inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue without any knowledge of either Anglo-Saxon or Early English . With the latter the student of Chaucer must from the nature of things gain some acquaintance . But even for him it is not advisable to begin so late as this The language is then in a transition state ; everything is confused , much is fragmentary ; the ancient order of things // as a whole is broken up , the ancient inflection is laid aside , while yet everywhere traces of the past remain . He is thus brought face to face with a revolution which is only partially completed . For him to understand its origin and the course it is taking , it is even more essential than for the student of later English , to make a full examination of our primitive tongue . And when once this need is felt by all , the general demand for them will supply speedily good text books for instruction , in which this branch of learning has confessedly been , at least until lately , exceedingly poor . But right here lies one danger , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing as too close and exclusive an attention to grammatical and philological details . Our object is to give knowledge and appreciation of English literature ; and care must therefore be taken that we do not yield to the too common tendency in education of substituting the sign for the thing signified , that we are not so occupied with the means that we forget the end . We study the language for the sake of the literature , not the literature for the sake of the language . Minute and microscopic investigations have an importance that can not be over-estimated . But it would be exceedingly unfortunate if the standards by which they measure objects were to be extended to all cases of vision or if the excessive magnitudes they give us were to take the place of that natural and orderly proportion which is furnished by our unassisted eye-sight . No acquaintance , however minute , with verbal forms , no knowledge , however accurate , of points of detail , can be satisfactory to any clear-thinking man , if , in gaining them he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Philology is an interesting and important study ; it is worthy of the sin cerest devotion for itself ; but it is not literature ; and the study of the one must never be mistaken for the study of the other . The information furnished by the former will often be of incalculable value for the comprehension of the latter ; but the value is in this case a subsidiary and not an independent value . Confine the attention of the student to mere grammatical and verbal details , and the noblest productions of prose or poetry will lose for him their highest and most legitimate charm , that subtle // fascination which in a healthy mind is so easy to be felt , but is so hard to be defined . The familiarity thus gained with the mere words and phrases of beautiful extracts is poor compensation for the loss of that keen appreciation , that freshness and glow , as lustrous but as evanescent as the bloom of fruit , which the rude grasp of philology often causes at once to fade , never to return . Instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our preparatory schools , where degrading associations frequently destroy for particular individuals all power of appreciating some of the finest passages of English prose and poetry . Especially has this been the care with Milton , whose Paradise Lost has been for many vulgarized forever by the profan ation of parsing . A work so doleful and funereal as Yonng 's Night Thoughts would not be an nnsuitable one to be employed in so doleful and funereal an exercise , and no great harm might result . But the beauty and the majesty of Milton 's verse sink in the mind of the scholar to the level of the baldest corn rnonplace , and no after-stndy on his part can furnish enjoyment , or revive a glory really there , but which for him has faded away forever . No later devices are sufficient to restore the freshness and life once lost . The funeral-baked meat ' * , as is ever the case , do coldly furnish forth the marriage tables . But this is a danger belonging rather to the future than the present ; in the existing condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any damage of this kind will be done . And , incidentally , it may be well to mention here one positive benefit which will result from the study of English literature as pursned in this manner . This is , that it will furnish in great measure a corrective to that widely-spread habit , born of newspaper and novel-reading , of running over the words of a book without gaining the least idea of its contents . This to some may not seem a matter of moment ; but even the slightest experience in the teaching of English will convince any one that with a liberal estimate the average man , under ordinary circumstances , does not remember one-fourth of what he reads nor understand one-half . The fact that he knows the meaning of each of the individual words that go to make up time sentence , is to hitn sufficient proof that he knows the meaning of the sentence as a whole . His eye runs over the printed // page , his face is directed steadily toward it ; but his brain gets of its contents just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cow , calmly standing on a summer day and coiftemplatively chewing its cud , gets of the beauties of nature-no less and no more . It is not meant to be asserted that in these days of multifarious reading a man is bound to make a mere lumber-yard of his memory , by storing in it every thing which he chances to come across : and every one of us knows personally sonme men who would be far greater ornaments to society than they now are , had they taken half the pains to forget what they have remembered that they have to remember what they have forgotten . Yet in spite of all this , it is hard to imagine a much better intellectual discipline for any young man than to be compelled , in going over an English author , to stop at the end of every sentence and ask himself if lie really understands what he has been reading . If forced by external pressure to do this thoroughly in a few instances , there is hope that on other occasions , when the work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for himself . We recognize fully that in such a course as is laid down here , the knowledge of the literature will be necessarily imperfect and incomplete . Still , it is knowledge , so far as it goes , which is far more than can be said of the method now generally pursued . And the greatest and most desirable result of all has been achieved , if the scholar has by it been taught how to study . For in at least three cases out of five , the student is not going to stop with what he has acquired in the schooLroom . His *rot iz*c* has been secured . He is on firm ground from which to prosecute his investigations for himself , and the interest he may have gained in any particular man or in any particular era , will lead him to extend his knowledge far beyond the little that has been made the subject of direct instruction in the limited time given to it in his college course . But even granting that he does nothing more , granting that after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of a single classic author , yet even in such a case he has already done more than perhaps a majority of professedly educated men at present do . Suppose that under the proposed system he has gained a thorough knowledge of one master-piece of Chaucer , // one of Bacon , of Spenser , of Shakespeare , of Milton , of Dryden , of Addison , of Pope , of Burke , of Wordsworth , and of Tennyson . How many of our college graduates can ever say as much ? Are we told that we propose too much ; that the method recommended , however flue in theory , will not work in practice ; or that it will divert the attention of the scholar from other studies equally necessary , if not more important ? As to the object proposed being too high , if that is a fault , it is at least a fault that leans to virtue 's side . Believing with Sir Philip Sidney that he who shoots his arrow at the sun , though he may not succeed in reaching what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he who aims at something on a level with himself , we should hold it a far safer course to set up a standard difficult if not impossible of attainment , rather than one which is no perceptible improvement upon the standard now in use . But there is in reality nothing difficult or impossible of attainment in the standard here proposed . It will not work in practice ! Why not ? It is nothing more , indeed , than what in the study of Latin and Greek every college in the land requires in theory , however imperfectly many of them carry out the requirement in practice . No more is proposed here than that English should be treated no longer with the indifference with which it is now regarded , that it should be lifted up from the degradation in which it is now sunk , and that in all our schools it should take its rightful place beside all languages , living or dead , that are made the subjects of special instruction . There is , in reality , no compromise possible in this matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught completely , or practically it will not be taught at all . In this case , fortunately , a middle course , the everlasting resource of middling minds , is not feasible . Nor , as actual experience will demonstrate far better than any statements that can be made here , will it take up so much of the time of the college course as from the extent of the subject might be supposed . For the great difficulty which retards the student in the acquisition of other languages and literatures is done away with entirely in this instance by his previous knowledge of his own tongue . Moreover this is a study that is ca // pable of indefinite expansion and contraction : and whenever the authorities of any institution find that the pupils entrusted to their care , are beginning to know more of English and to devote more time to it than is good for them , a short application of any ordinary manual of our literature is all that will be required to bring the very ecstasy of enthusiasm down to the most rational level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frequently implied , though it has not been directly stated , that English literature studied as here proposed , will not only be interesting in itself but that in many cases it will be apt to awaken the enthusiasm of students . But let no one delude himself with the vain idea that it will be equally interesting to all , or that it will not be distasteful to some . We know that there flourishes at present a class of advanced thinkers , who hold that all the ignorance now prevailing in Christendom is due to the study of Latin and Greek ; that once sweep away these relics of the dark ages , and the road to wisdom becomes on the instant effulgent with shining light ; once remove these stumbling-blocks trom his path , and the youthful student will go up the hill of science on a run ; or rather that to him , lyivlg on his back in the shade , without the labor of plucking on his part , the fruit from the tree of knowledge will of its own accord drop into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Greek are abolished , and mathematics are finished at least by the age of fourteen , when the young American studies only what is useful and practical , above all when he will not be forced to learn anything he does not care to learn , then , when all these things come to pass , it might be hoped that the department , whose claims are advocated here , might survive and even flourish amid the wreck of matter and the crash of colleges . But so long as education implies work , the innate laziness of human nature may be trusted to render the acquisition of it hateful to some , and more or less difficult to all ; and grievous as is the fact , a knowledge of English literature can no more be gained without labor than a knowledge of any other branch of study . To him , indeed , who hates the toil of thinking it will be often irksome and distasteful , more especially if he belongs to that // class in whom literary taste has neither been implanted by nature nor developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may not impossibly be urged , we close this part of our subject . It may be claimed that a knowledge of English literature can be better acquired later in life , after the mind is completely matured and its faculties thoroughly disciplined ; that then it can be pursued to the best advantage , and from it the best results can be secured . It is not necessary to assert in answer that there is no branch of learning to which the same remark will not justly apply . It is not necessary to point out the absurdity of the policy of leaving to later years the development of the chief agency in the cultivation of literary taste . But it is necessary to protest most earnestly against the narrow idea of the importance of this study which the objection implies . For English-we use the word in its widest sense as including both the language and the literature-is to us not only second to no other study in importance , but is superior to all . It is not a matter of which any one , whatever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant . To us it is not and never can be a special study . A knowledge of it is not simply the privilege , it is the duty and should be the pride of every man who boasts his birth-right as a member of the great race which speaks it , who glories in his heritage in the words and works of illustrious men which are the majestic trophies of its intellectual conquests . But for the majority , that familiarity with what it has achieved must be gained in early years or never gained at all . XV e must look upon men as they are , not upon them as they ought to be ; we must judge them by what they do , not by what they ought to do . It is a significant fact that in any country the classic authors are the last and least read . Particular exceptions may sometimes occur in the case of one or two , as , for instance , in English , in the case of Shakespeare . But for all that even the average educated man knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well have written their works in a foreign tongue . Dryden , for illustration , is a prominent name in English literature . Yet how many of so-called educated men have consciously read a single line of his writings , or how many can be said to be familiar // with a single one of his productions ? The same is true of the minor works of Milton , and would have been true of his Paradise Lost , had not the grammatical exercises of the preparatory schools kept alive the poem , while they destroyed the poetry . Indeed , to suppose that any one , in the turmoil of business , in the strife of politics or hurry of life , will stop and turn aside to acquire information which , in the quiet and leisure of early years he was unable to gain , or to develop literary taste which he then neglected to cultivate , is a belief which , however creditable to our faith in the average man , is not based upon a very accurate knowledge of his character . We may rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ordinary circumstances , be studied in youth , or they will never be studied at all ; and that the taste for literature must be developed then , if it is expected to manifest activity in later life We conme now to the consideration of another subject , which , though not directly included in the department of English literature , is inseparably connected with it in our system of instruction . By what means shall the student be best enabled to acquire a clear and correct , if not an elegant style ? The marked difference between this and the foregoing inquiries must be kept clearly in view . To borrow the terms of political economy , the student , instead of being a consumer , must be taught to become a successful producer of literature . A problem difficult of solution in itself varies here its conditions with the character and circumstances of the individual . This is not the place to enter into the minor details of this question . But there are connected with it some general principles which , clearly borne in mind , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us a distinct perception of the proper course to be pursued . Before doing this , however , it will be necessary to clear away some of the rubbish which has collected around this whole m'atter ; and in so doing , it will be equally necessary to ascertain the exact value of a study now generally pursued in the college course . Logic is sometimes and Rhetoric is almost always included in the department of English . This is in a great measure arbitrary , for both studies being universal in their nature have // no special connection with any one language . The former has up to a very late period led a somewhat feeble life ; but the latter has always shown more vitality , from its supposed tendency to enable the student to acquire a finished style . Thc demand for text-books being great , the subject has naturally been a favorite one for authors ; and just as in our country , men who do not have money enough to found a college , found instead of it a university , so men who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hand upon a rhetoric . Doubtless many of the treatises on this subject , which so constantly appear , are of value . Yet , as a general rule , it can safely be said that the great difficulty with them is , that those which are good for anything are not fit for text-books , and those which are fitted for text-books are not good for anything . But granting , what is not impossible , that a perfect work has been produced , and that it will be taught by a perfectly competent instructor , yet the knowledge thus acquired will not have a particle of influence in imparting a single positive excellence of style . It is right at this point that the whole subject becomes involved in a fog which completely beclouds the intellects of many who ought to know better , but who without thinking fi3dl in with the prevalent popular ideas floating about them . For there is certainly a wide-spread opinion that by some method not very distinctly defined , every student can be taught to have a clear , expressive and forcible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor must both so conjoin and work together that nothing but the most glaring and culpable neglect on the part of the pupil can save him from writing English , if not elegantly , at least perspicuously . This is an idea so prevalent that some attention must be paid to it , though the slightest reflection is enough to convince any thinking man that a quality so subtle , so intangible , so incapable of ultimate analysis as style , can never be made the subject of direct instruction . That may give him a knowledge of the names of different styles and of the various characteristics which go to make up the one which is perfect ; but the perfect style itself it does not and it can not impart . Rhetoric may enable a man to describe in scientific terms // what he has been doing , but it will never help him to do it . Admitting that the rules which it gives him are the best possible rules , it does not and it can not furnish the power of applying them , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fallacy in reasoning will be no clearer to his mind and no easier of detection , after logic tells him that its form is that of a disjunctive hypothetical with the major false . A man is not going to walk any better or faster after being made acquainted with the fact that the two principal bones of his leg are the tibia and the femur , nor will he strike a harder blow because he has learned that in so doing he bends the flexor and straightens the extensor muscles of his arm . Power and skill and grace come from a different quarter , and are entirely independent of the knowledge thus obtained . We well remember a young man who , before beginning his commencement oration , sat down , and as a preparatory exercise , read through the whole of Whately 's treatise on Rhetoric , yet after ilnisliing it was profoundly astonished to find that lie was able to write no better than he could before . Such mistakes would be ludicrous were they not so common . For to every man who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , there can not fail to be an element of sadness in every instance lie witnesses of energies perverted and enthusiasm mIsapplied . But there is a certain work which rhetoric and rhetorical instruction can do , which is an important work , though far from having the value which is sometimes mistakenly claimed for it . But it is of a negative character , and its exact use in ust be clearly borne in mind and its exact limitations understood . The teacher can not impart positive excellence . TIe can not communicate the subtle graces of expression which arrest and lix the attention . He can not convey even the appreciation , far less the realization of that rhythmical modulation , that balance of periods , that ebb and flow of movement , so regulated that nothing shall seem abrupt , nothing dissonant , nothing wanting to coluplete the perfect harmony of the sentence . He can not even impart that first and simplest requisite of sty le , perspicuity : for back of clearness of expression lies clearness of ideas , and clearness of ideas is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bat if he can not impart positive excellence , he can at least save from positive defect ; he can correct the countless errors of language , whose presence is a discredif though their absence can hardly be called a virtue ; he can not only show what is to be shunned , but he can direct the attention to what is to be sought for and to be imitated ; and varying materially with his character and circumstances he can stiniulate those under him , by precept and exarriple , to higher degrees of attainment . But in general , he stands merely like a guideboard to point out the road to excellence ; lie can not save anyone from the toil and trouble of the journey . His work is a humble , but it is in most cases a necessary work , and faithfully and skillfully performed will often be no mean agency in the development of critical taste . The question now remains , How is positive excellence to be obtained ? If power and skill in expression do not come from the study of Rhetoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any style is doubtless due to the peculiar character of the individual , which education may modify , but can neither give nor take away . But as the mark and the result of culture , it is due to that imitation , sometimes conscious , more often unconscious , of the style of others whom the individual regards as his superiors . Right here lies the true way and the only way to impart to any student the highest qualities of expression . Composition either in prose or poetry , is an imitative art , and that very fact points out the proper course to pursue . Throwing out of view the consideration of excessive natural ability , which may take any particular case out from under the operation of general laws , a good style can be acquired best and soonest-for the majority of men it may be said only-by a careful study of the best English writers , just as elegant manners can be best and soonest acquired , not by studying books of etiquette , but by associating with refined and cultivated persons . To become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imitate unconsciously his manner , to be influenced by his words and thoughts , to feel profoundly his power , is worth more for the development of expression than all the study of all the grammatical and rhetorical rules that were ever in- // 599 vented . He who has sat at the feet of the great masters of English literature need have no fear but their spirit will inform the life , and touch , as with fire , the lips of their disciple . But just in proportion as such an influence in the development of expression is more important than any other , in just the same proportion is it likely to be overlooked and despised , because its effects are not apparent upon the surface , and often do not manifest themselves until after long intervals of time . Not unfrequently , in consequence , are these effects referred by the common mind to causes with which they have no real connection . But great writers have never failed to arrive at correct results in their own case . Spenser acknowledges his obligation to Chaucer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of these ever thought of attributing his superiority to the study of rhetorical rules . And here it is , and on this account it is , that we make our final appeal for the fuller study of the language and literature we have inherited but have too much neglected and despised . It may be said that this end is already provided for ; that the works of the greatest authors are read in every school , the men whose productions exhibit graces of style which modern writers do not pretend to surpass or even to rival . The argument is a fallacious one . No foreign author can do the work here demanded or have the effect here required . Their superiority will not be imitated , because , though it may be seen , it is not felt . If a student understood Latin , for instance , as he does English ; if its words were as familiar , and came to him as spontaneously as the words in which are recounted the thoughts of his mind , the feelings of his heart , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force not now belonging to it . But no such thing does take place or can take place , except in exceedingly rare instances . The ordinary student has no conception whatever of the beauty of the Latin arrangement and style . The same thing is frequently true of even an accomplished scholar , not because he does not have an intellectual comprehension of it , but because he does not feel it ; and so long as the mind is absorbed in the intricacies of construction , it is little apt to be influenced by beauties of expression . // The highest culture must , therefore , be based upon the study of our own literature . Any other foundation is too narrow for us to think to build upon it lofty and enduring achievement . For the culture derived from any other source reaches its culminating point speedily . It has no healing waters in which to renew its vitality ; it knows no fountain of youth , whose life-giving properties enable it to go on from strength to strength . The power of expression does not keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of ripest study , of widest observation , of profoundest thought* are stated in the language of the school-boy. iNor can such a state of things be changed , except by the introduction of agencies that operate upon the mind in early years . The institution of learning which neglects literature may turn out in abundance great scholars , lawyers , metaphysicians , and statesmen ; but it will never , save by accident , turn out men of letters . The atmosphere in which they flourish is not created ; the stimulus that springs from association and sympathy is denied . And the policy of disregarding , not to say despising , this study produces its legitimate results . The culture created , such as it is , is shorn of its due influence both on the present and on future times . *For the achievements of scholars , however great , fade in splendor with every new achievement of those who follow them . The fame of lawyers is confined to their own profession , and is as transitory as it is limited . Systems of philosophy wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the shadow of a name to-morrow . The audience of all these is few , for they appeal but to a class or to a time . But literature appeals to all classes and to all times ; and that oblivion , which sooner or later overtakes nearly all mortal achievement , reaches it last of all . It has not been asserted , nor is it meant to be asserted , that the criticism here iimade of existing methods is true of all institutions of learning . It is by no means impossible that there are some schools in which far better methods than the one here proposed have been long in operation . But if such exist , they are confined to particular places and are practised by particular teachers . No satisfactory system of // instruction in our literature has yet been adopted generally , though culture everywhere languishes under the neglect . In this , as in other things , our words and works display their usual inconsistency . We complain , and complain justly , that with us artistic taste remains either undeveloped or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not here to be seen and stadied . Yet , what right have we to make such a complaint , when a kindred culture and taste suffers from the neglect of master-pieces that are accessible to all , and whose very accessibility causes them to be disregarded and despised ? We now go through English literature like the night-traveler on a great railway line , who whirled rapidly through hamlet and village , and city , reaches his destination at last with no knowledge of the country he has been through ; nothing indeed , left upon his mind but a vivid consciousness of the weariness of his journey , and a confused remembrance of names and stations . We ask that this shall not simply be reformed indifferently , but shall be reformed altogether ; that the chief agency in the refinement of mind , the cultivation of taste , and the development of expression , shall no longer be left to random study or individual caprice ; and if Milton , in a less enlightened age , could avow his conviction that Speuser was a better teacher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that such seed , sown in youth , will in later years flower out into a broad and generous culture and a manly life .
