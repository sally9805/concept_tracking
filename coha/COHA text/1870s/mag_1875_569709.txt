ARTICLE IV. - THE TROUBLE WITH THE CAUCUS . THAT there is some trouble with the caucus is plain enough . The nominations of both parties are in many cases not fit to be made . The men nominated are either unknown or known unfavorably , and yet the nomination of a regular caucus is , in the case of the party in power , almost a guarantee of election . And so the corruption of our government , State and municipal , is continually growing with the increasing knavery and imbecility of the representatives of our caucuses . Now we often hear it said that if the " good men " would go to the caucuses the result would be different . Their abilities and character would command respect , and secure the nomination of respectable candidates . Before an election most of the better class of newspapers preach editorial sermons on this text , discourses that have a curious likeness to those computations one sometimes hears of the number of heathen that might be converted with the money spent for tobacco , or the number of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow the good seed does not seem to fall on the right sort of ground , and the use of tobacco and whiskey and the corruption of the caucus go on increasing . The " if " in either case is too large ; the conclusion might follow if the premises were established ; but the " good men " wo n't go to the caucuses . Some advisers say , in despair of other means of reform , " iDisregard the caucus nomination , vote against all bad men that are nominated , and thus compel the nomination of good men . " But then the diffleulty arises , that the candidates of both parties are equally objectionable or equally unknown , and there being no mode of union adopted among the " good men , " it may follow that a dis0usted Republican will vote for the Democratic nominee and a discontented Democrat for the Republican ; or both may decline to vote altogether . This result , those evil spirits , the politicians , who preside as tutelary divinities over caucuses , contemplate with grim complacency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astute managers join in the // newspaper cry , doubtless from unholy motives , and pleasantly invite good citizens to come to the caucus and nominate better men , if they are not satisfied with those who are actually nominated . The good man thus sees himself reproached on all sides ; some accuse him of indifference , others of stupidity , but the most exasperating charge is that of the caucus managers . They try to do as well as they can , they say , and nominate worthy men , as they suppose ; while the good men stand coldly aloog decline to give their assistance , and then try to undo at the polis the work that owes its unsatisfactory nature to their refusal to participate in it . Under these circumstances it is not surprising if the good man is puzzled to know just what he ought to do . It is undoubtedly true that as a rule our best citizens are not regular attendants of the caucus . So far the popular complaint is correct . But when the newspapers proceed to say that if such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled by them , we are led along from facts to inferences , and the validity of these inferences must be examined if we are to get any further than reproaches and lamentations over our plight . Suppose we venture the statement that it would make little difference if the better class of citizens , that now stays away , should attend the caucuses ? We should be careful how we throw blame on an estimable class of men unless we are certain that they deserve it . Indeed , if the deplorable state of our government is really caused by the indifference of good citizens , they hardly deserve the name of good . If they can remedy matters , and neglect to do so from mere supineness , they are guilty of real treachery to the State . There are several things to be noticed about the class of citizens in question . One is , that men who are alive to the demands of duty in their family , social , and business relations are likely to answer its calls in other directions . The disposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not particularly under the control of our desires . If we have a real sense of obligation , we can not confine it to those things that we want to do . It compels us to do those things that we do n't want to do . That is its peculiarity , arid the reason why we attach so // great importance to it . Of course , we often see individuals that are generally prompt at the call of duty , singularly forgetful of its claims in particular cases . But when we observe the class of men that is distinguished as possessing this moral sense ic an unusual degree-when we see these men decliuing with some unanimity to discharge what we suppose to be their duty , we have a good opportunity to consider whether our opinion or theirs as to their duty is more to be trusted . In short , we have some reason to suppose that many good men do not feel it to be , on the whole , their duty to attend caucuses . Another thing to he noticed is that the better class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . On the contrary , they take a very keen interest in them . It is not so very long since the war that the patriotism of this class can be forgotten . There was , before the attack on Sumter , some talk of this indifference , but the outburst of devotion to the Union that followed that attack silenced all such language . It can not be that that class which gave so freely of its substance , and left its dead on so many battle-fields , has forgotten its sacrifices , and lost all interest in the welfare of that country whose danger so recently roused it to enthusiasm . Do we find that politics is avoided among our acquaintance as a topic of conversation ? IDo we not find that even those who pretend indifference and disgust , yet secretly follow the movements of politics with a keen eye ? And when the state of affairs is such that they can make their influence felt , they are not slow to improve the opportunity . One other point remains to be noticed , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarity . Most of us doubtless have at one time or another come into conflict with a hotel-clerk or railroad-officer , when the right in the matter was plainly on our side . What did we do ? We pocketed the impertinence and made the best we could of the situation . We did not break forth into fury as an Englishmun might , because we knew that our fellow-citizens would lauTh at us , knowing , as we ourselves knew , that we were helpless . He who has seen his own trunk fall from the top of a pile of baggage wfth the calmness of a disinterested spectator , has proved himself an American citizen . Strong language is of // The Trouble with the caucus . July , no use , for the baggage-master is himself an American , and has cultivated a sang-froid as well as a faculty of powerful expression that , added to his advantages of situation , renders him invincible . if we were to seek for an explanation of this stoicism in the fashionable philosophy of the day , we should perhaps lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle forces that caused the Aborigines to submit without complaint to the tortnres of their enemies , or the hardships of cold and hunger , have possibly affected their successors on this continent with a similar apathy before the inevitable . But the principle of heredity must not be disregarded . Some such trait must exist among the Anglo-Saxons , for did not Charles Lamb , when his play was hopelessly damned , join vigorously in the hissing ? But however it be explained , the fact remains . The ordinary American citizen will not make any demonstration unless he thinks it will have some effect . And so we may suppose it comes to pass that a man who has a sense of duty and who is not indifferent to politics , declines to attend caucuses and to a certain extent elections , because he believes that his presence will not affect the result , and he does not choose to put himself to gratuitous trouble . We have then good citizens , mindful of their duty and interested in politics ; but their influence is lost because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus does not answer its purpose . Why it does not , we shall see if we go to one ourselves . It is not necessary to take so bad an example as a ward caucus in a large city is apt to be . A country town in Massachusetts may be selected as offering a fairer illustra. tion , and the personal observation of the writer may be allowed to bear witness to the faithfulness of the account . The town is four or five miles square , with an agricultural and manufacturing population of 6,000 or 7,000 . There are also several institutions of learning of large size existing in the town , so that there is a small class of citizens of more than average culture . For the convenience of the laboring classes the caucus is held in the evening . In consequence of this , the farmers . who live away from the village and are obliged to be up early in the morning , do not attend . The workmen in the factories , who are in or near the village , and generally spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the sidewalks , attend in greater or less numbers , accordino- to the emergency . The representatives of learning generally do not appear , unless from curiosity or in a time of great interest , such as General Butler sometimes occasions One who is acquainted with the villagers may pick out a few faces that he sometimes sees in attendance on the fireengine . For the nomination of town officers the attendance is small , for that of delegates to the State-senatorial , congressional , or State conventions , larger , but not often more than one hundred . The smaller meetings are quiet , the larger sometimes turbulent , though there is no physical violence . A member of the town committee calls the meeting to order , some person nominates a moderator , who is chosen , and appoints a committee to nominate delegates or officers . They are elected and the meeting adjourns . Everything is " cut and dried . " These nominees for town-officers are elected at the town-meeting , for who else is there to vote for ? The delegates to conventions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works well ; everything is apparently fair ; but a little observation shows that the whole affair is in the hands of half-a-dozen men . They may not be bad masters , but they are masters . They make no display of their power , but it is real power . And they do not belong to the class of " good men , " in the sense of being eminent for their abilities or virtues . They are members of the " firemen 's ring , " hotel-keepers , stableowners , small tradesmen , and lawyers . They are the " men about town " of the New England village , and any one acquainted with such villages will find no difficulty in recognizing them . Sometimes citizens of the better class grow a little restless and attend the caucus . They are welcome . They give an air of respectability to the proceedings . But as soon as their numbers grow formidable the managers draw on their reserves . Large numbers come in from the street-corners and other places of resort , and the original programme is quietly carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better class carry the day . But these exceptions are rare . And it is plain they must be rare , for the " good men " are widely scattered , their evenings are not always at their command , and they have no // organization . On the other hand , the party managers have their friends immediately around them in the village , the rank and file willingly devote their evenings to canenses , and their chieftains have them in excellent discipline . The " *. ood men " see suspicious delegates chosen without the power to prevent it , these delegates meet in convention and nominate unknown men , and all the names being on one ticket , all are elected together . It is safe to say that generally the good citizen does not know the name of the State-senator whom he has helped to elect , and knows generally nothing but the name of his repre-sentative Such is the town-caucus viewed under rather favorable circumstances , for where there are liquor-shops , the saloon-keeper becomes a political chief hence the ward-caucus of the city must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The lesson to be drawn from this picture is not an acceptable one , but it is unavoidable . The government of the country is no longer under the control of the better classes , but is in the grasp of the class of men above described . And more than this is true . Under our present system the control of the government will pass more and more into their grasp . The earlier State legislatures were of a higher grade than those we now have . State senators were once distinguished men . Until recently the Senate of the United States preserved its former high character . Now it too has yielded to the ascending influence of the primary meeting . And even the Supreme Court was recently saved as by fire from the suspicion of this taint . In times of great peril , when the necessity of good men is felt even by the bad , this tendency may be temporarily arrested . But we must not allow ourselves to hope that it will not reappear when the emergency is past . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that our republic is already in its decadence ? If all our acquaintance with the morals of the people were gained from the newspapers , we might be inclined to take a gloomy view . But if we look at our individual experience we see that honorable men and virtuous women are not growing scarce . On the contrary , there are probably , with the advance of civilization , more now than ever before . Their influence is felt in most // departments of society ; in business , in law , and in education , ability and integrity are the foundations of success . Why is there an exception in the case of politics ? Is it in any way possible for the higher classes to exert on the government an influence proportioned at least to their numbers , if not , as in other departments of society , proportioned to their superiority ? It will assist us in our answer to these questions if we correct a possible misapprehension as to that class of citizens that we speak of in general terms as the people . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lf the better classes are the negative cause of our evil state , the people are the positive cause . They wilfhlly nominate and elect bad men , regardless of the warnIngs of those whom they know to be competent to judge . But we must not suppose that the people really desire a corrupt government . If we turn aside our thoughts from that vague general term , the people , and look at the individuals that coinpose the bulk of our population , we shall find that they are , after all , not such very bad fellows . Anyone who has had occasion to employ labor , and has taken pains to make the acquaintance of his workmen , has found them , if he has treated them well , to be not without the ordinary virtues . They are not insensible to kindness nor incapable of gratitude . They are often faithful to their duties , even to the extent of heroism . Take even the lowest class of day laborers , such as live in tenement houses in the cities , where , to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is sometimes affecting to see how virtues , like delicate exotic plants , manage to exist in that foul atmosphere . Their behavior at the caucus is , therefore , not to be explained by their total depravity ; there is something in the caucus that calls out evil passions that elsewhere slumber . In a word , the caucus shows the people its numerical advantage , and the spirit of democratic envy drives them to make use of it . The laborer does not look on the government as the cause of his evils , which it too often is , but as a power which he may bring into use for his own support in his struggle for existence . In this struggle he can not resist the conviction that he is somehow overreached by the wealthy classes . The toil which barely furnishes his family with food , swells the already excessive wealth of his // employer . As he returns in the evening to his miserable abode and squalid family , bearing on his weary shoulders the implements of his labor , he sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his children finely dressed and beaming with health and the enjoyment of their drive . As he painfully trudges along in the dnst which the passing carriage has left behind it , his reflections are bitter . That luxury is purchased with his labor , but he himself will never share it . All there is before him is a life of continuous toil , and an old age of pain and want . And what his life is , will also be the life of his children . And yet he is far from being a communist . He would not ( at least at present ) resort to violence to bring about a fairer division of the blessings of this life . But a certain degree of envy is only human . There must always be " Ins , ' and there must always be " Outs . " And what seems the natural state of affairs to the Ins will excite the discontent of the Outs . They stay poor , or grow poorer , while their lucky brethren are fattening on their misfortunes . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show itself . But with universal suffrage the opportunity is too tempting to be resisted . The laborer sees at the caucus the members of the upper classes trying to secure certain measures . But here , at last , all the advantages that elsewhere enable them to carry out their views , are of no avail . The contest is here decided by numbers , not by wealth or education , and the laborer rejoices in his only chance to let the rich man know that in this country the vote of one man is worth no more than that of another . He can not answer the arguments that prove to him that the interests of all classes are the same . But he feels them to be fallacious . He thinks that by keeping the higher class out of the government , he will be sure that the advantages will come to him instead of to them , and though he is continually disappointed in this expectation , his ( lisappointment embitters him without teaching him wisdom . He struggles against a law of nature , thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the men he elects do frequently give him employment on public works , perpetuates his delusion . Besides , the men who urge him to disregard the influence of the higher classes are men who are // little , if at all , above him . They drink with him and talk with him familiarly . They sympathize with him in his hard lot , and assure him that they will do their best to improve it . Although he may not feel confident that these are the best men to have in office , he can not resist the temptation to humiliate his superiors . The popularity of Butler with the populace of Massachusetts was measured by the fear and hatred felt towards him by the upper classes . It is clearly evident from this , that any combination to control government based upon any class distinction such as wealth or education , has no possible chance of success . The moment its constitution was clearly understood it would be overwhelmed by popular indignation . The remedy for our disorders must be sought in some other direction . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too slow , and , as IDe Tocqueville points out , has natural limits beyond which it can not pass . " It is impossible , after the most strenuous exertions to raise the intelligence of the people above a certain level . Whatever may be the facilities of acquiring information , whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and cheap science , the human mind can never be instructed and developed without devoting considerable time to these objects . The greater or the less possibility of subsisting without labor is , therefore , the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement . This boundary is more remote in some countries and more restricted in others ; but it must exist somewhere , so long as the people are constrained to work in order to procure the means of subsistence , that is to say , so long as they continue to be the people . It is therefore quite as difficult to imagine a State in which all the citizens should be very well informed , as a State in which they should all be wealthy ; these two difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is hut another form of the conflict of the people with the upper classes , furnishes us with valuable lessons , and , as will be argued , with the suggestion of a remedy for our political troubles . The conditions are in great part the same , except that while the people are aware that the strikes , with which they punish their employers , cause suffering to themselves , they do not see that // their action in politics is followed by the same results to their own interests , as well as to those against whom their envy is directed . If , then , we examine the nature of the expedients which have been resorted to with success in allaying the jealousy of the laboring class , we may reasonably expect to find some elements that are essential to the removal of the same feeling , when displayed in politics . The general principle of all these expedients has been to array self-interest against classenvy . Just so soon as it has been possible to make the working class understand where their true interests lie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of their employers . The process is a slow one , and yet in its beginnings , but the direction is right . The methods by which this change is wrought are embraced under the head of Co-operation , which may be defined as any mode of doing business whereby the wages of the laborers employed vary according to the success of the business . But for the pul-pose of illustration a particular form of organization of labor has peculiar advantages . When contracts are made for constructing the road-bed of a railway in England , the large contractor divides his share into sections of small size , and sublets these to other contraetoi-s . So far the pi-ocess is the same in this country . But in England ( in some cases ) the sub-contractor , instead of hiring his men by the day and putting them directly on to the job , divides his section again into portions of such size , that the laborer can judge for himself how much time it will take to accomplish the in . The men themselves become contractors for these smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen members , called " Butty-gangs , ' selecting their gang in such a way that the members may be , so far as possible , of equal efficiency , and choosing a head . The English " navvy " is about as near a savage as any civilized man , but by this device of piece-work he has unquestionably forwarded civilization . This system is a hard blow to strikes and trades-unions . If the workman thinks he can do more work at eight hours a day than ten , he is at liberty to try it . If he wants a holiday he can take it , if he gets his contract done in time . If he finds that others who do less than himself receive equal pay , he can join a gang where he finds his equals . // But the instructive point for us is , that the work is subdivided until the ordinary man can see just where his interests lie . Let us suppose that instead of this complex organization of contractors and sub-contractors , the whole job were to be regulated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the capitalist should have no more authority than that of the laborer . What sort of management would result ? Precisely the management that we see in our unwieldy caucuses . The remedy , then , which we have sought is to be found in subdividing the caucus districts , until it is possible for every member of a district to be personally acquainted with all the rest , to Am*ow the man that he chooses to represent him . This is simply acting in accordance with the great law of division of labor . Large organic or inorganic molecules are in highly unstable equilibrium , and tend to break up into smaller and more stable units . Large heterogeneous bodies of men are like them . Nothing can be done with men until they organize . Nothing is so easily swayed in any direction as a crowd . Nothing is so unreasonable or so fickle as an unorganized mob . It is unnecessary to illustrate a law by which all nature , animate or inanimate , is pervaded , and which is the foundation of our modern civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from trunk to branches , from branches to twigs , from twigs to leaves . We see it in the change from the country store , with its miscellaneohs assortment of goods , hard ware and ribbons , corn and candy , to the city shop where only one class of merchaudize is to be found . We see it in the instinctive organization of a group of children playing games , where the first step is to choose a leader . And in the caucus itself we see that nature 's laws will be obeyed ; for what are the political " rings ' but attempts at this organization ? Misgrowths they are , but unless they satisfied a want , they would not exist . The children of this world have been wiser in their generation than the children of light . Iu point of fact we have outgrown the existing political organization or framework , just as a cherry-tree outgrows its bark , or a boy his clothes . Now bark and clothes are necessities , but they need to be enlarged and varied with time . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representatives , whatever it is called , is really a cau // ens ; but the simple gathering of a small New England town becomes with the growth of population entirely unfit for its purpose . The reason is plain enough . In the early days life was confined within a circle of a few miles , everybody knew all ahout his neighbors , and they all spent their lives together , went to the same church , met in the same town-meeting , and elected thc best men of the town as their representatives , because their numbers were so few , and their habits of life were such , that they knew the best men in town . Like the members of the " B utty-gangs , " their work was marked out before them , and they had only to choose from a small circle those whom they knew to be most competent to further the common interests . How is it now ? Take the ease of New Haven . It is for some purposes a city , but for others it is still a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of 60,000 . Is it likely that deliberation will be mature , that wisdom will be listened to , that anyone knows anything about the names that are proposed ? An organized ring is a necessity under such circumstances and there are plenty of men shrewd enough to understand it . It is in consequence of the observed inconvenience of overgrowth that towns differentiate into cities , with their subdivisions into wards . This is good so far as it goes , but the ward is still far too large to allow the necessary conditions of wise action to come into play . It is impossible to fix an exact limit within which the average man may be supposed to be confined in his acquaintance , but so far as the observation of the writer extends , a neighborhood of fifty voters is large enough for the political unit , and this only with minority representation . With the ordinary majority rule it would be better to have not more than twenty-five men meet for nomination , for reasons that will presently be explained . In the ordinary New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the school-houses would serve as places of meeting . In cities , that part of a street contained between two streets that cross it , a block in its common linear , not solid sense , might possibly answer . Under this system there would naturally arise three cases . Some neighborhoods would consist entirely of wealthy and cultivated individuals . // There would be little trouble in such a case , and with a neighborhood of fifty , and three delegates to be chosen , but only two votes allowed to each individual , representation would be as nearly perfect as any human institution . Secondly , some neighborhoods would consist of a mixed class , poor and rich , laborers and capitalists . Here the best results might be expected . The laborer , when joined with his fellows in a large crowd , looks at the capitalist as an abstract tyrant and inilames himself against him . Let him , with only a few of his own class , meet this abstraction as an actual flesh and blood acquaintance , of rather pleasant manners , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , and the natural influence of superior ability will have its effect . Democratic envy can not thrive under such circumstances ; it dares not openly proclaim itself except in that nursery of bad passions , a crowd . Want of space forbids dwelling on this point , but it might reasonably be expected that such a neighborhood would return its best men as delegates . Thirdly , in a neighborhood composed of the poorer classes , or even of the vicious classes , the result could in no case be worse than it now is . On the other hand , it is only reasonable to suppose that here too the best men the place afforded would be chosen , because the people would know who was the best man among them ; and the trouble is not at all that the best men are not chosen when they are kn6wn , but that they are not and can not be known under the present system . Anything better than this it is impossible to have under universal suffrage , for there is little hope that any large body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If now we look at these classes as a whole we find that we have secured the good effects of minority representation . There is much confusion about this minority representation . The fact is not observed that in any representative government some must be unrepresented . All that minority representation does is to aive to unusually large minorities a representation that they ordinarily fail to obtain . But there must always be small bodies of citizens that are not satisfied with the representatives chosen , unless the phenomenon of defeated candidates is to disappear entirely . Now the subdivision proposed above will come as near to giving every man a // representative as any scheme of minority representation possibly can . The difference will be in this respect . The subdivision of the districts would require the insertion of another term in the series . The delegates chosen would not be for election , but to nominate candidates for election . They would be delegates to general caucuses , and the same principle of avoiding unwieldy masses would forbid the sending of delegates directly from the towns to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of 1,000 voters would be obliged to choose three or five from their number to represent them in a county convention , where the delegates to the State convention would be at last chosen . But the process , as a little reflection will show , would be a continual selection of the best material . Its complexity is more real than apparent , and after all it is only a despotism that can be really simple . The failure of the electoral college may occur to some as an objection to this scheme . But the electoral college is a part of the organic political machinery of the United States , while this scheme is intended for the use of parties ; although , if successful , it might perhaps be adopted into the constitutions of our governments . And further , the failure of the electoral college is explained by this scheme . Who knows anything about the thirty or forty names of electors on the ticket he votes in New York ? How could he find out anything about them if he wanted to ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is easier to find out about one man than about forty . The electoral college has failed for this simple reason , that the acquaintance of the people with their electors was impossible , while something at least could be learned about the one or two prominent candidates for president . The college might even yet be revived into usefulness by some such division of districts for nomination as is here suggested . But the theory of election by an elected body is not affected by this practical failure in one instance . For a long time it gave us a United States Senate which was the equal of any parliamentary assembly in Europe . The reason it no loi*ger does so is because the State legislatures are now composed of men unknown to those who elect them . The judgment of Dc Tocqueville is not to be disregarded as to the importance of ' this method . He says : // " The time must come when the American republics will be obliged more frequently to introduce the plan of election by an elected body into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserably amongst the shoals of democracy . " " I do not hesitate to avow that I look upon this peculiar system of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of political power to the level of the people . Those who hope to convert this institution into the exclusive weapon of a party , and those who fear to use it , seem to me to be equally in error . " That time has come . No one can contemplate our municipal governments , and reflect on the large proportion in which the population of the cities already stands to that of the whole country , bearing in mind also the growing tendency of population to concentrate in towns , without feeling anxiety for the future of the republic . Why " this peculiar system of election " was regarded by De Tocqueville as the only means for our salvation , has been explained above . Men must learn to choose a representative as they choose a lawyer or a doctor ; not one who will carry out all their whims , but one who will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior knowledge where he sees it will be advantageous . Not one who will sacrifice his judgment to that of his patients or clients , but one to whose judgment they are willing to yield their own . Such men can not be discerned in a crowd ; they are only to be found by personal acquaintance . It is not likely that any existing party will be persuaded to adopt a reform that would be the doom of most of our political managers . Should there arise a new party , however , there would then be a favorable opportunity for trying the experiment . Whatever difficulties may be in the way , it may be confidently asserted that radical reform can be obtained only by working in this direction . IReform thus obtained will be permanent because the size of the political unit will be fixed by the limit of a certain number . Without some such reform we may look to see the new party captured at the outset by the politicians as at Cincinnati , or gradually brought into subjection by skillful managers , as has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
