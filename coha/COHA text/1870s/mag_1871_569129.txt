ARTICLE YI. - YALE COLLEGE. - SOME THOUGHTS RE SPECTING ITS FUTURE . FOURTH ARTICLE . THE work of the new era in the undergraduate departments of the University is the subject which will occupy our attention in the present Article . Of these departments , the one which is connected with the Scientific School is of recent growth , and has some of the peculiar wants to which we have referred in connection with the schools for professional study . The other is the original College , established at the beginning of the last century , and strong with the power and fame of its past history . It needs larger development , indeed , and a progress fitted to the coming times , but it is secure in its position as one of the two leading collegiate institutions of the country . The claim of the guardians and friends of Yale College is , that , by the establishment of these two departments , side by side , the most satisfactory arrangement possible has been made both for the classical and the scientific methods of education . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are sometimes called , which is now agitating the public mind , is one that can not be wisely settled until after the excitement of the first onset and struggle shall have passed away . The interests of sound learning , at the present moment and while the discussion is going forward , demand , first of all , that the two systems be so placed in contrast with each other , that they may show their own especial excellences and defects . If they are intermingled with one another , or the students , who are pursuing the different lines of study , are brought together in the same classes or the same institution , this end can not be successfully attained . In most other colleges this is the course adopted . But here the work in either line is unmingled with and unhindered by that in the other . Each system has full opportunity to develope itself and to do all that it can do in its own way . We believe that the officers of this University in all its departments are alike of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best one . The experience of the years since it was adopted has only confirmed this opinion , and the steady growth of both the classical and scientific schools bears witness that the public sentiment outside of the college is not out of harmony with the views which are entertained here . It would seem , indeed , that these views must be founded in reason and must , therefore , be in accordance with truth ; for the decision of this most important question must depend , in the final result , on the feeling and consciousness , if we may so say , of the individual student . If the man who is classically educated feels and knows within himself that he stands on a higher level of intellectual cultivation than his associate who has followed the new education , and if this associate knows and feels that he is himself on a lower grade ,  --  if this is true of every fair-minded student in either line , or of the great majority of such students , the determination will , crc long , be reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the new . If , on the other hand , the opposite state of things shall prove to be true , the opposite decision will be accepted as the final one . But the two students must stand apart in their education , and the institutions for the different studies must be side by side and not be mingled in one , if the comparison , which is essential to the end in view , is to be properly made . For ourselves , we believe the settlement of this question will rest upon certain unchangeable factswhich are lost sight of now , because we are at the most unfavorable point of the controversy for the calmness of consideration and wise judgment-and , if we can give the opportunity for such individual comparison as we have spoken of above , there will be little occasion to apprehend the result . It is a part of the wisdom of the managers of Yale College , that they have , so carefully and thoroughly , provided such an opportunity . But our object is not to discuss the merits of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any peculiar excellence of this University with respect to the adjustment between them . Whether wisely or not , the decision here has been made to carry forward the different lines of study in different departments of the institution , and we may presume that the unanimous judgment of the officers of both the departments will not easily be altered . We may accept it , therefore , as a settled point , that // the opening era is not to change the order of things in regard to these fundamental arrangements , but that its work is to be that of enlarging and developing both , the separate branches . How should this work be carried forward is the question of greatest interest , at the present moment , and the question on which we propose to present a few suggestions to our readers . In respect to the Academical Department the coming years will call for progress , as we think , both in the provisions made for instruction and in the methods of teaching . If we may refer to these two points in their order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instruction , none is more generally demanded by thoughtful friends of the College than the partial or complete abolition of the Tutorial office . In this institution , at present , about one half of the education of the students is committed to those holding this office . These persons are young men , who have been graduated two or three years , and who are purposing , after a brief period of teaching , to enter upon some other work in life . They are , commonly , men of good scholarship and possessed of some degree of that genuine enthusiasm which belongs to their age , but , owing either to the method of choosing them or to unavoidable circumstances , they are not very unfrequently of limited capabilities or qualifications as teachers . By reason of some fault in the system , also , they are not always assigned to that particular department of instruction for which they are , by their tastes or their acquisitions , best fitted , but the man whose inclinations and studies have been in the line of mathematics is obliged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pupils in Latin or Greek . For these reasons and others which might be named , almost all persons who now graduate at this college have , as we believe , at the time of their graduation and afterward , grave doubts about the whole Tutorial system . The advocates of the system are largely among the older men , who do not easily escape the influences under which they grew up , in their earlier years . For ourselves , we do not think that this office ought to be entirely given up . The continual infusion of new blood into a college faculty is a health-giving thing . Young men , too , are apt to be more ready to teach the rudimentary parts of studies and to be more enthusiastic for this work , than those who have , // in their own progress , gone far beyond the beginnings and have been teachers of successive classes for many years . The Freshman and Sophomore glasses in our colleges , so long as the preparatory schools do not advance far beyond their present state , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intellectual development , and they must be tanght as boys . In general , the work which they need can be well done by those who , but a few years ago , were in their own condition , and who not only remember , but are interested in , what they are now studying . Older men are often wearied with these things , because they are older . They have risen to the higher regions of learning and are interested there . Moreover , in institutions like our American colleges , where the students are to be governed , and the Faculty , as it is often said , stand in the place of parents , it is of great importance that a portion of the governing power should have recently come from the student community . The young man of 1820 or 1830 was , in many respects , different and widely different from his successor in 1870 . The instructor , therefore , who finished his student life forty years ago , does not , in all points , understand the feelings and sentiments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the passing years-even remember his own sentiments and feelings as they were in the distant past . There seems oftentimes to be an almost impassable barrier between the older officers and their pupils , in this regard , which wholly prevents the former from properly appreciating the peculiarities of the latter ; and , whenever such is the fact , the government is likely to be administered more or less unwisely . We believe that the Tutors in Yale College have always done their full share in the work , not only of discipline , but of reasonable discipline on the part of the governing body , and that they have , very frequently , by reason of their more thorough understanding of the present interior life of the college community , arrested mistaken measures and corrected erroneous views . Students , in general , are not ready to do them justice , because they seem but little older than themselves . But , so far as our observation has extended , we are sure that they have been of great service to the institution , and have constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispensed with . But , while we admit and maintain all this , we do not see how it can well be doubted , that the Tutors here are too large a part of the Academicaj Faculty . Permanent instructors , devoting their lives to their several branches of study , are what a collegiate institution most needs . Young men who have made but little progress , and who are intending soon to enter upon one of the three learned professions , are not qualified to do so large a portion of the whole academic teaching . They do not know enough . They are not concentrated sufficiently in their purposes upon this one work . They are ordinarily obliged to give a considerable share of their time and efforts to other studies , in preparation for their future business . With their time divided and their thoughts drawn in different ways , they lose efficiency and sometimes slight their college duties . They are instructors whose life , so to speak , is only half within the institution . How can they be as useful as the permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the lawyer or physician is to his ? The education at Yale College is not inferior to what it is in many other institutions because there are a considerable number of Tutors here ,  --  for , in the first place , the proportion of these officers to the more permanent ones is not larger than in the small colleges where there are fewer of both , and , in the second place , there are many persons in other institutions wearing the title of professors , who are no better qualified for their work than these younger teachers here are . Nor do we see any evidence that Yale College has suffered thus far , in the public estimation , on account of this Tutorial instruction . But it must be remembered that we are now about entering upon a new era , in which scholarship is to be carried forward beyond the limits which it has already reached . A community of scholars is growing up in the country , who will both elevate and guide public opinion in this matter . More will be demanded of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the demands which are reasonable are not met by any institution , that institution will so far fail of future success . An imperative necessity resting upon the Academical Department of this University will require , in the early future , as we can not doubt , the substitution of professorships for most of our tutorships , and the aban // donment , thus , in large measure , of the old system of the past . The occupants of the Tutorial office , so far as that office shall still remain , will need to be chosen in some different way , and for a longer period , than has hitherto been the case . They will need to be men who are preparing for the teacher 's rather than the minister 's or lawyer 's work , and who , for this reason , are able and willing to give their whole energies to their office . They will need , also , to be assigned to their duties only on the ground of their fitness , and not according to the rule that the oldest in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Article was suggested , as we believe , one of the best ways of selecting not only the Tutors but also almost all the officers of instruction for the college-namely , the method of selecting them from the company of those graduated students who shall be pursuing higher and non-professional studies at the University itself . In this way , every such student will have the greatest stimulus to make the utmost progress possible , and the governing powers of the institution will have the most abundant , as well as the best , opportunities to observe the capacities and adaptations of the candidates for office . The time is rapidly coming , if , indeed , it has not already come , when our largest Universities must educate their own instructors for their work , and when they can no longer content themselves with the services , for two or three years , of young men who are designing to live in some other sphere , but must secure for a lifetime the men of largest powers and of highest enthusiasm . Another demand of the coming epoch will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , indeed , is a constant one in every , growing institution of learning , and has been felt here in the past as truly as it will be . We have now , however , arrived at a period when decided and marked advancement must be made , or the College will be in danger of falling back . The graduates and friends of the Academical Department ought carefully to consider its wants in this direction , as they have been recently set forth by one of its most distinguished officers , and , if they would make it worthy of the age , they should provide the means for the establishment of these new chairs of instruction . Especially in the department of English Literature , of Latin , and of the Modern Languages , as well as in von . xxx . 33 // Astronomy and International Law , additional professors should be appointed at the earliest possible day . But our object in alluding to this point is not to repeat what has been pressed upon the public attention , more than once of late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased number of instructors which arises from the very large and increasing number of students . When the College classes have reached the number of one hundred and fifty or more , they can not be taught suecessfuily by three or four persons , as they could be when consisting of eighty or a hundred only . Indeed we regard it as having been , for more than twenty-five years , one of the misfortunes of Yale College , that its teachers have been so few . A division of thirty students is too large to recite together with the highest advantage . Where instruction is given largely by lectures , as is the case in the professional schools to a great extent , this remark will not hold good . But , in the Academical Department , the main work is and ought to be in the line of recitations , and , under such circumstances , fifteen or twenty are as many as should meet together . The larger number prevents all familiarity and spontaneity in the exercise . It limits , of necessity , the instruction to simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the pupil , and , thus , quenches or , at least , fails to excite the enthusiasm of the student . Large colleges are more advantageous to the student than small ones in so many ways , that there can be no doubt that it is best for any man , who is able to do so , to go to them . But , in this respect , they are attended by a disadvantage , unless the teachers are made more numerous in proportion to the students . For the individual and personal influence of instructors upon pupils , also ,  --  one of the most desirable of all educating influences in a college-it is essential , that , in an institution like Yale , the number of instructors should be multiplied . It is impossible for any professor to come into very close connection with every individual in a class of a hundred young men . The greater part of them will and must lose the good which would result from acquaintance with him , because there are so many to demand his time and thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing upon us , because they are felt , in their importance , so // generally by that class of persons who , like ourselves , believe in the desirableness of forwarding the growth of a University in this place . They may well be mentioned , also , because they will have a direct tendency toward making the University what it ought to be , by advancing and fostering scholarly enthusiasm in that Department which is at the foundation , as it were , of the other and higher schools . If we turn now to consider the methods of teaching we may be led , incidentally , to refer to some other demands of the new era , and , thus , in some measure , to complete what must , from the limits imposed upon us , be necessarily an imperfect exposition of the wants of the Department . Much has been written , of late , in the way of complaint respecting the mode of instruction in this college , and , especially , with reference to the want of any enthusiastic love of study among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to the system of teaching . We have every reason to believe and to know , that the same complaints may be made as justly against all American Colleges , but the charge is , doubtless , intended to bear upon all alike , although , for special reasons , it is now brought forward by many against this one alone . The charge of want of enthusiasm among students is one which we acknowledge to be true . There are , as we are persuaded , comparatively few young men in our collegiate institutions , who are fired with any unquenchable love for the studies in which they are engaged . Enthusiasm comes , to some extent , after men have completed their undergraduate course and have entered upon their professional studies or upon their life-work , but , with now and then an exception , it does not inspire those who are at the earlier stage . It ought , however , to be remembered by persons who make the complaint , that the fact is largely owing to the simple reason of their being at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a general thing . Unless they are remarkable boys , or unless they have very remarkable teachers , they begin the course of learning rather under the influence of necessity than of love . Nor is this true of their beginnings in learning only . The same fact is observable in every other work . Indeed , nothing charactenses the great mass of men , in mature life , more than the want of that inspiration which comes from enthusiastic ardor // in their pursuits . The necessity laid upon us all is the motive without which we should be in danger of neglecting our business , and it would be strange if it were not even more so with the young . Many seem to suppose , that , if the compulsory attendance upon lectures and recitations could be given up , and what is called the marking system abandoned , the evils of the present would , at once , disappear and a kind of golden age begin . But our observation of human nature , as exhibited in any institution of learning which we have seen either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to look for any such result . In fact our experience in connection with one or two of the German Universities , a few years ago , where the students are at a higher point of education than our undergraduates , and are , therefore , more capable of being trusted with freedom from rules , has convinced us of the necessity of the compulsory system , so far as its essential features are concerued . A. body of youth , just passing from boyhood to manhood , who are left at liberty to attend or not , as they please , the exercises of a college , are likely to be not only a body of idlers but an intolerable evil in a community . Perhaps the marking system may be modified , or something in the way of frequent examinations , as bearing upon success , may be substituted for it , but the fundamental element in the marking system-namely , the honoring of students according to their rank and faithfulness-is no hindrance to enthusiasm , and is only a legitimate application of the principle of rewarding those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsory system which , because it drives rather than draws , hinders the growth of love for his studies in the student 's mind , we think is undoubtedly true . But we regard the compulsory system as a necessity because of the evils unavoidably resulting from its abolition ; and the hindrance of which we have spoken is only a small one in comparison with others that are independent of this system . The question for our American Colleges , then , as it seems to us , is not the question as to a fundamental and radical change in this respect , but it is the question how enthusiasm in study-that most desirable of all things-may be awakened under the present organization of things . We believe that it can be and ought to be thus awakened to a far // greater extent than it has been . In our second Article , we were led , incidentally , to suggest two or three points of great importance in connection with this matter . It will be unnecessary to dwell upon them again in this place , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision needs to be made for that greater familiarity of communication between the pupil and his instructor in the recitation-room , to which we have alluded . By the adoption of this single change in our present method , onehalg or more than one-halg of the existing evil might be removed . The student may be obliged to attend the exercises of his class . Indeed , without some sense of responsibility in this regard , he will often waste his time and abuse his privileges . But , when he comes to the exercises , he ought to have free opportunity to question his teacher and to bring forward , in a suitable way , the topics and thoughts which have been interesting his own mind . On* of the great reasons why the members of the professional schools are more enthusiastic in their work than college students are , is , doubtless , this larger freedom in the lecture-room . In every well organized law school or theological seminary , the young men are encouraged to ask for the solution of all their difficulties , and to discuss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them The lecture hour is , often , lengthened for this purpose , and the time which follows the close of the formal exercise is , often , more stimulating to enthusiasm than the lecture itself . Probably this course can not be adopted to the same extent in the undergraduate department , but it can be to a considerable extent , and , so far as it may be adopted , it will be attended with a similar result . Let the divisions of the class be arranged , as they are now in this college , according to the attainments and proficiency of the students , and then let them be limited in number to fifteen persons , and who can doubt that a faithful and inspiring teacher can accomplish much in this most desirable line ? Individuals will not be compelled as now to suffer because of the numbers who are to be examined , and the examination of whom is necessary in order to their faithfulness . But , while time will be given for all necessary questioning on the part of the instructor , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward the results of his own independent // investigation , and , thus , there will be the means of inciting him to such investigation . As we have already seen , however , this change in the present system will require a very considerable increase in the number of teachers . If it is to be accomplished , the friends of the college must enlarge its resources . The opening era calls upon them for large gifts to this end . Another change , to which allusion was made in the Article referred to , and which , though it might be discussed at greater length , we will only mention again at the present time , is in the method of teaching the classical languages-so that by limiting the instructions less exclusively to the grammar , and by giving more facility in translation and more appreciation of the beauty of style and thought , a more thorough knowledge of the glory of those languages , as well as a deeper love for them , may be produced . Unless something is done to this end , and efficiently done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in regard to the use of these languages in education , may turn out disastrously for a time , by reason of the errors of the classical party . Comparatively few students can be made to enjoy grammar , or to love the science of philology . These things belong , like the higher mathematics , within the region of the enthusiasm of a selected company . But almost all students , of respectable ability and faithfulness , may be aroused , as we believe , to read the Greek and Latin poets with pleasure , and to acknowledge the refining influence of these studies upon their own minds . With some , of course , it will be more difficult to accomplish this result than with others , but with the great majority it can be done , if the right method be adopted , and the teacher , gifted with magnetic power , be faithful to his office . But , without lingering longer upon this point , we urge , in the next place , that our present system involves far too much of memorizing . Verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word-is comparatively useless in after life . The thing which a man of education needs , is to grasp the thoughts and substance of what he reads , for , without this power , he can hardly be a scholar in any profession . Now the former power is the one which is cultivated , almost altogether , in our colleges . Students are even expected or required to learn the lists of words which form exceptions to some minute and comparatively // unimportant rule in grammar so accurately that they can recite them withdut any question on the part of the teacher-each one beginning where the preceding student left off in his recitation , and going on until he , in his turn , is allowed to stop . They are expected to recite works in history and , sometimes , even a book like Olmsted 's Natural Philosophy almost verbatim . We believe such memorizing , carried to such an extent , to be not only useless but positively injurious to the mind . If a youth is occupied with learning by rote , from the age of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind-he will weaken his memory in those other lines in which it must be of priceless value to him . It is with the deepest regret , and almost with a feeling of indignation , that we recall the baleful influence of some of our early teaching in this regard , and there is a well-known book , the mere mention of which brings to our thought a loss , which we suffered from such memoriter recitations in years gone by , whose greatness is appreciated only the more fully the farther we advance in our course . It is not the object of a man 's life in this world , as some one has said , to spend half of his career in getting ready for college and the other half in going through college . If it were , such methods of study might be defended . But college life is valueless except in its bearing on the future , and if college life does not give us what best fits us for the demands of that future and what developes the mind in the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only worthy end . It is not the schoolmaster 's estimate of the excellence of the recitations of his pupils , which determines the real value of their work under his care . It is what the pupils , in their later life , judge respect . lug it from their own experience-it is what they see to have been the influence upon their own minds , that decides the question . Estimated according to this standard , we can not doubt that the coming years will press a demand upon all our collegiate institutions , and upon Yale College among others , for a change in the matter of which we are now speaking . We only add , in this connection , that such verbal memorizing is a hindrance , rather than an incentive , to enthusiasm . The effort of the mind which it requires is a disagreeable one to most persons , and one which never becomes very attractive , it is // the thoughts of a book , not its words , which educated minds love to possess themselves of . The method of education which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to stimulate that earnestness in study and devotion to learning for its own sake which are so desirable-and , thus , the evil of which so many now complain will be most successfully removed . Twenty years ago ,  --  we believe that the experience of all the classes will justify us in sayihg ,  --  the question least thought of by undergraduate students was the question of the course of thought in the hook they were translating . In the new era , and long before another twenty years shall have passed , we hope it will be , if not the first , the most interesting and most important of all questions to their minds . We can not but feel , again , that , in the coming years , there will be a call for greater immediate and personal influence of the teachers over the pupils than has been the case heretofore . The difficulties in the way of exerting such influence , except in some general manner , we are well aware of They are found on the students ' side as well as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lerable enlargement of the number of instructors , and with constant attention to the matter , much can doubtless be accomplished . The effect of such personal association and infinence must , of necessity , be for the exciting of interest in the studies of the college course . Beyond the demands of the recitation-room and the authority of the government of the institution , a power will come np*n the student 's mind from an enthusiastic teacher whom the student has learned to know as a friend . And thus , in its bearing upon this point , the change which are suggest becomes closely connected with , and almost involves in itself , a change in the method of instruction . While we have spoken with favor of the compulsory system , as known at present in our colleges , and of the custom of marking the student for his recitations , at least so far as its essential features are concerned , we think that both of these may be modified in the future to some extent . It may be , and doubtless is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is followed too sharply by small rules , and that he is watched at every step too much like a young school-boy . There is , to say the least , a danger under the present system , that many college officers // will treat their pupils in a way not only to quench enthusiasm for study , but also to awaken an evil disposition and a readiness to take every unfair advantage of the governing powers . If the matter of excuses is pressed into too great minuteness , and beyond bounds , the result may be something worse than irregularity of attendance . Marks , too , under some circumstances , may become anything but an incitement to real scholarship . It will , very probably , be a serious question with the officers of our collegiate institutions , at no distant day , whether the rules may not be somewhat diminished in their number and relaxed in their all-penetrating strictness ; and it is certainly deserving of careful consideration , whether some other method of determining the relative rank of students may not be adopted , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks now accomplishes , will be less likely to repress enthusiasm or to make the daily study appear but a daily task . The suggestions which we have thus briefly made are only a portion of those which might be offered . But , since they are all , more or less immediately , connected with the question as to the means of inspiring the students with the love of their work , they fall together , naturally , into one class ; and since , as a class , they may be regarded as representing all other suggestions of different orders , which might be brought forward , we content ourselves with presenting them alone at this time . To the effecting of these objects , in the way of advancing the scholarship of the college , an increase of endowments will be needed . The Academical Department has great necessities , in this respect , as well as the other Departments . It has , however , a very large company of its own graduates to whom it can appeal for aid . The change in the governing Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many , especially among the younger alumni , seems now about to be accomplished . As the want of this change has been claimed to be the reason why larger and more frequent gifts have not been offered by the graduates to the college recently , we suppose we may now be justified in expecting from all , who have been withholding their means for this reason , a large endowment at an early day . Certainly , if this expectation turns out to be groundless , the claim will prove to have been made upon a false basis . But // the question will arise as to the method in which gifts from the Alumni of the college can be best obtained . From those of very large property , we should say , it should be sought in the same way as from others of a similar class who are not graduates . There are , however , a great number of the Alumni - indeed , the great majority of them-who are not wealthy . For these the system which has been adopted in one or two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of contributions by the several classes . If some individual in each of the classes , which have graduated during the last forty years ,  --  some one who is inspired by a warm affection for the College , and who is possessed of some pecuniary ability ,  - -  will undertake the work among his own classmates , and will , by his own example and exhortations , incite them to give larger and smaller sums according to their means , a very considerable fund may , with little difficulty , be obtained . We know of no time better than the present-when a new epoch of the college history is just beginning and all is hopeful-for the inauguration of such a movement . There is no reason , so far as we can see , why such contributions from the various classes - through the gifts of small sums , from year to year , by the individual members-might not become a constant source of income to the Academical Department . No general movement upon the Alumni , or among the Alumni , has , as vet , been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement , if made now , would be very generally approved , and that the results of it would be surprisingly large . But for this Department , as well as for the others of which we have previously spoken , a large plan ought to be devised by the governing powers , and , under the guidance of the presiding officer of the University , all those interested in the management of the Department should devote themselves earnestly to the work . With a determined energy and a strong hopefulness on the part of the persons here who are entrusted with the care of the institution , we have great confidence that the efforts of the future will be crowned with success . And why should there not be such success ? Yale College has more living graduates than any other college of the countm-y . These graduates are scattered everywhere , and are everywhere men of // influence . The large majority of them have always been deeply interested in the college , and even those who , of late , have been disposed to find fault are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their want of approval removed . The public mind , outside of the limits of the Alumni , is coming to feel more and more the importance of maintaining and strengthening the larger colleges and this great national college in particular . The wealth of the country was never so large as it is to-day , and never has it been given more freely , or more abundantly , for the best ends . The time for forward movements has come , and , if made in the right way , they can not fail . Of the other undergraduate department of the University , which forms a part of the Scientific School , less need be said . By reason of its connection with the professional part of the same school , we have had occasion , in our last Article , to mention some of its wants . They are large , in a pecuniary point of view ; but , with the energy now displayed by the managers of that department , we may look for an early supply of these wants . The progress of this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent history of the University , and the more the numbers of students have increased and the design of the course of study has been understood , the more , we believe , has the public favor rested upon it . The question of the future , with regard to this Department , may not improbably be , whether it should not be ranged with the Academical Department as a coordinate preparatory school , educating students for the school of philology and the higher studies in natural science . But we do not regard it as possible that the two will ever be merged in one , or that the system which has been adopted here , with so universal approbation , will ever be given np for that which is found so generally elsewhere . If a University is hereafter to be ftilly established at Yale , or any where else in this country , the result will be , that , sooner or later , the higher schools for professional and general study will take the leading place and constitute the University itself while the undergraduate departments will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men for the higher positions . But , for a long time to come , these undergraduate departments must be a most essential part of the institution , // and must deserve , both by reason of their numbers and their importance , most earnest thought from the friends and officers of the University . For many reasons the Academical Department must , even in the new era of which we speak , continue to be , in a certain sense , a sort of centre of the whole institution . But it will be only in a certain sense . The co6rdination of all the Departments is the work of the years before us . It is the work which will characterise the coming time as truly as any of the great works of the past have characterised their epochs . It is a work to which all who have at heart the interests of the University ought to give themselves , according to their posi. tion and their opportunities . The growth of Yale College , during all its past history , has been a peculiar one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . It has not been by means of a series of new experiments , or by fundamental changes in its sys. tem for the purpose of meeting some passing demand of the age . Such experiments and changes are always attended by great loss of the good belonging to the old things , and they , very frequently , prove to be failures in the end . It can scarcely be otherwise , for the requirements of the agitators or the assailants of the past , who call themselves the representatives of the times , are too generally founded on unwise views . They are the mere notions of men who comprehend little of the lessons of history and as little of the wants of the future . But the progress of this College has been a steady and healthful development . Its guardians have carefully preserved whatever of good has been received from preceding generations , and have , at the same time , not lost sight of the teachings of their own age . The existence of the Scientific School , and especially of its undergraduate department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in this regard . So soon as the new wants of the country , occasioned by the development of its resources , began to require more thorough education in Natural Science , a school was founded in connection with the College for this purpose . And , again , when the public demands called for a different method , in the more general education , for those who could not pursue the Academical course , provision was made to meet those demands . They were met , too , as we have already seen , // with great wisdom , and according to the uniform plan pursued here in the past . Without interfering at all with the arrangements for the old curriculum of study , and by a provision which prevents all possibility of either system being hindered in its development by the other , the two *llasses of students are offered their choice between the different lines of instruction and are carried forward in the one or the other under the highest advantages . The evils of the elective system are thus avoided , while its most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wise and healthful progress of which we speak . Other instances might be given in connection with the history of almost every other branch of the University . In the Academical IDepartinent itself to which reference has been made more particularly in this Article , the advance has been very great , as those can appreciate who , like ourselves , graduated even so late as twenty-two years ago ; and it has been , mainly , with a due regard not only to the past but to the present and the future . With some further changes which the era now beginning will naturally suggest , such as those to which we have referred and others of a similar order in other lines , which might have been mentioned but for the limits of our space , the growth of the Department will meet the reasonable requirements of all enlightened men , without any great revolution and without any severance of the links that bind the College to the times gone by . As one of the most eminent instructors here has recently said , the great thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future is confidence in the University on the part of all its friends . There never was an institution of any sort , in any age , which merited such confidence more than Yale College . Let it receive the endowments and the means of accomplishing its ends which it now needs , and all the experience of the past one hundred and seventy years will be contradicted if it does not make the most wise and satisfactory progress in the period just before us . There is one subject connected with the whole University , and more particularly , in certain respects , with the undergraduate departments of it , which the length of our Article will only allow us to discuss very briefly , and which yet can not be passed over without any allusion . We refer to the matter of religious // instruction and the religious character of the institution . Much has been said of late on this point , and it is very manifest that , in the minds of some of those who demand changes in the college system here , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our view , the giving up of the old character of the institution , as an institution whose religious life is always regarded as its highest life , would not only be a change to be most deeply regretted in itself ; but would be disastrous to the future growth of the University . The friends of Yale College , on whom it must depend in the future as it has done in the past , are , the great majority of them , Christian men , who believe in Christian education and in no other . Losing the sympathy and support of these men , the college will have nothing to fall back upon . It will sink from its high position , when it thus turns away from its past history , and it ought , thus , to sink . This institution was founded with prayer and consecration to God by the noble men of a past age . They established it as a place of religious teaching and influence , and not merely for the learning belonging to this world . They handed it over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from God for all time . Every advance , which it has made since their day , has been made by the gifts and efforts of men who had their spirit . It has been as truly a power in the world for the extension of the Christian faith as for the promotion of any science . Its endowments would never have been given to it , but with the implied assurance that it was always to be what it was at the first , a religious institution . If by any unfaithfulness of to-day , or of any future time , it should be suffered to pass out of such influences and to take on a new character , it ought to lose its glory and its future . If those who do not believe in religion in colleges wish to establish institutions in accordance with their own views , they have abundant opportunity to do so . But , whoever they may be , do not let them violate the pledges given by the fathers , or lay hands upon a University which owes everything it has and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it forward because it was a Christian institution . To this end of religious instruction and the maintenance of the religious character of the University , it seems to us essen // tial that there should be stated preaching in the college chapel . This service can not be safely given up in so large an institution , and we see no reason why the undergraduate students , who are , generally , of such an age that at their own homes they would be under parental control in this matter , should not be required to attend the college religious exercises . It is to be remembered , however , that , connected with such compulsory attendance , there are some incidental evils , and , so far as may be possible , wise provision should be made to avoid them . For several years past , it has appeared to us undesirable to assign to one preacher the whole charge of the college pulpit . It is doubtful whether any man can accomplish successfully , for any considerable period , such a great and difficult work . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the general oversight of its interests and should preach one half of the time , and the pulpit should be occupied at other times , according to some regular arrangement , by the rest of the clerical professors or by preachers from abroad , such variety would be given to the services as would make them more interesting and more profitable . It will be a subject of consideration , also , as we can not doubt , before many years shall have passed , whether the afternoon service may not be , in some degree , changed from what it now is-so that it shall be more exclusively adapted and addressed to the student community , or so that it shall be a more familiar Biblical exercise instead of an ordinary sermon , or so that , while the students are required to attend the college chapel in the morning of each Sunday , they shall only be called upon to be present in some church at the afternoon service , while the choice as to what church they will attend shall be left open to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such change , for it would , perhaps , be improper to do so at this early day . But questions in regard to this subject may well be seriously examined when they shall arise , for the determination of the best method of effecting the best spiritual results for the great company of young men assembled in the college may be dependent on the settlement of them . In neither of the undergraduate departments , however , as it seems to us , can the oversight of the Faculty over the students , in this matter of attending public worship , be altogether given up , // with safety to the highest well-being of the college . We feel , also , that the chapel , where the religious services of the Sabbath are held , should be designed not merely for the undergraduate students of one department , or even of both departments , but that it should be * University Chapel . It should be large enough to accommodate all the members of the University -- not those younger students alone who are required to attend , but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . Such a common center of religious worship might naturally become a means of uniting the whole institution and of making its various members to be one body . To this end there needs to be provided a new and commodious and comfortable chapel , in which the hearer can listen with patience , and the preacher can come into sympathy with his audience and can be both seen and heard . The time is not far distant , we hope , when the present chapel of Yale College will be a thing of memory only . And here we may be permitted to say , that , in our opinion and , we believe , in that of many others , the new chapel of the University , when it is erected , ought to be placed near the center of the college square , and not at one of its corners and the corner of two of the city streets . Its location should be the most retired possible , within the circle of the other buildings , and it should be as central as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every observer that all things in the education here point toward religion and lead the soul to tbat which is higher and better . With these few general and special remarks on this most important subject , which bears particularly upon the Academical college and yet has relations to all the other schools , and which , therefore , appropriately follows all else that has been said , we bring our present Article to a close . The plan , which we have followed in our discussion of the future of the University , has led us to speak of the undergraduate departments last We need not repeat what has been already stated with emphasis , that this course , which we have taken , is not due to any depreciation of the importance of these departments as compared with the others , but to the fact that , in changing the College of the past into the University of the future , it is necessary , first of all , to strengthen those departments which most // need it and which , owing to the peculiar circumstances of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . When the University idea is realized and the various depart . ments become , as they ought to be , codrdinate and coequal ,  - -  then all may be cared for alike , and may grow together for all time to come . The Academical Department of this College is strong in the affections of its thousands of graduates . It is remembered with the tenderest interest by all who have passed the period of their *ducation under its teachings and influences . We are sure that it need not fear that it will ever be forgotten , or that its wants , when known , will be long neglected . But the time , we trust , is coming , and the beginning of that time is near at hand in the opening era , when the University , which began with the establishment of this Department , shall have taken it up into itself as one among its several parts , and shall have glorified it by making it one of the members of a nobler institution worthy of the future age of the conntry.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
