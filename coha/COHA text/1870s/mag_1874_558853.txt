ART . I. - THE MODERN TYPE OF OPPRESSION . THERE are two kinds of liberty , unlike in character and often opposite in effect . The one consists in the mere absence of restraint ; the other , in such an order and discipline as shall make the relations of men wings rather than fetters , salutar.y , serviceable , productive , rather than a means to demoralization and degeneracy . Now , it is apparent that the attention of the modern world has for some time been devoted chiefly to the first named , that is , to the liberty which consists in being left to follow one 's personal inclination . The stress of effort for a century has gone to the emoval of social restraints , as , for example , in that setting ' aside of restrictions upon the liberty of assemblage , of speech , and of publication , which , if complete only in England and America , has more or less taken place in all civilized lands . These changes constitute an important amelioration , and it is by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the peculiar and somewhat exclusive character of modern reform . The century has done well to deliver itself from many restraints , which , however appropriate to the moral conditions of an earlier age , were only hindrances or impertinences in ours . Liberty in the customary sense , that is , the free initiative of the individual , contributes greatly to impulse , energy , enterprise , zest , and thus is the proper correlative of a capable social discipline : combine // the two , each at its best , and the highest productivity of civilization is provided for . Our time , however , has set its heart upon one of the two , to the temporary neglect of the other . We disestablish , displace , abolish , make room for " the voluntary principle , " and meantime hold it for the highest merit of government , not that it should be wise , capable , steadfast , able to secure for the nation the liberation of social health , but that it should be in the nature of a weather-vane , well poised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two kinds of liberty , so also there are two distinct types of oppression , the one proceeding directly from government , the other from the want of it , or want of knowledge , understanding , consistency , sequence , in its conduct . The former exists where the just , wholesome freedom of personal choice and action is of purpose invaded , restricted , taken away by a public authority , which , set over against the nation as an opposite interest , is strong and selfish enough to indulge itself at the nation 's expense ; and there are many who will regard no other as possible . The latter , which , nevertheless , is but too possible , exists where , in the absence of a sovereign , sanitary control , liberty becomes lawless and a canker ; where egotism , unrestrained , runs riot ; where private interest , abandoned to its own conduct , becomes predatory ; and where , to crown all , government itself , amid the great factions of private force , resembles a weak nation between powerful and contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with that , and strong **42;440;TOOLONG , butneverstrong enough to maintain its independence , still less to impose peace . One oppression , which government may of purpose and upon system inflict ; another , which it alone can prevent , and which , in a complex , powerfully motived civilization , it will be able to prevent only by having a masterly head and skilled hand . Is the latter the less frequent or less fatal of the two ? He that reads history as it is , instead of reading his own bias into it , will scarcely say so . Despotism is undesirable , but candor must confess that under a despotism civilization has been seen to prosper and arrive at better things ; in a condition of anarchy , with that multifarious self-oppression of a people which comes of it , civilizations have many times been seen to perish , never // once to grow . Mexico , during its subjection to a form of delegate-despotism , which is a bad kind , grew in numbers , in wealth , in education and arts . Careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of births to deaths was 175 to 100 . Juring'forty years of no-government , misnamed " republic , " not only was there a miserable lapse into poverty and , ignorance , but the population remained stationary , its entire natural increase consumed . If it is bad to be beaten or bound , it is not felicity to commit suicide . From a strong and selfish government large classes may suffer the one ; without able government , society is always on the way to the other , perhaps dealing itself great strokes of revolution , perhaps slowly pricking itself to death with pins . As the individual body incessantly generates poisons of which it would perish , were not their elimination also systematic and unceasing , so it is with society ; private interest , if not kept momentaneously under correction by an honorable and aerating public system , breeds plagues , which , having destroyed whatever is nobler , are fatal at last to their original . In making this sort of oppression an object of attention and reflection , the American citizen simply resumes that point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The Federal Constitution owed its formation to a painful sense of just this . Liberty , the liberty of unrestraint , was the felicity of 1783 ; a means to put it under official control , to make Obligation its master , and to force upon it the regimen of health , was that of 1789 . When the War of Independence closed , the people , with some exceptions , stood in a negative attitude toward government in general ; they thought , with Jefferson , that " energetic government , " under the republican form as under another , " is always oppressive " ; and they rejoiced with him that in their happy land " the necessary evil " was reduced to a minimum . Stern fact soon made havoc with their complacency . What arrived was anything but the golden age expected . It was inexplicable ; there was no government that could oppress , all public burdens were thrown oW the pursuit of happiness left open as never before ; within was the achieving genius of the Anglo-Saxon ; without , prodigal wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of // bounding motion , debility dragging its feet ; instead of happiness , a pursuit of it to catch the contrary . Everywhere was that " rage of private interest " which Marshall signalizes as characteristic of the time , and yet no prosperity . Here was a people that would not honestly try to pay its debts , but that spared payment only to sink in poverty . Commerce was seen with empty holds and rotting ships ; capital with closed coffers , fearing to venture ; labor with idle hands ; meantime , over large sections of the country , expenditure grew lavish as means diminished . Egotism , envy , distrust , corrupted social relations , and , as usual , conscience and understanding were corrupted with them ; wild revolutionary fanaticisms - customary product of such conditions - arose and burst into war . Such was the actual present , into which that painted future had emerged . " We have thought too well of human nature , " wrote Washington , sadly . Better , and truer to his real thought , had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions under which human nature can do itself justice . " Society , as a mere inorganic aggregate of individuals , is natural to wolves , and unnatural to the civilizing genius of man ; and if human nature in an unnatural situation fails to bring forth its best , what wonder ? Morals were as little designed to have their sufficient effect without institutions as hands without tools . A systematized public virtue , sovereign in power and instant in effect , makes , one might say , the climate in which alone private virtue can generally thrive , and without which only here and there an impregnable constitution will keep its health . Or , more specifically , such a system is necessary in four ways : first , as a fixed moral capital or estate , laid up in customs and laws for the behoof of all , so that conscience need not perpetually go forth barehanded to struggle with the rudeness of primitive conditions ; secondly , as a bridle to private interest ; thirdly , as a protection against violence and fraud ; lastly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with either defensive strength or productive power . The Federalists got an eye upon such truths , and began clearly to discover why their paradisiacal expectations had been so disappointed . They saw that oppressions spring spontaneously , like malaria from undrained lands , in // defect of a right public system ; and they perceived , too , that , as the stoutest walker walks with no success when up to the hips in a bog , so conscience flounders and becomes unclean without a firm public ground . This perception , made keen by a grinding experience , determined the character of their politics . In framing the Federal system at Philadelphia , and afterwards in putting it into effect , their thought was : the people , that is , the mass of private interests and inclinations , must be governed , governed by choice abilities and efficient means , or , as the alternative , it will breed for itself oppressions to swarm like locusts , swarm and devour . They believed that , with assiduous cultivation of a right spirit , it could be thus governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , did they prefer the republican system as being less a government than any other , and the nearest approach to none at all . Quite the contrary ; they saw in this system the likeliest means to put choice abilities in power , to secure them confidence when in power , to relieve them of hampering jealousies , and thus to make a government distinctly more effective than any other , - that is , should the people show a spirit equal to the role attempted . That was " the experiment of free government , " as Washington understood it , - an experiment , not at making a government which should rule only as the weathercock rules the wind , but rather to see whether the people would faithfully choose men fit to govern , and then let them do it . There was another party , that wished only weathercock - rule . To these men the Federal system was an offence . Jefferson uttered their feeling when , at sight of the new Constitution , he wrote to Colonel Smith , " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . " Having mentioned Jefferson , we may as well take him for a type of that political direction , which in his time he led , and as whose risen Elijah he is remembered . Abroad during the miserable , demoralized years of the Confederacy , he had but distantly heard of the prevailing shames . For a while , he would believe no word of the reports that reached him , denouncing them as " British lies . " When at length his self-pleasing incredulity was forced to give way , when it became plain that the American States , // bankrupt in pocket and on the way to be so in morals , were making their liberty a byword and a hissing to the world , then lie chose to see in the unwelcome fact , not the effect of a situation made by a false direction in politics , but rather a native trait of American character . " Among many good qualities , which my countrymen possess , " tranquilly wrote he to a foreign observer , " some of a different character , unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagance , and infidelity to their engagements . " The last named , however , was an accident , not a vice . His countrymen were not rogues ; they merely liked spending , hated work , and chose rather to promise and not pay than either to labor or spare ! The remedy was to let them run in debt until no sane mortal would trust them more . They would work when they must do so or starve ; they would be frugal when want of credit and indisposition to labor should render them so ; and they would break no engagements when unable to make any , - when , their word everywhere known for counterfeit coin , all the world should cast it contemptuously back . In all this , meanwhile , he was playing the optimist , and looking on " the bright side . " A people has indeed sunk low when its sanguine friends are driven to hoping for it in this style . Washington 's mourning over the evil days seems rapture beside this smiling prognostic . There was , however , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be attributed to defect of character or defect of government , one of the two . Now , to the latter Jefferson would on no condition impute them . That oppression could spring from liberty , that is , from private interest and the individual pursuit of happiness , when not made amenable to the laws of social welfare , was to him a proposition not only preposterous , but flagitious ; action proceeding from that point of view was , as honest action , unintelligible ; corruption or treason must be at the bottom of it . His prepossession had been strengthened by observation . In France he had seen what partly was , and partly but appeared to be , the selfish rule of a class whom long isolation in hereditary privilege , divorced from all serious duty , had debauched in morals , while estranging them in sentiment and interest from the nation at // large ; and in their hands government had been made a gold spoon for the idle hundreds , and an iron yoke for the toiling millions . All the virtue there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passionate aversion to it was , perhaps , his most honorable trait . In this , again , he saw the type of all oppression , real or possible . To guard , therefore , against this seemed to him the sum of all wisdom and all rectitude in politics . Hence his political direction . According to him , the dominant design of all republican politics is to find and put in action a means , not of wisely , ably , justly governing the nation , but of governing the government ; not of making a public system superior to the mass of private interests and inclinations , but rather of securing to the latter an instant and unqualified supremacy . Any government whatsoever , as distinct from the people in person , he regarded as an adulteration of republicanism , and as sure to destroy it altogether , if not endowed with an excellent incapability to do anything but wait upon what might appear at the moment to be the popular will . In constituting its personnel , one should , therefore , seek a fitness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counsel and devise , but to receive orders and comply ; not , in short , to find outfor the people , but only to find out from them , what measures should be taken . The Constitution provided for a responsibility of the government to the people , to be effectuated by periodical election ; Jefferson insisted upon more , he must have a " direct and constant control " of it by the people , as he could not often enough say . This object implies , first , a principle of selection at the polls ; secondly , a principle of conduct at the capital . At the polls one will inquire for quick ears rather than capable judgments , for a pliability to what may be thought the people 's will rather than an intelligent devotion to its weal , and , having to choose between the two , will always prefer the supple readiness of a prentice hand to the devising head of an independent master . At the capital the persons chosen are not to find out by a broad study of facts what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty to judge what were best ; they are there to study only wishes , and to exercise themselves in pick-thank legislation ; they may put forth " motions " as feelers and ascertain what will " take " ; they // must hearken outside , conjecture as they can from the greater noise where is the greater number of voices , and act accordingly , complying promptly with the prevailing wish , if they can find one , industriously doing nothing , if among the many noises , no one seems clearly preponderant . We are to have a legislature of forty millions acting by a proxy of two or three hundred , - a proxy not generally commissioned , but to be under " direct and constant control " ; we are to have an executive of forty millions publishing its will through a Presidential towncrier . That is to be the ideal of representative republicanism . It is known which of the two tendencies prevailed . Jefferson , in the first year of our century , his elevation to the Presidency secure , and his soul elate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no republicanism , but " only its travesty " ; twelve years later boasted that " the revolution of 1800 , " signified by his own election , " was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form . " The boast was not idle ; there had indeed been a revolution of principles without change of form ; and what was the nature of it has been indicated . Between those opposite ideals we do not here judge . But Jefferson judged his own so far as this : he thought it suited only to a simple , moral society , and despaired of it , as of government and society in general , from the moment when it should have to cope with the conditions of a many-citied civilization , like that of the Old World . " Our reliance , " he said , " can not deceive us so long as we remain virtuous ; and I think we shall be so as long as agriculture is our principal object When we get piled upon one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt as in Europe , and go to eating one another , as they do there . " The founders of the Republic had seen the eating one another already in process on their own side fhe sea , and wished for an able government , that could provide effectually against it ; they were stigmatized as corruptionists , monocrats , monarchists , for their pains . Jefferson would not see that it had come , but saw it coming , and wished or hoped only to put off the evil day . " As long as the people can find employment in cultivating the land , " he had written , " I would not convert them into manners , // artisans , or anything else . " Manufactures , however , were his chief aXrersion , since , he said , " I regard the class of artificers as the panders of vice , and the instruments by which the liberties of a people are generally overturned . " He wished it were possible to exclude both manufactures and commerce forever , and to make the American people tillers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to be exchanged , he said , for foreign fabrics , imported in foreign bottoms . The happy situation might be a little prolonged , but could not be perpetuated ; and with its passing away , he looked only to see America become what Europe was at the close of the eighteenth century , when politics and morals alike were at the lowest ebb . Meantime , his political principles were designed for a social condition recognized by himself as temporary , though this did not lessen his bitterness against those who , fostering the growth of that civilization which he feared , excited his fears yet more by seeking to provide for an able sanitary control of the interests that should arise . The situation was to pass sooner than he dreamed . Not only was America to grow with unexampled rapidity in population , in wealth , in the magnitude and complexity of private interests ; not only was it thus to fly Mr. Jefferson 's ideal of a moral and pastoral life , requiring little government , and to acquire with astonishing quickness the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the opening of the century , just when his political direction became dominant , the whole civilized world was entering upon a series of economical changes , whose effect would be to empower private interest as never before , to mass interests against each other , to break up conserving customs with the conditions to which they had belonged , to mobilize civilization in an unheard-of degree , and thus to enhance immensely the need of a systematic sanitary control . Since the beginning of this century an entire set of new forces have been brought into play , all to be regarded as acquisitions , but all needing to be governed , and all , if ungoverned , dangerous . In presence of these , political duty is to b* studied anew ; and in view of them , the radical traditionalist , spinning out his little store of maxims borrowed from the century past , and esteeming himself the // most progressive of mortals when , with eyes shut to the living , pregnant reality , he opens an " advanced " school in the tomb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to show . We propose a glance at some of these new developments , which enrich and endanger the civilization of our epoch . 1 . The new means of transportation , travel , and communication have effected a social transformation of vast importance . From them has come an enormous growth of cities , a sudden extension of their influence , and a spreading abroad of the spirit of commerce , until it touches every workshop and farmhouse in the land . Our former rural civilization , with its simple manners , moderate desires , and autonomous life , has as good as disappeared ; the country is now but the suburb of the city . We remember when in a coast township two hundred miles from Boston the wages of labor and the prices of most commodities had a strictly local adjustment . Butter from the farm was sold at an invariable rate year after year . Wages were a dollar a day in haying time , two thirds as much at other seasons , and twelve or twelve and a half dollars a month for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from a mill near by , which received a portion of the fabric in payment . Money transactions were extremely limited ; money-making , as now understood , unknown . Fortunes , or what were esteemed such , - for he was rich who was taxed for ten thousand , - grew by the half-dollar , and with liberal use of the maxim that " a penny saved is as good as a penny earned . " The ups and downs of the metropolis , the mutations , the chances , the shifts of commerce , still more of speculation , were matters of far-off rumor ; the panic of 1836-37 went over like a wind in an elevated stratum of the atmosphere ; one saw the clouds fly , and that was all . A third of a century passes ; the township has gained little in population , less in wealth , not at all in the average of comfort ; but the local adjustment and comparative fixity of prices , the easy calculation of income and expense , the independence of city manners and mutations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open wood-fire and the sanded floor . The change is typical of one that has taken place throughout the country . // Meantime , while the spirit of commerce has displaced so much , and made itself dominant , there has been an equal movement toward commercial centralization . Fifty years ago , Newburyport was an independent trading centre , more independent of Boston than Boston or Cincinnati or Chicago now is of New York . We know an aged gentleman , who formerly , as a wholesale druggist and importer in the little town first named , had extensive country connections in the northeast of Massachusetts and adjacent parts of New Hampshire ; he lived to see the railroad steal them all ax* ay , and transfer them to Boston , while the latter city , in its turn , has been becoming dependent to a degree unknown and undreamed of at an earlier date . A banker , responding to some remark upon the wide effect of financial irregularities in New York , said , " Yes , disease of the heart is dangerous . " The bold figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already reached a stage where it may justly be compared to physiological unity . Moreover , the connection , while acquiring this breadth and concentration , has become in the same degree quick , instant in effect . The means of communication act as a nerve-system , to propagate influence , and make it instantaneous . Financial combinations covering half a continent are effected , as it were , in a day . The palpitations of the stock exchange are felt like an electric throb from the Atlantic to the Pacific shore . Today 's doings or misdoings in the metropolis reach Bangor and St. Louis to-morrow . A grocer in Vermont or Minnesota , over his morning 's coffee , inquires in New York , through the newspaper , at what price he shall sell a pound of coffee after breakfast . To all this , regarding its effect on one side only , a cordial welcome may be given , for it implies a social vitalization more extensive , more unitive , and more active . To name the great cities of the world is to name its systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and civilization among them , testify to the closeness of the connection . But in the republics of antiquity a peculiar fact may be observed : they are bisected ; a gap wide and deep lies between the city and the country ; the whole life consists of municipal civilization on // LOct. the one hand , and rural barbarism , or what closely approaches it , on the other . It was the feudal system which took the first great step toward a genuine rural civilization , graced with manners and arts ; over its grave , where it lies little honored nowadays , one may thank it for this vast piece of service . The new means of communication , however , are resuming its work on a larger scale , and making such a future as had no antitype in the past . A century since , Paris was a nation of half a million , with twenty-four millions of dependants ; but not long ago M. Thiers , with his peasant army , was thundering through the throats of cannon at her gates the news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . He announced the fact ; the railway had made it . The old duality disappears , the old deadness of the extremes along with it ; and if disturbed conditions , spasms of pain , flushes of fever , and a new sense of defect in the social morale keep it company , none should be surprised and none discouraged . Obviously , however , this condition requires for its health a finer public regimen , a more effective public discipline . The larger the spread of sail a ship carries in a wind , the more skilled and able should be the hand at the helm . So the higher the vitalization of society , as of any organism whatever , the more effect of system there should be , and the greater promptitude , precision , delicacy , sequence , in its effect . If the social morale , as maintained through the medium of institutions , does not become more capable and commanding , as social activity increases , oppression arrives , the worst oppression , that of demoralization and disease . Here it is. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another of commercial mobility ; centralization is every day more complete , connection every day more close and quick ; the railways and telegraphic wires are multiplied nerves , the cities nervous centres and batteries to propagate influence , the nation all one complexity of sensitive life ; and meantime the head , the controlling power , that should propagate yet more quickly , yet more vigorously and surely , the effect of a wise , healthy , sovereign system , what of that ? That is to be whatever the varying combinations and push of private interests may for the moment make it . It is an ideal that one can scarcely // regard as well suited to the reality and its demands . In the midst of our swift-rushing civilization , the public system , even when carefully made capable rather than incapable , too often resembles one who should attempt to steer a ship of a thousand tons with the tiller of a cockboat , or to balance the action of a cathedral clock with the pendulum of a parlor timepiece. 2 . The modern system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be its agent and exponent , is not strictly a creation of the present century , but has obtained in it so sudden and vast a development that it might be considered as such . Debt and credit there have been in all ages ; but the time is not far behind when there were no national debts , no bank-notes , no commercial paper in customary circulation , no debts but such as were contracted between two individuals standing face to face ; now debt and credit are the element in which the world 's economy lives , moves , and has its being . The spirit of commerce , we have said , has become ubiquitous . With commerce goes credit as its inseparable accompaniment , working to like effect , and making still more of that mobility which is the peculiar modern condition . In some sense , credit is the flower of civilization , that is , of the human virtue which makes and sustains civilization . What is it at bottom but a trust of man in man so stable , so guaranteed , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and man , however , in mere individual relation , no such trust ever did or can arise on a scale to become a great social agent . Only a virtue which has the breadth and coherence of a state , and the effect of law , begets it ; only a system of social order so continued and assured that its effect is taken for granted , renders possible this raising of trust to the degree of a stated economical power . It is a late effect of that liberation which civil institutions , and the victorious unity of civil virtue in them , secure , - a liberation by no means to be found in Rousseau 's " natural liberty . " That it demands more of what made it , - that when inventive skill has created the locomotive engine , another skill must manage and make it safe , - that without this rising to an equality with our own work , we shall be mastered and mangled by it , - is understood . But the fact remains ; credit is a product of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill , and it exists as the diploma of civilization , attesting that it has graduated with that degree . The medal has its obverse . The bright side has been suggested : there is a shadowed side also ; and it is the sanguine coward , courageous while and because he believes there is no danger , who will look on the bright side alone . No need now to say that riches may take wings to themselves ; they are only on the wing , ever in flight , whether or not to fly away . All pecuniary interests , with which all moral interests have a connection so close , are grown precarious . If , now , we suppose , what , unhappily , may be more than supposed , a large proportion , not easily distii*guished , of delusive credit , reposing on no proper basis of either capital or character , and in the nature of a forgery upon the community at large ; if we add extensive combinations and powerful appliances , designed to act upon credit otherwise sound , like those who set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames ; if , accordingly , it becomes a stated necessity in the conduct of business to trust practically what the mind can but half trust at best ; if , by consequence , legitimate trade and honest investment , reduced to conjectural ground , are reduced also to venture like the gambler , turning the dice-box to take their chance ; - if this be , not wholly indeed , but always in considerable part the situation , what ensues ? The financial condition resembles that of lands extremely subject to earthquakes , where the ground is always shaking , arid may at any moment open under the feet . Is it not approximately the modern situation ? " Panics , " that are to finance what earthquakes are to the globe , have already acquired an irregular periodicity ; while if these do not arrive , to shake our Lisbons down , it is commonly because the same thing is distributed , manifesting itself as chronic rather than acute . The moral force of civilization has produced an agent which its immoral forces seize upon and use against itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying shows , to blow bubbles with only foul air inside and pass them off for sterling substance , or to " corner " honest credit and extort toll ; what the virtue of civilization has brought forth , its vice captures and turns against it . // The situation tells upon morals , upon intellect , upon physical health , upon sanity . Buckle , in his chapters upon Spain , remarked upon the moral effect of a constant liability to earthquakes , asserting that a shaking ground unsettles civilization ; unsettles , as it were , the human soul itself . His observations might have taken a wider extent ; all instability , social as physical , above all , instability of a nature to fire the hopes and spur the fears of egotism , works to the like effect . Niebuhr , again , was persuaded that more than once the morals of a civilization , and therewith the civilization itself , have succumbed to a great pestilence , first with that egotism of terror , then that contempt of precaution , since no precaution seems to avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pestilence in its way , and in the realm of morals is always more or less destructive , often severely so , while that inflation of spurious prosperity , which alternates with collapse , corrupts yet more . Finally , a constant condition of financial insecurity not only seduces conscience and extinguishes honor , but induces a peculiar low concentration of mind , which , become habitual , incapacitates it for the genial expansion of good sense . A Blondin , balancing himself upon his rope , must have his soul in the feet , - a focusing of the mind not likely to give it either elevation or breadth . Modern trade , insomuch as it has an ever-fluctuating credit for a foothold , is placed somewhat in the same position . The rope , too , has rotten strands ; one ventures upon it , hoping that it will hold this time ! It is certain , then , that the system of credit , as now developed , is an immense acquisition , and certain , too , that , as now conditioned , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to be endured . How , now , to correct these abuses ? It is one of several hard problems , which our own and the ensuing age will have to solve . Certain , meanwhile , that they will never be corrected by private action alone : government must help , and be capable , as well as beyond suspicion sound , that it may help . 3 . Another modern phenomenon is the private corporation . Here , too , it is a vast productive force which one has in view . That massing of capital , effected by means of this modern institution , and seen to be proceeding daily through leagues and // coalescences to aggregations more and more enormous , has given to enterprise another right hand , the hand , too , of a Titan . When the modern individualist spirit , become fully established , had given to all activity a corresponding form , it might have seemed that works to rival those of antiquity , as of Egypt , India , Assyria , - works accomplished by the massing of men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke 's great speech upon " The Nabob of Arcot 's Debts , " he observed that in the Carnatic alone were to be found above eleven hundred public reservoirs for irrigation , from the extent of some acres to more than five miles in circumference , " built , " he said , " with admirable skill and labor , and maintained at a mighty charge . " The British government , strong only in the strength , and weak with the infirmity , of our individualizing times , could not even keep in repair those noble resources , which the " insatiable benevolence , " as the great rhetorician called it , of ancient rule had provided ; and the famine , that strewed the Carnatic with unburied dead , came in consequence . To the ancient massing of men succeeds , however , the modern massing of capital , and powers that seemed lost forever are restored to civilization . Of this much has already come , while its effects , so far from being exhausted , or even approaching their predestined term , are , we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what reclamation of wastes , what restoration of denuded lands , what systems of drainage and irrigation wellnigh continental , what corrections of climate even , may one day issue from it ? Imagine this force brought to bear in its grandest proportions upon the valley of the Amazon , upon the wilds of Africa , upon deserts that are such from mere luxuriance , regions starved by abundance , barren from over-fecundity , and closed to civilization by their very ability to feed it . What other power has the world now in hand , that were able to tame the tropics ? The railway , according to Mr. Ruskin , makes the globe in effect smaller , by reducing distance ; but the power which is behind the railway can , on the contrary , render it , as a household for man , incomparably more spacious . By nothing , meanwhile , is civilization more gravely menaced than by this very ally . Once again , through its access , civihiza // tion is in one of those immature , expectant stages , which announce an abler epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations , new tasks , a fresh travail of intelligence and pain , it may be beyond that of death , as the price of a richer life . Ever the appearance of unprecedented powers is a sight to elate the thoughtless , and to sober yet more deeply the minds that were sober before ; for they come to serve only if duly commanded , and otherwise to destroy . In the present case , our Titan has already sufficiently shown , but is daily showing afresh , its extreme need of a master . Unregulated , it has organized exaction , pampered fraud , systematized pillage , given castles to corruption , made dukes and archdukes of plundering speculators , and afforded but too good excuse to the craze that shrieks against capital itself . Neither the morals nor the industrial interests of civilization can endure always to be preyed upon in this way . Massed capital is a good thing , but massed extortion and massed fraud are not good ; a means must be found , a sure means , to prevent the good thing from becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under control . In our country there is a disposition to attempt the work , or one section of it , but in what seems to us an unhealthy and unpromising way . In the " granger " movement , one aggregation of private interest is pitted against another , resolved to capture it , if possible . Whether the capture will be effected seems doubtful , supposing it desirable . Little good will come of it , we apprehend ; and if not good , then evil . Social dissension , disruption , one more fissure of that social unity which is the safeguard of national unison , have already come of it , and are too likely to continue doing so . Now , social contention , without a clear , commanding , wholesome decision as its result , makes political indigestion , and by continuance renders it chronic . The agitator , administering his dose from the platform , will have a wholesome effect , provided he is not a quack , who relies upon the fact that there is disease to prove his nostrum the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can respond by throwing the medicine off , and the affliction along with it . But when conspirations of private interest , on this side and that , marshal their forces and wage their war , while // the public system is upon principle made such that it can but trim and try to please , agitation even against indubitable mischiefs is likely itself to be but another mischief added to them . 4 . The free commerce and free competition , which in recent times have succeeded to a system of multiplied restrictions , have brought obvious and important aids . Free commerce makes the whole world every man 's market , in which to buy and sell . It enables those who have special advantages , natural or acquired , to obtain the fullest use of them , and at the same time to impart their benefit to the largest number . Meantime , it obliterates provincialism , liberalizes men by a large acquaintance , promotes a good understanding between nations by customs of peaceful , profitable intercourse , and is probably doing more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In respect indeed to the comity of nations , it has succeeded to the role assumed in the Middle Ages by the Catholic polity ; and if there be in the modern equivalent for ecclesiastical administration less of heaven , there is in it less of hell also . Free competition , again , which belongs to the same system , has aspects exceedingly favorable , though , to be sure , it has been prejudiced by a celebration too profuse and too little discriminating . It is valuable , in the first place , as a principle of unconscious regulation ; regulation accomplished , not by any express mechanism , liable always to get out of order , and costly even when perfectly in gear , but by the ordinary effect of human motives . Free competition , again , develops by demanding individual resource it puts every man upon his mettle , tempts enterprise , and makes each the nursling of that necessity which is the mother of invention . The free initiative of the individual does so much to evoke activity and give zest , that there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so kept under correction as not to im peril social stability , coherence , and health . Once more , free competition is praised , and with reason , as a principle of " natural selection " ; it sifts out incompetence , we are told , gives the tools to him that can handle them , and , pushing every man toward the place where his abilities will serve him best , secures also to the community its benefit of their most effective use . In some such strain are its eulogists accustomed to speak of it , // and there is sense in what they say . We have reason , therefore , to reckon this system among the signal acquisitions of the modern era . It is good , however , with one indispensable condition , one , if no more . Let probity compete with probity , faithful skill with the like skill , let there be a fair rivalry , and the prize go to the best man ; then morals are conserved , while industrial pressure is always toward more and more of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud , genuine with deceptive production , then the pressure is in the opposite direction , and a principle of unnatural selection put in force . Now , that a large and severely oppressive proportion of this has got into the modern system of competition , is a fact that no assiduity of winking can wink out of sight . Law , disconcerted , in despair , looks on and lets the thing go . Government does indeed try its hand here and there in a small way , as in forbidding milk to be watered , or the flesh of animals which have died of disease to be sold as food ; but in general we have given up , and know of nothing better than that every man be put upon his wits , and make his own suspicious eyes his guardian as best he can . It is indeed certain that government can not undertake with success to be wit for all the simple , and knowledge for all the ignorant , but it is also certain that the business of leaving every man to fight it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , this setting of every man to buy with the eyes of a detective be relied upon as a sufficient means to keep up the standard of production , and to assure its morals , the reliance is obviously ill placed . Within the present century there has been throughout the world a marked deterioration in the quality of ordinary plain work . Not to speak of the extent to which the adulteration of foods and fabrics goes on , one must recognize a tendency toward slight and flimsy fabrication , toward paint and gloss as the cover for what is intrinsically of little worth in this respect , it is certain that the world has gone backward . Something of insubstantial and fictitious in the product of labor has become a trait of the present age ; there is an expenditure of industry to make things look better than they really are , and sell for more than they are really worth , of which it is mere // self-deception to say that the like and to the like extent has been seen in all ages . Carlyle took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one two hundred , the other ten years old . The bricks at the corners of the former were still sharp as when they left the mould , and the mortar was hard and smooth , like polished rock ; the new house scarcely had corners , the brick was so worn away , while the mortar was crumbling , and could be picked out with the finger . There are in London square miles of new-built houses that are but gilded traps to catch tenants in . The English law seems expressly designed to favor the process . It requires the tenant to leave the house in as good repair as he found it , - which commonly means , such being the quality of the work , rebuilding it in part , and may mean rebuilding entire . Of the latter an example : A London carpenter hired a house of a bishop , and one day it literally tutubled down over his head . Luckily escaping alive , he wrote to the bishop , and acquainted him with the event , supposing that the latter would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No answer was returned , and he wrote again , saying : " I am paying house-rent with no house ; will your lordship please attend to th' matter at once . " The bishop now replied , and the response was , " If the house has fallen down , you are to rebuild it , not I. Please do so promptly , and see that the work is properly done . " The astonished carpenter took legal advice , found that the law indeed required this of him , and had to expend the earnings of his life to the last penny in complying with its dernands. * Now , though laws may not elsewhere be so ill devised or vilely construed as to bid directly for fraud in building , yet these effects are not confined to England . On the Continent , to the extent of our observation , there is the same general , almost invariable tendency toward flimsy construction , the same expenditure of labor in making deceptive show . In Stuttgart , for example , a house a hundred years old will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day in building will have ceased to be even a ruin . We build thin houses in America , but it would be hard to find in American cities such // examples of painted botchery in domestic architecture as are to be seen in the capital of Wiirtemberg . Under such a system , honesty is not fostered , but starved ; fraud is not systematically weeded out , but cultivated ; civilization puts at odds the morals that are its life-blood , and puts a premium upon the vices that would destroy it . Deceptive production , in the first place , makes labor a school of demoralization . The workman knows well what is done ; he helps the employer cheat ; it is a poisoned air , that no one can live in long , and remain healthy . The system comes to this : Be honest at yo*ir peril . In an examination some years since , before an English Parliamentary commission , a dealer , reported as highly respectable , was asked if he thought it morally right to put up and vend as pure coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perfectly right ! " responded he , without a moment 's hesitation , and not without s*me virtuous displeasure that such a matter should at all be brought into question . " But how , " it was inquired , " will it be with the dealer next door , who sells only pure coffee as such ? " " Can not he make a mixed article too ? " retorted the respectable : " if he has not sagacity enough for that , let him fail , he deserves it ! " And the good man closed with a vigorous reclamation in behalf of free competition . In the moral assimilation of bad conditions one man is quicker than another , and profits by his celerity ; but in the long run and on the large scale conscience grows to the climate it lives in , and the dealer next door , if not in due time morally reconciled with his climate , will at least die of it , and leave the place to suppler constitutions . It is not here intimated that such examples represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent its climate , with the effect of this upon susceptible constitutions . Now , it is but too plain that something is operating in modern society to displace the scruples of honesty and honor . Gross betrayals of pecuniary trust , - how frequent they are grown ! Hardly a week fails to bring intelligence of some glaring example ; one is surprised rather to miss than to find them in the columns of the newspaper . Look , too , at the list of defaulters , and see what names are there ! - names of men never made to be rogues , and indeed that never meant to be // such , but fell into the ways of the world , took liberties , and could not take them back . Look at the list of corporations which gravely vote to " pass " the interest on their bonds ! We have trusted private interest too far , have permitted too much , have left men to be schooled by their practical conditions into laxities that , become general , unstring civilization ; and society , that feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of its suffering , and scruples to lay blame upon the individual . How much the permitted license of competition has to do with the effects just noted , we are unable to say . The system itself , meanwhile , is not only advantageous , but inevitable ; to rage against it is vain , to attempt its displacement Quixotic . But that , as now conditioned , it generates a bad air and makes typhus , is out of question . Meanwhile , we make no excuse for dwelling rather upon the moral aspects of the case than upon oppression in the shape of pecuniary injury , for that is simply to go to the root of the matter , even though it is here presented for political consideration . Civilization has its system of morals which are not only necessary to it , but are itself , its vital essence . Civilization , - what is it at bottom but an imperative preference of peace to violence , of honesty to fraud , of industry to idleness , of just to lawless possession , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beastly and barren ? It is human virtue that makes such a preference ; and only when such virtue rules , is lawgiver , master , magistrate , can civilization prosper , or in the end exist . Government is properly the means to organize and effectuate that rule , and failing notably , habitually there , it is a Beishazzar that perhaps does not see the writing on the wall , but against which no less the sentence is gone out , " Tried in the balance and found wanting " ; nor will anything in its form , however good as matter of form , atone for that defect of function . Government can not indeed make virtue , nor need do so , for human nature brings forth the needed supply , not superabundant , but enough to live on , if the harvest be properly husbanded ; but government can and must be an economist of morals . 5 . To pass to another topic . The system of free labor , that // is , of free individual engagement , is in many aspects a precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heightens in him the individual consciousness , and leaves open to him the way to all that outward success which is commonly desired among men . Moreover , there is in the system a principle of self-regulation , of which it has already been said , the more of it the better , provided the regulation be really effected . Under the best conduct , the modern method would doubtless be attended by occasional hardships , but by none surely equal to the general hardship implied in an iron system designed to render any particular case of suffering impossible . Nevertheless , if to satisfy those immediately concerned be success , free labor , as known at present , borders upon failure . Labor itself has risen in arms against it , and an organization is spread through all the countries of Christendom , whose purpose is to make the war general and systematic . The recent remarkable progress of socialist democracy in Germany , evinced by the election of ten or eleven members to the Beichstag , - while giving by these numbers but a faint hint of its force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social disorder already , in greater or less degree , coextensive with Occidental civilization . Indeed , in the immense social agitation initiated in our day , and destined , it seems clear , to characterize the coming century , no element betrays or promises a profounder disturbance than just this of free labor . A little while ago it gave the age a word to conjure with ; and now , while the echoes of its praise are yet in the ears , there breaks forth from its own side a fierce jarring note of complaint , incrimination , menace . " Down with the middle classes ! " roars the International in Europe . " He that works for wages is a slave ! " cries labor-reform in America . " I can not help rejoicing , " said to us an ex-mechanic in Massachusetts , - whose face , by the way , indicated intelligence , while his language and manners were those of culture and good breeding , - " I can not help rejoicing at every bankruptcy , and think thefts , robberies , burglaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely labor is sore ill , and these are its groans . For these wild utterances are not merely expressions of feeling peculiar to here and there an unbalanced nature ; they represent the // fixed , insuperable persuasion of not a few , and beyond this a good deal of that half-grown persuasion , which is above all the element wherein revolutions foment . Aside from strikes , the grudge of labor is a constant deduction from its effect . Wendell Phillips , quick to detect symptoms of social disorder , but also far too quick to pronounce upon them , denounces the " wage-system " as teaching the laborer to " skulk and cheat , " rather than to do his best . An impatient mind would take a short cut to truth , and quits the road only to butt the wall . But it has indeed become too commonly true that laborers skulk and cheat , especially the discontented ones , who profess labor reform . " A fair day 's work for a fair day 's wage , " is scarcely now the customary chant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry . On the contrary , some at least avow it as their maxim , " The least possible work for the highest possible pay . " In the workingmen 's unions of Berlin , it was recommended that a bricklayer who had been accustomed to lay eight hundred bricks a day should for the future lay only two hundred , that four times as many hands might be needed , and the demand get ahead of the supply . Meantime , labor is oppressed , no doubt of it , and in two ways . The theory of the laborer 's situation is this : in return for a moderate , but assured , support , he consents to forego the chances of fortune , leaving to the capitalist , along with these , those risks of loss which he himself caniiot afford to incur . The theory is too often falsified in fact . The lawless cupidity of speculation makes inflation , to be followed by collapse , and periodically turns workmen out of employ by the ten thousand . The risks , therefore , not merelyof capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forced upon the laboring class , while the winnings of the gamester are never theirs . Again , the purchasing power of wages is statedly reduced : first , by cheap money , which tells the laborer he gets three dollars a day , when in truth he has but two and a half ; secondly , by speculative inflation of prices ; thirdly , by so multiplying the risks upon trade and production that each man engaged in them must perforce try to cover his hazard with a large margin of profit ; fourthly , by labor itself // that " skulks and cheats , " and so clips the dollar in its own hand . In fine , here is a disturbed social condition , whose costs in money or money 's worth are immense , while yet inconsiderable beside the injury done in other ways , as by the making of bad blood , of infatuations , and of a violent spirit , prepared to say , all is fair in war . Of course , it can be said that evils cure themselves , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure themselves ; their supply is exhausted , and they die of their own havoc . Evils famish themselves by killing what had nourished them . The human style of cure is another , we should say . But our business here is simply to note the condition , - a very oppressive one , clearly not made by government , nor as yet manageable by it . Nor , perhaps , will it ever become manageable otherwise than by sustaining a better general regimen . 6 . The last of those great economical changes , implying profound social chaige , which are here touched upon , stands in closest connection to the last mentioned . It consists in the extensive substitution of machinery driven by steam or the like for simple hand-labor . Is it necessary to spend words in exhibiting the accession of productive power which has come therewith ? Everybody knows it ; fable is outdone by fact . Limitless energies of nature are become our journeymen , lightning our mail-carrier . This new power , however , is not ploughing seas and prairies alone , but human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptui'ned the old sward , to leave the brown soil bare , unless a new genius of social tilth shall follow . Without this , one plainly sees , the earth will teem , but man himself become barren . There are broad areas even now that lie too nearly bare ; in many a Manchester , those human fields , which one covers with the term " operative , " look desolate , the health and hope and cheer of labor , that clothed them once , too obviously turned under . The class of operatives , made pendent to a business which they do not own , able to attain in it the distinction of a master only by fighting their way out of their own class into another ( not humanly possible in one case out of a thousand ) , fixed in a condition of class-separation , and with almost no play of // sympathetic human relation between them and those with whom they are economically connected , - these persons , scarcely known as persons , bu*t purchased merely as " labor , " are thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand ; they see , for the most part , only one another , speak , listen only to one another , and generate together a style of sentiment and opinion that springs only from their peculiar position . But as there are many of them , in an intercourse numerically large , though in character so limited , this sentiment is confirmed between mouth and ear ; thus they acquire for what is , in truth , the product of a singularly narrow experience , narrower than individual experience is commonly , a sense of universal validity , as if it were what everybody sees and says . It is observed that " striking " fraternities are usually unwilling to hear a syllable from the other party . The reason is , their ears are full already ; among themselves they have beforehand obtained that social confirmation of individual opinion which commonly suffices to give assurance . A certain amount of general saying is certitude for most men with that , the particular seems sustained by the universal ; and this point reached , all else which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , while the situation is really a hard one , and while its hardship is but too likely to be mistaken for one wilfully imposed by the employer , the discontent that may be generated talks only with itself , and , nevertheless , obtains all that confirmation which comes from a wide social interlocution and a consent of opinion equal in extent . The remarkable and ever-growing development of socialistic doctrine among the operative classes in Europe is due to this singular condition , and is now recognized by all thoughtful Europeans as a very grave matter . In America such doctrine is still an exotic , - as the Canada thistle was once . The thistle is sufficiently at home here now . But while the isolation of the operative leads to sentiment intensely partial on the one side , there is partiality also on the other . In Europe we have met with a Manchester capitalist , a man of reading , courteous in manners , genial in conversation , and , to judge from his personal impression apart from his opinions , of kindly nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give nothing , directly or indirectly , to subsidize no charity , to relieve no distress . " If , " said he , " a man is poor , he is so by his OWil fault or that of hi* progenitors ; his poverty is the just reward of his indolence , intemperance , ignorance , incapacity , one or all , or of the like in his parents . What have I to do with the matter ? It is simply immoral to meddle . Nature feeds industry , starves idleness , feeds intelligence and knowledge , starves ignorance and stupidity ; that is her system of morals , and no man has any right to interfere with it . Talk of misfortune ; your meddling benevolence is the misfortune , with its trying to keep in what Nature tries to starve out . Let alone , let every man have what he can lawfully get , along with what he lawfully inherits ; then each will have just what he deserves , that is , all that does or can honestly belong to him . I come of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good judgment in the conduct of business ; I inherit the fruit of that , as it is right I should do , and have added to it . Another comes of a family that has been habitually lazy or improvident or intemperate , and whose wits have suffered from its habits ; he inherits the fruit of that , as it is right he should do . If he can fight his way out of that bad inheritance , good ; he will deserve to be quit of it when by his own exertion he actually is so . It is his affair , he is his own man . People talk about the virtues ' of charity , generosity , etc. ; they are vices , not virtues . Cost , pay , profit , are the wholesome words ; stick to those , as Nature does . If I give a man a shilling , or lend him one as matter of favor , I make a thief of him , and become myself a party to the theft . The shilling is not his , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has simply picked my pocket with my own complicity . " The words here are our own , but the doctrine is fairly represented . There is sense in it , too ; and yet between socialism on the one hand , and Miancliesterism ( if this be it ) on the other , who will judge to the discredit of the former alone ? Machinery , in making a class of capitalists and a class of operatives , has brought out on both sides a class-sentiment , just when the demands of the situation could be met only by a new breadth and integrity of feeling and thinking . On both sides there is the partiality of private interest , with the mutual misunderstanding which must come of it . // IDid this case stand alone , were our civilization otherwise well settled , the cleft would close up , a good understanding between the divided parties be xeached by mutual approximation ; for men are not mere blind embodiments of private interest , but also in part , if often in too small part , rational creatures . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to year , and , complicated with so much else to the like effect , threatens to go on widening . Capital find labor both suffer in consequence , the community at large suffers with them , and it is easy to see , or rather impossible not to see , that , with a continuance and continued exasperation of these conditions , the affliction will become intolerable . This completes the enumeration proposed . What we have seen is an accession of productive powers , vast in proportion , munificent in promise , rich in effect already attained . But these powers , representing private interest , share its limitations , and do not place themselves in healthy relation with the public weal . Meantime , the public system , whose function it is to sustain the conditions of social health , resembles , in presence of these new forces , a coachman who has learned well how to guide a team of horses , but suddenly finds himself in charge of a locomotive-engine , and knows not which way to turn . In this posture of affairs numberless oppressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another , and either way taxing the community , breaking up its amity , and corrupting its morale . And this it is which is here signalized as especially the modern type of oppression . Private interest empowered , escaped control , and running at last into sheer corrupting disease , that everywhere infects the modern spirit , - that is , summarily , the situation . What should be done ? It is easy to answer the question in general , though to answer it in detail would require the study of some decades , even if that study were resolutely set about , and steadily pursued , with application of the best abilities to it . In general , however , the way is clearly indicated , though it be like a way through the wilderness , plain enough by compass , but to be made with many a stroke of labor . In the sphere of the public system the work is to be done . What is the state here for , in the first instance , but to uphold the necessary order , and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults of private passion and the partialities of private interest ? To this end , consciously and expressly , the federal system was framed : resume the spirit that gave it birth ; qualify it to do the work for which it was brought into being . Nor , to this purpose , will there be any call for an endless drizzle of interferences : a little , done in season , and really done , will suffice . No need to be always trying , if one will drive here and there a bolt of iron and rightly clinched . Give us sound iron in the right place , and we shall have no occasion to be always pottering with rope-yarns . But sound iron , - do the people see that in the public system now ? They say the contrary , and loudly , copiously enough . The attitude , indeed , of us Americans toward our government is singular , and may be counted by a future age among those curiosities of history which would be incredible , were they not history . In the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , next to none ; profuse praise of the one , prodigal distrust , incrimination , contempt of the other , run side by side , like the clear waters of the Mississippi and the turbid cnrrent of the Missouri immediately after their junction . It may be , however , that the contradiction indicates good sense rather than the want of it , and that the nation hits the nail upon the head in both instances . The form of the government was made by the Federalists , but Jefferson boasted that he and his confederates had evicted the practical principles which at first went into it , and substituted others radically different . However this be , certain it is that , along with rapturous praise of the Republic as a form , there goes measureless reproach of its practical character and action . No parliamentary body within the limits of civilization is less trusted and respected by the nation at large than the American Congress by the American people . From no national legislature is less expected ; the best hope of the people is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be no worse off at the close of a session than at its opening , is thought a piece of luck , and it is not often that anything like a consenting voice of the people declares them to have been even in that degree lucky . So in the several States ; very commonly , the meeting of legislative // bodies is looked to with apprehension , while a sigh of relief is breathed when they adjourn . In no other civilized land is official character rated lower ; in none is the political class more distinctly out of credit . Politician , as everybody knows , is a word quite ruined in reputat:on by long keeping of bad company , or of what passes for such . Our method of making officials is perfection , but the thing made is promptly pronounced bad work by the mechanic himself . A man is respectable until he is elected ; no sooner have the people put their stamp upon him than they incline to call him branded ; the impression of their own merit recommends him to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quitting clean ground to draggle their skirts in " the dirty pool of politics . " Well hit ! cried the multitude ; no one thought democracy vilified in being characterized as foul water ; to be a dirty pool was serenely assumed as its normal condition . It is a curious posture . " If America is right , Jefferson was right , " says Parton . Does America itself say that it is right ? - not as to its form of government , which Jefferson did not help to make , and which would never have been made had his wishes prevailed , but as to the practical character of its politics . It has a singular way of saying so , if that be the thing said ! In 1863 , or thereabouts , a great American orator addressed the labor-reforiiners assembled in Fanenil Hall , and in one of his most effective paragraphs gave his opinion of the coin which our political mint brings forth . His address is not now before us , nor immediately accessible ; we do not therefore profess to quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general purport of the paragraph in question . Somewhat to the following effect the passage lies in our recollection : " Legislation has no conscience : do n't waste time in holding a candle to a blind eye . The legislator looks to one thing , his private interest , especially his interest to get himself re-elected : there he has feeling , there you will touch him , and make him feel . The fiction is that he takes his place to think , study , learn , labor , for the public weal ; the fact is that he takes it to speculate on his private account , speculate in popular favor , and make out of it what he can . Treat him accDrdingly ; no inquiring // about his convictions as a statesman , he has none ; he is your tool , or you are his ; inquire , choose whether you will be his tool , or make him yours . Choose : and understand that his selfish devotion to his own interest , which would betray you , is also the handle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sell you , if you permit him , or sell himself to you , if you compel him . Be his purchaser and not his wares ; bribe his interest on the one hand , threaten it on the other ; make your terms , and say , Here , give us your vote , we will give you ours . If he begin playing the considerate statesman , talking of what is just and for the weal of the community , he is trying to jockey you . Put an end to that ; tell him he is not in the pulpit , but in the market , that you have made your bid , that if he will knock himself down to you , the bargain is made , and that if he do not , you will bear your bid elsewhere . Do this , " said the orator , " and in a year the politicians will be about you begging you to take them at your own terms . " We repeat that here is no pretence of reproducing the words , or even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection at some years ' distance can make one ,  --  recollection from carefully reading , not simply hearing , - that the substance of the advice given is here not unfairly represented . The speech was approved , printed , circulated , - circulates yet , most likely ; and in respect to this remarkable passage , has not , to our knowledge , incurred public criticism . Perhaps such counsel made rather for the speaker 's credit as a man , wrong-headed indeed about measures , but very knowing in his judgment of motives and men . Were it , now , the question whether official character in our Republic was there justly described , we should at once answer , No ; it is a description of the disease with which our politics are plagued , but which , nevertheless , is their plague , not their type ; and meantime we hold that the advocate , in counselling his clients to accept that measureless demoralization of democracy which he imagined , to adjust themselves to it , speculate in it , make a profit from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service as any man could render with honest intents . The point , however , is that such things could be said , approved by the auditors , and not condemned by the public . Distrust has gone so far ! Mr. Parton goes to Washington , // dines with Congressmen , is convinced they do not generally steal , says so publicly , and is laughed at for his credulity ; a journal snggests that good dinners , like charity , cover a multitude of sins . In fine , modern civilization is rich beyond example , and rich in liberalities , magnanimities , humane interests and intents , no less than in material resource , but it is disordered , and it is worm-eaten ; and in America the condition is extreme on both sides . No nation is so preyed upon , and none has so much which can be preyed upon . Private interest has been put in command of agents more able , means more opulent , than imagination had dreamed of ; it has come to devise and will in a royal way . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new conditions . Let the time but govern well what it has got , and it may cease to boast ; its deeds will be its praise . Here , however , the defect is flagrant ; the business of governing our conditions is ill done and in a bad way . And because this is the case , disorders increase , oppressions multiply ; the nation is plundered in pocket , imperilled in morals ; angry discontent is the mood of millions , distrust of all ; agitation , insecurity , unhealthy excitement , hope to win and fear to lose , alike hovering in nncertair*y , alike heightened by imagination , unsettle conserving customs , break up the traditions of honesty and honor , reduce intellect to skipping , snatching processes , and prey even upon physical health ; trade , harassed by the speculating larv*o , learns their methods , if only in self-defence ; platform-professors of reform instruct applauding audiences to see in our institutions only the egotism of individuals , in the labors of public life only the plotting of private interest ; and philanthropy itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditates the making of universal felicity at a stroke by some grand " operation " with a lie at the bottom . Social war is already announced ; labor is in the field against capital , " granges " against corporations ; and what is believed to be justice is sought by the methods of extortion . This is the shadowed side of modern life , the offset to its magnificent and incomparable achievements . Rich and deranged , liberal and lax , productive and a prey , spacious in sentiment and bewildered in moral judgment , principled in a philanthropy // world-large and scarce able to believe in simple honesty , hoping all things , like charity , and , unlike charity , driving a bargain , it may be , with Satan to obtain hope 's fruition , civilization resembles a spring day , when sunshine and sleet come together , and the blossoms , prodigal in beauty and promise on every hillside , open their hearts to the one only to receive with it the other . Nnmbers can not see this , becanse they are habitnated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see barbarism in the regime of the revolver , the bludgeon , and the bowie-knife . Nnmbers , a gain , simply will not see it , since they must be happy , and to be happy must think there is no danger . The latter class , much the less penetrable of the two , bolt the doctrine of progress to their sides , and go about iron-clad against instruction . Progress , say they ; enough , nothing is amiss ; be a philosopher , and be sure that all is well . They look down with pity upon those who do not see in thickening evils only " evolution , " but trouble themselves rather to evolve an understanding and a duty . These , on their side , have somewhat to say , and it runs to the following effect : " There is indeed progress , notable , wonderful . progress , and therefore work to be done . Progress must continually learn new arts of precaution and purgation , not to be buried at length under its own accumulated slough . Rome died of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet others will , perhaps , do again . Were men more able to profit by either the lessons of history or those of external nature , the rushing advance of our civilization , considering the specific character of that advance , would scarce be an occasion for wordy exultation or sanguine unconcern ; for when private progress is toward power and the means of exaction , while the public progress is rather toward diffuse liberality without able conduct , then , if ever , is that progress in a way to become its own plague .
