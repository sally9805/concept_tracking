txt Great credit is due to Mr. HENRY NauMANN , familiarly known as " Dutch Heinriohs. " for his recent close impersonation of an insane man . Mr. NEUMANN , who is by profession a bond-robber  --  though with a delicate blending of modesty and satire he prefers to call himself a broker  --  was some months since sent to Sing Sing for some more than usully enterprising stroke of business . It subsequently appeared that there was an informality in his conviction , and he was thereupon returned to the Tombs for a new trial . Knowing that he was sure to be convicted , Mr. NEUMANN decided to become insane , and he has played the part of a lunatic with great skill and unremitting perseverance ever since . Any thief can feign insanity for a day or two , but when a man keeps up his assumed character as a lunatic for a month at a time , his perseverance really deserves recognition . For years past the freight-cars of the Harlem Railroad nave been permitted to stand for thirty minutes at a time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn into the depot . Of course , while those cars were on the track , the street-cats of the Fourth-avenue line , on their way down-town , were blocked up , to the great annoyance of their passengers . Within the last few days , it has occurred to some gigantic intellect in the employ of the railway , that the street  --  zars could be switched on to the up-track , and thus be drawn around the olig strutting freight-cars . Accordingly , this scheme has been put In practice , and the delays which formerly occurred three or four times every day are now obviated . The switches have been is existence for the last ten years or more , and the fact that they have at last been pin to their proper use , reflects very great credit upon the enterprise of the company . There has been a riot at Frankfort-on-theMain , directed , as the cable informs us , against the sellers of beer . Breweries and beer-houses have been stormed and sacked . and untold quantities of beer have been wasted in the municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred in this country , would at once have been understood to be a movement in the interests of total abstinence . Probably it would have been led by women and ojieered on by men anxious for the suppression of the beer-fiend . Occurring , however , as it does in a German city , we immediately recognize that it is a protest against poor beer at high prices . When the German becomes a rioter , the chances always are that he is fighting in defense of his oeloved beer ; but when he proceeds to attack the sources of his beverage , it is morally certain that either bad beer or extortionate prices have led him to break the peace in order to convince the brewers of the error of their ways . The person who jumps overboard from a ferry-boat in order to drown himself , and is rescued by the herculean exertions of his Pelle wpassengers , has been repeating that pleasing performance . At first sight , this form of suicide would seem to be less selfish than that practiced by the ill-bred person who cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves a letter requesting his body to be sent miles away for burial at the expense of his belp'ess friends . In Point of fact , however , it is even a more heartlessly selfish proceeding . When a man Jumps overboard from a ferry-boat he delays hundreds of passengers , who have to wait while the effort is made to fish him out again , and he shocks the nerves of weak women and tender-hearted men who may witness his performance . No gentleMan will be guilty of such an act , especially when he can take passbge on a steamer with insufficient coal , and thus put himself in the way of dying without trouble or expense to any one . Every one knows that a solitary boy was saved from the wreck of the Atlantic . This boy was subsequently taken to Walt-street , and cruelly exposed to the howlings of the bulls and bears . Having survived those two ordealsfhe has now , so it is said , been seized upon by a showman , who proposes to exhibit him as a curiosity to the inquisitive public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public does not care to gaze upon a boy . but would take an active interest in looking upon the man who caused the wreck of the Atlantic . Either Mr. Ismay or Mr. Imrie is the showman 's true game . Let him engage one of those thrifty gentlemen to . exhibit himself for a few hours each day , holding a sample of oheap coal in his hand , and offering for sale photographs of the Atlantis as she appeared driving on the coast with her commander asleep , and the extent to which the public will patronize tho exhibition will make the showman 's fortune long before the season is over . It is reported that the French Transatlantic cable is broken about 230 miles west of Brest . It has recently been pointed out that the manner in which the ocean cables have been constructed makes it reasonably certain that they will break at no very distant time . The outer coating of the cable consists of hemp and iron wire . The wire will , of course . rust , and the rust will eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except by a covering of gutta-percha . It is , of course , impossible to remedy this error . so far as the sables ale ready laid are concerned , but the company that is about to lay a new cable from New-York to Land 's End miyht well take into conetderation the propriety of doing their work thoroughly . Ocean tables that will only last for three or four years are decidedly too expensive . There bas been a curiously complicated revolution in Panama . Some few years since . the Republic of New-Granada changed its name , and became the United States of Colombia . In order to give every possible facility to revolutionists. each State of the Republic was permitted to elect its own President , and the Federal Government bound itself to observe a strict neutrality in its State revolutions . Recently President NEIRA ruled over the State of Panama . Early in April he was arrested , and a new government , under President CErtvERA , established . The federal troops in the City of Pans . ma immediately undertook to have a share to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President NEIRA . Thereupon a treaty was made between the Federal and State troops , whereby President NsinA was handed over to the Peruvian Minister . to be kept in escrow , as the lawyers would say . until ex-President CORI/BOBO should reach Havana and succeed President CERVERA . It is thought that the dreaded Panama fever oriel. nates in the attempt on the part of foreigners to master the Intricacies of Colombian politics . A New-Orleans Democratic organ declares : " We are satisfied that the next Presidentim election , three years hence , will present to toe people of the United States the choice between a tree Government and a*elespoinam in the form of a perpetual Dictator , or Emperor . President GRANT will be a candidate for a third election to the Presidency . Before that time arrives he will , like all his despotic predecessors , try to win the popular support , by foreign complications and acquisitions . " This sounds very terrible . But it is not the first time we have heard such stuff . Gen. GRANT was going to make himself dictator on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the programme . We all know how crazy be is to get into a quarrel with some foreign country ? though be does not seem to have been able to floc on any one in particular yet . As for " acquisitions , " we tremble when we think of what be may do in that direction . But let him remeto ber that the eye of the New-Orleans editor is os him . If that wo n't check him , nothing will .
