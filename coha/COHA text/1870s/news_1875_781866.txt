txt It is now said , by persons who profess to be well informed , that TWEED has not made his flight to a foreign country , but is still within easy reach of New-York , and that he proposes to offer a compromise of the claims against him , and to divulge the secret history of the Tammany Ring . He will give up the names of all who shared in the plunder , and expose the meu who worked with . him and for him iu the days of his power , mild who turned upon him so relentlessly after his downfall . This would be a very curious narrative , and there are many who now live iu " brown-stone houses , " and who hold their heads up very high , who would go in fear and trembling , and spend a very anxious Christmas , if they believed that TWEED really meant to carry out the purpose ascribed to him . When we remember the men who were TwEert 's advocates and supporters iu his palmy days , and look round on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . are rather amused to find . that they : m3 one and the same . " Why does not TUE TIMES say more about that old rascal , TWEED I " we were asked the other day . " It does Dot pitch into ' him half enough of late . " *The force of this remonstrance was rather weakeued by our happening to recollect that the inquirer was one of TwEED 's numerous supporters in the heyday of his power . The amount of virtuous indignation which these gentry exhibit when the name of Twnift , is mentioned is astonishing . We had no idea that there was so much good in the world . It would have saved us a great deal of trouble if we could have brought sonic of it out in 1870 , when we - were left single-handed to fight against the Tauunany Ring , when SAMUEL J. TILDEN was conniving at all its schemes , and when we wore being literally pelted - with law-suits in the courts , and " startling personal charges " in the upwspapers . We know something of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is TWEED alone who can give the necessary proof of their complicity in the Riug frauds . Most men would have made a " clean breast " of it long ago , but ' TWEED has hold his tongue . The consideration which he has shown for his accomplices or friends , they have taken care not . to return . There was a story in the San yesterday about a " journalist " whom TWEED'i8 said to have described as a man who had once levied black-mail upon him , and who now pursues him with great show of wrath . Is this a solitary case I We rather suspect not . How many lawyers are there about whom TWEED could reveal fatal secrets . How many large tax-payers gave him the benefit of their countenance and . support iu return for havinfr their assessments reduced ! Hundreds of persons in this City had a great load of fear taken from their minds when they beard that TwEEr , had escaped . Their one wish now is that he may never be heard of again . Yet we must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the very least that we shall get front him the promised " secret history . " flow many successful politicians , and how ninny who hope deleted 7 lines Mr. TILDEN is now Governor of this State , but in 1870 and 1871 he was Chairman of the Democratic State Committee , and knew perfectly well what enormous amounts of money were being used in this State to control the elections . Where did ho suppose that mouey came from ? Did he fancy that , like Topsy , it " crowed " ? Mr. TILDEN has shown a great deal of shrewdness since , in ferreting out the disposal of some of the Ring plunder . Yet we are to suppose that he had not the slightest idea how TWEED 'S election funds were raised . Perhaps he thought that the bankrupt chair-maker had come into possession of a /Rae private fortune . Mr. TILDEN also knew that not only were vast sums of money spent at election time , but that the ballot-boxes were opened and falsified after the votes were all iu . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. GREELEY openly charged him with that knowledge  --  and , indeed , how could he possibly have been kept iu ignorance on the subject ? There is no man in the State who knows so well how many ' votes a district can fairly bring out  --  and when ho saw that number multiplied ten or twenty fold , is it likely that he was iu any doubt as to the means by which the result had been accomplished ? How much did TWEED spend every year out of the stolen money , ou elections , for the benefit of his party , while Mr. TILDEN was Chairman of the Democratic State Committee ? Let TWEED tell the truth  --  the public will not be slow to draw its own conclusions from it . But there will be a great pressure brought to bear upon him to induce him to hold his peace . If Gov . TILDEN l'IeW that a full and true story of the Tammany Ring , by TWEED , was to appear in THE TIMES next Saturday , we do not believe ho would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some day , how much reason there is for this conjecture .
