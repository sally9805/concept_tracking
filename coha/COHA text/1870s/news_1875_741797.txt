txt There is nothing alarming at first sight in the 27 Democratic majority which Ontario County gave this Fall . Other Republican counties have given larger ones by ten times . which are yet as strongly and healthily Republican as ever they were . But the serious feature of this smell majority appears when we look into causes . While in the counties referred ito the adverse majorities were the effect of a spasmodic effort on the part of the Democracy , not capable of being repeated with the same success , in Ontario a steadily progressive increase in the Democratic vote is discoverable , while the Republican vote exhibits a decrease , or at best remains stationary . Local disputes or ether merely temporary troubles are insufficient to account for a change in the numerical relations of the two parties which proceeds as regularly as the succession of years . Some more enduring and permanent cause must be looked for . The unaided figures from the census will scarcely explain it Between 1850 and 1860 the increase in the population was only 633 ; between 1860 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ratio of increase so low as this it seems hardly probable could materially affect the vote of the couniy ; and yet tins or something of equally permanent nature would appear to be doing it . Taking the vote of the county since 1868 , grouped into off-year and . Gubernatorial elections , we have the following exhibit , the odd numbers being omitted for the sake of clearness : The vc , V. ! in Gubernatorial elections was as follows : Now , it will be noticed that the Republican vote is. as usual , much larger in the two Presidential years , ' 6S and ' 72. than in others ; but that the vote of ' 72 shows a decrease as compared with that of ' 63 , and another decrease is shown in the vote of ' 74 , as compared with ' 70 . The loss is progressive on the vote brought out each year . On the other hand , it we take out the exceptionally low vote of 72 ? produced by Mr. Greeley 's nomination and Mr. Kernan 's religion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from 4,200 in 1868 to 4.600 in 1375 . If this condition of increase and decrease continues next year , the vote of Ontario County in , the Presidential election 01 ' 1876 will be nearly this : Republican , 5.500 ; Democratic , 4,700 . Some Republicans here think that it will be Impossible to give even a majority of 800 , and place it as low as 600 ; nut there is no necessity for assuming , that things will be worse than the evidence warrants . Beyond all doubt , there is still in Ontario County a Republican reserve force of nearly 1,030 which is good for a Presidential election , for then the Prohibition vote , which is nearly 400 , is thrown in with the party to which it of right belongs ; or , at the worst , a good half of it may be relied upon to go there ; but for all elections in which a Prohibition ticket is put in the field , it seems quite clear that the Republicans of this counts- will have to do their level best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been repeatedly beaten of late years in county elections , and this Fall lost the Assemblyman , besides contributing to the loss of the Senator and allowing the Democratic State ticket to get a majority . The total Republican vote was 4,574. while the Democratic was 4,600 , and the Temperance vote 398 . The leading Republicans here acknowledge that with the exertions that were made to bring it out , there should have been a vote of at least 4,800 . The Democrats brought out the largest rote they ever polled in the county , vet , with this exceptional showing , they might have been neaten by 200 and still left several hundred Republicans in reserve , exclusive of the straight Prohibitionists . That this was not done seems to indicate a screw loose somewhere in the party machinery . VIE CAUSES OF DEMOCRATIC INCREASE . Merely pausing to remark that to the impartial observer it must appear a matter of surprise that the Republican vote was not smaller rather than larger , we may pass to the causes of increase in the Democratic vote . Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns to be the centres ) t a new and foreign population ; nor has it Eafered much disturbance by the building of railroads through it . Its wealth is in its beautiful hills and valleys , its rich soil , its fertile fields , its abundant streams . No landscape could be more suggestive of idealistic peace and plenty than that which he s stretched out at ego 's feet when looking down from the lofty tower of the Court-house here . There is a euggestion of quiet , of beauty , of abundance , of an industrious and steady population in its wide stretch of gently undulating hills , its fertile slopes , the long expanse of lake , with its timbered shores , and the gentle flow of the streams which fall into it . These bills and vales wei e settled early in the present century , when the shores of Lake Ontario were on the borders of the then wild West ; and the people who then took up the new lands transmitted them to their children . But the children of the third generation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for some years past been , gradually leaving the old homesteads , and the place is being supplied by a foreign population , nine-tenths of it being Irish . Some towns have lost more in population than they have gained , while in others the process of replacement fins been rapid , and an augmentation of the population has been the result . As a general rule the newcomers have taken the laud in small parcels , as their limited means necessitated , and have preferred it near the villa2es where they could find a ready sale for the produce of their little patches and an oc : ? asitinal day 's work to help out the near . The families of this class are larger than those of the old settlers , and every year more young men come of ago who cast their first ballots for the Democratic Party than is the case with the other class of the community . From the figures given above it appears that there is , from this and other lesser causes , an absolute annual increase in the Democratic vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent annual decrease of the Republican vote is between twenty-five and thirty . It is more probable that the rate of change will continue to increase rather than diminish , but even at the present rate it seems only a question of a few years when this eounty will become as permanently Democratic as the neighboring county of Seneca . To show how great has been the change in the voting population of some of the towns I will give a few figures taken from official records : The vote of both-parties in 1863 was a full one , and the Democratic vote this year was their fullest , but the Republican was not ; so that the change appears in these instances to be greater than it really is . It will be observed that the townships of Seneca and Phelps seem to have declined in population since 1868 , but that the Republican vote loses more than the Democratic . Of a small town not on the abovelist , but which exhibits the same characteristics in regard to its inhabitants , I was told by a resident that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that if the girls married there they must take their husbands from the rising class of Irish-Americaus . I think the same fact would hold good for many other towns , in and out of this State . THE COUNTY STILL REPUBLICAN . Still , Ontario County is Republican , aria must be for not a few years yet , even at the worst . It Was Whig before it was Republican . and the republicanism of its people is of that deep-seated and quietly-earnest character . which in the individual almost assumes the place of a religious belief . It is their creed ; they received it from their fathers , and it has become part of their being . We concede the claim of the Republican Party as a party of moral ideas , seeing a community which lives in the spirit of it as this does . Here is where usury , over the statute rate , is rewarded as sinful and wicked ; and the use of intoxicating liquors as abominable in the sight of God and man . A great shock was given when Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Lincoln , of Ontario , who , in au able speech , led the forlorn hope in the motion to pass the bill over that veto . The representatives of this and neighboring counties in the Genesee Valley have been the stoutest opponents of the movement to release bonds and mortgages from taxation , or to repeal the Usury laws ; and . every bill to prohibit or control the liquor traffic has received their strenuous support . They are now advocating the taxation of the surplus funds of insurance companies , and the active opposition of several of these corporations to Hammond was made by his friends one of the strongest helps to secure his election to the Senate . Yet , with all their individual depth of conviction , and their still great numerical strength over their opponents , the Republicans of this county will be represented by a Democratic Senator , by ' two Democratic Assemblymen , and have their local affairs conducted by a full corps of Democratic county officials . The men who assume to lead the party here will tell you that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , but not wholly . When a political party is so greatly in the majority that the opposing force has no possibility or hope of success in a contest . with it . there will be very little of the talent of leadership developed , for only constant fighting can do this . Valuable offices , for those who can win them , will sometimes take the place of nn active opposition party in making leaders , but there are no such prizes in Ontario County . If the Republicans have had no good leaders here of late years , it is because they were too strong to need them . But strong or weak there is a party machinery which somebody must take the trouble to operate , and as this labor is almost mechanical when there is no opposing force , it almost inevitably , under such circumstances , falls into the hands of merely mechanical men , destitute of the genius of leadership , because none was required . Such is the ease with Ontario County . It was of little moment that the men who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of affairs , when the Democracy was in a hopeless minority , and the Temperance Party , had not yet started into active life ; but it is a serious thing now ; with a young , vigorous , and not too scrupulous Democracy growing up . a gradual decrease in the Republican class of the community and a Temperance vote which takes off nearly five hundred Republican votes at every election and probably causes a loss of many more . As it is now , the Republican Party of Ontario is in a state of atrophy . It has neither life nor vigor nor energy ; no part in the present and no hope of the future . Its " leaders " will tell you that nearly all the young men coining of age affiliate with the Democracy , but they do not speak of any effort made to bring them into the Republican Party ; of the fostering of " Young Men 's Associatiorse " oh the enlistment of youthful energy and enthusiasm in the cause of the only party which represents the principles on which this continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and the consequence is that all the spirit and vigor which exist in the party find their outlet and channel in the temperance movement , which is therefore much more powerful and effective in its action than the mere record of 400 votes would indicate . Nor does it appear that these " leaders ' ' are any better in employing the material at hand , than in shaping the raw product . The recent campaign is a good example . It was shameful that Hammond was not beaten . Ile ought to have been . and he might have been , had these " leaders " shown half the energy to defeat that he did to secure his election . They say he made an extraordinary canvass , and spent a great deal of money . Was it expected that he would not 1 The fact that he bad to do this , shows how strong the current of public sentiment was against him . Here the Prohibitionists come in again , as ' ? holding the balance of power . " They did ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own petty circle for a nominee against Hammond ; and-ccause so many Republicans were too thoroughly disgusted with these inevitable candidates to turn out and vote . The Republican nominees for both Senate and Assembly ran behind their ticket in their own towns ! Excellent men to put up for a warm fight ! The . Demoorats put up strong men , made au immense effort , spent plenty of money , polled their last man when election day came , and swept the board  --  State ticket and all . I referred incidentally to the Democracy as being not over scrupulous . Here is an instance . There was a big Democratic meeting in this town the night before election , and Mr. H. H. Hubbell addressed it . This gentleman is an able and shrewd Democrat , and be concluded his address with an appeal intended to secure the " floating vote . " ' ' Now , boys , " be said , " I want you all to turn out at the polls to-morrow and vote ; applause , and I want you not only to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to work without paying ybit for it , give every man who reports to me at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning , $7,2 for the day . " Vociferous applause . and of course , at that hour , every floating vote turned up enthusiastically and got the money . Votes are pretty cheap at 82 a piece ; and it is said that as much as $1 and $5 had to be paid in other towns than Canandaigua ! It may be mentioned that the Democratic campaign in this county , as in others this Fall , was entirely one of " personal effort . " Mr. Hubbell told me he had conic to the conclusion that more effective work could be done in that way than in any other . Our ( minions were unanimous . DEFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LEADERsilIP . If my strictures on the leadership of the Republican Party here seem severe , I can only refer to the facts of the case for justification . No talk can explain away the hard reality of official figures . The men who have the running of the party machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republican vote on Ilovertior in the last Presidential year ( 1872 ) was over five thousand six hundred . Allowing for the decrease  --  which , as I have said , seems annually progressing ? we will place the full vote of the county at this date at 5,500 , which is doubtless lower than it really is . The Temperance vote is 400 , or less . Deducting this from the total vote , we have a remainder of 5,100  --  and this force composed of life-long , earnest-inhaled Republicans , who vote their own ticket or none . The full strength of the Democrats , by their own acknowledgment , is the vote they last polled . Not another one could be added to the list , they themselves say . This vote was 4,600 . Here , then , is a clear Republican majority in the county , exclusive of the straight Temperance men , of 1,000 . Now , with this immense majority at command , the Senator bee been lost , the two Assemblymen have been lost , all the county officers have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is this the showing of only a single year or the effect of sonic sudden political spasm . The county officers have been Democratic for several years , and the management Of local affairs has been almost exclusively in Democratic hands . It does not seem that these " leaders " can do much more harm than they have done . Nearly everything there was to lose has gone ; all that rowdies now is the Congressman , and they are in good training to lose that . Should Om Democrats do as well as they did thi section , it trill go . Just consider for a moment ; a county , of which an immense majority of the population are earnestly Republican in every thought and . feeling , is represented . in both branches of the State Legislature by representatives of the opposing minority in that population . It seems almost incredible that such a thing could happen where there remained even the pretence of free elections . But there is the fact , mid here , on the ground , it is not difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for it could . do no better service to their party than to get out of it .
