By MARK TWAIN . A COUPLE OF SAD EXPERIENCES . WHEN I published a squib recently , in which I said I was going to edit an Agricultural Department in this magazine , I certainly did not desire to deceive anybody . I had not the remotest desire to play upon any one 's confidence with a practical joke , for he is a pitiful creature indeed who will degrade the dignity of his humanity to the contriving of the witless inventions that go by that name . I purposely wrote the thing as absurdly and as extravagantly as it could be written , in order to be sure and not mislead hurried or heedless readers : for I spoke of launching a triumphal barge upon a desert , and planting a tree of prosperity in a mine  --  a tree whose fragrance should slake the thirst of the naked , and whose branches should spread abroad till they washed the shores of , etc. , etc . I thought that manifest lunacy like that would protect the reader . But to make assurance absolute , and show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt an Agricultural Department , I stated distinctly in my postcript that I did not know anything about Agriculture . But alas ! right there is where 1 made my worst mistake-for that remark seems to have recommended my proposed Agriculture more than anything else . It lets a little light in on me , and I fancy I perceive that the farmers feel a little bored , sometimes , by the oracular profundity of agricultural editors who " know it all . " In fact , one of my correspondents suggests this ( for that unhappy squib has deluged me with letters about potatoes , and cabbages , and hominy , and vermicelli , and maccaroni , and all the other fruits , cereals , and vegetables that ever grew on earth ; and if I get done answering questions about the best way of raising these things before I go raving crazy , I shall be thankful , and shall never write obscurely for fun any more ) . Shall I tell the real reason why I have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people ? It is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious , and the rest did not read it at all , but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand . Those cases I could not guard against , of course . To write a burlesque so *vild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody , is very nearly an imposible thing to do . It is because , in some instances , the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself , and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon Aim ; and in this case the only person dishonored is the man who wrote the burlesque . In other instances the " nub " or moral of the burlesque-if its object be to enforce a truth-escapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself . And very ' often this " moral " is tagged on at the bottom , and the reader , not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose at it and leaves it unread . One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty , if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire wIth the extraneous interest of the travesty , and so bury it from the reader 's sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim , when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom . I have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness to deceive the public , and this is why I tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a one-eyed potato could see it ; and yet , as I speak the solemn truth , it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in America ! THE PETRIFIED MAN . Now , to show how really hard it is to foist a moral or a truth upon an unsuspecting public through a burlesque without entirely and absurdly missing one 's mark , I will here set down two experiences of my own in this thing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people got to running wild about extraordinary petrifactions and other natural marvels . One could scarcely pick up a paper without finding in it one or two glorified discoveries of this kind . The mania was becoming a little ridiculous . I was a brand-ne*v local editor in Virginia City , and I felt called upon to destroy this // growing evil : we all have our benignant , fatherly moods at one time or another , I suppose . I chose to kill the petrifaction mania with a delicate , a very delicate , satire . But maybe it was altogether too delicate , for nobody ever perceived the satire part of it at all . I put my scheme in the shape of the discovery of a remarkable petrified man . I had had a temporary falling out with Mr. Sewall , the new coroner and justice of the peace of humboldt , and I thought I might as well touch him up a little at the same time and make him ridiculous , and thus combine pleasure with business . So I told , in patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at Gravelly Ford ( exactly a hundred and twenty miles , over a breakneck mountain trail , from where Sewall lived ) ; how all the savants in the immediate neighborhood had been to examine it ( it was notorious that there was not a living creature within fifty miles of there , except a few starving Indians , some crippled grasshoppers , and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble to get away ) ; how those savants all pronounced the petrified man to have been in a state of complete petrifaction for over ten generations ; and then , with a seriousness that I ought to have been ashamed to assume , I stated that as soon as Mr. Sewall heard the news , he summoned a jury , mounted his mule , and posted off , with noble reverence for official duty , on that awful five days ' journey , through alkali , sage-brush , peril of body and imminent starvation , to hold an inquest on this man that had been dead and turned to everlasting stone for more than three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so to spea*k , I went on , with the same unflinching gravity , to state that the jury returned a verdict that deceased came to his death from protracted exposure . This only moved me to higher flights of imagination , and I said that the jury , with that charity so characteristic of pioneers , then dug a grave , and were about to give the petrified man Christian burial , when they found that for ages a limestone sediment had been trickling down the face of the stone against which he was sitting , and this stuff had run under him and cemented him fast to the " bed-rock " ; that the jury ( they were all silver-miners ) canvassed the difficulty a moment , and then got out their powder and fuse , and proceeded to drill a hole under him , in order to blast him from his Josition , when Mr. Sewall , " with that delicacy so characteristic of him , for-859 bade them , observing that t would be little less than sacrilege to do such a thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a string of roaring absurdities , albeit they were told with an unfair pretence of truth that even imposed upon me to some extent , and I was in some danger of believing in my own fraud . But I really had no desire to deceive anybody , and no expectation of doing it . I depended on the way the petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle . Yet I purposely mixed that up with other things , hoping to make it obscure  --  and I did . I would describe the position of one foot , and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose ; then talk about his other foot , and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart ; then talk about the back of his head a little , and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger ; then ramble off about something else , and by and by drift back again and remark that the fingers of the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too ingenious . I mixed it up rather too much ; and so all : that description of the attitude , as a key to the humbuggery of the article , was entirely lost , for nobody but me ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the petrified man 's hands . As a satire on the petrifaction mania , or anything else , my Petrified Man was a disheartening failure ; for everybody received : him in innocent good faith , and I was stunned to see the creature I had begotten to pull down the wonder-business with and bring derision upon it , calmly exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the genuine marvels our Nevada had produced . I was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of my scheme that at first I was angry and did not like to think about it ; but by and by , when the . exchanges began to come in with the Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glori-. fled , I began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction ; and as my gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sawthat he steadily and implacably penetrated . territory after territory , State after State , and land after land , till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy in the august " London Lancet , *v my cup was full , and I said * was glad I had done it . I think that for *bout eleverb months , as nearly as I can remember , Mr. Sewall 's daily mail contained along in the // neighborhood of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many climes with the Petrified Man in them , marked around with a prominent belt of ink . I sent them to him . I did it for spite , not for fun . He used to shovel them into his back yard and curse . And every day during all those months the miners , his constituents ( for miners never quit joking a person when they get started ) , would call on him and ask if he could tell them where they could get hold of a paper with the Petrified Man in it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sewall in those days , and these things pacified me and pleased me . I could not have gotten more real comfort out of him without killing him . Mv FAMOUS " flLOODY MASSACRE . " The other burlesque I have referred to - was my fine satire upon the financial expedient of " cooking dividends , " a thing which became shamefully frequent on the Pacific coast for a while . Once more , in my selfcomplacent simplicity , I felt that the time had arrived for me to rise up and be a reformer . I put this reformatory satire in the shape of a fearful " Massacre at Empire City . " The San Francisco papers were making a great outcry about the iniquity of the Daney Silver-Mining Company , whose directors had declared a " cooked " or false dividend , for the purpose of increasing the value of their stock , so that they could sell out at a comfortable figure and then scramble from under the tumbling concern . And while abusing the Daney , those papers did not forget to urge the public to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and safe San Francisco stocks , such as the Spring Valley Water Company , etc . But right at this unfortunate juncture , behold the Spring Valley cooked a dividend too ! And so , under the insidious mask of an invented " bloody massacre , " I stole upon the public unawares with my scathing satire upon the dividend-cooking system . In about half a column of imaginary inhuman carnage I told how a citizen had murdered his wife and nine children and then committed suicide . And I said slily , at the bottom , that the sudden madness of which this melancholy massacre was the result , had been brought about by his having allowed himself to be pe*suaded by the California papers to sell 4 sound and lucrative Nevada silver stocks and buy into Spring Valley just in time to get cooked along with that company 's fancy dividend , and link every cent he had in the world . Ah , it was a deep , deep satire , and most ingeniously contrived . But I made the horrible details so carefully and conscientiously interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked the following distinctly stated facts , to wit : The murderer was perfectly well known to every creature in the land as a bachelor , and consequently he could not murder his wife and nine children ; he murdered them " in his splendid dressed-stone mansion just in the edge of the great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick 's , " when even the very pickled oysters that came on our tables knew that there was not a " dressed-stone mansions ' in all Nevada Territory ; also , that so far from there being a " great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick 's , " there was n't a solitary tree within fifteen miles of either place ; and , finally , it was patent and notorious that Empire City and Dutch Nick 's were one and the same place , and contained only six houses anyhow , and consequently there could be no forest between them ; and on top of all these absurdities I stated that this diabolical murderer , after inflicting a wound upon himself that the reader ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eye , jumped on his horse and rode four miles , waving his wife 's reeking scalp in the air , and thus performing entered Carson City with tremendous *clat , and dropped dead in front of the chief saloon , the envy and admiration of all beholders . Well , in *il my life I never saw anything like the sensation that little satire created . It was the talk of the town , it was the talk of the Territory . Most of the citizens dropped gently into it at breakfast , and they never finished their meal . There was something about those minutely-faithful details that was a sufficing substitute for food . Few people that were able to read took food that morning . Dan and I ( Dan was my reportorial associate ) took our seats on either side of our customary table in the " Eagle Restaurant , " and as I unfolded the shred they used to call a napkin in that establishment , I saw at the next table two stalwart innocents with that sort of vegetable dandruff sprinkled about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the Truckee with a load of hay . The one facing me had the morning paper folded to a long narrow strip , and I knew , without // any telling , that that strip represented the column that contained my pleasant financial satire . From the way he was excitedly mumbling , I saw that the heedless son of a hay-mow was skipping with all his might , in order to get to the bloody details as quickly as possible ; and so he was missing the guide-boards I had set up to warn him that the whole thing was a fraud . Presently his eyes spread wide open , just as his jaws swung asunder to take in a potato approaching it on a fork ; the potato halted , the face lit up redly , and the whole man was on fire with excitement . Then he broke into a disjointed checking-off of the particulars-his potato cooling in mid-air meantime , and his mouth making a reach for it occasionally , but always bringing up suddenly against a new and still more direful performance of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrade impressively in the face , and said , with an expression of concentrated awe : " Jim , he b'iled his baby , and he took the old oman 's skelp . Cuss 'd if I want any breakfast ! " And he laid his lingering potato reverently down , and he and his friend departed from the restaurant empty but satisfied . He never got down to where the satire part of it began . Nobody ever did . They found the thrilling particulars sufficient . To drop in with a poor little moral at the fag-end of such a gorgeous massacre , was to follow the expiring sun with a candle and hope to attract the world 's attention to it . The idea that anybody could ever take my massacre for a genuine occurrence never once suggested itself to me , hedged about as it was by all those tell-tale absurdities and impossibilities concerning the " great pine forest , " the " dressed-stone mansion , * , etc . But I found out then , and never have forgotten since , that we never read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no occasion to suppose that some irresponsible scribbler is trying to defraud us ; we skip all that , and hasten to revel in the blood-curdling particulars and be happy . Therefore , being bitterly experienced , I tried hard to word that agricultural sq*b of mine in such a way as to deceive nobody  --  and I partly succeeded , but not entire ly . However , I did not do any harm with it , any way . In order that parties who have lately written me about vegetables and things may know that there war a MEMORANDA . 86i time when I would have answered their questions to the very best of my ability , and considered it my imperative duty to do it . I refer them to the narrative of my one week 's experience as an agricultural editor , which will be found in this MEMORANDA next month . THE JUDGE 'S " SPIRITED WOMAN . " A CORRESPONDENT quotes an incident the Pierre Bonaparte trial as " an unusual instance of spirit in a woman "  --  a young and gentle woman , unaccustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the very reverse of spirited in a place like that High Court at Tours . She described the scene between herself and Victor Noir and his betrothed , when Victor was putting on and buttoning his neat new Jouvins . Then , says the cor-respondent : She described how in two hours they brought him back dead . In the evening she asked those about her how the trouble came about , and they told her that the Prince said Victor had given him a blow ! " I went to his body , " she said , " I looked at his gloves , and when I saw them unbroken , unstained , and clean and tightly fitting , buttoned as I had seen them in the morning , I knew the Prince had lied I " As she said this , she pointed her finger at the Prince and looked him in the face , but he made no sign . In a moment this little feminine outburst reminded me of the instance which an old Nevada Judge of the early times gave me as being what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wom. anly git-up-and-git " that had ever fallen under his notice . " I was sitting here , " said the Judge , " in this old pulpit , holding court , and we were trying a big wicked-looking Spanish desperado for killing the husband of a bright , pretty Mexican woman . It was a lazy summer day , and an awfully long one , and the witnesses were tedious . None of us took any interest in the trial except that nervous uneasy devil of a Mexican woman-because you know how they love and how they hate , and this one had loved her husband with all her might , and now she had boiled it all down into hate , and stood here spitting it at that Spaniard with her eyes ; and I tell you she would stir me up , too , with a little of her summer lightning occasionally . Well , I had my coat off and my heels up , lolling and sweating , and smoking one of those cabbage cigars the San Francisco people used to think were good enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their // coats off and were smoking and whittling , and the witnesses the same , and so was the prisoner . *Vell , the fact is , there war n't any interest in a murder trial then , because the fellow was always brought in not guilty , the jury expecting him to do as much for them some time ; and although the evidence was straight and square against this Spaniard , we knew we could not convict him without seeming to be rather high-handed id sort of reflecting on every gentleman in the community ; for there war n't any carriages and liveries then , and so the only style ' there was , was to keep your private graveyard . But that woman seemed to have her heart set on hanging that Spaniard ; and you 'd ought to have seen how she would glare on him a minute , and then look up at me in her pleading way , and then turn and for the next five minutes search the jury 's faces  --  and by and by drop her face in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to give up , but out she 'd come again directly and be as live and anxious as ever . But when the jury announced the verdict , Not Guilty , and I told the prisoner he was acquitted and free to go , that woman rose up till she appeared to be as tall and grand as a seventy-four-gun ship , and says she : " Judge , do I understand you to say that this man is net guilty , that murdered my husband without any cause before my own eyes and my little children 's , and that all has been done to him that ever justice and the law can do ? ' " The same , ' says I. " And then what do you reckon she did ? Why she turned on that smirking Spanish fool like a wildcat , and out with a navy ' and shot him dead in open court ! " " That was spirited , I am willing to admit . " " Was n't it , though ? " said the Judge , admiringly . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the spot and we put on our coats and went out and took up a collection for her and her cubs , and sent them over the mountains to their friends . Ah , she was a spirited wench ! " " Yxs , I remember that anecdote , " the Sunday school superintendent said , with the old pathos in his voice and the old sad look in his eyes . " It was about a simple creature named Higgins , that used to haul rock for old Maltby . When the lamented Judge Bgaley tripped and fell down the court-house stairs and broke his neck , it was a great question how to break the news to poor Mrs. Bagley . But finally the body was put into Higgins 's wagon and he was instructed to take it to Mrs. B. , but to be very guarded and discreet in his language , and not break the news to her at once , but do it gradually and gently . When Higgins got there with his sad freight , he shouted till Mrs. Bagley came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagley live here ? " " The widow Bagley ? No , Sir ! " " I 'll bet she does . But have it your own way . Well , does fudge Bagley live here ? " " Yes , Judge Bagley lives here . " " I 'll bet he do n't . But never mind-it ai n't for me to contradict . Is the Judge in ? " " No , not at present . " " I jest expected as much . Because , you know - take hold o ' suthin , mum , for I 'm a-going to make a little communication , and I reckon maybe it 'll jar you some . There 's been an accident , mum . I 've got the old Judge curled up out here in the wagon  --  and when you see him you 'll acknowledge , yourself , that an inquest is about the only thing that could be a comfort to him I " " HOGWASH . " Foa five years I have preserved the following miracle of pointless imbecility and bathos , waiting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in vain . I have read it forty or fifty times , altogether , and with a steadily-increasing pleasurable disgust . I now offer it for competition as the sickliest specimen of sham sentimentality that exists . I almost always get it out and read it when I am low-spirited , and it has cheered many and many a sad hour for me . I will remark , in the way of general information , that in California , that land of felicitous nomenclature , the literary name of this sort of stuff is " hogwash " : From the * California Farmer . " A TOUCHING INCIDENT . Ms. Eorroit : I hand you the following for insertion , if you think it worthy of publication ; it is a pi*ure , though brief , of a living reality which the writer witnessed , within a little time since , in a luxurious city : A beautiful lady sat beneath a verandah overshadowed by clustering vines ; in her lap was a young infant , apparently asleep ; the mother sat , as she supposed , unobserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the outward I // appearances of wealth and station , wife and mother and mistress of a splendid mansion and garden around it , it would have seemed as if the heart that could claim to be queen here should be a hapoy one . Alas l appearances are not always the true guide , forThat mother sat there like a statue awhile , When over her face beamed a sad , sad smile ; Then she started and shudcler 'd as if terrible fears Were crushing her spirit-then came the hot tears . And the wife and mother , with all that was seemingly joyous around her , gave herself up to the full sweep of agonizing sorrow . I gazed upon this l ) iclure for a little while , only , for my own tears fell freely and without any control ; the lady was so truthful and innocent , to all outward appearances , that my own deepest sympathies went out instantly to her and her sorrows . This is no fancy sketch , but a sad , sad reality . It occurred in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow , I asked myself , how can these things be ? But I remember that this small incident may only be a foreshadowing of some great sorrow deeply hidden in that mother 's aching heart . The Bard of Avon says : " When sorrows come , they come not single spies , But in battalions . " I had tumed away for a moment to look at some object that attracted my attention , when looking again , this child of sorrow was drying her eyes carefully and preparing to leave and go within " And there will canker sorrow eat her bud , And chase the native beauty from her cheek . " A LITERARY " OLD OFFENDER " TN COURT WITH SUSPICIOUS PROPERTY IN HIS POSSESSION . IN last month 's MEMORANDA I published a sketch entitled " The Story of the Good Little Boy Who Did Not Prosper , " and closed it with a dreadful nitro-glycerine explosion which destroyed the boy . He had unwittingly been sitting on a can of this compound and got his pantaloons greased with it ; and when he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catastrophe instantly followed . There was something so stupendously grotesque about the " situation , " that I was filled with admiration of it , and therefore borrowed it . I say " borrowed " it , for it was not my invention . I found it drifting about the sea of journalism , in the shape of a simple statement of the catastrophe in a single sentence , and attributed to a California paper . I thought , at the time , that in saying it was Californian unnecessary pains had been taken , for such a happy inspiration of extravagance as that could not well have originated elsewhere . I used it , and stated in a foot-note that I " borrowed it , without the unknown but most ingenious owner*s permission . " I naturally expected that so neat a compliment a that would resurrect the " ingenious unknown , " and bring him to the light of day . Truly , it did produce a spectre , but not the one I was looking for . The party thus raised hails from Philadelphia , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he encloses to me a half-column newspaper article , dated December 22 , signed with his name , and being what he says is the original draft of the nitro-glycerine catastrophe . The impulse to make pleasant mention of this person 's name and give him the credit he claims , is crippled by the fact that I , or any one else acquainted with his literary his . tory , would feel obliged to decline to accept any evidence coming from him , upon any matter , and especially upon a question of authorship . His simple word is worthless ; and to embellish it with his oath would merely make it picturesque , not valuable . This person several of us know of our own personal knowledge to be a poor little purloiner of other men 's ideas and handicraft . It would not be just to call him a literary pirate , for there is a sort of manliness ab6ut flaunting the black flag in the face of a world , and taking desperate chances against death and dishonor , that gives a sombre dignity to the pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of the smaller kind of literary rogues . But there is a sort of adventurers whom the police detect by a ces'tain humble look in their faces , and who , when searched , yield abundance of spools , handkerchiefs , napkins , spoons , and such things , acquired by them when the trusting owners left the property openly in their company not thinking any harm . The police call this kind of adventurer a - However , upon second thought , I will not print the name , for it has almost too harsh a sound for polite ears ; but the Philadelphia person I have spoken of will probably recognize a long-lost brother in the description . Anybody capturing the subject of these remarks and overhauling the catalogue of what he calls his " writings , " will find in it two very good articles of mine , and if the rest were advertised as " strayed or stolen , " they would doubtless be called for by journalists residing in all the different States of the Union . The effrontery of this person in appearing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have originated an idea , surpasses anything that has come under my notice lately . I can not conceive of his being so reckless as // to deliberately try to originate an idea-considering how he is built . He knows himself that it would rip , and tear , and rend him worse than the glycerine did the boy . This sad person purloins all his literary materials , I fancy . And he spreads his damaged remnants before his customers with as happy an admiration as if they were bright and fresh from the intellectual loom . With due modesty I venture the prophecy that some day he will even ravish a dying speech from some , poor fellow , and say with a flourish as he goes out of the world : " Fello*v-citizens , I die innocent . " I do not print this party 's name , because , knowing as I do upon what an exceedingly slender capital of merit , fame , or public invitation , two or three of the most widely popular lecturers of the day , of both sexes , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pave the way for him to transfer the report of somebody 's speech from the papers to his portfolio , and step into the lecture arena upon a sudden and comfortable income of ten or fifteen thousand dollars a season . I can not take this person 's evidence . Will the party from whom he pilfered the nitro-glycerine idea please send me a copy of the paper in which it first appeared , and with the date of the paper intact ? I shall now soon find out who really invented the exploded boy . POST-MORTEM POETRY . IN Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see adopted throughout the land . It is that of appending to published death-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry . Any one who is in the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia " Ledger , * ' must frequently be touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth . In Philadelphia , the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not more surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses half its terror because the knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery of verse . For instance , in a late " Ledger " I find the following ( I change the surname ) : DIED . HAWKS-On the a7th inst. , CLARA , the daughter of Ephraim and Laura Hawks , aged 25 months and 2 days . That merry shout no more I h*ar , No laughing child I see , No little arms are round my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek , These lips are sealed to me . Dear Lord , how could I give Clara up To any but to Thee ? A child thus mourned could not die wholly discontented . From the " Ledger " of the same date I make the following extract , merely changing the surname , as be-fore : BEcKET-On Sunday moming , s9th inst. , JOHN P. , infant son of George and Julia Becket , aged year , 6 months , and s* days . That merry shout no more I hear , No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek , These lips are sealed to me . Dear Lord , how could I give Johunie up To any but to Thee ? The similarity of the emotions produced in the mourners in these two instances is remarkably evidenced by the singular similarity of thought which they experienced , and the surprising coincidence of language used by them to give it expression . In the same journal , of the same date , I find the following ( surname suppressed , as before ) WAGNER-On the zoth inst. , FERGUsoN G. , the son of William L. and Martha Theresa Wagner , aged 4 weeks and z day . That merry shout no more I hear , No laughing child I see , No little arms are round my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek , These lips are sealed to me . Dear Lord , how could I give Ferguson up To any hut to Thee ? It is strange what power the reiteration of an essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up the " Ledger " and read the poetry about little Clara , we feel an unaccountable depression of the spirits . When we drift further down the column and read the poetry about little J ohnnie , the depression of spirits acquires an added emphasis , and we experience tangible suffering . When we saunter along down the column further still and read the poetry about little Ferguson , the word torture but vaguely suggests the anguish that rends us . In the " Ledger " ( same copy referred to // above ) , I find the following ( I alter surname as usual ) : WELCH-On the 5th inst. , MARY C. WELCH , wife of William B. Welch , and daughter of Catharine and George W. Markland , in the 29th year of her age . A mother dear , a mother kind , Has gone , and left us all behind . Cease to weep , for tears are vain . Mother dear is out of pain . Farewell , husband , children dear , Servethy God with filial fear , And meet me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and love . What could be sweeter than that ? No collection of salient facts ( without reduction to tabular form ) could be more succinctly stated than is done in the first stanza by the surviving relatives , and no more concise and comprehensive programme of farewells , post-mortuary general orders , etc. , could be framed in any form than is done in verse by deceased in the last stanza . These things insensibly make us wiser , and tenderer , and better . Another extract : BALL-On the morning of the seth inst. , MARY E. , daughtex of John and Sarah F. Ball . T is sweet to rest in lively hope That when my change shall come Angels will hover round my bed , To waft my spirit home . The following is apparently the customary form for heads of families : BuRRs-On the 20th instant , MiCHAEL BURNS , aged 40 years . Dearest luther , thou hast left us , Here thy loss we deeply feel ; But t is God that has bereft us , He can all our sorrows heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasant about the following , which , in Philadelphia . seems to be the usual form for consumptives of long standing . ( It deplores four distinct cases in the single copy of the " Ledger " which lies on the MEMORANDA editorial table ) : BROMLEY-On the 29th inst. , of consumption , PHILIP BEOMLEY , in the *oth year of his age . Affliction sore long time he bore , Physicians were in vainTill God at last did hear him mourn , And eased him of his pain . The friend whom death from us has torn , We did not think so soon to part ; An anxious care now sinks the thorn Still deeper in our bleeding heart . This beautiful creation loses nothing by repetition . On the contrary , the oftener one sees it in the " Ledger , " the more grand and awe-inspiring it seems . With one more extract I will close : DOBLE. - OIS the 4th inst. , SAMUEL PEYERIL WORTHINGTON DOBLE , aged 4 days . Our little Sammy 's gone , His tiny spirit 's fled ; Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . A tear within a father 's eye , A mother 's aching heart , Can only tell the agony How hard it is to pert . Could anything be more plaintive than that , without requiring further concessions of grammar ? Could anything be likely to do more toward reconciling deceased to circumstances , and making him willing to go ? Perhaps not . The power of song can hardly be estimated . There is an element about some poetry which is able to make even physical suffering and death cheerful things to contemplate and consummations to be desired . This element is present in the mortuary poetry of Philadelphia , and in a noticeable degree of development . The custons I have been treating of is one that should be adopted in all the cities of the land . WIT-INSPIRATIONS OF THE " TWOYEAR-OLDS . " ALL infants appear to have an impertinent and disagreeable fashion nowadays of saying " smart " things on most occasions that offer , and especially on occasions when they ought not to be saying anything at all . Judging by the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are little better than idiots . And the parents must surely be but little better than the children , for in most cases they are the publishers of the sunbursts of infantile imbecility which dazzle us from the pages of our periodicals . I may seem to speak with some heat , not to say a seispicion of personal spite ; and I do admit that it nettles me to hear about so many gifted infants in these days , and remember that I seldom said anything smart when I was a child . I tried it once or twice , but it was not popular . The family were not expecting brilliant remarks from me , and so they snubbed me sometimes and spanked me the rest . But it makes my flesh creep - and my blood run cold to think what might have happened to me if I had dared to utter // JUNE , some of the smart things of this generation 's " four-year-olds " where my father could hear me . To have simply skinned me alive and considered his duty at an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinning . He was a stern , unsmiling man , and hated all forms of precocity . If I had said some of the things I have referred to , and said them in his hearing , he would have destroyed me . He would , indeed . He would , provided the opportunity remained with him . But it would not , for I would have had judgment enough to tare some strychnine first and say my smart thing afterward . The fair record of my life has been tarnished by just one pun . My father overheard that , and he hunted me over four or five townships seeking to take my life . If I had been fullgrown , of course he would have been right ; but , child as I was , I could not know how wicked a thing I had done . I mad ' * one of those remarks ordinarily called " smart things " before that , but it was not a pun . Still , it came near causing a serious rupture between my father and myself . My father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two others were present , and the conversation turned on a name for me . I. was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns , and endeavoring to make a selection , for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people 's fingers , and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get at something else . Did you ever notice what a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse 's finger , or how back-breaking and tiresome it was try . ing to cut them on your big toe ? And did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jericho long before you got them half cut ? To me it seems as if these things happened yesterday . And they did , to some children . But I digress . I was lying there trying the India-rubber rings . I remember looking at the clock and noticing that in an hour and twenty-five minutes I would be two weeks old , and thinking to myself how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unsparingly lavished upon me . My father said : " Abraham is a good name . My grandfather was named Abraham . " My mother said : " Abraham is a good name . Very well . Let us have Abraham for one of his names . " I said : " Abraham suits the subscriber . " My father frowned , my mother looked pleased ; my aunt said : " What a little darling it is ! My father said : " Isaac is a good name , and Jacob is a good name . " My mother assented and said : " No names are better . Let us add Isaac and Jacob to his names . " I said : * All right . Isaac and Jacob are good enough for yours truly . Pass me that rattle , if you please . I ca n't chew India-rubber rings all day . " Not a soul made a memorandum of these sayings of mine , for publication . I saw that , and did it myself , else they would have been utterly lost . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when developing intellectually , I was now furiously scowled upon by my father ; my mother looked grieved and anxious , and even my aunt had about her an expression of seeming to think that maybe I had gone too far . I took a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring , and cnvertly broke the rattle over the kitten 's head , but said nothing . Presently my father said : " Samuel is a very excellent name . " I saw that trouble was coming . Nothing could prevent it . I laid down my rattle ; over the side of the cradle I dropped my uncle 's silver watch , the clothes brush , the toy dog , my tin soldier , the nutmeg grater , and other matters which I was accustomed to examine , and meditate upon , and make pleasant noises with , and bang and batter and break when I needed wholesome entertainment . Then I put on my little frock and my little bonnet , and took my pigmy shoes in one hand and my licorice in the other , , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Now , if the worst comes to the worst , I am ready . Then I said aloud , in a firm voice : " Father , I can not , can not wear the name of Samuel . " " My son ! " " Father , I mean it . I can not . " " Why ? " " Father , I have an invincible antipathy to that name . " " My son , this is unreasonable . Many great and good men have been named Samuel . " " Sir , I have yet to hear of the first instance . " // " What ! There was Samuel the prophet . Was not he great and good ? " " Not so very . " " My son ! With his own voice the Lord called him . " " Yes , sir , and had to call him a couple of times before he would come ! " And then I sallied forth , and that stern old man sallied forth after me . He overtook me at noon the following day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Samuel , and a thrashing , and other useful information ; and by means of this compromise my father 's wrath was appeased and a misunderstanding bridged over which might have become a permanent rupture if I had chosen to be unreasonable . But just judging by this episode , what would my father have done to me if I had ever uttered in his hearing one of the flat , sickly things these " two-year-olds " say in print nowadays ? In my opinion there would have been a case of infanticide in our family . ONE of the saddest things that ever came under my notice ( said the banker 's clerk ) was there in Corning , during the war . Dan Murphy enlisted as a private , and fought very bravely . The boys all liked him , and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him , they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler . He made money then , and sent it always to his wife to bank for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it . She did n't waste a penny . On the contrary , she began to get miserly as her bank account grew . She grieved to part with a cent , poor creature , for twice in her hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry , cold , friendless , sick , and without a dollar in the world , and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again . Well , at last Dan died ; and the boys , in testimony of their esteem and respect for him , telegraphed to Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home , when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole , and then inform his friends what had become of him . Mrs. Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband , and so she te*egraphed " Yes . " It was at the " *vake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the widow . She uttered a wild , sad wail , that pierced every heart , and said : " Sivinty-foive dollars for stooffin ' Dan , blister their sowls ! Did thim divils suppose I was goin ' to stairt a Museim , that I 'd be dalin ' in such expinsive curiassities ! " The banker 's clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house . A cuitious incident , and one which is perfectly well authenticated , comes to us in a private letter from the West . A patriarch of eighty-four was nearing death , and his descendants came from all distances to honor him with the last homage of affection . He had been blind for several years-so completely blind that night and noonday were alike to him . But about half an hour before his death his sight came suddenly back to him . He was as blithe and happy over it as any child could have been , and appeared to be only anxious to make the most of every second of time that was left him wherein to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments in speculating upon the wonderful nature of the thing that had happened to him , but diligently and hungrily looked at this , that , and the other thing , and luxuriously feasted his famishing vision . Children and grandchildren were marched in review by the bedside ; the features of favorites were conned eagerly and searchingly ; the freckles on a young girl 's face were counted with painstaking interest , and with an unimpeachable accuracy that filled the veteran with gratified vanity ; and then , while he read some verses in his Testament his sight grew dim and passed away again , and a few minutes afterward he died . It seems to be a common thing for long-absent reason and memory to revisit the brains of the dying , but the return of vision is a rare circumstance indeed . THERE is something very touching in this news of Lady Franklin 's setting sail , at the age of eighty years , to go half-way round the globe to get a scrap of Sir John 's writing which she has heard is in the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hers . Here is a love which has lasted through forty years of a common lot , then bridged a grave and lived on through twenty years of grief which only such an affection is capable of feeling  --  and still , at this day , widowed and venerable , is able to mock at the zeal of half the honeymoonloves in the world . // - THE GALAXY offers this month two interesting contributions to the history of the nation at that most important epoch of transition from the old order to the new , when political traditions and precedents were beginning to disappear before the rising tide of civil war . The reminiscences of Mr. Thur. low Weed reveal some of the circumstances attending the first tentative efforts of Mr. Lincoln and his Cabinet to deal with the revolution which his election had precipitated , and in the letter of ex-Attorney-General Black to Senator Wilson we have a view of Mr. Buchanan 's policy in reference to the events which he has been so severely censured for suffering to get beyond his control . Judge Black 's letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he was identified . Though it lacks the calmness of temper we should have advised , yet we adhere to our policy of freedom and allow its author the fullest liberty of expression . It is to be remembered , too , that something is to be excused to a man who is praced at such a disadvantage by the popular sentiment which the circumstances of the last ten years have created . Unfortunately for him , public opinion deals with men and events as the scene-painter deals with his colors - it distributes them wholly with reference to bold effects when viewed from a distance , and does not concern itself with the results of a nearer inspection . Mr. Wilson can well afford to allow the fullest liberty of statement to a critic who argues against events ; and we are glad to give so able a writer as Judge Black this opportunity to be heard now , when the passions of the hour have cooled . But not even the argument of so skilled an advocate can reverse the record . - VOLTAIRE , who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who took a good-humored delight in the eccentric ways of English law and English life , would have rejoiced over some of the humors of a cause lately tried in one of the great provincial towns of England . A married woman chose to elope with a young man . The deserted husband had , according to English law , no way of punishing a man for carrying off his wife . He might , of course , seek for a divorce , and under certain conditions might possibly even recover damages from his wronger , but there is no legal way of punishing the seducer as a criminal . They have not in England much sympathy with the more heroic way of finding remedy for such wrongs which are lately so popular in more advanced conditions of civilization and therefore it did not occur to the husband to take what English sportsmen call a " pot shot " at the paramour of his wife . But the husband was not a man to be wholly passive , and he thought he saw a way to punish his enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bundle of clothes besides the garments in which she stood , and these she gave , as Jessica gave the jewels , to her lover to carry for her . Now these clothes were apparently the legal , property of the husband , not the wife , and therefore the husband had the lover arrested , sent to prison , and arraigned on a charge of stealing certain articles of wearing apparel . The case came to trial , and there were learned counsel arrayed on both sides . The charge was , that the prisoner , while carrying off the wife , a thing not unlawful to do , had also carried off certain feminine undergarments , which is quite unlawful . But the defence was very ingenious . A married woman is entitled in England to have at her husband 's charge , whether he will or no , all articles of food or clothing which are absolutely necessary ; and it was contended that the extra garments carried off were needful changes of linen such as no respcctable adulteress could be expected to do without . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury and the court was , simply , whether the articles carried off were or were not necessary to the woman s personal comfort . Each of the articles-they were only a few night-dresses , chemises , and so forth-was brought into court , and a debate took place as to whether jt was really necessary for a woman starting on a journey to have such a thing . Finally , the jury held that the faithless wife could not be reasonably expected to elope without a few changes of linen the prosecution broke down , and the lover was set at liberty . We doubt whether , even in England , " old Father Antic , " the Law ever appeared to more delightful advantage than this . Here was an
