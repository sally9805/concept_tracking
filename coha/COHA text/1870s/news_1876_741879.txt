He knew the dangers and hazards of the position and his stores , and took his chances . His goods were bever in the possession or under the control of the United States . He knew the Government warehouse and stores were contiguous to his store-room , and when the warehouse was fired and the preparatiOns for such firing were making , no effort was made to re . move any of them . The flames from the Government stores communicated to his storehouse , and his goods were consumed . We know of noprinciple of law which will render the Government responsible under the facts in the ease . " In the case of John , Company E , Sixtyfourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said regiment , and for pay and allowances while a prisoner of war at Authorsonvillo , the Senate Committee on Military Affairs made an adverse report. , in which they say : " John , Company E , Sixty-fourth Ohio Volunteers , was enrolled and mustered into service Oct. 19 , 1861 , for three years ; was reported a deserter from Aug. 19 , 1862 , to Deo. 31 , 1862 ; was captured in action at Chickamauga , Ga. , Sept. 19 , 1863 ; enlisted in the rebel Army us a private in Company A , Tenth Tennessee Regiment , while a prisoner of war at Andersonville , Ga. ; was recaptured by United States forces at Egypt Station , Miss. , Dec. 28 , 1884 , while in arms against the Government ; was confined as a rebel prisoner of war at Alton ( Ill. ) military prison . and was released Feb. 21 , 1865 , on amnesty oath .

' We have bore a case of desertion that should not be confounded with honorable conduct by any lapse of time , and to grant the relief prayed for would be an injustice to the surviving loyal men who suffered all the hardships enumerated by the applicant rather than abandon their colors and array themselves on the side of the enemy . " The Senate Committee on Claims , in their report on the petition of John S. Friend , say ; " The petitioner alleges that he lived , as a istock raiser , in one of the frontier counties ot Texas , and that ho suffered much from depredations by marauding bands of Comanche Indians , taking from him at various times horses and other property amounting in value to $2,492 , and upon one occasion attacking his family , mutilating in a shocking manner his wife and taking captive his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , subjecting him to great expense , as well on account of medical services rendered to his wife as in efforts to recover and restore to his home his sun , amounting in the whole to some six thousand dollars . This claim was we . sented to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , who replied that the case was one deserving favorable consideration , and recommended that it be presented to Congress : As the case conies before Con. gress with this recommendation , the committee deem it proper to say , in reference to this and all like claims , that in their judgment , In the absence of treaty stipulation or special obligation on tho part of the Government , the Government can not , and ought not , to become the insurer of the lives and property of those who choose to undertake the hazards of a frontier life . . It is certainly right and proper for the Government to afford all the guards iu its p , wer for the protection of its citizens against Indian incursions , by the aid of its military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require it to go . They therefore reject the claim of the petitioner , and ask that they may bo discharged from its further consideration , and that the bill accompanying this petition be indefinitely postponed .
