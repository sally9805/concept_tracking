RECOLLECTIONS OF CHARLES SUMNER . THE first two volumes of Mr. E. L. Pierce 's excellent biography of Charles Sumner are confined to what may be called the period of his preparation for political life . They end at the time when his influence as a force in national affairs really began . The abundant materials which Mr. Pierce has in his possession assure us that his forth-coming volumes will far exceed in interest and value those which he has already published . Meanwhile , all recollections of Sumner , recorded by friends who surveyed him from various points of view , can not but aid him in making his biography complete . The charm of Mr. Pierce 's work , so far as it is published , is the absence in it of partisanship . Warm as is his sympathy with his subject , he is not specially affected by that disease of admiration , that Lues Boswelliana , that Furor Biographicus , which Macaulay declares " is to writers of lives what the goitre is to an Alpine shepherd , or dirt-eating to a negro slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own story , without any of those exclamation points of admiring wonder which generally prove that the biographer is the slave rather than the social and intellectual equal of the man whose life he depicts . It was the misfortune of Sumner that , more than any other public man of his time , he was subjected to the extremes of adulation and obloquy . His real character can hardly be discerned amid the tumult of puffs and scoffs , of exaltations and execrations , which the mere mention of his name excited during his public career . Sumner himself was inclined to take the compliments at more than their real worth , while he experienced another though different satisfaction in reading the calumnies . The compliments he considered as indications that all lovers of liberty and justice were on his side ; the calumnies delighted him , because , as they grew fiercer and fiercer , they seemed to prove that his blows directed at slavery and injustice were telling more and more against the enemies of freedom and right . It is difficult to say whether his enjoyment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from distinguished men , abroad and at home , which exalted him to the skies , or in spreading before them other letters , mostly anonymous , which damned him to everlasting infamy as the foe of his country and of the human race . It must be confessed that , during the rebellion , our Southern friends did not confine themselves within the limits of good taste in their private communications to their Northern opponents . It is impossible for me to compute the number of times that Sumner 's soul was consigned to perdition , with all the additions of superfluous profanity known to gentlemen in whom profanity appears to be a secretion in the throat . These private threats and public denunciations were a source of humorous pleasure to Sumner . He never swore as an individual ; nobody ever heard an oath slip from his lips even in his ecstasies of philanthropic rage ; but he was the best swearer by proxy and quotation that I ever listened to . The oaths launched at him by his Southern enemies , the oaths which some Republican Senators would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinacy in clinging to his own view of a party question that had been decided against him by a majority of Republican statesmen-these , in narrating his experiences in political life to a friend , he would roll over on his tongue in quite an unsanctified but still innocent fashion , and lau , , h at the profanity as something exquisitely comical . The more people swore at him , the more delighted he was ; and it is a pity that he did not have the same sense of humor in estimating the hyperboles of panegyric addressed to him by his admirers , which he unquestionably had in estlinating the hyperboles of execration shot at him by his assailants . My acquaintance with Sumner preceded by a few years his celebrated oration on " The True Grandeur of Nations , " delivered in Boston on the Fourth of July , 1845 . He had recently come back from Europe after one of the most successful social campaigns which a young American had ever made abroad . From the first I was attracted by his grand , cordial way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon came to love him very much , as did scores of other young men , who dropped occasionally into his law office for an hour 's conversation . We all had a special liking for some English , or French , or German author ; and here was a man who had seen and conversed with our particular idol a year or two ago , who was still in familiar correspondence with him , and was willing to show us , in confidence , a letter from him dated only a month before . Sumner thus consumed in private conversation with us and other more learned loungers a vast amount of time which probably should have been devoted to establishing himself in his profession . Whether he would have ever become a great advocate or a great judge , had he devoted his whole energies and his constantly accumulating stores of legal learning to the profession of the law , it is difficult to say . My impression of him , in 1843 , was this-that he was a man who would devote himself to assistin* , and cheering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was even then a philanthropist , a lover of mankind , to the very core of his nature . In conversing with him I found that all his study of history had impressed him with a horror of war , that all his study of law had kindled his soul into an ambition to make jurisprudence identical with ethics , and that his mind was specially bent on schemes which proposed such an extension of the law of nations that all conflicts of nations with each other should be decided hereafter by tribunals on princi ples of reason and justice , and that the sword should be appealed to only after every moral restraint on the passions of men had been urged in vain , He not only quoted in illustration of his conception all great writers on international law , but he was particularly interesting in citing the unpublished opinions of eminent living European jurists with whom he had conversed on the subject , and who confided to him aspirations in the direction of his own ideal of a Congress of Nations which they probably would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ambition to extend the scope of international law was never absent from his mind ; and later in life , when he made his celebrated speech on " Constructive Claims , " all who knew him intimately must have felt that he was aiming at an addition to the laws of na tions , that lie was innovating on the established code while he was seemingly only expounding it . On the occasion of his last visit to Great Britain , after the Treaty of Washington had been concluded , I laughingly asked him , as we shook hands on the wharf , if he were going to England to collect his " constructive claims . " He laughed in return ; but he added : " I can tell you one fact you do not know . Lord said to me a few weeks ago , Mr. Sumner , had you not made that speech , we should not be here to negotiate the treaty which has just been happily concluded . ' So you see , in making that speech , which has resulted in arbitration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in this case may not be very satisfactory ; indeed , I voted for the treaty only under great stress from friends whose arguments did not altogether convince my judgment ; but the establishment of the principle of arbitration must still be considered a great advance on the old ways of diplomatic intercourse between nations . And you will find that Great Britain will never , in any future war , place herself again in the predicament in which my speech demonstrates she was placed in the matter of the rebel cruisers . " But my object at present is to show what a delight it was to hear Sumner tell anecdotes of his experience of English life after he had returned from his first joyous visit to England , and when he was still a young man , full of enthusiasm for literature as well as for jurisprudence , and thoroughly enjoying , in endless talk with chance visitors , the leisure of a lawyer without clients , before the lawyer had been tempted to publicly appear in the field of either philanthropic enterprise or political discussion . Laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching his long legs to the full length of their possible extension , he would discourse for hours on every subject and every personage which the questions of his visitors aroused in his singularly tenacious memory . " Did you meet Talfourd , Mr. Sumner , while you were in England ? " " Oh yes ; and that reminds me of a ludicrous incident connected with Dr. Channing 's sending him his lecture on temperance . Channing , you know , was captivated , as all of us were , by Talfourd 's exquisite tragedy of Ion . Well , he sent his pamphlet to Talfourd , with the full // assurance that the author of such a dramatic poem would gladly receive a lecture so full of moral truths ; but the good doctor forgot to prepay the postage . In the condition of the postage laws at that time the sum demanded for it was very large , and Talfourd refused to take it from the office . Meanwhile it was exhibited among the letters and documents uncalled for ; and at last the envelope became so torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person to whom it was addressed , became visible to the public eye . Talfourd was unmercifully quizzed by the members of his special club on his unwillingness to take out from the office such a precious document , especially as its subject indicated that it had some particular reference to him . I happened to be at the club one night , or rather morning , when Talfourd came in from the House of Commons , which had just adjourned . After calling for broiled bones and claret , he beckoned me to his table , and asked some questions regarding this Dr. Channing . Of course I told him what a noble philanthropist Channing was , and how greatly he was esteemed by the best men in the United States . Well , Sumner , ' was his reply , I wish , if you see him on your return , you would beg him to send me no more of his pamphlets without paying the postage ; and you may add , though it may be at the expense of my character for sobriety , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb , to the tipsy school . ' " And then , perhaps , the querist might be one who had heard of the breakfasts where men of letters met each other at the table of Samuel Rogers . " Have you ever , Mr. Sumner , been present at one of these ? " " Many times , " was the reply ; " but you must not be deluded with the idea that the feeling among the persons invited to them was always cordial and friendly . I remember , on one occasion , after we had sat down at the table , Rogers remarked that a prominent lawyer and writer whom he named , though invited , had not yet appeared . Then came a series of bitter sarcasms directed at the absent but expected guest , to which the host blandly contributed his full share . Suddenly the object of this combined attack entered the room , and Rogers rose from his chair , shook hands with him in his most charming way , and added , Ah ! my dear how glad we are to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in ! " ' Sumner , indeed , keenly perceived the organized hypocrisy which constitutes the formal politeness at great London dinner and breakfast parties , and knew how niuch conceit , envy , hatred , and malice may be expressed without any violation of " good manners . " Again , some visitor might ask : " Did you ever meet Macaulay ? " And Sumner would answer : " That reminds me of a curious circumstance in my London experience . At a dinner at Lord Lansdowne 's the question of codification came up for discussion , and I was appealed to as an American to give what information I could as to how far the laws of the separate States and the United States had been harmonized into a code . I answered in general terms . A gentleman who sat opposite to me at the table , and who had not spoken before , then began to put to me a series of questions . They were so searching , and were so evidently intended to get at the very root of the matter , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that I must in the end come to the exact , the real advance that our country had made in this direction . This terrible fellow was content with no generalities . His penetrating analysis went pitilessly on , every new question presenting new difficulties for me to clear up ; but while I was drawing on all my resources of information to answer him , I felt confident in my own mind that the questioner was Macaulay , though I was then ignorant of the fact that he had returned from India . And I was right . It was Macaulay . He was fresh from his great work on the India penal code , and knew more about codification than any English lawyer at the table . And , by-the-way , perhaps you have heard of the sarcasms that his legal opponents launched against that code . I was told in legal circles that though it had cost the government a guinea a word , it was utterly impracticable . " And it may be added here that Macaulay 's code , with some modifications , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to undergo a storm of opposition lasting forty years before its merits were recognized . The defect of Sumner as a relator of such memories as these was his disposition to be too minute and circumstantial in his narrative . His imaginative memory was roused when he was asked any // question as to his intercourse with an eminent man , and he recalled in a dreamy way the irrelevant as well as the relevant incidents which were connected with it . Thus he would consume ten minutes in telling a story which a man like Choate would have flashed upon his hearer in one . During all the early period to which I refer , Sumner appeared to be a thorough philanthropist in thought and feeling , rather than a man capable of putting philanthropy into aggressive action , and of becoming a great public Force . In listening to him one got the impression of a certain indolence of nature , which would be content with uttering moral opinions without backing them up with moral might . Suddenly , as by a flash of lightning , the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , long meditations , and long conversations on moral ideas , broke out in a Fourth-of-July oration . His subject was " The True Grandeur of Nations ; " the occasion was the commemoration of Independence-day , which the municipality of Boston celebrates annually with an oration and other fire-works . The great success of Sumner was due to the fact that his oration was studiously framed so as to be utterly inappropriate to the occasion . It happened that a considerable number of army and navy officers were present , some of them suggesting to the audience memories of the war of 1812 . Foreseeing that there was to be a kind of benevolent mischief in Sumner 's oration , I took a position at the extreme end of the hall in which it was delivered , in order to watch its effect on the countenances of the bewildered or belligerent auditors as his famous plea for peace was developed , each proposition illustrated by some vivid picture of the horrors of war , and both propositions and pictures relentlessly leading to the conclusion that among communities of reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the expenses of supporting Harvard College and the man-of-war Ohio , then floating in Boston Harbor , together with his somewhat clumsy ridicule of the spangled costume by which an officer of the militia is distinguished by his dress from an ordinary citizen , must have been resented as an inexpiable offense not only by the captains and commodores of the regular army and navy who were present in full regimentals , but by the militia offi cers whose companies escorted the procession to the hall , and who altogether outshone their professional brethren in the freshness and brilliancy of their military accoutrements . The whole scene , as I viewed it from the outside , seemed to me so deliciously humorous that I fear tbe moral grandeur of Sumner 's sentiments did not impress me half as much as his almost child-like innocence while he went on dealing stab after stab to estimable servants of the United States , who had come there with the reasonable expectation that on the Fourth of July , at least , they would not only be honorably mentioned , but might also count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which on such occasions are ordinarily lavished on " the brave defenders of the country , whether on land or sea . " They could not have dreamed that the uselessness of their profession would be the orator 's theme , when they remembered how scanty were their emoluments , and bow severe was the code of professional honor which prevented them from resorting to those ignoble contrivances by which many civil officers of the government increased their meagre " wage " by illicit and unlawful gains . Sumner , as might naturally have been expected , was called to account by many speakers in the dinner that followed in Fancuil Hall ; but he bore his punishment meekly ; and the peculiar fascination of his smile was never more ebarmingly apparent than during the time he sweetly listened to the diatribes of his angry opponents , even when his friend Dr. Palfrey felt himself compelled to join in the chorus of dissent . On the next day his law office was beset by friends and foes alike . The remonstrants were there in great force ; and Sumner had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to those who half agreed with him , and to those who totally disagreed with him . For hours he was mobbed by a successive crowd of intelligent men , whose questions were so searching that a speech longer than his oration would have been required to answer them . Choate , whose office was near Sumner 's , darted in at a propitious moment , and dragged off the most formidable of his friends and antagonists , the great publicist Dr. Lieber ; but still , sympathizers were almost as difficult for Sumner to manage as non-sympathizers. // Hullard , whose office was connected with Sumner's-divided oniy by a door-and who was then in close friendship with him , quietly remarked to me , amidst the din of voices : " What folly is all this ! Each of these men professes to be a Christian ; Sumner , as I understand it , has simply applied the principles of Christianity to war , and he has raised a tumult fiercer than if he had insulted Boston , on the national anniversary , by an open profession of paganism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourth of July , 1845 , it became evident that Sumner had established himself as a power among two classes of our New England population which it is never safe for any politician or statesman to disregard or despise , namely , earnest progressive clergymen and warm-hearted cultivated women . In speaking of " cultivated " women , it is , of course , implied that the phrase includes not only those women of large hearts who have been highly educated as to the knowledge of many languages and many literatures , but those women who have been trained in the austere discipline of practical life to regard moral obligations as the most important and permanent of all the ties on which civil society rests , though they may speak no language but their own , and have read but few books except the Bible and Pilgrim 's Progress . The influence which Sumner early obtained among these sources of real power went on increasing to the day of his death . There was from the first something feminine , though not effeminate , in the delicacy of his perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practical men honestly delivered their opinion that Sumner was , in the most expressive term of Yankee contempt , " a greenhorn . " They saw clearly that war was a hateful condition nf human affairs to which all " Christian " states must be at times exposed ; that preparations for possible wars should properly enter into the economy of all strong governments ; that the precepts of the Christian religion were historically proved to be weak against human avarice and human ambition ; and that the best way , on the whole , to prevent war was to be prepared for it . These men did not add that the great provocations to war were moral , springing from the stalwart assertion of the rights of man against the oppressions of privileged men ; VOL . LIx. - No. &amp;50. -1 8 that there could be no peace as long as any man was deprived of his rights ; and that the fiery philanthropists who appear as the champions of reason , justice , and peace , who denounce religious superstition and political tyranny in words which stir multitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient provokers of war . When they ask this king or that aristocracy to combine with other kings and other aristocracies to prevent the nations they rule from indulging in the expensive expedient of war , they suppose a condition of things which would reduce the people they rule into a weak submission to servitude , against which human nature , at least in Europe and the United States , instinctively uprises with arms in its hands . Fifteen or sixteen years after the oration which first made him prominent among the public men of the country , Sumner 's earnest preaching of the seemingly peaceful doctrine of right and justice ended in making him one of the most prominent of those American statesmen who , in the most frightful of civil wars recorded in history , were for waging war to its utmost limits until justice and right were established throughout the land . He would , of course , have preferred that the dread arbitrament of war should have been avoided ; but when it came , who was more vehement than he to prosecute it on principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Most wars , indeed , when waged in civilized states , are either the direct or remote results of the insurrection of the human heart , the human conscience , and the human reason against the attempt of a few privileged men to degrade human nature itself by an insolent assertion of superiority over the great mass of mankind . But to return to the immediate subject . Sumner 's reputation grew day by day , as the great Christian layman of New England , from the time the oration on " The True Grandeur of Nations " was published . The peace societies naturally welcomed so eloquent an adherent ; but the series of speeches and addresses which followed it , with his favorite emphasis on RIGHT-always prominent with a capital R , or with the whole word in capitals-so worked into the mind and moral sentiment of Massachusetts that he became at last the Senator of that State in Congress , by the operation of the Darwinian law // of natural selection and " the survival of the fittest " among the contending politicians who desired to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth-ofJuly oration , he made a new application of its principles in his noble Phi Beta address at Cambridge , on " The Scholar , the Jurist , the Artist , the Philanthropist . " The men selected to represent these were John Pickering , Joseph Story , Washington Allston , and William Ellery Channing . Having been present on the occasion of the delivery of this oration , I can bear testimony to the general enthusiasm with which it was received by the old and by young men who were present ; the tribute to Judge Story , especially , was the best compact statement that has ever been made of Story 's real contributions to jurisprudence , considered as a science ; and yet a young sprig of the law , hardly out of his legal teens , superciliously remarked to one of his companions as he left the hall that the whole speech sounded to him as if it were made up out of four rejected obituary notices ; and the joke made him quite a reputation among the whole body of young gentlemen of his turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was so demented as to be inspired by any moral enthusiasm whatever for what Sumner emphatically called the " Right . " But the special criticism on Sumner advanced even by some persons whose minds were absorbed in questions relating to philanthropy , was this , that he was a pedantic philanthropist . If there is one among Sumner 's many orations which may be selected from the rest as pre-eminently able , it is his college address ( 1848 ) on " The Law of Human Progress . " After having been delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Union College , Schenectady ( New York ) , he repeated it before scores of popular lyceums in New England and New York . The audiences were doubtless amazed that a proposition which they were prepared to accept without question was historically considered , that the obscure hints of the law in ancient poets and philosophers were elaborately set forth , and that the theories of Descartes , Pascal , Vico , Leibnitz , Lessing , Perrault , Fontenelle , Turgot , Condorcet , and a host of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the words of Pascal , the succession of men , as they appear age after age , may be regarded as one man , " who lives always , and learns continually . " A quickwitted woman , who had heard the lecture at a village lyceum , told me that when Sumner first announced his proposition , she agreed to it at once as an obvious truth . " But , " she added , " when he went on summoning this and that great man of whom I had never heard to testify to its validity , I began to grow suspicious ; the truism took on more and more the character of a paradox ; and after his citations of authorities had come to an end , I came to the conclusion that human progress . was one of Sumner 's benevolent heresies , and was inclined to disbelieve in it altogether . " Yet the value of Sumner 's historical method of treating the genealogy of freedom , and the importance that his large legal and general learning gave to his arguments for human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate of the United States , and plunged into a hand-to-hand and mindto-mind fight with the accomplished lawyers and debaters who thought , or pretended to think , that the truisms accepted at most New England firesides were damnable paradoxes , which all friends of the Union and the Constitution must passionately denounce or derisively reject . Then the laborious antiquarian of liberty came in to re-enforce its resolute champion , citing precedents as fluently as he asserted principles , and basing the disputed proposition that two . and two made four on a mass of accredited authorities in matters of government and legislation which were entirely independent of the judgments of his own intellect and the monitions of his own individual conscience . Thus he could not be contemptuously dismissed by his brother Senators as a mere " freedom screecher , " for he screeched Grotius and Puffendorf , screeched L'H6pital and Turgot , screeched Hale , Holt , Mansfield , Chatham , Camden , Burke , and Fox , screeched Washington , Jefferson , Hamilton , Madison , Jay , Marshall , Jackson , Story , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enthusiasm without having in his brain an authority which justified the words that came hot from his heart . Therefore , what struck popular audiences as pedantry became , when Sumner entered the Senate of the United States , an element of power . Hia // legal opponents , treating him at first as a mere enthusiast , were soon forced to admit that the briefless barrister they affected to despise had employed the time which they had spent in the practice of the law in local courts , with fat fees as the just reward of their industry , in a patient and prolonged study of every branch of law , national and international ; that he was intimately acquainted with the most important decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States , and of the judgments of the State tribunals as far as they bore on the subject which happened to be under discussion ; and that the attempt to put him down by technical objections ended in rousing a kind of legal porcupine , bristling all over with technicalities , and shooting out his pointed quills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when his political enemies called forth the special capacity in which he preeminently excelled . His vast memory became indeed " a tremendous engine of legislative oppression " when its stores of precedents , legal or historical were called . forth by the questions , the taunts , the sneers , or the invectives of his political adversaries . The great body of the reformers and philanthropists of the country at last settled on Sumner as their man , because they found that in a national assembly which included lawyers and jurists he could bring learning to the aid of moral enthusiasm , and hunt up precedents to sustain all the principles which he and they mutually advocated . This was all the more important because such a combination of the technical lawyer and the philanthropic statesman was a rare phenomenon in our politics . They came to the conclusion that though four added to four made eight in the minds of simple people , it might mean nine or eightyeight in the minds of members of Congress ; and they witnessed , with ever-increasing admiration , the long array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts brought to bear on this question of moral arithmetic , when its soundness was vehemently questioned by eminent publicists both from the South and North . But as Pulteney , the great opponent of Walpole , said , nearly a century and a half ago , " The heads of parties are , like the heads of snakes , carried on by the tails ; " and Sumner was the head of a party within his party , which was clamorous for every new advance in the path which eventually led to negro emancipation . He developed by degrees a kind of moral implacability , derived from the uncompromising ethical fierceness of his chief supporters . He could bear ordinary taunts and invectives with fortitude , but when suspicions were suggested that he was not up to the requirements of " the party of Right , " he was greatly disturbed . The charge that any one was ahead of him in the legislative championship of justice and freedom , and had grounds for inveighing against his short-comings in the cause , inflicted on him an immedicable wound , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , which it might take a year of debate to get organized into a law . Sumner was early accused of the foible or vice of vanity , and the accusation was repeated again and again up to the day of his death . He was doubtless open to the charge ; but it is extremely difficult for any body who knew him intimately and loved him heartily to state the peculiar form this foible assumed , considered as one of the many ingredients which went to make up his character , so that those who knew him not can view it in its relations with the nobler and predominating qualities of his nature . To him there was a glory , perhaps sometimes a vainglory , in doing a good act , in making a good speech , or in writing a good book . If , in the early days of his career , any thing done by himself attracted the attention of men he esteemed , he delighted in showing to his intimate acquaintances the flattering letters he received ; but he delighted even more in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in the North American Review , if Longfellow published a new poem , or Prescott a new history , or Lieber a new work on the philosophy of tics , or Story a new treatise elucidatiiil some difficult department of law , he Apended all his energies in the attempt to set forth its merits . He was more vain , if the expression may be allowed , of the - forks of his friends than of his own . He wished that every thing they wrote should be properly appreciated , and that the public opinion should be in accord with his own . It is impossible to compute the amount of labor he consumed in aiding his literary and legal brethren when any one of them // was engaged in an enterprise which required toilsome research . His learning and his time were always at their disposal , and his glory in their glory became occasionally almost vainglorious . Now vanity , when it becomes a vice , is ever allied to envy , and of envy Sumner had not a particle in his nature . His cordial recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have of his own deservings . Where literature was concerned , he was , from the first , superior to all political and social prejudices . There was a period , some forty years ago , when a distinguished historian , of strong Democratic principles , was personally the most unpopular man in Boston , where he held an important political office . " Why , " a cultivated gentleman said to me at this time , " do you young men of the Lyceum invite him to lecture before you ? " " We invited him because , being an eminent man of letters , we supposed we should attract to our course of lectures persons of culture like yourself . " " Then you have made a great mistake . He is a person tolerated by nobody-except by Charles Sumner and William H. Prescott , who tolerate every body . " This was really a tribute to Sumner 's magnanimity , as he had then little sympathy with the politica.l views of the man that Boston society , through one of its mouthpieces , thus inexorably proscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most genial and amiable of human beings , was also honorable to him . Not many years after this , Sumner himself came under the ban of " good society . " The occasion was a debate at a meeting of the Boston Prison Discipline Society ( 1847 ) . He had done or said before this some things which offended the inner circles of Boston society , but in setting forth his views on prison discipline , he , in the heat of debate , made some needlessly cutting remarks on persons of the first respectability in the city , and he was thenceforth voted by them to be " vulgar . " His offenses against what was considered social and political decorum went on increasing year after year , and the houses where he had before been a welcome visitor closed their doors to him one after the other . It is curious that this fashionable ostracism continued after he had made himself a great reputation in the Senate of the United States , and held the position of chairman of the Senate Coinmittee on Foreign Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the opinion of ambassadors of foreign states , when numbers of the commercial and manufacturing aristocracy of his native city rated and berated him as a vulgar fanatic . Mr. Samuel Hooper  --  a Boston merchant , who represented Boston in the national House of Representatives for many years , before , during , and after the war of the rebellion and who was an intimate friend of Sumner-told me that one of his solid mercantile friends once asked him how he managed to get along with that fellow Sumner . " Oh , very well , " was the reply . " I meet him very often . He appears to be invited to every party given in Washington . You ca n't go any where without meeting him . " " But you do n't say he is considered a gentleman ? You do n't say that he is a man that one would ask , now , to dine at your table or mine ? " " No , " Mr. Hooper rejoined , with that dry , delicious , and quietly malicious humor which characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become you to invite him to your house . But society in Washington is mixed up of heterogeneous elements such as we never find in Boston . There is , you know , a lot of ambassadors from the various countries of Europedukes , earls , barons , knights , and other persons , with this or that title prefixed to their names  --  and they are compelled , for political reasons , to invite all kinds of persons to their dinners . Sumner seems to be their favorite guest ; but I would not , of course , advise you to invite him to dinner . In Boston we are naturally more cautious in selecting the persons who are to eat our meats and drink our wines . In Washington we have to be less discriminating . And the good Boston merchant departed , fully assured that his friend Hooper entirely agreed with him as to the propriety of excluding such a fanatic as Sumner from the inner sanctuary of his own unpolluted dwelling . And yet at this very time Sumner was recognized at the seat of government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matters which intimately affected the prosperity of the commerce of Boston in common with that of the whole commerce of the country . In questions relating to domestic affairs , // Sumner was almost always in collision with his Democratic opponents , and often with his Republican friends . In foreign affairs , however , he generally carried with him both the Democratic and the Republican members of his special committee of the Senate . This was owing primarily to his exceptional knowledge of international law , the study of which had occupied his attention from the time he entered the Law School at Cambridge ; but this advantage was supplemented by his immense correspondence with the leaders of European opinion . Many of these leaders were occupants of offices under their respective governments ; others were professors of international law in the universities of England , France , and Germany ; wherever , indeed , there was a man competent to deliver a wise opinion on the law of nations , whether in office or out of it , Sumner contrived that a private letter addressed to himself should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as to the immediate question before them . It is probable that Mr. Pierce in the forth-coming volumes of his Life of Sumner will demonstrate how Lord Palmerston was forced to abandon his early insoent pretensions regarding " belligerency " by the knowledge which Sumner possessed , through his private correspondence , that some eminent member of the House of Commons would rise on some occasion and put a question to the First Lord of the Treasury which it would be awkward for him to answer . That question would be asked because Sumner had suggested it to one of his numerous correspondents who were members of the House . Indeed , it may be confidently asserted that there were a series of communications between influential members of the English House of Commons and House of Lords , addressed ( privately , of course ) to Mr. Sumner , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , which seriously influenced the action of the governments of the United States and Great Britain . The power that Sumner obtained was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes of Parliament and all the judgments of the press . This power he exercised with a kind of inexorable and implacable persistence , knowing that , if his demands were resisted , England would be placed in the position of a power of the second rank in Europe . " That , " he once told me , " is my object . If England should abandon her proud pre-eminence among the governments of Europe as the special representative of civil and religious liberty , if she should , in her relations to our country , dare to violate the recognized principles of international law , she must be inevitably reduced to the ignominious position of a power of the second class . My speech , which has so often been laughed at , and which every English journal denounces-though not one of the newspapers has ever condescended to print it in full-is really pondered by the shrewd ministers and diplomatists of other European governments . They know that until the questions I have mooted have been settled , England can not be considered a power of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to us . We have shown a capacity of improvising armies and navies which naturally excites surprise abroad ; and as long as Great Britain insolently denies our right to have the differences between us adjusted by fair arbitration , she has a terrible enemy on her flank should she choose to indulge in the luxury of war . " The relations between Mr. Seward and Sumner during the administration of Andrew Johnson were of a singular kind , and explain the difficulties he afterward unsuccessfully encountered in his dealings with Mr. Fish during the administration of President Grant . Seward and Sumner were old political and personal friends , and understood each other perfectly when they came into political hostility . They were generally in accord as to the foreign pohey of the government at the time they were most vehemently at variance on the domestic question of reconstruction . It was pleasant to listen to Sumner as he narrated any one of his many interviews with the Secretary of State . Thus he would say : " As soon as I heard of the position of Seward on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Once together in his private room , I immediately began : Mr. Seward , you have lost the great opportunity of your life to be ranked among the most illustrious of our statesmen . You have done much more . You have forfeited by this act a large part of your reputation among reformers and philanthropists , which you had justly acquired by your efforts in the cause of justice and // freedom . This last offense is inexpiable , unless it be at once repented of and disclaimed . History will hold you up as one of those men who met a great occasion on which the happiness and welfare of oppressed millions depended , by a weak compliance with the intrigues , the false statements , and the sophistical logic of their oppressors . I beg you to pause in time . ' And then , " Sumner would add , with exquisite naivete , " Seward would get mad as what man would not ? , and denounce me and my political friends as fools and fanatics ; and , you know , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to fools and fanatics . And so we would go on for perhaps half an hour in the fiercest contention , until our mutual noble rage was exhausted . Then Seward , recovering his equanimity , would say , Sumner , let us leave this matter , where we can not agree , and proceed to foreign affairs , where , I think , we have no radical cause of difference . Now I am placed , as Secretary of State , in a peculiarly embarrassing position as to foreign ambassadors . While this question of belligerency is pending between our government and that of Great Britain we can not consider any claim of other governments , however just they may be . I wish you would allow me to say , if Mr. , representing , and Baron reQresenting , or any other of the European ministers , call upon me for redress , that the trouble is not in my department , but in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . As you are the chairman of that committee , and all the claims are in your possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some obloquy , but I think it would be more proper that you should bear the burden than I. Of course we can not consider any claim from any quarter until Great Britain has receded from her first pretension . ' And so we would have another half-hour 's talk , perfectly friendly on both sides , in which it was agreed that I should be referred to as the obnoxious person who obstructed the consideration of any claims , until Great Britain had acknowledged the principle on which all should be settled . When the ambassadors came to me , I always told them that a few minutes ' conversation with the British minister would inform them of the real difficulty in the case . So , you see , though Seward and I were at swords ' points on many questions , we got along together very well in respect to matters of foreign policy . We never really quarrelled , though we sometimes violently disagreed . " One can easily understand why " a new hand " in the office of Secretary of State , like Mr. Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not contrive to fall into agreeable relations with the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , and why President Grant came positively to hate him . Sumner had become so accustomed to dominate in matters of state , was so blunt and belligerent in his conversations with Lincoln and Seward , that he could hardly understand why his outspoken advice should not be received by a new administration as it had been received by the old . Seward 's appreciation of his mastery of foreign affairs , which was not only due to Sumner 's knowledge of international law , but to his extensive correspondence with the leaders of English and European opinion on every disputed question which came up during and after the war , prevented him from ever getting into any quarrel with Sumner which would dissolve their personal friendship . Even after , as I have said , he had exchanged epithets with Sumner which would *1iave justified , to the Southern mind , an exchange of pistol-bullets , he would say , " Now I desire to see your last letters from , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corre spondents of yours in Europe . The dispatch I am going to write requires all the interior information I can possibly obtain regarding the real feelings and intentions of the men who represent public opinion abroad . " Mr. Seward felt that it would be folly to quarrel with a Senator who not only had the principles of international law in his brain , but had the opinions of its latest expositors in his pocket . Mr. Lincoln , again , so clearly discerned the impolicy of making an enemy of the formidable Massachusetts Senator , who so specially represented the moral sentiment of the Northern people , that he bore with much magnanimity Sumner ' s somewhat rude intrusions of advice as to what should be the President 's policy . A few days before Lincoln 's second inauguration as President , Sumner called at the White House , and told him that he was determined to defeat in the Senate his favorite measure regarding Louisiana , // because it embodied a vicious principle , which would be quoted as a precedent when any large scheme of reconstruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Lincoln blandly listened to the Senator 's remonstrances , and replied : " Mr. Sumner , I am not convinced by your arguments ; and as to your threat of defeating the bill , I can tell you it is impossible , for I know that a clear majority of the Senate is in its favor . " " But I tell you , Mr. President , " answered Sumner , " it shall and will be defeated . " " Try it , " was the quiet retort . Sumner did try it . He appeared on the last night of the session of Congress with a small law library , partly on his desk , and partly piled up on either side of it . The bill was introduced , and it was supposed that it would be immediately passed . Sumner , however , had the floor , and began to speak . After he had spoken an hour or two , it occurred to Senator Wade , of Ohio , that it would be well to ask Sumner-as the session of Congress would soon expire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done-how long the Senator from Massachusetts intended to occupy the attention of the Senate . Sumner replied , in his most courteous tones , that he feared he could not get through his argument in less than six hours ; the Senator from Ohio must see , from the books he had about him , every one of which contained matter bearing on the question of debate , and from which he proposed to make copious extracts , that his speech must be of unusual length , and that he could not promise that it would come to a close before the legal session of Congress came to an end . Wade , who had in his charge what was , in effect , Lincoln 's bill , was , on this announcement , compelled to abandon it . Sumner thus managed to have the whole great subject of reconstruction postponed to the period when it could be discussed in all its larger relations to the welfare of both sections of the country . It is very likely that this incident , as Sumner told it to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault is in my memory , not in his long narrative . But his object in telling it was to illustrate a beautiful quality of Lincoln 's character . " I thought , " he said , " that the President would consider my opposition as a personal affront . Instead of that , you may suppose of my surprise when he sent me a note on the next day , asking me to accompany Mrs. Lincoln , in his carriage , to the ceremonies of the inauguration , and also to accompany her to the inauguration ball in the evening . As to the ball , you may imagine the kind of wonder which was excited when , with Mrs. Lincoln on my arm , I made my way through the thick throng of ladies and gentlemen present , and placed her in her selected seat . The thing was nothing in itself ; but it still , I thought , read a lesson to shrewd politicians , when they had to undertake the task of pleasing such a man as Abraham Lincoln . " It is evident that Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vehement advice was not adapted to the mental and moral constitution of Grant and Fish . Perhaps they would not concede the value of the information he was able to give , while they resented the strenuousness , amounting almost to physical force , with which he urged his opinions on their attention . The quarrel which ensued came in the natural order of things . Much has been said about Sumner 's lack of humorous perception ; but this defect has been somewhat overstated . There was , it must be admitted , a certain tendency in his eloquence to grandiloquence-a tendency which was in his mind as well as in his words . Coleridge , in the admirable criticism on his friend Wordsworth , in the Biographia Literaria , states that the great poet sometimes brings in thoughts and images too great for the subject they illustrate , and he calls this " mental bombast , " as distinguished from verbal . It is a vice of style into which serious minds are apt to slide , when they are deficient in that sense of humor which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his full share of this defect . Still , in my conversations with him I often found him genially open to impressions of the humorous side of the questions he commonly debated with passionate fervor . At the time when he was among the most strenuous of those Republicans who opposed the renomination of Grant for the Presidency , I called upon him one evening at his rooms in Boston . He immediately began to declaim against the nomination of Grant as a " nomination not fit to be made " for a second term . In a pause , perhaps of half a minute , when his vehemence // was somewhat exhausted , and he stopped to gather breath for a new assault , I took the opportunity to remark that what he had just said reminded me of something that I had read in a newspaper the day before . " What was it ? " he eagerly asked . " Oh , nothing but this  --  a coincidence of opinion between your friend B and your friend Agassiz . " " B and Agassiz ! how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the next Republican nomination for the Presidency ? " " Well , " I replied , " I know nothing about the matter but what the newspaper states . There is an absurd report abroad that Agassiz , on geological grounds , predicts that the world will be smashed to pieces on October 22 . The news was communicated to your friend B while he was absorbed in arranging multitudinous rows of figures demonstrating that Grant could not be reelected , and that he only paused a moment in his calculations to exclaim , Good ! Any thing to beat Grant . " ' At this Sumner absolutely roared with laughter , and I feared he would drop from his chair , so convulsed was he with the sudden turn given to his serious thinking . I then ventured to add that he must , of course , know the motto which was suggested for Mr. Greeley , the candidate of the Democrats and the discontented Republicans . " No , * he said , recovering his accustomed earnestness ; " what is it ? " " Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , bail him on the spot ! ' " And then he laughed more uproariously than before . Stale as the jokes were , he had never heard of them ; but he must have had some sense of humor to appreciate their point when introduced , as they were , in the height of his moral passion against what he thought the sins of Grant 's administration . On the other hand , there were occasions when he seemed singularly obtuse to the most exquisite examples of humor . In 1853 was published a book which ranks with the most fascinating of all modern biographies  --  the Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon , Historical Painter , from his Autobiography and Journals , edited and compiled by Tom Taylor . It is one of the mysteries of what is called literary success that this work should not have obtained a circulation almost equal to Uncle Tom 's Cabin . Speaking only as one reader , I can say that at the time they were published I happened to take up each work early in the evening of one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next that I went to bed . In both cases sleep was impossible until the biography and the novel came to an end . In Haydon 's autobiography , full as it is of interesting matter , there is no description more deliciously humorous than his account of a dinner which he gave in December , 1817 , for the purpose of introducing Keats to Wordsworth , with Charles Lamb as one of the party . " Lamb , " he says , " soon got delightfully merry . He made a speech , and voted me absent , and made them drink my health . " Then he turned to Wordsworth , and said , " Now , you old Lake Poet , you rascally poet , why do you call Voltaire dull ? " After the dinner came tea , and then a stranger came in , who , like Wordsworth , was a comptroller of stamps , and had a vague notion that his brother comptroller was an eminent poet . As Lamb was dozing by the fire , the comptroller , being in literary company , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to Wordsworth , solemnly asked , " Do n't you think , Sir , Milton was a great genius ? " The scene that ensued is fully described by Haydon ; but the special point of it is that Lamb took up a candle , and walking up to the prosaic comptroller , asked , with great solemnity , " Sir , will you allow me to look at your phrenological development ? " The result of the whole series of embarrassments arising from Lamb 's reiterated demand to have " another look at that gentleman 's organs " was that Haydon and Keats , nearly bursting with suppressed laughter , forced him into the adjoining painting-room ; and while Wordsworth and others of the company were trying to pacify the enraged functionary , Lamb , struggling with his captors in the painting-room , was heard at intervals exclaiming , " Who is that fellow ? Allow me to see his organs once more . " It would appear to be impossible that any person who had caught a glimpse of the peculiar humor of Charles Lamb should not perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet Sumner , referring to Haydon 's detailed narrative of the occurrence , remarked to me : " I am sorry that such a story as that should have been published . We who love and appreciate Charles Lamb must be pained at seeing // RECOLLECTIONS OF CHARLES SUMNER . him represented in such a disreputable light as insulting the guest of his host in so unjustifiable a manner . He must have taken too much wine at dinner , or he could never have been guilty of such an indecorum . " Yet Sumner , while he made this remark , would have felt offended if you had questioned his capacity to enjoy the humor of Lamb . It was plain , from all the circumstances narrated at the dinner , that Lamb was not intoxicated at all . His conduct was a humorous protest against the commonplace comptroller of stamps , who had asked , " Do n't you think that Milton was a great poet ? " Phrenology was then a theory new in Great Britain , and Lamb 's demand to explore the " bumps " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic society without the remotest notion of what was indisputably established among them as settled questions , ridiculous to doubt , was but a practical , a characteristic , outbreak of his peculiar humor . Yet Sumner could not see it . But those who knew Sumner most intimately must heartily recognize those commanding traits of character which made his foibles and deficiencies appear of small account in their general judgment of the man . He was a grand specimen of physical , intellectual , and moral manhood , ready to do and to suffer any thing in the cause of what he considered true , just , honorable , and humane . Far from being confined to the ques*tion of slavery , which was his special task , he , in the spirit of Bacon , proudly took all benevolent and intelligent legislation " for his province , " and he was as sound on financial questions as on those questions which made him the special champion of liberty and justice . Above all , he was intrepid , and can hardly be said to have ever felt the sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an absurd opinion to controvert . On many occasions-indeed , on all prominent occasions of his career as a statesman-he was called upon to exhibit what is called " backbone ; " and the bravery in his will and in his heart always answered to that which was in his brain . Sumner , in common with all thoughtful and cultivated persons who speak the English tongue , had a just admiration for the genius and character of Edmund Burke . He sympathized deeply with the philanthropic spirit which animated the works of that illustrious philosophical statesman , even when he differed from hi* opinions . Probably the compliment he most prized was that paid to him by the eldest son of Earl Fitzwilliam , as he and Lord Milton were looking at the portrait of Burke by Sir Joshua Reynolds in a gallery of paintings in Wentworth House . " It seems to me , Mr. Sumner , " said Lord Milton , " that in this position , and in this light , there is a marked resemblance between your countenance and that of Burke . " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life in carefully correcting his orations and speeches . They were published in successive volumes , each receiving the last touch of the author 's pen , with a special solicitude that every quotation should be verified . He hoped that his spoken words would become a part of American literature , as the speeches of Burke were indisputably an essential portion of English literature " the third Englishman , " as Choate was wont to call him . He did not , of course , indulge in the pleasing conceit that his speeches were equal to Burke 's ; but he felt that , in preparing and delivering them , he had some claim to participate in the exultation of soul with which Burke welcomed , on a memorable occasion , the glorious unpopularity which resulted from the difference between himself and his Bristol constituents on certain questions where justice and humanity were concerned . After declaring with an honest pride that no charge had been made against him of venality or neglect of duty , he proudly adds : " It is not alleged that , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my party , I have had a share in wronging or oppressing any description of men , or any one man in any description . No ! The charges against me are all of one kind-that I have pushed the general principles of justice and benevolence too far , further than a cautious policy would warrant , and further than the opinions of many would go along with me . In every accident which may happen through life , in pain , in sorrow , in depression , and distress , I will call to mind this accusation ; and be comforted . " Burke , in revising his speech , evidently put a semicolon rather than a mere comma after the word " accusation , " in order to give emphasis to the pause which naturally followed , as he spoke , before he // drew " comfort " from the " accusation . " This simple dispassionate statement stands now as one of the grandest passages in English eloquence . The great master of that eloquence had been constantly libelled , caricatured , misapprehended , and denounced for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he confidently appealed ; and in this sentence he lifted obloquy into a spiritual region of the soul , where it became a crown of glory  --  a supreme source of moral selfsatisfaction beyond that which any selfish statesman can feel in the moment when his ambition is gratified to the utmost by reaching that height of power to which his energies may have been unscrupulously directed . Sumner , also , had the noble consolation and comfort which Burke experienced when he uttered those immortal words . The charges against him were that he , too , had pushed the principles of justice and benevolence further than a cautious policy would warrant ; but fortunately he lived long enough to witness that the irresistible tide of events forced his party to admit , as politic , measures which he had urged on the ground of principle , and to adopt his seemingly abstract maxims of justice and benevolence as the most necessary and efficient of political expedients.
