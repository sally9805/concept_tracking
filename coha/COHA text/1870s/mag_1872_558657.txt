COUNT BENEDETTI has done good service to contemporary history by the publication of the volume before us . Up to within a very short time there were several questions connected with the events which led to the recent war that had to be considered as unsettled . For example , it was not generally known whether France had been made aware of the negotiations pending between Prussia and Italy , in time to prevent the formation of their alliance against Austria . A doubt existed in regard to the nature of the transactions concerning the Rhenish frontier . It was , indeed , believed that France at one time had presented a claim for an extension of her boundary , but the precise terms of that demand no one professed to know . The Projet de Traits , published by Bismarck , seemed to place France clearly in the wrong ; but the prompt counter-declaration of Benedetti appeared again to unsettle the whole question . The bandying of words and recriminations which followed was enough , at least , to raise the query , whether , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whether , for the sake of French support in her schemes of self-aggrandizement , Prussia had not been willing that 13e1-gium should be seized by the French government . Then , too , there was the question whether the French government at the // commencement of the war had any adequate knowledge of the strength of the German armies . Were the negotiations concerning the Hohenzollern candidature carried on in that conciliatory spirit which tends to the preservation of peace , or was there prevalent on either side a disposition to provoke a war ? We scarcely need to say that these questions are of somewhat more than ordinary importance . The Italian alliance , which a single word from France in the ear of Italy would have prevented , may be said to have had Sadowa and the primacy of Prussia in the affairs of Western Europe as its consequence . Of still greater importance , as showing the spirit of the two nations , was the Draft Treaty . Its very existence showed that an atrocious violation of international faith had been proposed by one side or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to urge an armed alliance on the basis of the absorption of Southern Germany by Prussia , and the incorporation of Belgium into France , was deserving of universal indignation ; for the treaty obligations which protect Belgium from the intriguing designs of ambitious neighbors are of the most binding character possible . Just such a combination was feared and provided against when the independent nationality of Belgium was established . The matter involved , therefore , not only the existence of some half a dozen independent states , but also the general peace of Europe ; for if such treaties are to be broken with impunity by any nation , or any two nations , it is difficult to understand the value of any treaty obligations whatever . The mere proposal of such a violation of international contract is an effort to return from the reign of law to the reign of anarchy and physical force ; it is therefore , in the instance before us , of vast consequence to know by which power such a proposition was urged and by which it was rejected . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick octavo before us , and the comments which it has provoked , throw a flood of light for which every student of this period will be grateful . We do not hesitate to call it the most valuable contribution to the history of the events just preceding the war that has yet appeared . Nor do we consider it strange that Count Benedetti should break over the ordinary usages of // diplomacy , and give his despatches to the world . He has been so vehemently accused , that he is entitled to a hearing in reply . His assailants , inspired by motives either patriotic or partisan , have attacked him from every conceivable quarter . Some of them have declared that he did not sufficiently advise his own government ; others , that by his zealous officiousness he encouraged it on , and inspired it with a ruinous ambition . In the opinion of one class , he neglected to inform his imperial master of the military strength and purpo*es of Prussia ; while , according to another he was guilty of showing a criminal indifference in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would seem that , according to the opinion of all good Frenchmen , he misled the Emperor to believe that , in case of war , France would have the assistance of Southern Germany against Prussia , and that thus he , in a sense , provoked the contest by which the supremacy of France in European politics has been broken . Perhaps of all the men , from Napoleon to Trochu , whom the French people have endeavored to put to I the purpose of a scapegoat for their sins , Benedetti has been the most unfortunate . The reason of this is in the double fact that he was most intimately connected with the events which brought on the war , and that his part in them was of such a nature as to be generally concealed from the public view . It was safe to accuse him of anything , because nobody could show that the accusation was false . Moreover , it seems to have been supposed that nobody was interested in showing that any of the accusations were unjust . But in their supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of history is not always the part of human nature , especially of French human nature . It is doubtful whether one 's country is ever subserved by the loss of one 's honor . No word of censure , therefore , can properly be pronounced against Count Benedetti for publishing his despatches , even though by so doing he throws the blame of the war from himself upon his countrymen at large . Moreover , the same public which had so willing an ear for his accusers , are in duty bound to listen to his defence . That defence is now before the world . The witnesses through whose testimony he hopes to obtain judgmont are the various despatches which he sent and- received // when ambassador at the Prussian Court . These despatches , of course , constitute the great value of the evidence now brought to light . Before proceeding to discuss the particular merits of Count Benedetti 's work , it is necessary to clear the way by a single observation of a general nature . We take it for granted that the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact copies of original papers that were actually sent as officfal documents , and which at the present time somewhere have an actual existence . It is asserted by the author that transcripts of the originals are held at the French Embassy , in Berlin , under the seal of the English Minister , and also that the originals themselves are to be found in the Bureau of Foreign Affairs in Paris . We are particular to mention this circumstance , inasmuch as more recent disclosures , which in due time we shall have occasion to consider , teach us that it is the part of prudence to inspect carefully our author 's authorities . If there are any who , in the light of Bismarck 's more recent disclosures , are inclined to thii*k that Benedetti has forfeited all right to expect that his word will pass unchallenged , and that even his despatches , therefore , are not to be relied upon , we would remind them that when he deals in fiction and gives it ofit as fact , it is to be presumed that he does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In view of the circumstance that to invent or to garble the despatches which his volume contains , would , in the face of such sure means of detection , be a hundred-fold worse than useless , we presume we are quite safe in regarding them all as genuine . Near the beginning of his volume , Count Benedetti asserts that , in the course of his long diplomatic career , he has never , save in three instances , been charged by his government with the accomplishment of a definite and clearly defined mission . Those three definite missions were , the conclusion of the treaty by which Savoy and Nice were ceded to France , the consummation of an agreement between Prussia and Austria after the battle of Sadowa , and the procurement of the renunciation of the llohenzollern candidature . His efforts on these three occasions he claims to have been completely successful ; for // even in the affair at Ems , the renunciation which was sought was secured , and it was only when an additional demand was proffered by his government that the negotiations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his duties were merely of a general nature . He was charged with keeping his own government informed concerning the political affairs of Prussia , and with keeping Prussia informed of the wishes of France . His chief duties , indeed almost his only duties , appear to have been those of a purveyor of intelligence . But they were on this account none the less important . It was a time of constant changes in the relations of Prussia to the other German States . Benedetti 's mission extended through the most important period of Gerii:ian history . During that time Prussia rose from a position of comparative weakness to be the strongest power in Europe ; and this strength was attained , not so much by the power of Prussian arms , which defeated Austria , as by the skill of Prussian diplomacy , which manipulated the neighboring German States into alliance . This process of manipulation was going on in the very presence of Count Benedetti ; and it is important to know whether he was so obtuse as not to perceive it , or whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information concerning it , or whether , indeed , his government was so infatuated as to give no weight to his reports . Then again , concerning the Italian alliance , there was at best nothing for the ambassador to do but to inform his government in regard to it , and then to carry out such directions as his government might see fit to give . The course pursued by France in 1866 , in permitting the alliance of Italy and Prussia to take place , when a single word could have prevented it , was so utterly unnatural and unnecessary , that many have believed the French government could not have had eveii its suspicions aroused , until after the negotiations were completed and the whole affair was settled . Moreover , the importance of the alliance and the traditional policy of France would seem to justify such a conjecture . We are not for a moment allowed to suppose that the French government would have been indifferent to the aggrandizement of Prussia , if it had in any measure comprehended the prospect of such an aggrandizement by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , // it would be dispelled by the famous letter of Napoleon to La Valette , in which all the governments were given to understand that in case of *tny aggrandizement of either of the larger powers , France would expect a corresponding extension of her frontier . The great and the fatal mistake of France was in withholding her opposition to the course of Prussia when that opposition would have been effectual , and in thrusting it forward when Prussia had become so strong as to be able to disregard it with impunity . There is every reason to believe that Prussia would not have ventured upon the war of 1866 had it not been for the support of Italy . It is , moreover , quite certain that Italy would never have granted that support , if the French government , to which Victor Emmanuel was under so many obligations , had uttered so much as even a hint of a protest . The matter resolves itself then to this , that the war of 1866 would not have occurred , if Napoleon had protested against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been either because his ambassadors gave him no information concerning the alliance until it was too late to prevent it , or because he had so inadequate an understanding of the strength of Prussia as to suppose that the alliance would be harmless . If the relations of Prussia and Austria , and the relations of Austria and Italy , at the time of the alliance , had been of a friendly nature , the supporters of Napoleon might not be reduced to the necessity of accepting the dilemma which the real state of affairs imposes . But both Prussia and Italy were in warlike mood toward Austria before the alliance was formed . Everybody knew that the alliance was formed for the purpose of war , and war alone . It is certain , therefore , that Napoleon either did not know of the alliance until it was too late to prevent it , or , that knowing of it , he chose to allow it , and by so doing , to encourage the war which , as he must have seen , was sure to follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is to be charged upon the ambassadors ; if the latter it must rest with Napoleon , and we are forced to conclude that the Emperor looked with satisfaction upon the prospect of a war that would be likely to open the question of the boundary . As to which of these suppositions is correct , of course no one knows better than Count Benedetti , and in the volume before us he has settled the question beyond further doubt . // The first despatch concerning Italian affairs which Benedetti publishes is one which was written in 1866 , on the 11th of January . It informed the government that Prussia had just extended a friendly greeting to Italy , in the form of the Collar of the Black Eagle , conferred upon Victor Emmanuel by King William . M. Benedetti declares that Bismarek had urged the king to this course some months before , but that the latter had resisted his importunities until there should seem to be some special occasion which would not awaken the suspicion of foreign powers . Such an occasion had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zoilverein , and accordingly the king had conferred the distinction without further delay . On the 14th of February following , the French Ambassador sent a despatch to his government , giving a detailed account of an interview which he had just had with the Prussian Chancellor . Near the end of the despatch , which is given in full , he says of Bismarck - " Havino ' come to the name of Italy , he interrupted his account to inform me that , according to word that M. d'Usedom had sent , the Cabinet of Florence was manifestly inclined to seek , in a reconciliation with that of Vienna , a solution of the Venetian question . I made the remark , that surely no one could blame them for that , at whatever pecuniary sacrifice such an arrangement might have to be made , be it even five hundred million of francs . War , ' responded the president of the Council , would not cost them two hundred , and it would not leave pending those difficulties of the frontiers which peace is powerless to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be seen that even as early as the middle of February , 1866 , Benedetti communicated to his government the fact that Bismarek did not hesitate to speak of the advantages of war between Italy and Austria . But what could be the significance of such a remark ? It was folly to talk of a war in which Italy should undertake singlehanded to rescue Venetia from Austria , and of course nothing of the kind was in the mind of the Prussian Minister . Such a result could only be accomplished by means of a foreign alliance . It is easy to believe that a similar remark may have been dropped in the presence of other ambassadors . That such was the case , and moreover that the remark // April , was generally interpreted as pointing to an alliance between Prussia and Italy , and consequently to a hostile movemeiit against Austria , may be fairly inferred from what followed . On the 11th of March , only twenty-five days after the Chancellor 's remark concerning the expense of recovering Venetia by force of arms , Benedetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were most serious apprehensions of an outbreak between Prussia and Austria . This letter was apparently sent home for the purpose of informing the French government of the mamwr in which the principal courts of Europe would regard a rnpbure between the great German powers . In this letter Benedetti declared that Bismarck had just given him information of a report made by the Prussian Ambassador at London , and addressed directly to King William , in which it was stated that England would witness with extreme dissatisfaction any rupture of the friendly relations betweei* Prussia and Austria . Still further , Bernstorff , according to the report of Bismarck , volunteered the advice to the king , in most pressing terms , that his Majesty should avoid a war in which Prussia would be liable to incur the displeasure of all the great powers , not excepting that of France , adding that such was the opinion of all the political men of London . Letters conceived in the same spirit , added Bismarck , had been received from the Count Redern , the Prussian Ambassador at the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate as to the cause of this eXcessive frankness on the part of the Prussian Chancellor . Whether it was for the purpose of blinding the French government by showing that Prussia was fully aware that all Europe would be against her , or whether it was for the purpose of giving France an opportunity to protest at an early day , if indeed she desired to protest , can only be a matter of conjecture . The facts of chief interest in this connection are , that France was clearly informed of the agitation concerning a possible Austrian war , that she received hints of a possible Italian alliance , and that when she was thus fairly invited to present her opposition , if opposition she had to offer , no word of disapprobation was uttered . On the 14th of March , only three days later than the date of // the letter which reported the above conversation , Count Benedetti sent to Paris a despatch which shows that , whatever might be the condition of the French government , the French Ambassador was wide awake . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Govone , may soon be expected at Berlin , and that he comes charged with an important ssion . This news , which is believed to have been divulged through the indiscretion of Marshal Wrangel , has caused some emotion . If it shall be confirmed , there will not be wanting those who believe that Prussia and Italy are negotiating a treaty , offensive and defensive , in view of an approaching war , and I need not say to you to what point this incident has already aroused the attention of the public , and that of my German colleagues . " Two days later than this , the ambassador announced to his government that General Govone had arrived , and that both Count Bismarek and the Italian Minister declared that he was charged with a military mission , having for its special object an investigation of Prussian military methods . Two days later still , that is , on the 18th of March , Benedetti despatched to his government the following letter : - " In announcing the arrival of General Govone , I wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy , this envoy of the Cabinet of Florence was solely charged with the study of the military condition of Prussia . Yesterday Count Bismarck , forgetting , without doubt , what he had previously said , informed me that General Govone was authorized to enter into arrangements with the Prussian government . The communication which Vhe Italian official made to the president of the Council was , in substance , that Italy was not pressed to the necessity of an agreement ; in other words , that she intended to reserve to herself liberty of action , but that she was ready , meanwhile , if such a movement should be in accordance with the disposition of the king of Prussia , to conclude a treaty , the object and the execution of which should be determined at a future date . To this , Bismarck responded that Prussia was not yet in a condition to negotiate on that double basis . The state of her relations with Austria were not sufficiently aggravated , and moreover the Prussian government was bound to show more completely the necessity of recurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engagement to make war , and to declare it at a fixed date . Furthermore , the government was bound to confer in advance with the secondary States of Germany in // April , . regard to he will not be able to adopt definite action and pledge his word before he has provided for all possible contingencies ; in other words , Prussia would be glad . to bind herself with Italy , but in such a manner as to leave her action dependent upon circumstances . On both sides , meanwhile , they seem disposed to continue their parleys . At a second interview they considered the strength of the forces which each of the two nations would have at its disposal in the event of a crisis One of the most important and valuable of the series of letters on this subject is that written as a particulic*re to M. Druyn de Lhuys , bearing date of the 27th of March . It shows , on the one hand , the great difficulties in the way of bringing the negotiations to a favorable issue , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevented the Consummation of the treaty . After stating that Bismarck was in illnature that the affair made no progress , Benedetti proceeds - " I am in better condition to report to you , inasmuch as M. de Barral , the Italian Minister , has finally decided not to conceal from me entirely the movements and the advances of his government . You are acquainted with the first declarations which General Govone and Count Bismarck exchanged with each other . The Italian envoy proposed a treaty providing for war at a certain date , and indeed without delay ; Count Bismarek responded , that he did not yet know whether Prussia could properly make war with Austria , still less at what moment war could be declared ; he could therefore enter only into conditional engagements . The two plenipotentiaries have held themselves respectively on these grounds ; in fact , they are defiant . It is feared at Florence that Prussia , finding herself in possession of an article which will place at her disposal all the forces of Italy , will make these engagements known at Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to grant peacefully the concessions which she demands . At Berlin , on the other hand , it is feared that Italy , if the parties engage to negotiate on these terms , will , before final negotiations are concluded , give information to Austria , and will then attempt to obtain the abandonment of Venetia by means of a pecuniary consideration . It seems to me evident that these apprehensions have led the negotiators to hold themselves so well on their guard , that they have not succeeded , during these last days , in advancing a single step . M. Govone had come to observe a certain restraint which ill accommodated ; sclf to the impatience of Bismarck . Finally the latter modified his // language , and proposed a freaty which provided , . in substance , that Italy should engage to participate in a war , in case such should break out between Austria and Prussia within three months . This relatively short term appeared to General Govone to comport with the nature of his instructions , and accordingly to permit him to lend himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have communicated by telegraph with his government . He then asked the president of the Council to draw up a plan of the project of a treaty , and present him with a copy , in order that he might transmit its provisions to his government before it should he published . M. Bismarek would have preferred , on his part , to proceed at once to a signature without further reference , fearing constantly that the Italians would submit it to the Court of Vienna before returning it to Berlin . Yesterday , accordingly , he had submitted nothing to General Govone . In explaining the affair to me , he expressed a regret that he had detained General Von Moltke , * although the presence of the latter , in view of the active part he had taken in the preparatory measures as commander-in-chief , would , on the eve of the mobilization of the army , he of great service at Berun . The president was considering whether it would be better to arrest everything where it is , and despatch Von Moltke at once with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subserve the cause to send another officer in his stead . Such , as it seems to me , was yesterday the state of the negotiations . The minister of Italy has meanwhile asked Count Bismarck for an interview , and I suppose they will have a meeting to-day . " This letter drew from the French Minister a response which is also of interest , inasmuch as it shows , perhaps more completely thaix anything before published , the attitude of the French government in regard to pending affairs . It also shows how the service of Benedetti was regarded at the French Cabinet . The letter is marked " particuiie*re et confidentielle , " and bears the date of the 31st of March . We translate it literally as follows : - " I have read with great interest the special letters which you have addressed to me in the course of the present month . I tender to you for them my hearty thanks . If I have received them without respond * Von Moltke had been , some days before , on the point of setting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Govone to Prussia . In view of the possibility of an immediate war , however , he had been detained . Benedetti bad previously reported the affair to his government . // ing immediately , the reason is , that I have no modifications to make in the instructions which , from time to time , I have drawn up for your guidance . Our purposes are always the same . Fully recognizing the gravity of the new crisis which we are witnessing , we see nothing in the controversy as it presents itself to-day of sufficient importance to move us from our attitude of neutrality . We have explained our position at the Court of Prussia with all frankness . When we have been interrogated by the Cabinet of Vienna , we have declared freely that we wish to remain neutral , although that court has observed that our neutrality is modi more favorable to Prussia than to Austria . We await , therefore , the conflict of arms , if such a conflict must take place , in the position where we are at the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to the nature and the bearing of those interests which may become involved , and the extent to which the war is car ned , as well as the questions which it raises will determine the nature of the understanding between Prussia and ourselves . As to the negotiations which the Cabinet at Berlin has opened with Italy , I can assure you there is no foundation for that which was reported to Count Bismarek , concerning an intervention on our part with the Court of Florence . Our position toward Italy is determined by two important considerations . In the first place , at the time of the Yarsovie Conference , we , as you know , declared to the Italians , that if they should make themselves aggressors in Venetia , they would do it at their own risk and peril . We could not encourage them to listen to the overtures of Prussia , without incurring a very grave responsibility . In the second place , we have not designed , any further than we have been compelled , to place any obstacle in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning her from any combinations which , in the exercise of entire liberty of judgment , site may deem to be for her advantage . In this way I expressed myself to M. Nigra . This is the whole truth concerning our manner of looking at the question . I approve , moreover , completely of your attitude and your language , and I am much pleased that you have kept me so well informed in all the details of this crisis . " TZeuillez , etc. , ( Signed ) " DROUYN DE Lnuvs . " It is not necessary to multiply further our extracts from this interesting correspondence . Three days after the date of the letter just given the ambassador acknowledged it , and informed the government that it had arrived just in time to save him from some embarrassment . On the day before Count Bis // marck had sent an urgent message , desiring an immediate interview . On reaching the Prussian Cabinet , Benedetti found that the Chancellor had just received a telegram from his envoy , at Florence , announcing that Prince Napoleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turin , had arrived at Florence , and that , as a supposed consequence , the Italian ministers had been suddenly called to Turin for a Cabinet meeting with the king . The instantaneous inference of Bismarck from this intelligence was that the Prince had borne important counsel from the imperial government to that of Italy . The Prussian Minister himselt declared that , as Napoleon had been made fully aware of the prospect of an alliance , it was in the power of the Emperor to throw obstacles in the way of the negotiations which would be of infinite injury to Prussia . If Italy , for example , should go to Austria and say that an alliance with Prussia was pending , and that , too , with the approval of France , it was easy to see that Austria would in all probability make terms more favorable to Italy than the latter could hope to secure as the result of a war . This fear of Count Bismarck , of course , it was easy for the French Ambassador to remove , after he had received the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said further , that from this time the negotiations were carried on without interruption or difficulty . On the 6th of April Benedetti wrote home that the Italian plenipotentiaries had received full authority to bring the treaty to a close , and to affix the signatures . Now from this correspondence what inferences are to be drawn ? In the first place , we think it must be conceded that , as an informer , Count Benedetti played his part well . He had instructed his imperial master in advance in regard to the friendly disposition of Prussia toward Italy . He had announced the coming of General Govone , even before his arrival . He had succeeded in getting exact information concerning the negotiations , and had reported his information from day to day as the negotiations were pending . We think that Benedetti has shown his right to declare , as he does with evident satisfaction , that from the 18th of March , or three weeks before the conclusion of the treaty , he allowed the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to remain in ignorance of none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left no possibility of believing that the Emperor was deceived in regard to the fact of the alliagce . To the other conclusion , which Count Benedetti would have his readers draw from the correspondence , we are unable to agree . He would have us believe that the Prnssian Chancellor was bound to infer from the course taken by the i*'rench government that Napoleon was at least opposed to the Italian alliance . Now , as it seems to us , the course of France was of a nature to produce the opposite impression . The circumstances were such that it might fairly be claimed that silence gave consent . From the first , Count Bismarck had laid the matter before the French government . Before the negotiations had advanced beyond their mere inception , the affair was a subject of frank conversation between the Chancellor and the ambassador . The results of these conferences were fully reported to the Cabinet at Paris . If there had been any desire to prevent the alliance , it would have been a matter of the most perfect ease . Italy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a kingdom owed her existence . The relations of the two governments continued to be most friendly and most intimate . These facts leave no good reason for doubting that , if France had presented the slightest remonstrance to the Italian Qabinet , the negotiations would have come to an immediate termination . Moreover , in the early history of the relations which finally led to the treaty , the Prussian Minister constantly advanced as though such a protest might at any moment be made . From the first there was frankness , but at the same time there was great caution . It was evidently the purpose of Bismarek to give to France every opportunity to interpose her objections before negotiations had advanced so far as to make such an interposition in any way embarrassing . When , under these circumstances , it was apparent that no protest was to be offered , it was natural to infer that the alliance was regarded as in no sense objectionable . In a previous article we expressed the belief that Napoleon looked upon this treaty with favor , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth , doubtless , is that the Emperor was persuaded // that , without the contemplated alliance , Prussia would be no match for Austria , and that she would either decline the contest , or be speedily overwhelmed with disaster . In either case there would be no fragments for France to gather up . But if , on the other hand , Italy should be thrown into the Prussian scale , the two sides would be so evenly balanced as to make any overwhelming defeat impossible . The situation , in consequence , would be favorable for intervention , and France might hope for a suitable reward for her friendly services . Indeed , such a policy was clearly hinted at in the letter of instructions addressed by Napoleon to La Valette . Of Count Benedetti 's part in the final negotiations before the war of 1866 it is not necessary to speak in detail . There was , of course , no longer any apprehension from any quarter that France would interfere , and therefore the ambassador 's duties were confined to the matter of conveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author gives abundant evidence that he performed his duties with diligence and discrimination . It is plain that there was no reserve on the part of the Prussian Minister ; it is equally plain that the ambassador faithfully transmitted to his master the information so freely given . As events culminated , despatches were sent to France almost hour by hour . These letters contained not only reports of events which were known to have taken place , but also the fullest expression of the writer 's belief as to the course of events which might be anticipated . These letters the author calls special attention to , not only for the purpose of showing that he was a faithful reporter , but also to prove that his anticipations were in almost every instance realized . We are free to admit that the facts presented warrant the satisfaction of the author in presenting them . Not only are the details of the negotiations between Prussia and Austria reported with great fulness and clearness , but , what is of far more interest , the policy by which Bismarck was likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with general correctness . He showed that there was a general discontent throughout Germany at the existing state of affairs . He declared that these discontents were fomented in the interest of Prussia . He advanced it as his opinion , // that the policy of Bismarck would be to make such demands of Austria , in the interests of common Germany , as Austria would feel compelled to reject . He prophesied that these demands would be interpreted by Austria as evidence of warlike intention , and that , in consequence , the Austrian army would be the first to put itself on a warlike footing . In this manner , he declared that Austria would be made to appear the aggressor . As early as the 3d tf April he stated that the military purposes of Prussia , when the war broke out , would be to constrain the government of Austria to put all its military forces into the field , and then to bring the whole question to an issue in one great battle . He took especial delight in showing how Austria was exasperated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in consequence of that exasperation , the diplomacy of Austria was most unfortunate ; how the address of the Austrian government came to be " simply the address of the Emperor of Germany to the Marquis of Brandenburg " ; finally , how all these negotiations were , to use the forcible expression of one of his colleagues , simply , " de l'eau au moulin de M. de Bismarek. " * In regard to the period just before the declaration of war , the volume of Count Benedetti gives us some other curious information . The author declares that Bismarek was in constant fear that King William would not stand firmly to his policy . When it seemed probable that the questions at issue would be submitted for adjustment to a conference of the larger powers , Benedetti wrote to his government that in any event Bismarck would not himself be present , for the reason that he would consider it unsafe to leave the king accessible to uncertain advisers . In the opinion of the ambassador , the president of the Cabinet was in perpetual apprehension lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedetti addressed to M. iDrouyn de Lhuys on the 10th of April , 1866 , he gives free expression to his opinion in reaard to the attitude of the other European powers . What he said concerning the relations of Russia to Germany is , at the present moment , of unusual interest : " Puisque j'en suis * la Russie , laissez-moi noter que j'ai toujours remarqu* , non sans surprise , l'indifThrenee avee laquelle le Cabinet de Saint-Petershourg m'a pam , depuis l'origine , envisager les pr*tentions de la Prusse et l ' 6ventualitd dun conflit entre les deux grandes puissanees germanique ; que je ri'ai pas dtd moms frapps* de Ia eonstante s*eurit6 dans laquelle j'ai trouvd M. de Bismarek , sur l'ntritude et les intentions de I'empire du Nord . " // over-scrupulous person should get the ear of his Majesty and induce him to settle their difficulties without incurring the responsibility of war . It will be remembered that up to the 4th of June there was some prospect of an amicable settlement . While Austria was at least outwardly inclined to favor the reference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly opposed to it . Benedetti points out the manner in which the Prussian Chancellor outwitted his antagonist , and made him serve the purposes of Prussia . By assenting with apparent heartiness to the very arbitration which he most of all dreaded , he succeeded in conveying to the Austrian government the impression that at the hands of the plenipotentiaries Prussia feared nothing , but instead , hoped for everything . The consequence was that Austria was filled with the gravest apprehension . She suspected that Prussia had some secret ground to hope for an extension of territory . The Cabinet of Vienna , therefore , fearing that it might be drawn into some unforeseen necessity , and never suspecting that the whole matter might yet miscarry , sent a despatch to St. Petersburg , declaring that , though the Austrian government still adhered to its former engagement to submit the questions in dispute to a conference , it could only do so on the condition that no territorial question should he discussed , and that the powers there represented should renounce in advance all claim to a territorial aggrandizement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The several powers to which it had been addressed judged that the conditions imposed by Austria made the conference altogether impracticable . Such was accordingly the decision , and of course all further attempts at an amicable adjustment were impossible . Thus Prussia , though anxious at all hazards to avoid a conference , succeeded in throwing the responsibility of frustrating it upon her enemy , who was probably equally anxious to bring it about . Intelligence of this decision of the powers reached the Cabinet at Berlin on the 4th of June . On the same day Benedetti wrote to Drouyn de Lhuys that he happened to be with Count Bismarck when the desp*itch announcing the decision arrived , and that on reading it the Prussian Minister manifested his joy by crying out , " Vive le Roi . " // Count Benedetti 's part in the negotiations which followed the battle of Sadowa we shall not stop to consider . That period was already for the most part well understood ; and as very little new light is thrown upon it by the volume before us , we pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be remembered by everybody that , at the beginning of the late war , Count Bismarck took occasion to reinforce the German cause by the publication of what he declared to be certain propositions made by the French government in 1866 , having in view the annexation of Belgium to France . This declaration of Bismarek was immediately followed by the assertion of Benedetti , that although the draft was indeed in his own handwriting , it had simply been written at the dictation of Bismarck . It was further affirmed that this project , the infamy of which the Prussian Minister had attempted to throw upon the French , was , from beginning to end , purely a Prussian affair . Up to the publication of Benedetti 's volume , rather we should say up to the revelations called out by the volume , these contradictory statements have confronted each other with equal defiance . Nor is the question in dispute of insignificant importance . No one can properly sit in judgment on the causes of the late war , without having before him all the evidence he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations in their relations with each other . When , therefore , it is shown that there was advanced a proposition to incorporate Belgium into France , it is of supreme importance to know by which power so infamous a proposal was made , and by which it was rejected . Moreover , in the study of the same period , there is another question of almost equal importance . If it can be shown that the French made a vigorous diplomatic effort to gain the left bank of the Rhine , it is of importance to know whether the French government had any knowledge concerning the manner in which such a demand was likely to be received . On both of these questions there is now abundant light . Immediately . after it became certain that there would be war between Prussia and Austria , the French Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed a special despatch to Count Benedetti , asking him to communicate fully and immediately his impressions concerning the mood of the German people and of the German // government toward France , and especially toward the French government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , dated the 8th of June . In it he showed that of the two parties , the conservative and the radical , neither was disposed to be friendly toward the French government . The conservatives , or monarchists of the most rigid type , regarded Napoleon as the representative , and France as the cradle , of revolution . The journals of this party were partial and violent in their language . The liberal monarchists , on the other hand , had often rendered the French government justice , but always with a parsimonious hand . Persons of this class , together with the liberal democrats of all kinds , reproached the imperial government with being the most formidable enemy of parliamentary and constitutional reform . Thus conservatives and liberals , for reasons precisely opposite , manifested toward France a spirit of equal malevolence . However , it had to be admitted , Count Benedetti went on to say , that the bearing of France toward Germany during the war against Denmark had considerably modified the violence of German ill-will toward the French government . There were , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a great mistake to suppose their prejudices and sympathies are conquered . Nothing was changed , except upon the surface . But the conclusion of the letter is so important that we translate it entire - " In fact we have contributed by our past actions to lessen somewhat the apprehensions which France inspires throughout Germany ; but these apprehensions still exist , and they will show themselves unanimous and violent at the least indication which would allow them to suspect that we had an intention of pushing toward the Rhine . I know of no one , except perhaps Count Bismarck , who has entertained the thought that Prussia might have an interest in making to us a territorial concession , and even the Chancellor would consent to nothing more than to straighten the common frontiers of both countries . Nobody can foresee the necessities to which war might reduce the Prussian government ; but from the king to the humblest of his subjects , no one at this uirne could be made to anticipate the possibility of such a sacrifice . The Prince Royal , though fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a witness , declared but a short time ago with extreme earnestness to one of my colleagues , that he would prefer war to the abandonment even of the county of Glatz as the price at which the Duchies might be // annexed . In short , then , I perceive a considerable modification in the disposition of public opinion in Prussia ; but if it has ceased to be openly hostile , it is not yet sufficiently favorable to justify us in neglecting to proceed with the utmost circumspection . Notwithstanding these facts and the general considerations which would lead them to seek our support , they do not forget that Prussia has no reason to dread the ambition of other powers , and that in France there is prevalent a desire to conquer the , left bank of the Rhine . This conviction holds men on the alert , and keeps them from rendering to the Emperor without reserve the justice which is his due , and which the blindness of a narrow patriotism , no less than political passions and party prejudices , have up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days later than the date of this despatch that there appeared in the Mioniteur a letter written by Napoleon to his Foreign Minister , M. Dronyn de Lhuys . It was evidently intended as an expression of imperial policy . While the Emperor in substance declared that France would hold herself strictly neutral , he said that if the matter in dispute had been referred to a commission , the French government would not have thought of demanding a change of boundary , except in case the settlement had been for the material advantage of one of the greater powers . This clause was at least enough to show that Napoleon had the boundary question constantly in mind . Three days later , that is to say on the 15th of June , Benedetti sent to his government the following despatch , as expressing his opinion of the spirit in which the Emperor 's letter had been received in Germany : - " The document has produced at Berlin the most lively impression ; it is at this moment the object of universal conversation . I should dissemble what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has awakened in public opinion a general feeling of apprehension . No one here can fail to see that a war can not leave the territorial state of Germany in its present condition ; and in view of the fact that the war would be fruitless for Prussia if it could not result for her in some acquisition of territory , they conclude from the language of the Emperor that his Majesty , even at the present moment , is firmly resolved to demand a territorial compensation . No one seems inclined to suppose that our frontiers can be advanced at the expense of those neutral powers which take no part in the struggle ; it will be German provinces , they add , which must be ceded to France , and the anticipation of // such an event raises , with the press and in the ranks of the opposition to the Prussian Cabinet , the most energetic recriminations. the friends of the government have flattered themselves - I do not say hat it has encouraged them - that the benevolent and disinterested neutrality of France toward Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the manner in which the Emperor looks upon the situation which it might be best to impose upon the secondary states - a manner which it would be no less essential to preserve toward Austria - has all the more surprised them , inasmuch as this method of considering the situation is irreconcilable with the provisions of the plan of federal reform designed by the Prussian government . To one and all , therefore , the letter of the Emperor seems on the one hand to repel in advance all the benefits which they hope to gain from the war , and on the other to reserve for France the right to reap any advantage which may spring out of the contingencies of the struggle . I limit myself here , of course , to observing the sentiments which the letter calls up , and to describing them as exactly as possible . These should not , however , surprise your Excellency . As I indicated to you in a former report , public opinion in Prussia is not less dominant in its ambitious views than is the government itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of arraying themselves against a modification of the map of Germany . The doctrine which represents Germany as a single power , and one that is free to regulate itself at its own will , dazzles the eyes of the less prejudiced , and they repel with indignation every idea of a transaction which might involve the loss of any portion of territory whatever . " It is unnecessary to dwell upon the great importance of these letters as showing to the French government the spirit of the German people . We should not have transcribed them at length , but for the fact that there is still lingering here and there a person who professes to believe that the French government before the war of 1866 had good reason to suppose that Prussia , in case of success , would generously reward the neutrality of France . To all such we commend the above letters . Meanwhile we will venture the query : if such was the spirit of the government and people of Prussia concerning a territorial recompense before the victory of Sadowa , what was their spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Benedetti , for the benefit of the French government and of history , thus threw upon the spirit of the German people , we are the better able to understand the story // of the projected treaty . First of all , in approaching this question it is necessary to remark that the method which Count Benedetti has up to this point pursued here forsakes him . Hitherto , instead of telling his story in a manner that might be open to suspicion , he has simply allowed the story to relate itself , through the documents which were despatched to his government . In discussing the matter of the treaty , however , instead of fortifying his positions with documentary evidence , he has contented himself with repeating the assertions which he advanced in 1870 , and with urging the inherent probabilities of their correctness . The reason which the author assigns for not publishing his letters is one which could hardly prove satisfactory to his blindest adherent . At the time when the negotiations referred to took place , the Foreign Office at Paris was vacant ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Prime Minister , M. iRouher . The correspondence , in consequence , was not regarded as in the strictest sense official , and , as it had no proper place in the portfolio of the Prime Minister , when M. Rouher came to resign he neglected to turn over these letters with his other papers to his successor . If any one is inclined to ask why this circumstance should prevent Benedetti from publishing the needed letters , the answer is , that there is no possible method by which the reader could compare them with the originals , and that the author is so scrupulous that he will not introduce as authority a single document the correctness of which might not be verified . After making this flimsy apology for the nature of his argument , the author advances to the argument itself . Put into the briefest language , his declaration is that France demanded Mayence , Prussia refused , and offered Belgium instead ; France declined to annex Belgium , but asked for Luxemburg , and to this Prussia would not agree . In all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck on every point connected with the negotiation . Now if all this were true , what should be thought of the audacious effrontery of the Prussian Chancellor ? According to such a supposition , Bismarck must not only have known that it was true , but also must have known that Benedetti // could not fail to have at his disposal the means of proving it true before the whole world . If the French version were the correct one , the matter would be reduced to this : Bismarck proposed that Belgium should be seized by France , and then , although France declined the offer , the Prussian Minister in 1870 had the audacity to assert that it was France that proposed , and Prussia that declined , and that , too , with full knowledge that Benedetti had the means of displaying his effrontery before the eyes of all men . This theory might find currency if there were anywhere to be found a considerable number of men who regard Bismarck as both a knave and an imbecile . But unfortunately for Count Benedetti 's argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascal , there are surprisingly few who think him a fool . From the time of the recriminations which followed the first publication of the proposed treaty up to the appearance of Benedetti 's volume , no effort appears to have been made by the Germans to prove the falsity of the French claims concerning its origin . It now appears , however , that Prince Bismarck has had quietly resting in his office for more than a year a bundle o*. papers that one day were to come forth for the annihilation of his foe . It would be curious to know whether he so long held his fire simply that his enemy might come up into plainer view and more conspicuous destruction , or whether the motive of his reserve was that of the lion , which lay quietly and turned tail upon the drawn sword and eloquent threats of the Knight of La Mancha . But whatever may have been the cause of Bismarck 's silence hitherto , it can not be considered strange that the new and elaborate presentation of the case by Benedetti has called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador appeared , when forth from the Prussian Bureau of Foreign Affairs came the very documents which Benedetti declares he would not publish as proof of his positions , for the reason that his transcripts could not be verified by reference to the originals . The very papers which Benedetti supposed to have been destroyed , or to be buried in the profoundest secrecy , Prince Bismarck takes from his drawer and publishes , for the purpose of showing that the story of Benedetti , from beginning to end , is a tissue of falsehoods . The // letters which passed between the French government and its ambas*ador at Berlin concerning the annexation of Belgium are now given to the world . Count Benedetti , as he did not find them at the proper office at Paris , supposed them to have been happily consigned to oblivion . It tu'rns out , however , that , with a loosei*ess so characteristic of the Empire , the papers had been left by Rouher at his private residence at Cer*ay , and that in the course of the invasion they fell into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence as is necessary to show the history of the case is published by Bismarck , October 20th , 1871 , in the Reichs-Anzeiger . In the light of these despatches we shall endeavor to present the facts as briefly as possible , though chiefly by quotations . The first letter published by Bismarck is one which was sent to the French government by Benedetti on the 5th of August , just after he had received instructions to demand for France the left bank of the Rhine . It is as follows : - " M. LE MINISTRE : On my arrival in Berlin I found the telegrnm containing the text of the secret convention , which you have directed me to present to the Prussian government . Your Excellency may rest assured that I shall neglect no means of urging the acceptance of this convention , whatever may be the resistance I am sure toencounter . Deeply convinced of the moderation of the imperial government in stipulating for securities in the event of a future nggrandizement of Prussia , I shall not easily be brought to consent to modifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of submitting them to you . In this transaction I believe firmness to be the best , if not the only , argument to be employed . I shall therefore leave no doubt as to my determination to decline unacceptable proposals , taking good care , however , to prove that in refusing to us the guaranties we require , in case of Prussian aggrandizement , the Berlin Cabinet would be slighting the demands of justice and prudence , and also giving us an insight into the extent of its ingratitude . Considering what the temper of the Prussian Prime Minister is , and wishing to set to work as cautiously as possible , I thought it as well not to be present the moment when the certainty that we ask the Rhine , inclusive of Mayence , is distinctly realized by him . I have , therefore , sent him this morning a copy of your draft , accompanying it with a letter , of which I transmit a copy . I shall endeavor to see him to-morrow , and shall communicate in what mood I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was succeeded by an interview , as the ambassador had anticipated . He declares that Count Benedetti warmly and resolutely pressed the French demands . When the Prussian Prime Minister observed that such a demand meant war , and that Count Benedetti had better go to T*aris to prevent a rupture , the latter responded that he would , indeed , return home , but only to recommend the Emperor to maintain a proposition the abandonment of which might imperil the existence of his dynasty . The parting words of the Prussian Chancellor to Count Benedetti , before he set out for Paris , as nearly as the former could remember them , were these : - " Please call his Majesty 's attention to this . Should a war arise out of this complication , it might be a war attended with a revolutionary crisis . In such a case the German dynasties are likely to prove more solid than that of the Emperor Napoleon . " After this conversation Count Benedetti returned to Paris . On the 12th of August the Emperor 's letter was published , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayence questior* was thus disposed of , that the Belgian project was brought forward . This was done through the means of a letter dated the 16th of August , which M. Chauvy brought to Count Benedetti from Paris , and which contained an " accurate and precise abstract " of his instructions . This letter of instructions contains the gist of the whole matter , and settles the whole question in dispute . The instructions were as follows : - " 1 . Negotiations are to preserve an amicable character . " 2 . The negotiations must be strictly confidential . " ( Then follows a list of the persons to whom the confidence of the ambassador is to be confined. ) " 3 . In proportion to the chance of success , our demands will have to be graduated as follows : In the first place , you have to combine into one proposition the recovery of the frontiers of 1814 and th' annexation of Belgium . You have , therefore , to ask for the extradition , by formal treaty , of Landau , Snarlonis , Saarbriick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim at the annexation of Belgium by the conclusion of an offensive and defensive treaty , which is to be kept secret . Secondly , should this basis appear to promise no result , you // will resign Saarlouis , SaarbrUck , and even Landau , which , after all , is but a dilapidated nest of a place , the occupation of which might excite German national feeling against us . In this eventuality , your public agreement will be confined to the Duchy of Luxemburg , and your secret treaty to the reunion of Belgium with France . Thirdly , in case a clear and unmistakable reference to the incorporation of Belgium should be found unpalatable , you are authorized to assent to a clause in which , to obviate the intervention of England , Antwerp is declared a free city . In no case , however , are you permitted to allow the reunion of Antwerp with Holland , or the incorporation of Maestriel*t with Prussia . Should Herr Von Bismarck put the question , what alvantage would accrue to him from such a treaty ? the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful ally , that he would consolidate his recent acquisitions , that he was only desired to conse ' *t to the cession of what does not belong to him , and that he makes no sacrifice in any way to be compared with his gains . To sum up , ( lie minimum we require is an ostensible treaty which gives us Luxemburg , and a secret treaty which , stipulating frr an offensive and defensive alliance , leaves us the Opportunity of annexing Belgium at the ri*qhit moment , Prussia engaging to assist us , if necessary , by force of arms , in carrying out this purpose . " These instructions , which bore the date of August 16th , were answered by Count Benedetti on the 23d of the same month . The reply is declared by Bismarek to be , " like so many other interesting documents of the same kind , " in the handwriting of Benedetti . It is now in possession of the German Foreign Office . It contains a draft , also in Benedetti 's hand , conceived in strict accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sundry amendments , added in another hand at Paris . The revision agrees perfectly with the famous project published by Count Bismarek last year . In a letter accompanying the draft of August 23d Benedetti explained the reason of some modification which he had ventured to make . Landau and Saarbriick had been omitted . He assured the government that he had had occasion to convince himself that they wotild encounter insuperable difficulties were they to insist upon those places . He had accordingly kept himself to Luxemburg and Belgium . He also had deemed it best to have a single treaty instead of two . To this letter of Benedetti 's there is also in the hands of the // Germans a rough sketch of the reply . It is written on official paper , and shows that Benedetti 's draft had made a favorable impression . It alludes to the necessity of indemnifying Holland for the loss of Luxemburg by means of Prussian territory . It considers the pecuniary sacrifices that might be necessary in carrying out the treaty . It asserts that the right to garrison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in Southern Germany would be incompatible with the independence of the South German States . It renounces Landau and Saarbriick , but says that Prussia is expected to perform an act of courtesy by destroying their fortifications and divesting them of their threatening character . It repeats the declaration that the acquisition of Luxemburg is the immediate object of the convention , and the annexation of Belgium its ulterior aim . Then follows this passage - " It is obvious that the extension of the supremacy of Prussia across the Main will , as a matter of course , compel us to seize Belgium . But the same necessity may be brought on by other events , on which subject we must reserve to ourselves the exclusive right to judge . In this respect the clear and exact wording of the draft is of inestiniable value This combination reconciles all parties . By giving us an immediate satisfaction and setting people on the right track in regard to the disposal of Belgium , it quiets public opinion in France . It maintains secrecy concerning the alliance as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxemburg had better be concealed until after we lay hands on Belgium* I should be obliged by your giving your reasons in detail . You will pciceive that to suspend the beginning of operations for an indefinite time might result in bringing the Belgian question to a premature close . " To this communication from Paris Benedetti wrote a reply on the 29th of August . Now for the first time he expressed a doubt whether France could count upon the sincerity of Prussia . He thought that Bismarck suspected France of attempting to sow discord between England and Germany . He refers to the mission of General Manteuffel at St. Petersburg , and expresses the fear that Prussia has received assurances from another quarter , " which will enable her to dispen*e with the countenance of France . " He states that Bismarck professes to have told the king that Prussia must have the assistance of one // grbat power . Should the co-operation of France be declined , it will be solely for the reason that the Berlin Cabinet is otherwise provided for , or hopes soon to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain state of affairs , he had determined to go to Carlsbad , as he had been authorized to do in case he should deem it necessary . It was during the absence of Benedetti here referred to that the Prussian Prime Minister left Berlin for his summer resort , to return only in the month of December . Secret negotiations were thus suspended . They were , however , resumed in the following summer ; but as documentary evidence is not given by Prince Bismarck , it is to be presumed that the letters which were at that time exchanged between Paris and Berlin were not at Rouher 's residence at the time of the invasion . Prince Bismarck closes his chapter of revelations in the following characteristic manner : - " But we have no wish to indulge in disclosures beyond those imperatively required for defensive purposes . We abcordingly confine our selves b to the correcting of statements which miaht occasion erroneous ideas in regard to German politics . Until forced to resume this task , we shall resist the temptation to make a more unreserved use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather the challenge with which Prince Bismarck thus closed his letter has not been accepted by Count Benedetti . The ambassador has not denied the genuineness of the documents . On the contrary , he is represented as expending his indignation upon his old friends , that they neglected to inform him of the captures of Cer*ay . It is scarcely necessary to dwell in detail upon the motives which prompted Count Benedetti to enter upon this course of misrepresentation . The first publication of the Projet de Trait6 in 1870 placed France in a trying position . The ambassador knew that some , at least , in France , would regard his word as of equal value with that of Bismarck . He knew , moreover , that the Prussian government had no means of proving the falseness of his allegations . He therefore determined to array his assertion against that of his enemy . Having once entered upon the path of misrepresentation , there was now left him the choice of either confessing his falsehood or // pushing forward , concealing and inventing as there might seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to destroy the . documents which , in the interest of France , ought never to see the light , it was not difficult for him to decide upon his course . He wrote a narrative that is full of indignant virtue . He offered to the world a satisfactory account of all that happened in the matter . He carefully concealed all that could be arrayed against him . He omitted to publish his correspondence . Finally , with a grand climax of audacity , he assigns , as a reason for such omission , a virtuous unwillingness to bring forward a single witness which could not be cross-examined , when in fact he well knew that , if those witnesses were to be brought upon the stand , it would be for his instant destruction . We can not but add that , even if ingenuous , the motive which he assigned for his reserve would pass for what Horace so well characterized as pudens prave ; as the truth has been revealed , there seems to be more than " poetic justice " in the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The historic value of the papers published by Prince Bismarck is written upon their face . They show that , although , as we have seen , Benedetti faithfully warned his government that it could get nothing at the hands of the Germans , France began by demanding the powerful fortresses of Mayence and Landau , and ended by acquiescing in getting nothing . In the light of these facts the remarkable activity of the imperial government in reorganizing its army during 1867 - 68 has a new significance . The meaning of that great military activity can now be understood by everybody ; previously it was apprehended by the French and Prussian Cabinets alone . Of Benedetti 's account of his mission , fully one half is devoted to that portion of his career which follows what we have been considering . The value of this part of the volume , however , consists chiefly in the light which it throws upon two or three questions hitherto regarded as unsettled . Many of the friends of Napoleon have insisted that his government was not properly informed concerning the military strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in entire ignorance of the relations of Prussia with the other powers of Europe . // Still others , actuated by kindred motives , have made it current that in the final negotiations at Ems , just before the late war , Count Benedetti bungled everything which he touched , and that at the last moment the French*nation , in the person of its ambassador , was insulted beyond the proper bounds of endurance . On each of these questions the volume before us sheds abundant light . When the preliminaries of peace were signed at Versailles , it first became publicly known that France had nothing to hope from Russia . The nation then learned that Prussia and the Northern Empire entertained most cordial relations with each other . It was learned with universal surprise . Recriminations ensued . The keenest shafts were discharged at Benedetti . The Journal des De'bats declared that the treaty between the Czar and the Prussian king , which inflicted so much misery upon the French people , had been formed under the eyes of the French Ambassadors at Berlin and St. Petersburg , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . To these charges Count Benedetti 's answer is distinct and conclusive . He shows , by frequent extracts from his despatches , that he had informed his government fully in regard to the whole progress of the negotiations . As early as the 9th of April , 1866 , when the negotiations concerning the Italian Treaty were pending , he had given his chief a preliminary warning by remarking that he had always noted with surprise the indifference with which the Cabinet at St. Petersburg had looked upon the aggrandizement of Prussia , as well as the security which Bismarek had manifested in regard to the relations of Prussia and the Empire of the North . On the 8th of August , three days after France had presented her demand for Mayence , Benedetti telegraphed to Paris that General ManteuffeL had just been called from his command at Frankfort , in order to go on a mission to St. Petersburg . On the 5th of January , 1868 , in a letter which occupies twenty pages of his volume , M. Benedetti reviewed the relations of Prussia with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter shows an unusually clear comprehension of the various international relations of the different governments . In speaking of Russia , he calls attention to the fact that the moment it became cer // 9 h*V 0 tam France was to demand an extension of her frontiers , Prussia had despatched a most skilful agent to St. Petersburg . From the time of his arrival Alexander had not ceased to observe in his relations with Prussia an attitude that was manifestly benevolent . The ambassador furthermore relates , that the Russian envoy at Berlin , in evident alarm at the arming of Germany , had suddenly paid a visit to St. Petersburg , but that he had returned perfectly assured , and with no further apprehension . After narrating other circumstances which confirm his belief , Benedetti closes this portion of his letter by declaring that " these facts demonstrate that there exists a cordial understanding between St. Petersburg and Berlin . " We need only add , that since the publication of this letter , it can not be claimed that France was not duly instructed as to what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . But the accusation which Count Benedetti repels with most energy is that in regard to his failure to inform his government concerning the military strength of the Germans . Before quoting from his letters , he refers to the annual statements made by his government to the Corps Legislatif . He calls attention to the fact that the Emperor appealed annually to the Chambers for such legislation as would warrant the government in putting the army on a footing equal to that of the army of Prussia . He declares that the government was perfectly informed , and that Napoleon vainly multiplied his endeavors to enlighten the country . He asserts that all these efforts were stubbornly resisted by the mass of the nation ; and that when the people saw their country overrun by the enormous forces of the German armies , forgetting everything , they sought an outlet for their anger and their pride by attributing their misfortunes to the negligence or the incapacity of their diplomatic agents . Benedetti does not , however , stop to point out the dilemma to which his assertions bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but ask , of the statesmanship of a ruler who knows the strength of his enemy to be considerably greater than his own , and who yet manages in such a manner as to encourage hi* subjects in drawing him into a mortal combat ? But however damaging to the French government such a position may be , the author sustains his assertions with proofs that are conclusive. // On the 25th of August , 1866 , he sends to his government a long letter , which he now prints in full , giving an elaborate account of all the branches of the German army . For still more minute details he refers to the accompanying report of his military attach* , and concludes by asserting that if the organization contemplated is completed , " the Cabinet of Berlin will have at its disposal more than a million of men . " On the 18th of October following he informs his government that the organization proposed at Berlin had been adopted . One week later , and again on the 18th of December , the imperial government was assured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full force , and that in the conquered territories the rules of the Prussian service were in process of rapid introduction . About a month later a letter was despatched containing such specific words as these : - " Without recurring to what I have already had the honor to submit , I do not believe it superfluous to repeat that the Administration of War continues exercising the greatest activity . It is carrying out without relaxation the constitution of the new Corps d'Arm4e , and it is pressing the other states of the Confederation to take , without delay , the steps which the organization of the federal army requires . It is evident , and such , too , is the opinion of our military attaclid , that they hold it as of the very highest importance to place themselves in a condition to confront any eventuality . " Nor was this all . Nearly a year later , January 5 , 1868 , the ambassador recurred to the same subject . In the first place he showed that , in the event of war , France would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers to Prussia . He then reverted to the condition of the German armies . The key-note of this portion of the despatch was in its opening words : - " The more I observe the conduct of the Prussian government , the more I am persuaded that all its efforts tend to extend its power over the whole of Germany . I am each day more convinced that it is pursuing success in this direction , with the conviction that it can not attain its end without making it impossible for France to place any obstacle in the way . How and by what means it seeks to obtain this twofold result is what I ask permission to explain to you to-day , by recalling and uniting in a general view the different items of information which I have already had the honor of transmitting . " // On the subject of military strength , the writer then proceeded to show how the Prussian government had gained possession of the different resources of the country ; how , after the last war , three new corps had been formed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been formed with Bavaria , Wiirtemberg , and Baden ; how still another engagement had been signed with Hesse and all the smaller states , by which their troops formed a part of the Prussian army ; and finally , how by the law which voted the contingent for five years , the last requisite had been complied with for placing all the resources of Germany at the call and the pleasure of Prussia . Then , too , in regard to the purposes of Prussia his opinions are fully expressed . Perhaps this is the most valuable portion of his letter , for , while he warns France against the strength - of Prussia , he informs her that Prussia has no spirit of aggression . He shows that , though the King had gathered in strength from every quarter , at home and abroad , until his resources were enormous , he had evidently no intention of using them save for the purpose of compelling other nations to respect the right of Germany to control her own political affairs .

If we are not to accept it , let us prepare for war without respite . Let us study well in advance what agreement can be made with Austria .

In this letter he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and called attention to the fact that Prince Leopold of Hoheuzollern had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Spanish throne .

Benedetti relates that his Majesty terminated the interview by summing up thus : - " The candidature of the Duke of Montpensier is purely anti-dynastic . It injures no one but myself , and I can accept it . The candi // dature of the Prince of Hohenzollern is essentially anti-national . The country will not allow it , it must be prevented . " Inspired by such instructions , Count Benedetti returned to Berlin . But a few days later he had an interview with Bismarck , and interrogated him in regard to the current report concerning the candidature of Leopold . The response of the Prussian Minister was deemed inconclusive , and therefore unsatisfactory . It was in substance that the Prussian government , as such , knew nothing of the candidature whatever . Bismarck declined to make a positive declaration in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be called upon to take positive action . He dwelt upon the difficulties which Leopold would have to contend with , and apparently desired to leave the impression that the Prince would not accept it , even if there should be no obstacle in the way . He declared that Prince Frederic Charles would have risked the venture , but that he was a Protestant , and although a gallant and distinguished officer , he had never shown any aptness in politics , and therefore the matter was out of the question . When pressed further on the same subject , he declined to inform his interlocutor whether the candidature of Prince Frederic Charles had been seriously considered . Thus the interview by which Benedetti sought information failed to afford any positive enlightenment . But the affair for a time was here dropped . The king went to Ems , Bismarck to Wartzin , and Leopold to his home at Dusseldorf . From the time of the above letter ( May 11 , 1869 ) , it was more than a year before the subject of the iloheuzollern candidature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this early correspondence is given by Benedetti merely for the purpose of showing that he was not guilty of that aveugle negligence of which he has been so loudly acdused. * At one point , however , * It is of interest to notice the effect of this interval of diplomatic inaction on the armament of France . On the 21St of March following the conversation here narrated Benedetti wrote home that the people of Berlin were " pretending " that the armaments of France were no longer purely defensive , and that in consequence there was considerable public agitation . He wrote further that Bismarek had assured him that the king had taken the trouble to write four letters on the l ) receding day , calling attention to information which he had received on the same suhjcct. // his defence is quite imperfect . Although he shows that he was fully awake to the importance of the affair in its earliest history , it appears that he was quite ignorant of the negotiations which subsequently led to Leopold 's acceptance . He is clearly of the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the king and his minister were at their summer retreats . The conjecture is no doubt correct ; but is is also true that Leopold solicited the consent of the king , and that the latter , acting as chief of the family , did not deem himself called upon to withhold it . Of this fact Benedetti seems to have been in entire ignorance up to the moment when he was ordered to Ems . It was on the 7th of July , the day after the French Minister of War , Gramont , had set all France on fire by his speech in the Corps Legislatif , that Benedetti received a telegram ordering him to repair at once to Ems . Arriving on the following day , he received his instructions , which had been sent from Paris by special courier . His orders were definite , and had been summed up by Gramont himself in these words : " Efforcez-vous d'obtenir que sa Majest6 conseille an Prince de Hoheuzollern de revenir sur son acceptation . " On the 9th Benedetti was admitted to an audience with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps an insuperable difficulty , in the way of a literal fulfilment of his mission . The king declared that his consent to the candidature had been asked , and that he had granted it ; he could not in honor therefore withdraw that consent , unless Leopold should again take the initiative and retract his acceptance . In case the Prince should think it best to withdraw from the candidature , the king was free to say that such a withdrawal would meet with his consent and approval . Under no circumstances , however , could he be persuaded to dictate or interfere in an affair for which Spain and the Prince were wholly responsible . And yet , as he had given his consent in the capacity of chief of the Hohenzollerns , and as France took exceptions to the candidature , he was willing , in the same capacity , to consult with the Prince and the father of the Prince in regard to a withdrawal . This course , however , was not quite acceptable to the French , inasmuch as it necessitated some delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common possession of no cipher by means of which they could make use of the telegraph . When Benedetti urged the necessity of immediate decision , the king responded , that if the French government persisted in pushing matters to an extreme issue before he could hear from Sigmaringen , he should be compelled to regard it as evidence of a desire to provoke war . On the whole Benedetti seems to have thought that the king was dealing in a reasonable and rational manner , especially as Prussia , so far as he was able to ascertain , was making no preparation whatever for war . But to the government at Paris the king 's answer was wholly unsatisfactory . Gramont wrote there must be no delay . He declared that in case the answer was not immediate and satisfactory , they must be ready to enter upon the campaign within fifteen days . It seemed to be of far greater importance that Prussia should not get a day 's start , than that peace should be preserved . Meanwhile public opinion at Paris , which at first had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was advancing at such a mad rate that it would soon be beyond control . Indeed , it was already beyond control . Already there came surging up to the throne that hoarse cry of the French people which has so often driven the government before it into measures as fatal as extravagant . As everybody knows , the withdrawal of Leopold from the candidature was in due time announced . This withdrawal was first communicated to the French government from Madrid , even before it was known to the king of Prussia . It proved , however , unsatisfactory to the French people . Gramont wrote that , notwithstanding the renunciation which was now known , the public agitation was sucl that they feared they should not be able to control it . In fact , the cry " Au Rhin ! " had become irresistible . Accordingly , the very same despatch which conveyed to Ems the first news of the renunciation , conveyed also the demand that the king should engage that if , at any future time , Prince Leopold should change his mind , the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communicating to the king the will of his government , Benedetti sought an immediate audience . As William had not yet heard of the renunciation , and as he had // 1872 . The German Mission of Count Benedetti. engaged to inform the ambassador the instant he should receive word from Sigmaringen , his curiosity was somewhat moved by the urgency of Benedetti 's request for an audience . Although , therefore , an audience had been appointed for the afternoon , the king , chancing in the morning to see Benedetti on a promenade , approached him at once , and there learned the desire of the French government . The king 's answer was immediate and decisive . He positively refused to make the declaration demanded . After a protracted conference , he brought the interview to a close by declaring that in this , as in all such cases , he must reserve to himself the right to consult circumstances . The next morning the king received the response of Prince Leopold . As there was no further occasion for an interview with the French Ambassador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the candidature was withdrawn , and that the king approved of the withdrawal . On the following day the ambassador took formal leave of his Majesty at the railway station , as they were on the point of departing , the one for Paris , the other for Berlin . Benedetti declares that in all these negotiations the utmost courtesy had been maintained . The story of the " insult " he emphatically denies , and declares that it never originated either with himself or with his government . It was doubtless a mere war-cry , and is to be consigned to the limbo of the " fable " of Captain Jenkins 's ears . In surveying the diplomatic career of Count Benedetti , we can not resist the conviction that he performed the parts which were , from time to time , assigned to him with considerably more than ordinary ability . In saying this , we do not forget that his declarations concerning the Belgian controversy suggest a facility in falsehood which it is by no means pleasant to contemplate . It is quite likely that against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cannon-balls . But it must be remembered that " love your enemies* ' has not yet found a place in the accepted ethics of diplomacy . As a purveyor of intelligence to his own government , Benedetti was active and discriminating . In the most trying moments of his mission he carried out his instructions to the letter . He succeeded in securing the renunciation of the Hohenzollern candidature , and // it was only when additional and impossible conditions were imposed , that he was unsuccessful . That he failed to bring about a peaceful solution was no fault of his intelligence or his fidelity , but rather the fault of the nation which he served . We say the nation , and by it we mean both the government and the people , for they goaded each other on to common disaster . That the government was the first to raise the war-cry , we think is clearly shown by the Emperor 's instructions to Benedetti , and by the infamous address of the Duke of Gramont . We doubt if there was any possible way of maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets of Paris . From that moment there was to be either foreign war or revolution . The excitement was so intense that the dynasty was threatened , and Napoleon was obliged , at least , to seem to lead public opinion , when , in fact , he was swept along before it . After reading the despatches which were addressed to him by his ambassador at Berlin , it is impossible not to believe that he knew the risk he was running . But his crown was in peril , and his only hope of saving it was in throwing himself upon the mad current of popular opinion . 0 . K. ADAMS .
