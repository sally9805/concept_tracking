ALFRED TENNYSON . IN TWO PARTS : PART II . IN the year 1851 , Tennyson received the laurel , and almost immediately was called upon by the national sentiment to exercise the functions of his poetic office . The " Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington " was the first , and remains the most ambitious , of his patriotic lyrics . This tribute to the " last great Englishman " may fairly be pronounced equal to the occasion ; a respectable performance for Tennyson , a strong one for another poet . None but a great artist could have written it , yet it is scarcely a great poem , and certainly , though Tennyson 's most important ode , is not comparable with his predecessor 's lofty discourse upon the " Intimations of Immortality . " Several passages have become folk-words , such as " 0 good gray head which all men knew ! " and " This is England 's greatest son ,  - -  He that gained a hundred fights , Nor ever lost an English gun but the ode , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and refrains after the manner of Dryden , in which rhetoric often is substituted for imagination and richness of thought . The laureate never has been at ease in handling events of the day . To his brooding and essentially poetic nature such matters seem of no more moment , beside the mysteries of eternal beauty and truth , than was the noise of catapults and armed men to Archimedes studying out problems during the city 's siege . If he succeeds at all with them , it is by sheer will and workmanship . Even then his voice is hollow , and his didacticism , as in " Maud , " artificial and insincere . The laurel , and the fame which now had come to him , seemed for a time to bring him more in sympathy with his countrymen , and he made an honest endeavor to rehearse their achievements in his song . The result , seen in the volume 11/and and otker Poems , illustrates what I say . Here are contained his prominent occasional-pieces , " The Charge of the Light Brigade , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume takes its name . After several revisions , the Balaklavan lyric has passed into literature , but ranks below the nobler measures of Drayton and Campbell . Maud , " however , with its strength and weakness , has divided public opinion more than any other of the author 's works . I think that his judicious students will not demur to my opinion that it is quite below his other sustained productions ; rather , that it is not sustained at all , but , while replete with beauties , weak and uneven as a whole  --  and that this is due to the poet 's having gone outside his own nattire , and to his surrender of the joy of art , in an effort to l ) produce something that should at once catch the favor of the multitude . Maud " is scanty in theme , thin in treatment , poor in thought ; but has musical episodes , with much fine scenery and diction . It is a greater medley than " The Princess , " shifting from vague speculations to passionate outbreaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all intermixed with cheap satire , and conspicuous for affectations unworthy of the poet . The pity of it was that this production appeared when Tennyson suddenly had become fashionable , in England and America , through his accession to the laureate 's honors , and for this reason , as well as for its theme and eccentric qualities , had a wider reading than his previous works ; nor only among the masses , to whom the other volumes had been sealed books , but among thoughtful people , who now first made the poet 's acquaintance and received " Maud " as the foremost example of his style . First impressions are lasting , and to this day Tennyson is // deemed , by many of the latter class , an apostle of tinsel and affectation . In our own country especially , his popular reputation began with " Maud "  --  a work which , for lack of constructive beauty , is the opposite of his other narrative poems . A pleasing feature of the volume of a855 was an idyl , " The Brook , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful to every reader . A winsome , novel stauzaic form , possibly of the laureates own invention , is to be found in " The Daisy , " and in the Horatian lines to his friend Maurice . Here , too , is much of that felicitous wordpainting for which he is deservedly re-nowned : " 0 Milan , 0 the chanting quires , The giant windows ' blazon 'd fires , The height , the space , the gloom , the glory ! A mount of marble , a hundred spires ! * * * " How faintly-flush 'd , how phantom-fair , Was Monte Rosa , hanging there A thousand shadowy-pencilid valleys And snowy dells in a golden air . " We come at last to Tennyson 's master work , so recently brought to a completion after the labor of twenty years-during which period the separate Idyis of the King had appeared from time to time . Nave amd transept , aisle after aisle , the Gothic minster has extended , until , with the addition of a cloister here and a chapel yonder , the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first expected to compose an epic . It has grown insensibly , under the hands of one man who has given it the best years of his lifebut somewhat as Wolf conceives the Homeric poems to have grown , chant by chant , until the time came for the whole to be welded together in heroic form . Yet in other great epics the action rarely ceases , the links are connected , and the move . ment continues from day to day until the end . Here , we have a series of idyls-like the tapestry-work illustrations of a romance , scene after scene , with much change of actors and emotions , yet all leading to one solemn and tragic close . It is the epic of chivalry ,  --  the christian ideal of chivalry which we have deduced from a barbaric source ,  --  our conception of what knighthood should be , rather than what it really was ; but so skillfully wrought of high imaginings , faery spells , fantastic legends and medieval splendors , that the whole work , suffused with the Tennysonian glamour of Vor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated by saintly hands , and often blazes with light like that which flashed from the holy wizard 's book when the covers were unclasped . And , indeed , if this be not the greatest narrative-poem since " Paradise Lost , " what other English production are you to name in its place ? Never so lofty as the grander portions of Milton 's epic , it is more evenly sustained and has no long prosaic passages ; while " Paradise Lost " is justly declared to be a work of superhuman genius impoverished by dreary wastes of theology . Tennyson early struck a vein in the black-letter compilation of Sir Thomas Malory . A tale was already fashioned to his use , from which to derive his legends and exalt them with whatsoever spiritual meanings they might require . The picturesqu*e qualities of the old Anglo-Breton romance fascinated his youth , and found lyrical expression in the wierd , melodious , Pre-Raphaelite ballad of " The Lady of Shalott . " The young poet here attained great excellence in a walk which Rossetti and his pupils have since chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level with their masterpieces . They make success in this direction their highest aim , while Tennyson would not be restricted even to such attractive work , but went steadily on , claiming the entire field of imaginative research as the poet 's own . His strong allegorical bent , evinced in that early lyric , was heightened by analysis of the Arthurian legends . The English caught this tendency , long since , from the Italians ; the Elizabethan era was *o charged with it , that the courtiers of the Virgin Queen hardly could speak without a mystical double-meaning-for an illustration of which read the dialogue in certain portions of Kingsley 's Amyas Leigh . From Sidney and Spenser down to plain John Bunyan , and even to Sir Walter Scott , allegory is a natural English mode ; and , while adopted in several of Tennyson 's pieces , finds a special development in the " Idyls of the King . " The name thus bestowed upon the early installments of this production seems less adapted to its complete form . Like the walls of Troy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud that gathered shape . The shape no longer is idyllic , and doubt no longer exists whether a successful epic // can be written in a mature period of national literature . We have one here , but subdivided into ten distinct poems , each of which suits the canonical requirement , and may be read at a single sitting . To my mind , there is a marked diffeience in style between the original and later portions of this work . The " Morte d Arthur " of 1842 is Homeric to the farthest degree possible in the slow , Saxon movement of the verse ; grander , with its " hollow oes and aes , " than any succeeding canto , always excepting " Guinevere . " Nor do I think the later idyls equal to those four which first were issued in one volume , and which so cleared the laureate 's fame from the doubts suggested by " Maud and Other Poems . " " Vivien " is a bold and subtle analysis , a closer study of certain human types than Tennyson is wont to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness and absolute beauty of narrative and rhythm , dearest to the heart of maiden , youth , or sage . " Enid , " while upon the lower level of " Pelleas and Ettarre " and " Gareth and Lynette , " is clear and strong , and shows a freedom from mannerism characteristic of the author 's best period . It would seem that his creative vigor reached its height during the composition of these four idyls ; certainly , since the production of " Enoch Arden , " at an early subsequent date , he has not advanced in freshness and imagination . His greatest achievement still is that noblest of modern episodes , the canto entitled Guinevere , " surcharged with tragic pathos and high dramatic power . He never has so reached the *czssio vera of the early dramatist as in this imposing scene . There is nothing finer in modern verse than the interview between Arthur and his remorseful wife ; nothing loftier than the speech beginning Lo ! I forgive thee , as Eternal God Forgives : do thou for thine own soul the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved ? 0 golden hair , with which I used to play Not knowing ! 0 imperial maulded form , And beauty such as never woman wore , Until it came a kingdom 's curse with theeI can not touch thy lips , they are not mine , ButLancelot 's : nay , they never were the King 's . When this idyl first appeared , what ele*ation seized upon the soul of every poetic aspirant as he read it ! What despair of rivalling a passion so imaginative , an art so majestic and supreme ! I have referred to the Homeric manner of the fragment now made the conclusion of the epic , and entitled " The Passing of Arthur . " It is not strengthened by its new prelude , and plainly weakens at the close . The epic properly ends with the line , " And on the mere the wailing died away . " The poet 's sense of proportion here works injuriously , urging him to fully bring out the moral of his allegory , albeit the effect really is harmed by this addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work : " And the new sun rose , bringing the new year . " In conclusion , observe the technical features of " Gareth and Lynette , " a canto recently added to the poem . It displays Tennyson 's latest , not his best , manner , carried to an extreme ; the verse is clamped together , with every conjunction omitted that can be spared , yet interspersed with lines of a galloping , redundant nature , as if the laureate were somewhat influenced by Swinburne and adapting himself to a fashion of the time . A special fault is the substitution of alliteration for the simple excellence of his standard verse . This may be a concession to the modern school , or a result of . his mousing among preChaucerian ballads . It palls on the ear , as does the poet 's excessive reiteration and play upon words . I have elsewhere said that we are compensated for all this by a stalwart presentation of that fine old English which Emerson has pronounced " a stern and dreadful language . " The public is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too long forgotten , which , we trust , will hereafter maintain their ground . He is a purifier of our tongue : a resistant to the novelties of slang and affectation intruded upon our literature by the mixture of races and the extension of English-speaking colonies to every clime and continent in the world . It is not probable t , hat another sustained poem hereafter will be written upon the Arthurian legends . Milton 's dream , inconsonant with his own time and htgher aspirations , has , at last , its due fulfillment . The subject waited long , a sleeping beauty , until the " fated fairy-prince " came , woke it into life , and the spell is forever at an end . But who shall say whether future generations will rate this epic as highly as we do ; whether it will stand out like " The Faery Queene " and " Paradise Lost , " as one of the epochal compositions by which an age is symbolized . More than one poem , or series of poems ,  --  Drayton 's // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has wrongly in its own time been thought a work of this class , though now men say of it that only the shadow of its name remains . At present we have no right to declare of the " Idyls of the King , " as of " In Memoriam , " that it is so original , so representative both of the author and of his period , as to defy the dust of time . A famous life often falls short of its promise . Temperament and circumstance hedge it with obstacles ; or , perhaps , the " Fury with the abhorred shears " slits its thin-spun tissue before the decisive hour . In the case of Tennyson this has been reversed . He has advanced by regular stages to the highest office of a poet . More fortunate than Landor , he was suited to the time , and the time to his genius ; he has been happier than Keats or Shelley in length of years , and , in ease of circumstances , than Wordsworth , Coleridge or Hood . Had he djed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complete . Surely a poet 's youthful dream never was more fully realized , and we must regard the laureate 's genius as developed through good fortune to the utmost degree permitted by inherent limitations . During the growth of this epic he has , however , produced a few other poems which take high rank . Of these , " Enoch Arden , " in sustained beauty , bears a relation to his shorter pastorals similar to that existing between the epic and his minor heroic-verse . Coming within the average range of emotions , it has been very widely read . This poem is in its author 's purest idyllic style ; noticeable for evenness of tone , clearness of diction , successful description of coast and ocean ,  --  finally , for the loveliness and fidelity of its genre scenes . In study of a class below him , " hearts centered in the . sphere of common duties , " the laureate is unsurpassed . A far different creation is " Lucretius , " a brooding character with which Tennyson is quite in sympathy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly , I should conceive , wrought out the work he thought possible when the theme was first uggested to his mind . He found its limits and contented himself with portraying a gloomy , isolated figure , as strongly and subtly as Browning would have drawn it , and with a terseness beyond the latter 's art . I have already spoken of** Sea Dreams " and " Aylmer 's Field . " Among other and better pieces , " Tithonus , " " The Voyage , " a fine lyric  --  and such masterly ballads as " The Victor , " " The Captor , " and " The Sailor Boy , " will not be forgotten . It is worth while to observe the few dialect poems which Tennyson has writtenthrown off , as if merely to show that he could be easily first in a field which he resigns to others . The " Northern Farmer " ballads , old and new , are the best English dialect studies of our time . Among his minor diversions are light occasional pieces and some experiments in classical measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given no further attention . He saw that " Boadicea " offered no such field as that afforded by the Arthurian legends , and wisely gave it over . Again , he unquestionably could have made a great blank-verse translation of Homer , but chose the better part in devoting his middle life solely to creative work . The world can ill afford to lose a poet 's golden prime in the labors of a translator . Ii . A BRIEF and crowded summary of Tennyson 's characteristics is all that we are able to attempt : proffering clues to what might be said on each division of the subject , and not seeking to follow any path at length . The complete and even balance of the laureate 's poetry is from first to last conspicuous . It exhibits that just combination of lyrical elements which makes a symphony , wherein it is difficult to say what quality predominates . Reviewing minor poets , we think this one attractive for the wild flavor of his unstudied verse ; another , for the gush and music of his songs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in Tennyson we have the strong repose of art , whereof ,  --  as of the perfection of nature ,  --  the world is slow to tire . It has become conventional , but remember that nothing endures to the point of conventionalism which is not based upon lasting rules ; that it once was new and refreshing , and is sure , in future days , to regain the early charm . The one thing longed for , and most frequently missed , in work of this kind , is the very wilding flavor of which I speak . We are not always broad enough and elevated enough to be content with symphonic art . Guinevere wearies of Arthur . There are times when a tart apple , a crust // of bread , a bit of wild honey , are worth more to us than all the delicacies of the larder . We wish more rugged outbreaks , more impetuous discords ; we listen for the sudden irregular trill of the thicket songster . The fullness of Tennyson 's art evades the charm of spontaneity . How rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assured , strong ; but how seldom the abrupt bend , the plunge of the cataract , the thunder and the spray ! Doubtless , he has enthusiasms , but all are held in hand ; college-life , study , restraint , comfort , reverence , have done their work upon him . He is well broken , as we say of a thoroughbred-proud and true , and , though he makes few bursts of speed , keeps easily forward , and is sure to be first at the stand . We come back to the avowal that in technical excellence , as an artist in verse , Alfred Tennyson is the greatest of modern poets . Other masters , old or new , have surpassed him in special instances ; but he is the one who rarely nods , and who always finishes his verse to the extreme . Not that he is free from weaknesses : to the present day , when pushed for inspiration , he resorts to inventions as disagreeable as the affectation which repelled many healthy minds from his youthful lyrics . Faults of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set others against his close acquaintance-people who , with what a critic denominates their " eighteenth century " minds , still pay homage to the genius of Pope for merits which the laureate has in even greater excess . A question recently has been mooted , whether Milton , were he living in our time , could write " Paradise Lost ? " A no less interesting conjecture would relate to the kind of poetry that we should have from Pope , were he of Tennyson 's generation . The physical traits of the two men being so utterly at variance , no doubt many will scout my suggestion that the verse of the former might closely resemble that of the latter . Pope excelled in qualities which , mu/ads mu/am/is , are noticeable in Tennyson : finish and minute ness of detail , and the elevation of common things to fanciful beauty . Here , again , compare " The Rape of the Lock " with " The Sleeping Beauty , " and especially with " The Talking Oak . " A faculty of " saying things , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when persons needed that homely wisdom which seems trite enough in our day ) , became didacticism , in Tennyson is sweetly natural and poetic . Since the period of the " Essay on Man , " from what writer can you cull so many wise and fine proverbial phrases as from the poet who says : " T is better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all " Kind hearts are more than coronets , And simple faith than Norman blood ; " " There lives more faith in honest doubt , Believe me , than in half the creeds who puts the theory of evolution in a couplet when he sings of " one far-off divine event To which the whole creation moves ; who so tersely avows that " Knowledge comes , but Wisdom lingers ; " Things seen are mightier than things heard ; " and , again : " Old age hath yet his honor and*his toil ; " from whom else so many of these proverbs , which are not isolated , but , as in Pope 's works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse Laborious orient ivory , sphere in sphere ; " lines which record the most exquisite thrills of life : " Our spirits rushed together at the touching of the lips ; " and unforgotten similes : " Dear as remembered kisses after death ; - such beauties as these occur in multitudes , and literally make up the body of the laureate 's song . In feeling , imagination , largeness of heart and head , the diminutive satirist can enter into no comparison with our poet , but the situation is otherwise as respects finish and *moralistic power . The essence of Pope 's art was false , because it was the product of a false age ; Dryden had been his guide to the stilted heroics of the Fren*h school , which so long afterwards , Pope lending them such authority , stalked through English verse . In this day he would , like Tennyson , have found his masters among the early , natural poets , or obtained , in a direct manner , what classicism he needed , and not through Gallic filters . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope for the very characteristics which , as here shown , are conspicuous in Tennyson ; and decrying the latter , misled by that chance // acquaintance with his poetry , which is worse than no acquaintance at all . In suggestiveness Pope was singularly deficient : his constructive faculty so prevailed , that he left nothing to the reader 's fancy , but explained to the end . He had no such moods as those evoked by " Tears , idle tears , " and " Break , break , break ! " and , therefore , his verses never suggest them . In irony Tennyson would equal Pope , had he not risen above it . The man who wrote " The New Timon and the Poets , " and afterwards rebuked himself for so doing , could write another " Dunciad , " or , without resort to any models , a still more Y polished and bitter satire of his own . Tennyson 's original and fastidious art is of itself a theme for an essay . The poet who studies it may well despair ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary carelessness , trusting to make his individuality felt thereby . Its strength is that of perfection. ; its weakness , the over-perfection which marks a still-life painter . Here is the absolute sway of meter , compelling every rhyme and measure needful to the thought ; here are sinuous alliterations , unique and varying breaks and pauses , winged flights and falls , the glory of sound and color-everywhere present , or if missing , absent of the poet 's free will . Art so complex was not possible until centuries of literature had passed , and an artist could overlook the field , essay each style , and evolve a metrical result , which should be to that of earlier periods what the music of Meyerbeer and Rossini is to the narrower range of Piccini or Gluck . In Tennyson 's artistic conscientiousness , he is the op-. posite of that compeer who approaches him most nearly in years and strength of intellect , Robert Browning . His gift of language is not so copious as Swinburne 's , yet through its use the higher excellence is attained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me conclude my remarks upon the laureate 's art with a reference to his unfailing taste and sense of the fitness of things . This is neatly exemplified in the openings , and especially the endings , of his idyls . " Audley Court " very well illustrates what I mean . Observe , also , the beautiful dedication of his collected works to the Queen , and the solemn and faithful character-painting of the tribute to Prince Albert which forms the prelude to the Idyls of the King . The two dedications are equal to the best ever written , and each is a poem by itself . They fully sustained the wisdom of Victoria 's choice of a successor to " The laurel greener from the brows Of him that uttered nothing base . " Leaving the architecture of Tennyson 's poetry and coming to the sentiment which it seeks to express , we are struck at once by the fact that an idyllic , or picturesque , mode of conveying that sentiment is the one natural to this poet , if not the only one permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Theocritus ; and his work is greater than the Syracusan 's , because his thought and period are greater . His eyes are his purveyors ; with " wisdom at their entrance quite shut out " he would be helpless . To use the lingo of the phrenologists , his locality is better than his individuality . He does not , like Browning , catch the secret of a master-passion , nor , like the old dramatists , the very life of action ; on the contrary he gives us an ideal picture of an ideal person , but set against a background more tangible than other artists can draw-making the accessories , and even the atmosphere , convey the meaning of his poem . As we study his verse , and the sound and color of it enter our souls , we think with him , we partake of his feeling , and are led to regions which he finds himself unable to open for us except in this suggestive way . The fidelity of his accessories is peculiar to the time : realistic , without the Flemish homeliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a riper art . This idyllic method is not that of the most inspired poets and the most impassioned periods . But , merely as a descriptive writer , who is so delightful as Tennyson ? He has the unerring first touch , which in a single line proves the artist ; and it justly has been remarked that there is more true English landscape in many an isolated stanza of " In Memoriam " than in the whole of " The Seasons , " - that vaunted descriptive poem of a former century . A paper has been written upon the Lincolnshire scenery depicted in his poems , and we might have others , just as well , upon his marine or highland views . He is a born observer of physical nature , and , whenever he applies an adjective to some object , or passingly alludes to some phenomenon which others have not noted , is almost infallibly correct . Possibly he does this too methodically , but his opponents can not deny that his out-door rambles are guided // by their eloquent apostle 's " Lamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his abundant gifts . They are indicated , first , by a style pronounced to the degree of mannerism , and , secondly , by no mere disinclination , but positive incapacity , for dramatic work of the genuine kind . XVith respect to his style , it may be said that Tennyson ,  --  while objective in the variety of his themes , and in ability to separate his own experience from their development ,  --  is the most subjective of poets in the distinguishable flavor of his language and rhythm . Reading him you might not guess his life and story  --  the reverse of which is true with Byron , whom I take as a familiar example of the subjective in literature ; nevertheless , it is impossible to observe a single line , or an entire specimen , of the laureate 's poems , without feeling that they are in the handwriting of the same master , or of some disciple who has caught his fascinating and contagious style . I speak of his second limitation , with a full knowledge that many claim a dramatic crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tithonus , " " St. Simeon Stylites " - for the poet of the Round Tabk and the Holy Grail . But isolated studies are not sufficient : a group of living men and women is necessary to broad dramatic action . Tennyson forces his characters to adapt themselves to preconceived , statuesque ideals of his own . His chief success is with those in humble life ; in " Enoch Arden , " and elsewhere , he has very sweetly depicted the emotions of simple natures , rarely at a sublime height or depth of passion . He also draws ,  --  with an easy touch occasionally found in the prose of the author of " The Warden , "  --  a group of sturdy , refined , comfortable fellows upon their daily rambles , British and modern in their wholesome talk . But the true dramatist instinctively portrays either exceptional characters , or ordinary beings in impassioned and extraordinary moods . This Tennyson rarely essays to do , except when presenting imaginary heroes of a visioned past . A great master of contemplative , descriptive , or lyrical verse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we call dramatic , and often gives us a series of marvelous tableaux in lieu of exalted speech and deeds . This lack of individuality is somewhat due to the influence of the period ; largely , also , to the habit of solitude which the poet has chosen to indulge . His life has been passed among his books , or in the seclusion of rural haunts ; when in town , in the company of a few chosen friends . This has heightened his tendency to revery , and unfitted him to sharply distinguish between men and men . The great novelists of our day , who correspond to the dramatists of a past age , have plunged into the roar of cities and the thick of the crowd , touching people closely and on every side . It must be owned that we do not find in their works that close knowledge of inanimate nature for which Tennyson has foregone " the proper study of mankind . " The one seems to curtail the other , Wordsworth 's writings being another example in point . " Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laureate , and is pleased to watch and encourage them , but always from afar . With few exceptions , then , his most poetical types of men and women are not substantial beings , but beautiful shadows , which , like the phantoms of a stereopticon , dissolve if you examine them too long and closely . His knights are the old bequest of chivalry , yet how stalwart and picturesque ! His early ideals of women are cathedral-paintings - scarcely flesh and blood , but certain attributes personified and angelical . Where a story has been made for him he is more dramatic . Arthur , Lancelot , Merlin , Guinevere , are strong , wise , or beautiful , and so we find them in the chronicle from which the poet drew his legend . He has advanced them to the requirements of modern Christianity , yet , hardly created them anew . Undoubtedly Tennyson could force himself to compose some notably dramatic work ; but only through skill and strength of purpose , in thi* age , and with his habit of life . In a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Beddoe* , Darley , Landor , have been in his own century . By sheer good fortune he flourishes in a time calling for tenderness , thought , excellent workmanship , and not for wild extremes of power . So chaste , varied and tuneful are his notes , that they are scornfully compared to piano-music , in distinction from what he himself has entitled the " God-gifted organ voice of England . " Take , however , the piano as an instrumental expression of recent musical taste , and see to what a height of execution , of capacity to give almost universal pleasure , the // art of playing it has been carried . A great pianist is a great artist ; and it is no light fame which holds , with relation to poetry , the supremacy awarded to Liszt or Schumann by the refined musicians of our time . The cast of Tennyson 's intellect is such , that his social rank , his training at an old university , and his philosophic learning , have bred in him a liberal conservatism . Increase of ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , and , while recognizing the law of progress , to make no undue effort to hasten the order of events . He sees that " the thoughts of men are widened by the process of the suns , " but is not the man to lead a reform , or to disturb the pleasant conditions in which his lot is cast . No personal wrong has allied him to the oppressed and struggling classes , yet he is too intellectual not to perceive that such wrongs exist . It must be remembered that Shakespeare and Goethe were no more heroic . Just so with his religious attitude . Reverence for beauty would of itself dispose him to love the ivied Church , with all its art , and faith , and ancestral legendary associations ; and therefore , while amply reflecting in his verse the doubt and disquiet of the age , his tranquil sense of order , together with the failure of iconoclasts to substitute any creed for that which they are breaking down , have brought him to the position of staunch Sir William Petty ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these memorable words : " As for religion , I die in the profession of that Faith , and in the practice of such Worship , as I find established by the law of my country , not being able to believe what I myself please , nor to worship God better than by doing as I would be done unto , and observing the laws of my country , and expressing my love and honor unto Almighty God by such signs and tokens as are understood to be such by the people with whom I live , God knowing my heart even without any at all . " So far as the " religion of art " is concerned , Tennyson is the most conscientious of devotees . Throughout his work we find a pure and thoughtful purpose , abhorrent of the mere licentious passi&amp;n for beauty , " Such as lurks I'n some wild poet , when he works Without a conscience or an aim. ** In my remarks upon " In Memoriam " I have shown that in one direction he readily keeps pace with the advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art appears to be that of hastening the transition of our poetic nomenclature and imagery from the old or phenomenal method , to one in accordance with knowledge and truth . His laurel is brighter for the fact that he constantly avails himself of the results of scientific discovery , without making them prosaic . This tendency ; beginning with " Locksley Hall " and " The Princess , " increases with him to the present time . If a French story-writer can make the wonders of chemistry and astronomy the basis of tales more fascinating to children than the Arabian Nights , why should not the poet explore this field for the creation of a new imagery and expression ? There is a remarkable passage in XVordsworth 's preface to the second edition of his poems ; a prophecy which , half a century ago , could only have been uttered by a man of lofty intellect and extraordinary premonition of changes even now at hand : " The objects of the Poet 's thoughts are everywhere ; t&gt;ough the eyes and senses of men are , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings . Poetry is the first and last of all knowledge-it is immortal as the heart of man . If the labors of the Men of Science should ever create any material revolution , direct or indirect , in our condition , and in the impressions which we habitually receive , the Poet will sleep then no more than at present ; he will be ready to follow the steps of the Man of Science , not only in those general indirect effects , but he will be at his side , carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of the science itself . The remotest discoveries of the Chemist , the Botanist , or Mineralogist , will be as proper objects of the Poet 's art as any upon which it can be employed , if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us , and the relations under which they are contemplat*dby the followers of the respective sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as en/oying and suffering beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called science , thus familiarized to men , shall be ready to put on , as it were , a form of flesh and blood , the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfguration , and will welcome the // Being thus produced , as a dear and genuine inmate of the Izouse/wid of man . " It is not unlikely that Tennyson was early impressed by these profound observations ; at all events he has seen the truths of science becoming familiar " to the general , " and has governed his art accordingly . The poet and man of science have a common ground , since few discoveries are made without the exercise of the poet 's special gift  --  the imagination . This faculty is required to enable a child to comprehend any scientific paradox : for instance , that of the rotation of the Earth upon its axis . The imagination of an investigator advances from one step to another , and thus , in a certain sense , the mental processes of a Milton and a Newton are near akin . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will great poetry ever spring from a merely phantasmal brain : " best bard because the wisest , " sings the poet . M. Tame 's chapter upon Tennyson shows an intelligent perception of the laureate 's relations to his time and especially to England ; but though containing a fine interlude upon the perennial freshness of a poet and the zest which makes nature a constant surprise to him ,  --  declaring that the poet , in presence of this world , is as the first man on the first day ,  --  with all this excellence the chapter fails to rightly appreciate Tennyson , and overestimates Alfred de Musset in comparison . M. Tame 's failure , I think , is due to the fact that no one , however successful in mastering a foreign language , can fully enter into that nicety of art which is the potent witchery of Tertnyson s verse . The minute distinction between one poem and another , where the ideas are upon a level , and the difference is one of essential flavor , a foreigner loses without perceiving his loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verse . An English school-girl will see in his work a beauty that wholly escapes the most accomplished Frenchman : the latter may have ten times her knowledge of the language , but she " hears a voice he can not hear " and feels an influence he never can fairly understand . Again , M. Tame does not allow credit for the importance of the works actually produced by Tennyson . Largeness and proportion go for something in edifices ; and although De Musset , the errant , impassioned , suffering Parisian , had the sacred fire , and gave out burning flashes here and there , his light was fitful , nor long sustained , and we think rather of what one so gifted ought to have accomplished than of what he actually did . But Tame 's catholicity , and the very fact that he is a foreigner , have protected him on the other hand from the overweening influence of Tennyson 's art , that holds us " Above the subject , as strong gales Hold swollen clouds from raining ; " have made him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this matter he is like a deaf man watching a battle , undisturbed by the bewildering power of sound . His remarks upon the limitations of a " comfortable , luxurious , English " muse are not without reason ; all in all , he has a just idea of Tennyson 's representative attitude in the present state of British thought and art . He has laid too little stress upon the difference between Tennyson and Byron , by observing which we gather a clearer estimate of the former 's genius than in any other way . Tennyson is the antithesis of Byron , in both the form and spirit of his song . The Georgian poet , with all the glow of genius , constantly giving utterance to condensed and powerful expressions , never attempted condensation in his general style ; there was nothing he so little cared for ; his inspiration must have full flow and break through every barrier ; it was the roaring of a mighty wind , the current of a great river-prone to overflow , and often to spread thinly and unevenly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended work , seeks the utmost terseness of expression ; howscever composite his verse , it is tightly packed and cemented , and decorated to repletion with fretwork and precious stones ; nothing is neglected , nothing wasted , nothing misapplied . You can not take out a word or sentence without marring the structure , nor can you find a blemish ; while much might be profitably omitted from Byron 's longer poems , and their blemishes are frequent as the beauties . Prolixity , diffuseness , were characteristic of Byron 's time . Again , Tennyson is greater in analysis and synthesis , the two strong servitors of art . In sense of proportion Byron was all abroad . He struck bravely into a poem , and , trusting to the fire of his inspiration , let it write itself , neither seeing the end nor troubling his mind concerning it . Cer // tainly this was true with regard to his greatest productions , " Childe Harold " and " Don Juan ; " though others , such as " Manfred , " were exceptions through dramatic necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are sure that the whole structure is foreseen at the outset . Every block is numbered and swings into an appointed l ) lace ; often the final portions are made first , that the burden of the plan may be off the designer 's mind . Leaving the matter of art , there is no less difference between the two poets as we consider their perceptive and imaginative gifts , and here the largeness of Byron s vision tells in his favor . Tennyson , sometimes grand and exalted , is equally delicate-an " artist of the beautiful " in a minute way . Of this Byron took little account ; his soul was exalted by the broad and mighty aspects of nature ; for mosaic work he was unfitted : a mountain , the sea , a thunderstorm , a glorious woman-such imposing objects aroused his - noble rage . You never could have persuaded him that the microcosm is equal to the macrocosm . Again , his subjectivity , so intense , was wholly different from Tennyson 's , in that he became one with Nature  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective , so far as a pervading sameness of style , a landscape seen through one shade of glass , can make him , yet few have stood more calmly aloof from Nature , and viewed her more objectively . He contemplates things without identifying himself with them . In these respects , Tennyson and Byron not only are antithetical , but ,  --  each above his contemporaries ,  --  reflect the antithetical qualities of their respective eras . In conclusion , it should be noticed that , although each has had a host of followers , Byron affected the spirit of the people at large , rather than the style of his brother poets ; while Tennyson , through the force of his admirable art , has affected the poets themselves , who do not sympathize with his spirit , but show themselves awed and instructed by his mastery of technique . Byron 's influence was national ; that of Tennyson is professional to an unprecedented degree . If the temperament of Byron or of Mrs. Browning may be pronounced an ideal poetic temperament , certainly the career of Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with the rude outer world than any poet save Wordsworth ; again , while even the latter wrote much prose , Tennyson , " having wherewithal , " and consecrating his life wholly to metrical art , has been a verse-maker arid nothing else . He has passed through all gradations , from obscurity to laurelled fame ; beginning with the lightest lyrics , he has lived to write the one successful epic of the last two hundred years ; and though he well might rest content , if contentment were possible to poets and men , with the glory of a far-reaching and apparently lasting renown , he still pursues his art , and seems , unlike Campbell and many another poet , to have no fear of the shadow of his own success . His lot has been truly enviable . We have observed the disadvantages of amateurship in the case of Landor , and noted the limitations imposed upon Thomas Hood by the poverty which clung to him through life ; but Tennyson has made the former condition a vantage-ground , and thereby carried his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional , hard-working litterateur . Writing as much and as little as he chose , he has escaped the drudgery which breeds contempt . His song has been the sweeter for his retirement , like that of a cicada piping from a distant grove . Reviewing our summary of his genius and works , we find in Alfred Tennyson the true poetic irritability , a sensitiveness increased by his secluded life , and displayed from time to time in " the least little touch of the spleen ; " we perceive him to be the most faultless of modern poets in technical execution , hut one whose verse is more remarkable for artistic perfection than for dramatic action and inspired fervor . His adroitness surpasses his invention . Give him a theme , and no poet can handle it so exquisitely-yet we feel that , with the Malory legends to draw upon , he could go on writing " Idyls of the King " forever . We find him objective in the spirit of his verse , but subjective in the decided manner of his style ; possessing a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a faculty that can harmonize the incongruous thoughts , scenes and general details of a composite period ; in thought resembling Wordsworth , in art instructed by Keats , but rejecting the passion of Byron , or having nothing in his nature that aspires to it ; finally , an artist so perfect in a widely extended range , that nothing of his work can be spared , and , in this respect , approaching Horace and outvieing Pope ; not one of the great wits near- // qwq
