2. - The I2fe of John Adams . Begun by his Son JOHN QUINcY ADAMS . Completed by CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS , JR . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 2 vols. 1871 . THE " London Athenmum " of April 1st , in a review of this Life , was pleased to say , " The American world will in time forget Adams ! " With all possible submission to the better judgment of so infallible an authority , especially as to American affairs and American books , we must take leave to say that the American world will do no such thing . It may not be the wisest of worlds , and , like other worlds , it may have gone spinning away out of its proper orbit now and then , and appeared almost as foolish as some of the older worlds , but it does know and remember its friends ; and ingratitude to its benefactors , at least after they are dead , is not one of the vices of this particular Republic . To be sure , its memory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its birth and kept watch over its cradle . It is only a very few names for which posterity has room in its mind and of which // it can make household words of daily mention . They only who have identified themselves with great changes in human condition , with the great cardinal points on which history turns , can hope for more than an historical renown , a fame which is to be looked up in hooks , hut does not come uncalled for and make a part of our daily lives . But of this small number of immortals , John Adams is one ; and the Americaa people , instead of forgetting him , we are sure will hold him in fresher and fresher remembrance as time goes on , and this for personal as well as historical reasons . There are few eminent persons who have drawn so lifelike a portrait of themselves as he has done . His Journal is a marvel of self-anatomy and conscientious recording of the observations . It is no " Confessions , " like those of Rousseau , uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meditated and methodized with a single eye to the effect they were to produce on the minds of all and singular they should reach . He never imagined that the record he made of his feelings and opinions while a schoolmaster at Worcester , and a struggling lawyer at Braintree and in Boston , would ever be made the property of the world , and display him in all his weaknesses as well as his strength to all who chose to read . Had he never emerged from the obscurity of his first estate , and lived and died an unknown man , his Diary , unearthed a century after it Was written , would have been a most interesting and valuable contribution to psychology as well as to history . Any man that will be at the pains to correct the defect which Momus pointed out in the making of man , and open the window in his breast through which the operations of his mind and the feelings of his heart may he observed and studied , may depend on being an interesting object to after generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . A human being is always an interesting subject of contemplation , if he be truly portrayed . It is this that makes the charm of genuine correspondence , - of letters which the writers never dreamed of ever meeting any other eye than that to which they were addressed . Madame de S*vign* , Lady Mary Wortley , and Cowper little imagined how delicious a part they were to form of the lives of us of whose existence they knew as little as we do of the contemporaries of our greatgrandchildren . To read their letters is to listen to their most intimate conversations with their dearest friends and to catch their minds in dishabille . One never catches Horace Walpole so . lie is always en grande tenue , - his hair powdered , his gold-laced coat and embroidered waistcoat on , and his sword by his side , - writing to us just as much as to Sir Horace Mann , Harry Conway , or Lady Ossory . And we shall have no more true correspondence of famous people . Every // celebrated man now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity is looking over his shoulder and will not bate him a jot or tittle . And this knowledge is fatal to that abandon and reckless unreserve which is the soul and charm of genuine letter-writing . The more s the pity . John Adams 's Diary and many of his letters would have been always interesting , not merely as perhaps the most ingenuous self.revelations of one 's inward nature ever made , but as giving glimpses of a state of society which is now passed away . It carries us back to a time when , with infinitely less wealth than now , the inequalities of condition were more marked and the artificial distinctions of society recognized and respected , which were all swept away by the heady currents of the Revolution . The Boston of a century ago was a very picturesquely beautiful town , sitting on her three hills and looking over the estuary of the river Charles to the lovely heights of Roxbury and Brookline in one direction , and seaward to her magnificent harbor , gemmed with wooded islands , and stretching out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest town in the country , and exceptionally so just a hundred years ago , from the profits made in the Spanish and French wars of the middle of the last century . It contained a cultivated and refined society , living in garden-houses and in an expensive and luxurious manner , to which the wealthier inhabitants were always given , as appears from John Dunton 's account of his visit to the Great Town about 1680 , and from Oldmixon 's , a generation later , who said , " An English gentleman visiting Boston might suppose , from the politeness of conversation and the costliness and elegance of dre ssand furniture , that he was in the metropolis of England . " And it is on record that one thing which provoked the taxation of the Colonies was the accounts of the wealth of Boston , as displayed in furniture , plate , and entertainments , carried home by the officers who were welcomed there with frantic hospitality on their return from the conquest of Canada . The houses of the last century , those of Hutchinson , Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , now all swept away , but which stood within living memory , - the portraits of Copley , which preserve the dress of men and women of that day , the massive plate of which loads still remain in many old families , - testify to the elegance as well as plenty of the living of the richer classes before the Revolution . The excellent Dr. Kip , the Bishop of California , in an article in the " Galaxy " on New York in the last century , most unnecessarily endeavors to magnify his native city at the expense of Boston . The worthy prelate shows himself wofully ignorant of the Boston side of the story . Why , bless his soul , there was no time from I 650 // to 1770 when the town of Boston could not have bought up , not only the city of New York , but the whole Province , including the manors and manor-houses of which he boasts so much , in which the Dutch magnates lived in the rustic plenty of rich farmers , as appears from Mrs. Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with the easy elegance of our wealthy gentlemen at their country seats near Boston , and indeed throughout New Englaiid . He tells us that the citizens of ' New York would collect in crowds to see the Patroon of Albany arrive in his coach and four , so rare were coaches a century or so ago l Let us tell him that no Boston boy would have turned his head to look at a coach from the time when as Judge Sewall ( who kept one himself ) records in his journal in 1698 , he was met upon his return from circuit on the Neck by Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton " in his new coach , " to that when Governor Hancock went in his coach and six to meet President Washington in 1789 , after waiting in vain for the President to call on him first . We regret to say that this earliest attempt to vindicate State Rights lost the Father of his Country a good dinner , which was spoiled by the delay . But all this is not violently to the purpose of John Adams 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his life ended with the Revolution , his Journal would have made him a permanently interesting person from the insight it gives us into a human soul , and the peep it affords at the way of life of the generation that looks down upon us from the frames of ' Copley 's pictures in powdered heads and wigs , and velvet coats and embroidered waistcoats , and lace ruffles and silks , satins and brocades . But it is doubly interesting as the portraiture of the mind which perhaps did more than any other to give form to the institutions , State and national , of the country , and to whose sturdy common sense , refined into statesmanship , we owe as much for the consolidation of our civil liberties as to any military hero who vindicated them with his sword . John Adams , by his reception of us into his intimate confidence through his Journal , is a flesh-andblood entity to us , as very few of our Revolutionary worthies are . He is not perched up on a pedestal , like Washington , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a perfect monster which the world ne'er saw " He had plenty of small weaknesses , such as most of us have ourselves , only we generally take care to keep them to ourselves . He was a grondeur in small matters , not over well pleased to see people whom he thought no better than himself better off and enjoying more consideration than he . lie accuses himself of envy , but it was a mild type of that malady , and it never struck into a vital part . His temper was hasty and not always angelic , in which particu // lar he was by no means alone either among his contemporaries or preceding or succeeding generations . His state of ' mind during his youth and early manhood was doubtless that of thousands of oilier men working their way upwards from an humble and obscure condition , and struggling against the vis inertice of those established in the position they wish to win , and against the jostling competition of a crowd of rivals engaged in the same eager strife . Happily , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human frailties and infirmities , and endowed with impossible perfection , and will , thetefore , have a firmer hold on the affection and esteem of common people , who prefer a man of like passions with themselves to the best tricked-out of demigods . The Washingtonolatry , what very eminent men - and notably the late distinguished Mr. Everett - have attempted to impose upon us as the Established Religion of America , has already begun to yield before the natural reaction of the human mind towards heresy in all such cases . The worthy Athenian who was tired of hearing Aristides called the Just , and wished to get him out of the way , was a type of one side of our fallen human nature . We confess to a fellow-feeling with him , and rather think we should have slyly written the same name on a shell ourselves , had we been there . Mr. Bancroft , by his injudicious zeal for making Washington , not simply the chief , but the only actor on the Revolutionary scene , besides bringing about his ears a swarm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose merits Washington would have been the last to depreciate , has actually made his hero ridiculous and a bore in the eyes of common readers . We fear that too many of the lieges sympathize with a very eminent gentleman , who shall be nameless , who was overheard to say to a friend over the breakfast-table at " Parker 's , " one day , " I say , do n't you hate Washington ? " And we are sure that the crop of grivois stories about him which have sprung up so rankly of late years has been forced by the unwise attempts of injudicious admirers to apotheothize him . The life of John Adams as told by himself in his Diary as far as it goes , and by his grandson in connection with it and after it ceases , is particularly interesting as presenting the history of the Revolution from the civilian point of view . Historians have been so much given up to the military operations of that great movement , that we are apt to overlook the less striking but at least equally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who raised the funds , conducted the correspondence , quieted the jealousies , adjusted the feuds , planned and carried out diplomatic relations with foreign powers , and , in short , did work without which the slow and long dubious successes in the field // would have had small results . Of all these things John Adams did his abundant share . And his Diary shows us the course of his laborious preparation for just these services , beginning and industriously continued long before he could have imagined the career which awaited him . Had he foreseen it and set himself deliberately to fit himself for it , he could scarcely have laid out for himself a course of reading and study more exactly adapted to his end . Through his whole course the traces of his early self-education are to be discerned . His Diary will always be most curious reading for the insight it gives , often unconsciously and unintentionally , of the first beginnings of the Revolution and of the signs and portents which went before it . We are introduced into the inner life of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of a man , the representative of many besides , who is standing face to face with a duty beckoning to a path which may very probably conduct him to destruction , and all he loves to ruin , and who yet only waits to be assured that it has indeed a divine commission , to follow it without looking behind at what may come after . He deserves none the less credit for having chosen the more excellent way , because it conducted him to honors and power and fame ; nor yet because he was but one of many who equally with himself put themselves and all they possessed upon what then seemed the cast of a very uncertain die . The gradual progress of the Revolutionary sentiment , before any but the most discerning spirits knew whither it must lead , is perhaps more clearly told in Nrr . Adams 's Diary than in any contemporary story . From the immortal argument of the Writs of Assistance , through the excitements of the Stamp Act , the successive taxations , the arrival of the British troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the soldiers , the action of the town and of the Legislature , the closing of the port , the suspension of the provincial government , and the assembling of the first Congress , - all the preliminaries and preparations for the Revolution can be there traced almost from day to day . We would say just here that Mr. Charles Francis Adams hardly does justice to his illustrious kinsman , Samuel Adams , in the note to the passage relating to the trial of Captain Preston , in which he says that , to ascribe to him the advice to Mr. Josiah Quincy , Jr. , to engage in the defence , " in view of his known convictions respecting the soldiers , scarcely does him credit either as a friend or a citizen . " This note was written before the publication of Mr. Wells 's Life of Samuel Adams , and probably the sentiments of that great man were not so fully known as to this matter then as now . But it is now clear that there was no man in Boston so intensely interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which justice and the good name of // the town was deeply concerned , as Samuel Adams . It was unquestionably he , and not John Adams , whose advice helped to decide the course of the younger lawyer , and it was at his house that Mr. Quincy consented to act . Indeed , in 1770 no one would have supposed John Adams to have been intended by the absolute expression " an Adams , ** any more than any one would have thought anybody else to have been meant by it twenty years afterwards . There is something very striking to the imagination in the varieties of life through which John Adams proceeded , though they came along so gradually , one after the other , that they almost seem like the due course of nature . His childhood spent in the obscurity of his humble Braintree home , his early struggles for independence , and his laborious industry inspired by no ignoble ambition , the part he took in the earliest movements of the Revolution , his removal to the continental centre of affairs , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independence , and in the nomination of Washington as Commander-in-Chief , and then his diplomatic years abroad , crowned by his name authenticating the Peace of 1783 , and rounded by his representing his nation at the Court of George III. , make up a series of fortunate vicissitudes not often matched in the lives of famous men . Though his residence in London as Minister to St. James was made uncomfortable to him and his family by the slights and petty affronts by which the king and court relieved the irritation caused by his presence and the mortifying events which had brought it about , still there must have been a secret satisfaction in the knowledge that such feelings existed springing from such a cause . The New England yeoman 's son , whose life had been legally forfeit by his treason to the crown , standing in the circle at court , the representative of the victorious rebellion , must have been a Mordecai at the king 's gate , but a Mordecai that must have been more or less than man if he had not privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . And it is an amusing thing for us to think of , if not entertaining to Mr. Adams at the time , how the special friends of America who had made St. Stephen 's Chapel ring with her wrongs , and had fought their way to power as her ally , were taken aback by the apparition of a man who incarnated the very victory which had swept them into Downing Street , and how they , too , ventured only to show the coldest of their shoulders to him . Such is the difference in the way things look from one side of the House of Commons and from the other ! Burke and Fox had doffed the blue coats and buff waistcoats which the Whigs had taken from our continental army as their party uniform ( still surviving on the cover of the Edinburgh Review ) , and donned the bag wigs and // swords and court dresses which his Majesty 's ministers then wore in Parliament , and the prosperous rebel looked very different in their eyes from the struggling one they had helped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some comments unfavorable to human nature on this text , but being the most amiable of critics , we shall do nothing of the kind . It is a thousand pities that Mr. Adams 's European Diary substantially ceases upon his arrival at London , and the gap is not materially filled up by the little of his private correspondence during the time of his residence there that appears in his Works . It were curious to know whether their speedy relegation to private life made any change in the demeanor of those eminent Whigs towards the American Minister . That he knew many distinguished persons we may be sure , whom we wish we could have heard him tell about . His accounts of his residence in France , as recorded at the time and more largely related in his later comments upon them , are so entertaining , that we regret the more to have lost the lively details of his English life which he might have given us . His diplomatic services in France were of the highest importance , though the cold shoulder was turned to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not exposed to the glamour which did in a good degree blind those of his illustrious colleague Franklin to the designs of the French government , and it was not wellpleasing to the Count de Vergennes to be seen through by a diplomate from the Massachusetts Bay . He saw things with an undazzled eye , and was not mealy-mouthed in speaking of them . He was even clearsighted enough to discern , through all the splendors of her dress and surroundings , that Marie Antoinette , in the height of her beauty , though a handsome woman in face and figure , was much inferior both in countenance and form to many beauties he had seen in France , England , and America . Having been a spectator of the shows of the courts of France and England , as well as of the more modest state of the Hague , having signed the treaty of 1783 , which was the ultimate recognition of his country as one of the family of nations , having been the first to stand as her representative before her discarded monarch , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic service . It was on stormy times that that service fell , when the sky was dark and the sea ran high , and it required intuition to divine the true course , and a firm hand on the rudder to steer safe to port . And John Adams , when in command of the ship , had mutiny among his officers , to aggravate all the natural difficulties of his situation . All the greater and lesser infirmities of his temper and character helped his very virtues to make enemies of those of his own political household , and to prepare the way for his fall , if // fall it might be called , which was mainly occasioned by his courageous independence which saved his country , without compromising her dignity or honor , from a disastrous and perhaps a fatal war with France , at one of the most critical moments of her existence . This was the crowning act of his public life , the greatness of which is now admitted by all reflecting minds , though it was never forgiven by multitudes of his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some degree disturbed the tranquillity of his long retirement . But that service , though great , was of comparatively a temporary character . The three acts of John Adams 's life which have been of a permanent influence , and will be remembered as long as American history is read , are , first , his nomination of Washington as Commanderin-Chief ; secondly , the part he took in the drafting and the adoption of the Declaration of Independence ; and , thirdly , his substantial authorship of the Constitution of Massachusetts of 1780 . It was a just pride with which he held up his hand and exclaimed , forty years afterwards , in reply to the inquiry of Josiah Quincy , " Who drafted the Constitution of Massachusetts ? " " This right hand ! ' * For that constitution , we believe it may be said with truth , was the most perfect form of a republican government ever made . Almost every deviation from its original provisions , certainly every one from any proposed by Adams , has been a blunder and a misfortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just emancipated from the control of the mother country , in the attempts which they were making to find a substitute for what they had abolished . Had a brilliant visionary or an influential doctrinaire pi oposed some fanciful polity , resting on imaginary theories instead of the experience of mankind , in so leading a State as Massachusetts , the mischief might have been incalculable . That such were not impossible appears from the fact that even Poor Richard , the very incarnation of common sense , Dr. Franklin himself , favored the idea of a single legislative body , instead of the check on hasty legislation afforded by two . Happily , a statesmanlike mind , enriched with ample legal and historical learning , was called to the work , and the form he gave it not only endured unchanged for forty years , and still exists without vital alteration , but had a controlling influence over the final course of the other States , and upon the Constitution of the government of the United States itself . On the 4th of March , 1801 , he ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century of such repose as his active and restless spirit could enjoy . His long retirement , after so long a career of activity , has something about it that affects the imagination as the fit ending of such a life . He would not have been the man he was if it had not // been sometimes agitated by the passions of the past and the present , and disturbed by divers vexations and annoyances , which irritated his jealous spirit and sometimes led to angry ebullitions which were neither graceful nor dignified . These things , however , lose their relative importance as time flies on , and the idea that will rest in the general mind of the last years of John Adams will always be that of a philosophic statesman , watching the turmoil he had left behind him through the loopholes of his retreat , and beguiling the hours of his retirement with the recreations of literature and the pleasures of friendship and family affection . The successful career of his son John Quincy Adams was the supreme gratification of his old age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the nation was the crowning happiness of his life ; while his death on the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence was a conclusion of the whole matter as fortunate as it was extraordinary . John Adams was , in an eminent degree , foremost among the founders of our civil polity , and his history and his character will always be an interesting study to successive generations of his countrymen who owe so much to him . Mr. Charles Francis Adams has therefore done wisely and well in publishing this popular edition of his life of his grandfather . We believe its sale already shows that the stupendous events of the last ten years , and the vastly broader stage on which they have been presented , have not entirely obscured the memory of the scenes and actors of the mighty drama of the Revolution . The glory of Gettysburg may for a season throw that of Saratoga into the shade , but Americans will yet remember that the one as well as the other was a cardinal battle on which the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary imagination as something grander even than the Declaration of Independence ; but right reason will soon show that it was but its complement , without which that immortal instrument would have been a mockery , a delusion , and a snare , - " a blurred and tattered parchment . " Mr. Adams , with a natural and laudable filial piety , regrets that his father could not have finished the work which he had begun , instead of leaving it to be completed by his son . We do not share in this regret . Mr. Charles Francis Adams 's style is better adapted to such a narrative than that of his eminent father , which perhaps savors a little too much of the lamp , and bears too plainly the traces of that strenuous industry which was so characteristic an element in the composition of Mr. John Quincy Adaips . And , besides , it is scarcely possible , considering the earnest temperament of that statesman , and his strong opinions which an unfriend might call prejudices , that he could have told the most stirring  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
