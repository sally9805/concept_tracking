She pursues Knight to London , when he breaks off the engagement in the same blindly loving way that she runs off with Stephen . We can not give any just idea of how gracefully and modestly all this pure analysis of character is managed by the author , whose knowledge we ask the reader to compare with the knowingness of Mr. Charles Reade , for example , in similar performances . The charm , the sweetness , the tenderness of the story are not excelled by its truth ; and for a good , solid , intolerable bit of tragedy , we commend the close of the story as something that may almost stand beside the close of Turg*nieffs Liza . The meeting of Smith and Knight , and their mutual explanations ; their going down to Elfrida 's home together in open rivalry , on the same train that carries her lifeless body thither , - is a passage of such gloom that a dark shadow falls retrospectively from it over all the book , and solemnizes every part of it .

These characteristics are so conspicuous that we think it all the more our duty to call the preoccupied reader 's attention to the skilful study of a lightish sort of womanhood in Mrs. Staines .

To our thinking , this novel is one of the best , if not the best , that Cherbuliex has yet written . But too careful comparisons are idle . Every one will find it entertaining , and from a young writer , who is so far from showing any signs of exhaustion , we are justified in expecting a great deal in the future . We await another novel from him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A and somewhat conservative and unvaried ' array of pictures in the gallery of the Athen*om has of late brought into fresh notice the eminent name of Copley , with which we perhaps do not commonly concern ourselves enough . The addition consists of one small and three large paintings , executed at different periods , but all fruits of the artist 's English life , which , of course , was by far the most important part of his career , and loaned to the . Atheni*um by their present owner , C. Amory , Esq . As it chances , they differ considerably from each other in point of treatment , and we shall therefore remark upon them in their historical order . The first is the preliminary painting for the Youth Rescued from a Shark , which now hangs in the Christ 's Hospital School , in London . The incident which it commemorates occurred to Watson , afterward Lord Mayor of London , who while a " seaboy " ( as Cunningham phrases it ) , was attacked in the harbor of Havana by a shark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw him into their boat . Copley , the catalogue tells us , made the voyage to England with Watson in 1776 , and was attracted by the anecdote of this adventure , as furnishing subject-matter for a picture . It is mentioned as the first attempt of the painter in the historic style , and must have been one of his first ventures in London . There is a certain harmoniousness in the coloring , despite its paleness and aridity ; and the figures are wrought out with more or less success . But , on the whole , it is characterized by a groping , though by no means impotent , uncertainty . Nine or ten men are clustered into an eager group , in a boat which , judged by its prol ) ortion to their size , is very ' much too large to be moved by the single pair of oars with which it is provided . In the water immediately in front , the wounded boy lies on his back , drawn rapidly in the direction of a very greedy , but also somewhat* improbablelooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable readiness for the youngster . We confess to a want of knowledge in the matter of shark-anatomy , as well as in that of the physical aspect of these monsters ; but we nevertheless can not help feeling that Copley must have drawn this crude prodigy from some private reservoir of his own imagination . Of the water surrounding the boat and filling the harbor of Havana , we can speak with certainty as being wholly inadequate , and indicative of lack of study on the painter 's part . Even in his rudest sketch , the master of sea and sky can not so depart from the abiding laws of form in wave and cloud , as Copley does here . But among the figures in the boat , the two in white shirts who lean over , endeavoririg to grasp the hurt swimn-ier , and he who stands at the bow , in the act of delivering a death-blow to the gaping shark , are refreshingly vigorous . They tell upon the eye more strongly , perhaps ; // Art . for the very contrast which subsists between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . We do not know how far Copley improved upon this first draft in the finished work ; but the general conception is good , and might develop well were it not for the unmistakable defect in the artist 's notions of sky and water . The truth is , Copley was * not strong in " history , " nor even in accessory landscape . His most important undertakings in the way of historical painting , namely , his Death of Lord Chatham , and the Arrest of the Five Members of the Commons , derived a large part of their importance from the fact that they contained accurate portraits of all the chief personages of the House , at the epoch when the events commemorated in those works occurred . But the whole interest of such a collection of portraits , under pretext of some particular event , is literary , rather than pictorial ; and , moreover , in the representation of a great occurrence , where some special action demands notice , concentration of attention must be more difficult , when so many separate claims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is for this reason that a work of portraiture pure and simple , from the hands of Copley - such as the picture of his own family , which we next come to - is more valuable to us than either of the historical paintings we have mentioned ; for even their elaborate portraiture could not carry them through , and , as Leslie said , there were " too many figures to *e* " in them . In this Family Picture we have Mrs. Copley and her children , with her father , Mr. Clarke , - the consignee of that precious tea from which the first brew of rebellion was extracted , by mixture with salt-water , - and Copley himself in the background , leaning against a pillar , and looking a little sad and cynical . A somewhat flimsy landscape is seen through a wide aperture at the back ; but the complexion of Mrs. Copley , seated against this ground , on a crimson sofa , and attired in a lustrous blue silk , is marvellously clear and perfect . The children , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father 's heart must have been most fully given to this work , for the little people burst upon us with a dewy freshness of countenance and a sturdy , tumultuous joyousness of expression such as painters seldom succeed in investing their children with . The flesh-tints are all laid 505 on with the greatest care , evidently , and with a corresponding result in beauty of appearance . If Copley was exceptionally laborious in his mode of work , he was rewarded for his pains by great and exceptional triumph in the rendering of color in the human face . Here are faces which he moulded into mimic being nearly a hundred years ago , and they bloom before us still with all the pure perfection of enamel , enhanced by a softness , and an aspect of actual physical porous structure , which it would be difficult to surpass by the exhibition of any modern portraiture . There is , however , a " spottiness " in the picture as a whole ( owing to the lack of a side-light , which should balance the strong illumination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists ) , which gives to the fleshportions something of the appearance of being about to fly forth from their less forcibly executed surroundings . We fancy s6mething of the same effect is seen in the Red Cross Knight , on another wall , in which the painter 's son , Lord Lyndhurst , and two of his daughters appear at a more mature age . It is rather singular that the artist should not have learned , by this time , to redress this preponderance of the fleshtints . In all probability , he bestowed too small a degree of care upon draperies and so on , to ensure the equilibrium between these and the more brilliant flesh , after the lapse of years . In Saul reproving Samuel , which is the third of Mr. Amory 's pictures , we find , to be sure , a great advance in the historical style upon the Youth 's Rescue . But this is chiefly in the manifestation of academic discipline , which had now been at work Some twenty years upon Copley . We do not like the blue mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , nor the red drapery of Saul , the red banner above him , and the rosy cloud behind , in the centre ; followed by a deep black cloud on the left , and Samuel in dark dove-color and blue , with a yellow scarf . But the drawing is good and vigorous . In those days , if a man made an unsuccessful picture , he was at least at considerable pains to do so . Lady Jane Grey refusing the Crown , painted in 1809 , is skilful and dignified , slightly cold , and in on* or two points stiff , but really a fine achievement . Perseverance and determined industry , applied to a genius not naturally inclined to this kind of painting , led Copley to this eminence . // SC I EN C E.* PI OCTOR VOUMAN 'S International L-/ Scientific Series promises to be an admirable collection of popular treatises .

The present work courts comparison with the Lectures of Professor L&amp;theby on the same subject , published a year or two ago . Both are full of information of a sort useful to everybody ; but while Letheby 's book enters a little more fully into the physiology of digestion , and has a chapter upon dietaries , Dr. Smith 's work is ampler and more practical in its account of particular articles of food , is more simply and clearly arranged , and , when its companion volume is added , will no doubt supplantthe earlier and ( then ) the smaller work . Each kind of food is treated by itself ; and its mode of cultivation , the common impurities and adulterations to which it is liable , and the different rtianners in which it may be prepared , with their respective merits , are successively described . This makes quite a fascinating sort of hotch-potch to take up and read for half an hour ; and as it is hard either to criticise or to give an account of the " general drifts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are reduced to noticing a few points at random . Liebig 's extract of meat , for instance , which is so largely consumed , and still believed by the public to be nutritious , is reaffirmed by Dr. Smith to belong solely to the class of stimulant condiments . " There is but little left in the extract to nourish the body , and the elements which it really possesses are salts , which may be obtained otherwise at an infinitely smaller cost , and the flavor of meat which disguises the real poverty of the substance It should be classed with such nervous stimulants as tea and coffee , which supply little or no nutriment , yet modify ' assimilation and nutrition . Used alone for beef tea , it is a delusion . " * Foods . By EnwAso SMITH , M. D. New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1873 . Pog5idar Lectures on Scien/*ftc Subjects . By H. HELMHOLTZ .

In speaking of pork , too , he might well have devoted a few lines to refuting the vague prejudice against it which is so common in this country , but for which few can give any reason beyond the fact that it contains trichin* and " measles , " and took longer to digest than other meats in the fistulous stomach of the celebrated St. Martin . This latter undesirable quality , Dr. Smith says , is due to the hardness of the muscular fibres , which need more mastication than those of other meats .

Both he and Professor Letheby give the palm for composition and digestibility to " seconds " flour , which is of the degree only once removed from the fin. est . The coarser qualities , which contain more of the hull , are , it is true , richer in gluten and in salts , but are , as Voit of Munich has recently confirmed , less completely digested . The indigestible part of the bran excites the bowels so much that a part of what otherwise would be absorbed is carried off with it . So Graham bread makes a less instead of more economical food for the poor . For many , to whom the superiority in economy is unimportant , it is , however , no doubt the better article . And we may say , in passing , that few people know by experience whether Graham flour suits them well or ill , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wheat . The stuff usually sold by that name is made from wheat unfit to make white flour , and often has had extra bran added to it . The best .506 October , - // Graham flour certainly has not that inferiority of flavor which our author ascribes to it ; and there are some observations on the improvement of children 's teeth under its use which may make one suspect that its whole alimentary history is not disposed of when we have found that most of its nitrogen is wasted in the bowels . After all , not physiological analysis , but the rough verdict of long practical use , where one could get true comparative data by it , would be perhaps still our safest guide , if we must needs have one exclusive guide in dietetics . We are led to this remark by Dr. Smith 's articles on tea and alcohol , in which his conclusions are in large part inferences from the direct physiolo*ical effects of the fluids when taken in. i hus , because tea largely increases the amount of carhonic acid exhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whilst his verdict is as unfavorable to gin , brandy , and whiskey , because they diminish the same excretion . And because the alcohols do not exert their maximum effects in a precisely corresponding way on the different functions which are influenced by them , he says they " disturb " the vital harmony , and hence are bad . But who is not aware how small a portion of the facts these are , and how great is the set of secondary and tertiary changes set in motion by these primary ones , of which we know nothing accurately , but which , in the question of the c/ironic advantages or disadvantages of the beverage , become the most important elements ? Dr. Richardson , in an article against alcohol of which our author quotes a part , makes a great point of the waste of energy it produces by accelerating the heartbeats ; and goes into a sensational calculation of the amount of work in foot-pounds which one may thus throw away . But is not exercise good * and do we not throw away in exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very likely that Dr. Smith 's thesis against alcohol is true in the main , though his indiscriminate laudation of tea is undoubtedly false . But in either case , most of the reasoning from physiological analysis of the effects is crude , shallow , and really unworthy of the physiology of to-day . A good instance to enforce our own point of view is to be found in the chapter on milk , in which observations are quoted to show that children fed on " condensed milk " though they grow very fat and look uncommonly healthy , are yet slow in learning to walk , and show no power to resist disease . Now , condensed milk only differs from ordinary milk by the addition of sugar . We know nothing of the effects of sugar which should make us expect beforehand such a result from the use of the milk . Indeed , on Dr. Smith 's principles , it ought to be a most beneficial addition , for its power to increase the respiration is extraordinarily high . But the vice we speak of is characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mode of treating such questions which still prevails nearly everywhere , and which is certainly but a half-way house towards the true one . - It is perhaps not too extravagant praise of Helmholtz , now Professor of Physics in Berlin , to say that he is the greatest scientific genius now living . He has touched no subject without breaking new ground in it . The whole science of acoustics may be said to have been renovated by him . His great work on physiological optics will always be a model of the profound and thorough way in which one man.may exhaust a subject . Though not professedly entering into psychology proper , the elaborate study he has made therein of our visual perceptions forms perhaps the most really important contribution to psychological science of our generation . One hardly knows which to admire most in this work , - the mathematical originality , the ingenuity of mechanical contrivance and experiment , the genius for patient observation and subtile interpretation , or the power of large constructive thought which gives unity to the whole . He is , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that instrument for seeing into the interior of the eye , which has transformed oculistic medicine . He was the first to study muscular contraction by means of recording instruments , and the first to measure the velocity of the nervous current . When we add that his other scattered investigations in physiology , electricity , and mathematics would fill a long list , and that he is one of the four independent discoverers of the principle of conservation of energy , we need say nothing more to justify our opinion that this translation of his popular essays is an important addition to English scientific literature . Two of the essays are risurnAr of his researches on sound and vision , two on the correlation of forces , two on the general relations of physical science , one on // glaciers , and one - a very interesting one - on Goethe as a scientific investigator . We have not space for any detailed account of the separate papers . We will merely note , in passing , how the author 's study of the eye , made with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and discredits the old Bridgewater-treatise doctrine of the eye being the most perfect of optical contrivances . " It is not too much to say , " he writes , " that if an optician wanted to sell me an instrument which had all these defects , I should think myself justified in blaming his carelessness in the str , ngest terms , and giving him back his instrument . " He then explains that " as our intelb*-ence uses the eye and interprets its faulty data , it is quite sufficient to its function . " A sensible man will not cut firewood with a " razor , " and a more perfect eye would be a superfluity . It is interesting in this day of philosophic disintegration to know the general philosophic attitude of such a man as Helmholtz . He is very sober and reserved in his utterances . But in his paper on Goethe there is a passage which we may quote . After showing how Goethe , the poet , sought in nature the direct and transparent sensible expression of the spiritual , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , tries to Uiscover the levers , the cords , the pulleys which work behind the scenes , and shift them . Of course , the sight of the machinery spoils the " beautiful show , " and therefore the poet would gladly talk it out of existence , and , ignoring cords and pulleys as the chimeras of a pedant 's brain , he would have us believe that the scenes shift themselves or are governed by the idea of the drama But we can not triumph over the machinery of matter by ignoring it ; we can triumph over it only by subordinating it to the aims of our moral intelligence . We must familiarize ourselves with its levers and pulleys , fatal though it be to poetic contemplation , in order to govern them after our own will ; and therein lies the complete justification of physical investigation , and its vast importance to the advance of human civiliza. tion . " POLITICS . XV E have deferred hitherto saying anything about the rising , as it is called , of the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get from the various conventions and their platforms some idea as to the political intentions of the movers in the matter . The movement has now gone on long enough to give the spectators a clear notion of its origin and causes , and the public are in a position to judge of its merits . Of course nothing is more common in the history of politics than the adoption , by bodies of men organized for a given purpose , of a new and unexpected policy . The Granges , Patrons of Husbandry , and Farmers ' Associations may adopt some plan at some future time which will give a wholly different look to their movement . We speak of it as it is now . There seems to be in the public mind a grave misapprehension of the character of the operation known in . the West as farming , which has done a good deal to create . irrational sympathy for the farmers . The Western farmer is , as a rule , a man who has emigrated from the East in pursuit of wealth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressed labor , he is himself in nine cases out of ten an employer of labor , or , in other words , a capitalist . He is just as necessary to the world as the man who drives his reaping-machine for him , or , as the man who transports his grain to market for him , but not more so . He is very far from being a yeoman , and in fact very much nearer being a speculator . His quiet farm is an establishment , containing from a few hundred to a few thousand acres , which he leases or owns , the funds not being generally a handful of gold dollars , the hard-earned savings of his father 's lifetime ; on the contrary , his funds are to a great extent credits , the Western farmer being a borrower quite as much as the Western railroad . He is not , // 509 as a rule , any more God-fearing or law-fearing than any of the rest of us . He is not bound to his farm by strong local affection and old traditional feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand acres in one place as another , provided he can make enough from the soil to pay interest on his outstanding paper , and obtain a fair profit himself . He is , in short ; a gentleman who goes into the business of producing grain from the earth for the same reason that other gentlemen embark their funds in the production of iron and coal from the earth , and still other gentlemen manufacture cotton and flax into cloth . He is as much entitled to pursue this occupation as they are theirs ; but there is no more reason for sympathizing with him in his hard lot when he is unsuccessful in money-making than there is for sympathizing with one of the shareholders in a Lowell mill or a Pennsylvania coal or iron mine when his bands are on strike . Sometimes they make , and sometimes they lose money ; and whether they make or lose is a question depending partly on prudence , partly on chance , partly on the state of the market , partly on the condition of the weather ; in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railroads themselves . There is the best possible evidence - the evidence of men who have seen it with their own eyes - that within the past year or two the farmers have been producing too largely , or , as we might almost say , speculating for a rise on a falling market . Two years ago there was already a glut . Along some of the lines leading to the Atlantic coast there were stacked thousands of bushels of grain , waiting for a market . In other places farmers had begun to burn their grain for fuel . Meanwhile the situation of the railroads was not much better . When it is said that the average net earnings of all the railroads in the country is 5.20 per cent on the actual cost , and 3.91 per cent on their capitaL stock , the reply may possibly be made that this does not represent the state of the case in Illinois indeed it does not , because in Illinois there are only four railroads paying regular dividends at all , and only one as mtjch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the farmers assert , the railroads have been making such enormous profits during the last few years , they must havebeen frightfully defrauding their stock and bond holders , and it is these oppressed capitalists who ought to make common cause with the down-trodden agricultural population . No such movement has yet been heard of , though , speaking seriously , there is much antecedent probability that whatever railroad directors have enriched themselves unlawfully during the past few years have done so through robbery of those who placed them in their position . of trust , and gave them their opportunity for fraud , rather than through oppression of those whose voluntary contributions support the roads . For freight , though truly enough in one sense a transportation tax , is in another sense something quite different from any tat ; it can be collected only so long as the producer or shipper chooses to pay it . If he find it unprofitable , he will not pay it ; he will either change his business or his residence , and thus still further diminish the income of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly appreciated by the railroad-men who assess and levy the transportation tax than by any one else in the country . The first thing any railroad has to do is to calculate at what rate freight Will be shipped , and at what price it will not be shipped . On the other hand , if a body of directors wish to commit frauds , there is always stock and there are always* bonds to do it with . How many railroads have we seen within the past few years , with thousands of dollars ' worth of stock of a nominal value in the market , on which no one ever dreamed of receiving a dividend , but which was used solely , for the purpose of managing the roads ! No attempt is made in the case of these roads to collect freight enough to pay dividends . The freight is collected as it can be * the idea that any sensible fraudulent director would endeavor to increase his freight rates to a point which he knows to be exorbitant , when it is perfectly open to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , owing to circumstances connected with the purchase of some new line , or the lease of some old line , or the building of locomotives , or for some other timehonored reason , it has been deemed advisable not to declare any dividend for the past six months , is utterly monstrous . If we take the most fraudulently managed road in the country , - the Erie , - we shall see how plain this is . The Erie Railway has some $ 100,000,000 stock in the market , issued in great part by Fisk and Gould . No serious attempt has been made to pay dividends on this , except in one case , even // Politics . since the " reform directors " took  |p6ssession  ; they , it is true , declared a dividend of three and one half per cent . A dividend of three and one half per cent on the earnings of eight or ten years , however , may safely be considered as tantamount to no dividend at all ; so we may safely say that the Erie Railway pays no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers of the line have not been obliged to make any attempt at an exorbitant increase of freight rates for the purpose of paying dividends . Somebody undoubtedly has been defrauded ; but it is also an undoubted fact that those who were defrauded were the old stockholders , at home and abroad . It was these old stockholders , too , who felt themselves defrauded , and who formed committees and passed resolutions , and employed counsel , and ejected the corrupt management . We heard nothing in those days of the oppression of the farmers in the interior of New York and farther west . It will be admitted that'the Erie frauds may well serve as the type of any frauds that have been committed in railroad management throughout the country during the last few years ; and we see that the people defrauded by them , or at any rate the people who thought themselves defrauded , were not the people who paid the transportation tax . Very little can be said in favor of the railroad management of the country . Railroads are managed according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of those whose interests they are bound in honor and equity to protect ; and if the object of the farmers ' movement were to secure the greater responsibility of directors , or to bring to justice directors already known to have engaged in frauds , we should cordially sympathize with it . But , as we have seen , the movement is directed against that already oppressed class , the very stockholders who are now said to be so swindled by trustees . What is to become of the 5.20 per cent on the cost , and the 3.91 per cent on the stock , now paid to these unfortunates ; if they are to be subjected on the one hand to " raids " from directors , and on the other to " raids " from the State legislatures is easy to see . Besides the stockholders and the farmers there is another class of people whose interests are closely connected with the management of the railroads . In all the dIscussion which has been going on about the October , Granges , the Transportation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the rights of passengers . The Illinois law , if we remember right , does include passenger fares , but this branch of the subject attracts hardly any attention . If there is any class which railroads have an opportunity to impose upon , however , it is the travelling public . There is no class , certainly , to whose personal convenience railroads have paid less heed . They have been shut up in ill-ventilated cars , they have been seated in uncomfortable seats ; they have been delayed , hustled , wounded and killed in great numbers . For this maltreatment many suits at law have been brought , and usual damages recovered . We . have never heard , however , of any loud complaints on the part of the travelling public that the fares charged by the railroads were unjust . There have been suggestions that laborers ' trains might be run at low rates ; but these suggestions , even , did not come from the laborers , but from official students of the railroad question . This strange apathy on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that of a general belief that the roads understand the business of establishing rates of fare better than any one else ; they know what rates passengers will pay , and what rates they will not pay . The control of the roads over the passengers is much more close than any which they can ever establish over the farmers . They depend far more on freight than on travel , and , besides , this cause of the producers is one easily made a common cause ; massmeetings and associations of passengers , like the Granges and Farmers ' Associations , are very unlikely things . Before the roads seriously impose on either passengers or farmers , however , they will first squeeze their own stockholders ' purses dry . In order to understand the farmers ' movement thoroughly , it is necessary to take into consideration , not merely their supposed grievances , but also the means they have taken to remedy them . Their resolutions have been multitudinous , but their actual operations can easily be enumerated . First , they have formed themselves into various organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other names ( it is wholly immaterial for our present purpose what distinctions as to objects and methods there may be among them ) , and have announced their determination , first , that railroad // charters must be controlled by State laws ; second , that freight charges must be determined by the State itself , and not by the railroads ; third , that they must be determined on the pro-rota principle ; in the fourth place , they have carried the contest into the legislature of one State , and secured the passage of a law establishing a freight schedule in accordance with their views ; fifth , they have elected a judge of the Supreme Court in the same State , who announces that he will decide in any case arising before him that the railroad charters are subordinate in all cases to State law , and that the freight law of Illinois is constitutional . The proposition that railroad charters must be controlled by State law seems fair enough , until we know what it means . When we find that it means the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the United States guaranteeing the inviolability of contracts , we see that the proposition strikes a direct blow at all constitutional rights ; for even if , by elaborate regulations , the technical objections can be overridden : , the fundamental objection remains . A charter is a contract between the company and the State , and if the State has reserved no right of regulation , the company has under the contract full powers within the limits of what is reasonable . This has been decided over and over again by the Supreme Court of the United States , and fifty inferior courts . If at this day it is to be disregarded by some transparent hocus-pocus of a board of railroad commissioners , we may as well give up all idea of having any law regarded that conflicts with the interest of the majority for the time being . The determination of freight charges by the State on the pro-rota principle has been tried in Illinois , and has proved a complete failure . The law was hardly passed when loud complaints were made on every side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The election of Judge Craig to take the place of Judge Lawrence on the Supreme bench of Illinois has been so widely commented on in the press that it is hardly necessary to say anything here . That Judge Craig was elected for the express purpose of deciding cases against what he knew to be law , and that this is an attack upon the independence of the judiciary quite as dangerous as the election of men like Barnard or Cardozo in New York , - so much is generally admitted . Whether Judge Craig 5 " . had or had not already pledged himself in advance to the railroads seems to be still in doubt . To sum up what we have said : the farmers ' movement declares itself a movement on the part of an oppressed class to redress its wrongs by honest reform of the abuses of which it complains . It is in reality a quarrel between producers and carriers as to profits . It is characterized by a greatdeal of ignorance ; for it attempts to saddle the railroads with the blame properly belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , it mistakes the misfortunes which their imprudence has brought upon them for the result of impositions which have really been for the most part practised on the people with whom they are quarrelling ; it also displays the same ignorance , , in the development of the monstrous idea that a modern State legislature is a body competent to manage the complex business of a railroad ; and it has manifested a profound contempt for law , justice , and honesty in its openly avowed declaration of an intention to intimidate the judiciary into unjust and illegal decPsions . These are all the facts from which at present we can make inferences as to the future of the farmers ' movement , and the question which has been agitating many people 's minds during the summer ,  --  whether the new party of which we have heard so much for the last few years , is to find its foundation in this movement . It seems to us perfectly safe to say that , unless some violent change takes place , the farmers ' rising will come to little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things than the assemblage in public places of large numbers of men , excited by a temporary depression of business , for the purpose of denouncing monopolies , " salar*-grabs , " and iniquity of all sorts . No great party has ever been formed without some definite policy and some definite practical method of attaining that policy . The Republican party desired to exclude slavery from the Territories , and the means were very simple , for they consisted of gaining the control of Congress . The Democratic party was founded on a theory of govern- - ment which , though erroneous , was popular , had been elaborately thought and written about for a generation or more , until its ideas had permeated every mind , and , indeed , become part of the mental constitu // Politics . tion of the age . On the other hand , the Labor party , as it calls itself , has never been able distinctly to let the world know either what it wants or how it wishes to attain what it wants . One labor-reformer desires* to . throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divide it per capita ; another wishes all " industrial corporations which refuse to adopt the co-operative principle at once abolished " ; another wants his trade made into an hereditary caste . A few years ago we heard a great deal about the Labor party . It was rising in its might , and very soon it would have control of the country . It has done nothing of the kind , however , and will probably in the future do less than in the past . To take another instance , the Prohibitionists , who have indeed a definite aim , have never been able to discover any means of securing it . They have had , year after year , local triumphs in one State or another , and there was at one time some talk of a national Prohibitory party . The movement , however , makes no effect on national politics , because it is impracticable . The farmers are in the same position . They are filled with a vague dissatisfacti*n with the present state of affairs , and a vague notion , derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroads are to blame for it . They accordingly set to work to remedy their troubles by attacking the judiciary for having rendered a perfectly just decision , and then turning to the legislature , they secure the passage of a law which aggravates all their evils . More than this , they propose to hand over to this same legislature the absolute control of railroad management , *-a business which any one can see no legislature knows anything about . Under these circumstances , we can only regret the apparent probability that the farmers ' movement will come to nothing . Even if it should obtain a temporary control of some of the Western States , its chances would not be improved , for it has undertaken to accomplish what it can not accomplish . Its action may lead to a great deal of anarchy and confusion , may injure the business of some roads and build up that of others , but it can not make the production of wheat profitable where it is unprofitable , nor is it likely to attract very deep interest in that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the scene of action , looks on impartially . That this should be so is undoubtedly a pity : Any party which could really bring forward an intelligible scheme*of railroad management would establish distinct claims upon the gratitude of the country . But it is a thousand times better to leave such matters to be governed by the laws of trade , and managed by those who have , made them a special study than that they should fall into ignorant and incompetent hands , for the sake of wholly unlikely reforms which the change may by some magic produce . The Prohibitory movement , the LaborReform movement , and the Woman-Suffrage movement have all three been marked by one peculiarity , which has often been noticed ,  --  the prevalent feeling that all evils can be cured by legislation . It is not very difficult to see how this fallacy sprang up . The legislature having been looked upon down to the middle of this century as the body which stood between the people and the oppressors of the people , - * - -   kings , emperors , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it natural to continue to look in the same direction . Popular bodies had meantime become time-serving , ignorant , and corrupt ; but to these facts no sort of attention was paid . Any demagogue who discovered a crying evil anywhere in the social order was certain to assure his constituents that , if they would only send him once more to Congress or the legislature , he would certainly repeal it . The people were willing enough to believe his promises , forgetting that reformers of the popular kind , that is , agita-* tors , are very indifferent to methods , provided the noise goes on . The foes of what is known as rum were assured that the legislature should pass a law which would drive every rum-seller out of every State . The Labor Reformers were promised a legislative enactment which should make them all capitalists ; and the Suffrage Reformers were assured that the physical , mental , and moral equality of man and woman should be soon made a palpable fact by its insertion in the statute-book . It is pretty evident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , in the same way , that legislation is no panacea for natural evils ; it merely aggravates them .
