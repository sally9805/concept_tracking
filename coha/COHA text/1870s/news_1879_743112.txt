txt On Wednesday night the usually quiet village of Canandaigua , Ontario County , was the scene of a double tragedy of the most shocking character . Jacob Neu , a thrifty German gardener , was the principal actor rand his wife Barbara the victim . They occupied a very comfortable home , and were the prents of four girls and one son . The latter , about 15 years of age , was the youngest of the children . Of late he has been the only one of the children living at home , and on the evening mentioned went to a circus performance . As his father handed him the money to buy his ticket he said , " This is the last two shillings you will get from me . " The boy attached no alarming import to these words , for he had heard their like often , and it is hardly probable that the father meant them in a literal sense , but in the light of subsequent events they possess a startling significance .

The position in which the bodies were found , and the character of their wounds , indicate that Mrs. Neu was seated on the porch in front of the house when her husband , probably infuriated by drink , without a moment 's warning , struck her a stunning . blow with a chopping ? axe , the edge making a horrible gash at the base of her neck , on the back . This first blow was evidently followed by another . This time the axe was buried in his wife 's forehead , just over the left eye , severing the frontal bone from the skull . The murderer , perhaps partially sobered , then went into the house and obtained a razor . He returned to the porch , and with one strong , deliberate gash cut his throat from ear to ear . The carotid arteries , the jugular vein , and the windpipe were severed .

Drink was undoubtedly the primary cause of this tragedy . Neu was a man about 50 years of age , industrious , hard-working , and when sober in every way a good citizen . During the Winter just past he had signed the pledge , and , becoming a member of the village Reform Club , had for several months abstained from liquor . During this time he was peculiarly contented and happy , kind to his family , and a faithful attendant upon church services , but , recently , through the influence of evil associates , his appetite had become again ungovernable , and for weeks ; he had not seen a sober moment . On the day before his death he had obtained a new keg of beer , and probably , had indulged very freely .
