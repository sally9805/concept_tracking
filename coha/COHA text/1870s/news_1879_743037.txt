txt An unsuccessful attempt was made to-night to Assassinate Edwin Booth , the eminent tragedian . The play was " Richard II. , " and when the last act had been reached , and Mr. Booth held the stage alone , in the prison scene , the audience was startled by two pistolshots in quick succession . It was at first supposed that they might have been the result of accident , either on the stage or on the part of some one of the spectators , but in a few minutes the startling intelligence was spread among the audience that it ' Wes , in fact , an attempted murder , but the gratifying fact was also apparent that the intended tragedy had proved abortive . As soon as the shots had been fired , Mr. Booth excused himself to the audience and retired to his dressing-room , where his wife , who was in a state of great excitement , was in waiting . As soon as he had quieted her fears he returned to the stage , resumed his line , and finished the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dark , and it is probably owing to this fact that the assassin missed in his aim , and the bullets , instead of entering the person of the actor , penetrated the scenery and buried themselves in the stage floor , from whence they were extracted after the curtain fell . The man who fired the shots was at once arrested . He occupied a seat in the second balcony . He gave his name als Mark Gray , and said he was a traveling'salesman for a St. Louis dry goods house . On Ms person was found a letter addressed to a woman in some town in Ohio , in which he avowed his intention and determination to kill Mr. Booth . Upon being taken into custody ho was at once incarcerated in the Central Station . Mr. Booth says ho knows nothing of this man , and can not divine why ho should be singled out as the target for his bullets . It is stated that of late Mr. Booth has received a large number of letters threatening his life , but he himself asserted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit lately was untrue . Mr. Booth declines to make any statement at length to-night , owing to the illness of his wife , and his desire to be loft in quiet with her . The supposition is that Gray is some half-crazy fool , or was drunk at the time he committed the act . Mr. Booth says that ho knows nothing of the man Gray , and that he had no idea he was being fired at until informed by one of the people behind the scene . Gray says Booth once wronged a friend of his , and he has been resolved to punish him ever since . He states that he is from Keokuk , but is now traveling for a firm in St .. Louis . He WAS only 34 feet distant from Booth when be fired the shots . Mr. J. H. , the Manager of 's Theatre in Chicago , was found by a TIMES reporter at an early hour this morn ? ing in his room at the Gilsey House . Mr. was entirely at a loss to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not know any person by the name of Mark Gray , nor had he ever heard or such a man in St. Louis . He was not aware that Edwin Booth had an enemy in the world . It had frequently been remarked , as a rare fact , that in the profession Mr. Booth was without an enemy , and that there was never any jealousy between him and his brother actors . This might have been partly from Mr. Booth 's nature.o He had not mingled with men as a man must to make enemies . If so generally liked in the profession , it was yet more incomprehensible that he should be attacked outside of it . The whole affair , Mr. repeated , was a complete mystery to him . Mr. Booth had not played in St. Louis for three years , and there was little chance that he had ever met this man Gray . Without being in possession of the facts , Mr. said e'his theory would be that the man was crazy , and thought he would create a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre . " Let me see , " added the manager . " Yesterday was the 23d. the day of Shakespeare 's anniN ersary . It may possibly have been that this Gray was an admirer of Shakespeare , and thought he would commemorate the occasion in this way . I guess we 'll have to lay it to the day for want of a better reason . " Mr. said that he had never known , in all his intimate acquaintance with Mr. Booth , ( who is Mr. , ) of any threats being made against him . Immediately after the assassination of President Lincoln there was some feeling manifested on account of the relationship with the assassin , but even in that wild time there were no threats of personal violence received or known of by Mr. Booth . He was a man always just and kindly ' in his personal dealings , and surely was considered , if any man could be , without a foe in the world .               @ @ @ @ @ @
