txt Although a few silly sentimentalists , of whom it is not easy to speak without displaying the hearty contempt which they deserve , persist in calling vivisection a cruel practice , the cause of science is not substantially injured . The absolute necessity of vivisection has been so frequently demonstrated that no man can now attack it without incurring ridicule and bad , though scientific , language . How could medical students discover that the heart boats , unless a dog were frequently vivisected in their presence , and its heart pointed out with a scalpel ? How could we over remember that the woorari with which the South American Indians poison their arrows is unwholesome , if the scientific persons did not constantly inject woorari into the tissues of living animals , and then promptly vivisect thew , in order to show the effect of the poison upon the nerve centres Thus wo see that , next to tobacco and free schools , vivisection is the chief palladium of our liberties , and the most precious result of civilization . One of the most beautiful among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Nature by M .. PAUL BERT . It has never been clearly ascertained whether sensation can be conveyed in two opposite directions by a singdo nerve . Some scientific persons have held that when the. , spinal column of a dog is irritated with a hot iron , the sensation of pai  --  is conveyed , to only one end of the dog  --  that is to say , ' his head  --  while others have insisted that the spinal nerves convey . sensations to the tip of the dog 's tail as well as to his brain . M. BERT determined to settle this . interesting question , and ho therefore devised an experiment full of ingenuity and other charming qualities . Dogs not being plentiful , M. BERT took a , largo scientific person and removed the skin from his left foot . lie then excavated a hole in the scientific person 's back , corresponding in size and shape to the flayed foot , and inserting the latter in the prepared dorsal receptacle , sowed the two firmly together . Adhesion took place by the first intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all disease , passed safely through the febrile disturbance which followed the operation , and at the end of six months was as well as ever . He was then . brought before M. BERT 'S pupils , and the leg , which was now firmly attached at each end to the scientific person 's body , was cut at the knee joint . The result of this was that the scientific person had two legs of unequal length , and a novel and interesting tail , consisting of what was formerly the foot and lower half of his left leg . So far the result of the experiment had been the production of a now variety of scientific person with a clumsy tail . This , however , was not the object M. BERT had in view . The elaborate grafting of , the loft leg in the scientific person 's back , and the subsequent cutting of the log at the knee joint were merely preparatory to the grand design of the experimenter . All things being ready , be now proceeded to pinch and otherwise bruise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to ascertain it the nerves could convey sensations in a. direction opposite to that in which - they hadl been accustomed to travel when the tail formed part of the original leg . There waS no doubt that the tail was sensitive , fa : whenever it was pinched , the scientific person yelled and attempted to escape , greatly to the amusement of the scientific audience . This sensitiveness , however , was of brief duration . On the second day after the . section was effected the sensibility of the tail diminished , and finally disappeared altogether . The nerves had undergone the usual alterations of nerves separated from their trophic centres . The nerves of the remainder of the unique loft leg were , however , perfectly tree from degeneration . " When ho could no longer be used , the scientific person was thrown away , and we are , . of course , without any further information as to his fate . Probably he starved to death , since his crippled condition would naturally , prevent him from earning his living . Thus , M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey sensation in two directions , anti the result to which ho arrives is that " an excitation in a sensory. is propagated simultaneously both centripetally and centrifugally , " which simple and beautiful language may well challenge our admiration and gratitude . Of course , the sentimentalists will raise an outcry against M. Baia . They will claim that ho exhibited the utmost brutality in his treatment of the scientific person upon whom he experimented , and that there is hardly any punishment sufficiently severe for a man guilty of such cruel and inhuman practices . They will also insist that the results obtained by his cold-blooded vivisection of a poor and helpless scientific person are ridiculously out of proportion to the pain inflicted , and that no man eau rightfully think himself better or wiser merely because lie knows that an " exciation of a sensory " produced a whole ( plan-tity of things in six-syllable words . Thus they will fill the air with their unscientific clamor , and render themselves more absolutely ridiculous than ever . Having thus lured the sentimentalists into this humiliating exposure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific person . It was a mere rat which lie cut and slashed and pinched , and it was the rat 's tail , instead of the scientific person 's left log which was grafted and subsequently severed . With these trifling exceptions , the story , as just told , is strictly true . It is possible that it would be cruel to vivisect a scientific person  --  though , perhaps , in the interests of science , the experiment ought to be tried  --  but nothing can be clearer than that there is no cruelty in vivisecting a rat . What is a rat but a small animal wonderfully endowed with acute hearing and eye- , sight , and hence obviously unable to feel pain to any extent i Has any rat ever mentioned that lie found it uuplesant to be vivisected ? Of course , no such remark has ever been made , and we can therefore dismiss the idea that the rat can suffer pain , and congratulato M. BERT upon his ingenious ant ) delightful experiment .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
