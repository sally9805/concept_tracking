PICTURES IN THE PRIVATE GALLERIES OF NEW YORK . No . III . GALLEnY OF MABSUALL 0 . Ronnurs . AN urbane author of a time that is past , who had the pleasing consciousness of addressing the " gentle reader , " was fortunate in the temper lie felt and touched . Accustomed to polite society , scrupulous about the amenities of life , he knew that he must be agreeable ; and he was agreeable . To-day the " gentle reader " seems a fiction of our fathers ' time , and the style of the writer who addresses him is suggestive of the aacient , and faded , and conventional . Yet if it were possible to revive his pleasing presence he should be here ; and if , by chance , we could discover his local habitation , we would solicit the pleasure of his company in the private gallery of Mr. Marshall 0 . Roberts . We would not shoek him with strange and late developments , but we would place him among some of the familiar pictures of his palmiest days ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , instead of speaking , we should wish to listen to him . But the gentle reader , shade that he is , is likewise voiceless . However sure of his tenderness towards the famous pictures that were novelties in the art of his time , we should get no verbal sign from him . But we will even suppose him to be present ; for no spirit less gentle than his should preside over us in a gallery crowded with pictures that were famous ten years ago , but which must suffer from the present fashion of understanding art . Our genial companion , whose face is peaceful and gladdening , and without a suggestion of the influence of railroads and newspapers , is suffused with pleasure before Huntington 's picture of " Mercy 's Dream . " The pure intention of the artist and the sacredness of the familiar story , are united in a form of art conse-. crated by the reverence of ages  --  and it is enough for the gentle reader . This is a picture which is almost as popular , while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of Catholic Saints for devout Roman Catholics . It is a myth of the Puritan mind which in beauty and vividness does not decline before the historic splendor of the more prolific plastic imagination of the Catholic of the south of Europe . An ideal of Protestantism is here realized . how much the Evangelical public has been gratified by this picture ! We will not breathe a word of criticism before this figure consecrated by the affection and veneration of a thousand homes . Away , profane and skeptical critic , nourished on modern novels , modern science , modern French art , and American journalism ! You are before an ideal of a religious mind , albeit the ideal is in a conventional form . Mr. Huntington 's art can be brought in question elsewhere , and when criticism is less likely to wound pious prejudices . And , after all , rob the angel in his picture of lustre , and " Mercy " of grace , lower the art of the pniater , dispute his understanding of form , obey the instincts of a detractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's picture , and your task would not be productive of good to any one . You might whisper that it is most appropriate to a Sundayschool banner , but your very suggestion would be a vindication of the popular significance and spotless purpose of the painter 's work . Opposite to Huntington 's picture of " Mercy 's Dream " is a large picture representing the " Good Samaritan . " By its size and subject it belongs to great art as understood in academies of // painting , and as it was understood among ancient Italian painters . It does credit to Mr. Huntington 's study of some of the old masters , and is remotely suggestive of Titian and Vandyke ; in fact , it shows great dependence upon the examples of the two masters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . A certain degree of nobility in the types , more or less conventional , an impression of repose and size , and the dignity of the Samaritan , render this a respectable example of a style of art that belongs to the past . My gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that American art has no better specimen of this kind of painting save in the works of Allston . The color is rich , the tone deep ; the expression and character of the young woman 's face sympathetic and pure ; that of the mother fussy and incredulous and surprised ; that of the Samaritan cornmanding , perhaps a little exaggerated , and therefore overbearing . This is an example of religions art not mach appreciated outside of the pnlpit 's immediate influence ; it is not equal to Flaudrin 's art , nor could it well be so , for Flandrin was a pious , and convinced , and submissive mind-pious and submissive to a degree hardly possible in an American Protestant with a sense of beauty and of art comparable to the devout French Catholic religious painter . There are other examples of Mr. Huntington 's talent in Mr. Roberts ' gallery-several landscapes that show a natural sense of color , but a sense that seems to me not sufficiently cultivated , or rather , seems hurt by too much studio-work , and not stimulated enough by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in all his serious and gracious qualities of an agreeable and cultivated painter in Mr. Roberts ' gallery . His aim as an artist is now shared by few , perhaps by no American painter of equal ability . It is an aim that made him scrupulous to repeat something of the glories of the great Italian masters in a form which tbev have illustrated according to the suggestions of their own spirits . So far as the art of painting is concerned ,  - -  qualities of color , harmony , tone , depth , handling ,  --  Mr. Huntington may be said to have attained much . But the sweetness aud grace of his nature , instead of making a wholly personal expression , have been too easily contented with conventional forms , and this fact detracts from the merit of his work as an artist . But enough . We are before a charming head of a young girl , sweet and pearly in color , of a delicious simplicity in expression , refined in form and tint ,  --  rcfiued like the lip of a sea-shell , soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a portrait , and which is yet representative enough for a type . Well , it is only a little girl , a half-length by Mr. Henry Peters Gray , and , without exception , it is , to us , the most refined and wholly charming example of his talent that we know of  --  a picture to covet and retnember , it is so fine , so delicate , so delightful in suggestion , so artless . This little maiden with her little ring upon her little finger ; a little bud of a girl dressed in the simplest fashion , without a single detail , owing its whole charm to the positive painting of the face , to the unobtrusive painting of the figure and background , is really a work of art , precious in fact , and better than larger and more pretentious pictures . This picture represents a rare attainment in arta personal and lovely sentiment of a particular form of life . The mechanic , the mere picture-maker , had little to do here ; the artist , pervaded with a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the man who painted this picture is often in complete subjection to the very ideas which , inherited with his time , have cheapened the work of Mr. Huntington . We mean ideas of imitating-or , if not so frankly avowed , ideas of repeating  --  the historic an religious art created by the painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth c%enturies . This aim is , and these ideas are , it is but just to say , the common object and property of every school of academic art : dominating the life of an artist . he is lifted above the vl ) lgar and trivial by them ; yet as often // they take him away from reality , and then he but feebly touches our feelings , while to a Wilkie , a Frere , a Millet , a Rousseau , belongs the honor of creating anindividual if not a national form of art , destined to outlive the more exclusive , the less robust , the less natural , often the feebler , forms of art , consecrated by the reverence of schools and repeated only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not help regretting that both Mr. Huntington and Mr. Gray do not oftener content themselves with the simple fact of nature ; that they do not care more for actual men and women and children , and less for story and symbol or allegory , which make illustrative puppets of human beings . But to do this they must resist the taste of picturebuyers who covet a fancy picture , a composition , a story illustrated by conventional types , and are stupid or insensible before the finest example of art in the unpretentious form of a study of a head , of a figure , not knowing that the greatest achievement in the art of painting is a simple man , woman , or child , at the best or most pathetic moment of their existence . And yet this is a conclusion which must seem ill-advised in the gallery of Mr. Marshall 0 . Roberts , . before so imposing an example of historical art as the late Mr. Leutze 's " Washington Crossing the Delaware 's  --  a picture more widely known than any other American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is admired in Germany , and doubtless is highly thought of by the artists of the English Royal Academy ; for , viewed from the standpoint of a school , its art is on a level with its subject-it is heroic and effective . Most of us recollect the depreciation to which injudicious and envenomed critics subjected the painter of this picture but a few years ago : the reaction against his art was violent and inconsAerate of personal feelings ; hut after all is said , we must admit that Leutze the painter was on the same plane as Bancroft the historian , and that this historical composition is a clever and vigorous piece of work , expressive as an oration , and if not profound , if not precious , certainly intelligent , a pictorial witness of good sense ; as a composition , notwithstanding the tableau *ivant look of the figures , comparable to Yernet , and , in point of drawing and action , but little short of the merit of the best examples of retrospective historical painting , which necessarily fall short of the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brusque and positive before the works of living painters that are outside of our sympathies ; but before what remains vivid and tangible , with sign of weakness or of strength , of a hand now stilled forever , we must think and speak gently : and so we think of poor Leutze , so strong in his day of being , grasping by his intellect the barbaric and violent of history , and rejoicing in the active and collective life of past times . To him art was not an end in itself ; it was merely a means of rendering his conception of men in dramatic situations and at picturesque epochs . The artist , pure and simple , has a different aim ; his aim is beauty , and beauty and its means of expression are to him inseparable . The interest of Mr. Roberts ' Gallery would be strong were it only furnished with the three popular pictures , just mentioned , by Huntington and Leutze ; but these , chief though they be in American art of yesterday , are but a portion of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a few by the leading contemporary French painters . One Meissonier , one G6rome , three Freres , specimens of Willems , Jules Noel , Plassan , Vantier ; several pictures from the Dusseldorf school of painting ; three large landscapes by Church , two pictures by S. R. Gifford  --  a charming sketch of a woodroad and a masterly picture of sea and shore a little after mid-day ; two landscapes by James Hart , one by William Hart and one Kensett ; here , too , you can see one of George Hall 's best-known pictures , his " April Shower ; " an historical picture by Irving ; Robert M. Weir 's " Embarkation of the Pilgrims ; " Lang 's Beatrice Cenci in her 1a4 sleep ; Hay 's Herd of Buffaloes ; a landscape // study by Hicks ; a Venice by Cranch , also a bit of the russet woods by the same artist , and one of the best specimens of his talent ; an interesting , and , in some respects , a fine picture of Corpli Castle by Cropsey : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank at all , in art , are instructive to the lover of American art , and show what effort has been made by some of our older men years ago to give grace and beauty to our home-life . George A. Baker is represented by a lovely head of a young woman , and a cabinet picture of a group of girls , pleasant in color , but too general in style to do credit to the painter 's study of nature . A charming portrait of a child by William 0 . Stone , sketchy in execution and broad and delicate in effect , is worthy of attention . Two heads by Merle , a Venice by Tilton , a large landscape by Gignoux-Indian Summer in Virginia  --  a rocky coast by Alexander Wiist , four pictures by Eastman Johnson , a sketch by Homer , several pictures by Gray and one by Mount , a Marie Antoinette by Muller , a little picture by G. Lafribdin , an elaborate study of the details of vegetation in the autumn woods by W. T. Richards , a remarkable and invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to those we have mentioned , constitute the body and force of Mr. Marshall 0 . Roberts ' private gallery . Now that we know what we have to look at , mindful of our " gentle reader , " and yet without stopping to consider Leutze 's " Expulsion of the Moors , " one of his latest works , singularly like a piece of tapestry in effect , we will look at Woodville 's " News from the Mexican War . " This picture is to Mr. Roberts ' collection what Homer 's " Prisoners from the Front " is to Mr. J. T. Johnston 's gallery . It is expressive of an epoch ; it is a bit of local history of vast significance , painted with adequate knowledge and the right purpose . It is more elaborate art than Homer 's picture ; the direct and simple talent of the painter is less , his study and experience greater , than Homer 's . This picture is a gift to all of us , and it should have a place of honor in Mr. Roberts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Many of our older renders , doubtless , are well acquainted with this picture , for we believe it dates from the old Art-Union days in New York . The artist has painted a group of men on the stoop of a country Hotel and Post-Office , listening to the host , who stands in an anxious and eager attitude , devouring wi*h his eyes the exciting news from the seat of war , which he reads to a curious and varied group of old and young . Character , expression , action , grouping , are alike good-I will say more , remarkable-in this thoughtful and well-designed picture , which has more good sense , more brains , in it , than any Meissonier we have ever seen ; and certainly it is more appropriately placed on the walls of an American gallery than most examples of foreign art . Luxury and ostentation , with undiscrimmating pride , will covet and boast of foreign pictures , but real love of art will be as responsive to the extraordinary merit of our best native talent as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is for this reason that I congratulate Mr. Roberts upon being the owner of Woodville 's " War-News from Mexico . " There seems to have been a generous impartiality presiding over the formation of Mr. Roberts ' collection of paintings . Native and foreign art are represented without any thing like exclusiveness , although Church , Huntington , and Leutze do cover the greatest amount of space on the walls of the gallery . But size is not a measure of interest , of merit , or of cost , in matters of art , and therefore we suppose the little Meissonier , the well proportioned G*rome , and the historical picture by Muller , represent as much art and as much wealth , if less of patriotism , than the enormous examples of native talent just mentioned . Mr. Roberts ' G6rome , in point of color , is the finest that we know of in New York . Prisoners and slaves , guarded by Arabs , are seen moving towards the spectator on the sands of the East . The // hot and dusty look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a brawny negro from the Niger , coupled with wooden shackles , heads wrapped in the sheltering folds of white kaiks , while arms and legs and feet are bare to the sun and sand , are rendered with the hand of an unsparing , indefatigable , and masterly observer . What a group of surly and repugnant animals , subjected by treachery , or force , to the will of covetous and unscrupulous masters ! It is in a picture like this that G6rome 's accuracy and thoroughness do us a great service . Here the painter who travels is as much as-he is even more than  --  the photographer . Here is a representative picture , which show s us the actual conditions of life in the intercourse between the races and tribes bordering the great desert . This picture is wholly interesting-interesting as art , interesting as a glimpse of the populous and barbaric East , where , under burning skies , and by the shores of sluggish rivers , or across desert-sands , the animal , t ! e brute in human form , obeys thse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pause and think of destiny and fate , which hold so many races in the ruts of time , and bestow no glimmer upon them of that light by which we live and hope and love  --  the light of an ideal civilization . The absolute G6rome , whose talent is sufficiently understood by people interested in the subject of my article , was , as the French say , never better inspired than when he painted this picture . It is one of his masterpieces , being more solidly painted , more vivid in color , more mellow and harmonious in effect , than most of his paintings . The " gentle reader , " somewhat neglected for the reason that he is somewhat indifferent to G6rome 's work , has not been forgotten . We have observed him poring fondly over some of the pre*jirtistic examples of American art in Mr. Roberts ' gallery-poring fondly over little futile bits , feeble sketches , and before great canvases that were painted when lie was young ! He is a tender shade among the pathetic remains of the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York journalist , much less in face of an instructed and exacting lover of art ; but they are pictures which fill one with sadness , and suggest the sere and yellow leaf of artistic fame , and remind us how difficult it is fur us who last but a little while to make a work that shall last . A great subject is not enough ; the matter is often of so little importance in art , that the manner alone seems to be the part that floats a work and keeps a name fresh in the memory . But , shall a Meissonier , with his marvellous execution , touch , and tone , and drawing , and expression , employed on mean or poor or common subjects , last , while hosts of painters of sacred subjects , and pictorial and retrospective historians , have none to show them reverence ? Shall patience and dexterity of hand and exact observation do more for a man 's name than his power to sympathize with the noble , the good , the beautiful ? In the immortality of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , is the only pledge of the duration of a man 's work and name . His sympathies , his intentions , all that makes him a delightful and attaching social being , counts for very little in art for , in art it is not the matter , but the manner , that constitutes the particular glory of the artist . If the subject , if variety and fulness of meaning , were more than the style , Gertell 's " Father Time and his Fa*nily " in Mr. Roberts ' gallery would have made him more famous than Meissonier was made by his " Chess-Players . " And yet , it must be said that the greatest art must be the greatest subject expressed in the grandest manner . We are disposed to ignore this , for no American figure-painter has ever given us so much . Al ! ston alone , were he now lix*ing , might do it . He had the mind , the culture , the heart for it ; but he lived when painters were bound by tradition , and seemed exclusively retrospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now before Mr. Roberts ' Meissonier . It represents the costume of a // soldier of the seventeenth century , and the face of a very modern fellow . It is a beautiful piece of painting , clear , bright , exact . On this little pannel the art of the painter is expressive of traits of character which must always command respect and sometimes admiration . But if at any time in the study and admiration cf art , save when before a Ternet , a man may be excused for thanking God he is not like this man , it should be before a Meissonier . We all understand that he is unrivalled in his genre , that he is a positive fact in art as in life , that he is no trifler , no loose and careless and listless worker ; we all know his power of application , his love of clothes , weapons , furniture , and the material life of men ; we all call him master , and salute him . But would it not be well , out of respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in man , to ask , now and then , what is the world to Meissonier , what does he introduce us to , and is not his work most appropriately placed in the galleries of unthinking and heartless men ? elsewhere it can have place only as an object of curiosity and fashion . Thank God , there are but few Meissoniers among painters-that is , men who limit our sympathies and never appeal to the ideal , never seek for the beauty that is in all the fresh and natural and spontaneous and uncorrupted objects that bless us in life . The insensibility of Ingres to contemporary life is better than Meissonier 's , because he was infatuated with old Greek and Italian types of beauty . Meissonier 's art is illustrative of soldiers , drinkers , gamblers , duellists , chess-playing gallants , sometimes in tragic situations , never in tender or humanizing ones ; yet he makes all these costumed creatures wonderfully attractive by his picturesque and vivid realism . But will you not gladly turn from Meissonier 's guardsman smokin* , to contemplate a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a higher level , and makes you think of the grace and majesty and tenderness and gentle firmness that may be compounded with human clay , to make a martyr-woman , the wan and worn Marie Antoinette , seem to you one of the most awful and lovely and pathetic figures that human eyes have ever contemplated ? You are before Muller 's Marie Antoinette replying to the nameless accusation of " scandalous Ilebert . " And how well the artist has rendered the mother in the dignity , firmness , and proud scorn of her outraged nature ! Art is of double service to us here-it serves our historical sense and celebrates an awful and heroic moment in the life of a woman . To us , the Christian martyr , virgin or mother , under the cruel eyes of a persecuting populace , waiting , breathless , dumb , or exalted by religious hope , for the devouring beasts of the Roman Amphitheatre , is not a more awful spectacle , not a more illustrious witness of the dignity and heroism of human nature , than Marie Antoinette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble and firm bearing of that high-bred and lovely woman , grief-struck and appalled , yet , as mother , wife , and woman , an object sacred and immortal in history , the artist has caught for the eye to appreciate upon his canvas ; and with this noble picture , the thoughts it quickens , the feelings it touches , we will leave you in Mr. Marshall 0 . Roberts ' gallery , where the historical department of art is largely and impressively filled , and upon which Mr. Roberts seems to have bestowed much intelligent and generous appreciation . // A NEW STORY OF GENERAL PUTNAM . THE eventful career of the sturdy , lion-hearted Israel Putnam has ever been the especial theme of historical interest to the American schoolboy ; and the romantic and unusual incidents that color it are not likely to pass from his memory after attaining the years and sentiments of manhood . It is doubtful , indeed , whether the whole record of American history , colonial , revolutionary , and federal , can produce a character , who , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be named with " Old Put . " With him this quality appears to have been an instinct , even to the point of recklessness ; and the audacious affairs of the wolf 's den , the powder-magazine , and the ride at Horseneck , seem to have occurred merely from the ordinary exercise of this amazing quality by the man who , as his tombstone truly declares , " dared to lead where any dared to follow . " In other words , his lofty heroism was no exceptional or erratic display ; it pervaded his whole nature , and stood forth at once upon any adequate call of duty . He was born , as is well known , in Massachusetts , but removed to Connecticut early in life , in which latter State much of his military service and several of his most conspicuous acts of daring were performed . Western New York was settled , during the early part of the present century , in great part by emigration from Connecticut . Many of the pioneers of the Genesee and Niagara are still to be seen among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with solid satisfaction the substantial fruits of their early industry and hardships . Going back only one generation from them , we find ourselves in the goodly company of the continentals and revolutionary patriots , with Putnam , Stark , Warren , and the rest ; and very many are the reminiscences of this initial period in our na tional history-which might be gathered from the lips of these aged men as they received them from their fathers , of which written history has no knowledge . I lately met one of these pioneers , a venerable and intelligent farmer of nearly fourscore years , who was brought by his father from Connecticut to his new home in the " Holland Purchase , " so called , in his childhood . The father was a soldier of the Revolution , and had served under General Putnam in his own State . The incidents and general recollections of his campaigns , as he had related them to his son , in the spirit of the veteran who delights to " Shoulder his crutch , and show how fields were won , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to Putnam and his exploits . " My father knew him well , " said my informant , " and always spoke of him as the bravest man in the war . He never could mention his name without his eyes kindling and his cheek flushing with excitement ; and he loved to talk about Putnam and his exploits above every thing else . " Believing that our own late struggle for our nationality has more closely endeared to us the memories of the men of 76 , who struggled for it before us , I propose to submit to the reader , in brief the most interesting of the anecdotes of Putnam that I received from the source referred to . It is so perfectly characteristic of the man , as history paints him , and the way in which it comes to me is so perfectly satisfactory , that I have no hesitation in expressing my entire confidence in its truth . It will be observed that the Indian adventure which forms the groundwork of the story bears considerable resemblance to one of Putnam ' s adventures which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in one place * I find succinctly stated as follows : " The same year ( 1758 ) , when returning to Fort Edward from an expedition to watch the enemy in the neighborhood of Ticonderoga , his corps was surprised by a party of French and Indians , and he himself captured and bound to a tree . While in this situation a battle between his own party and the enemy raged around him for an hour . The tree against which he was placed was part of the time in the hottest fire . A French officer , passing by , struck him in the jaw with the butt of his gun . An Indian amused himself for some time hurling his tomahawk into the trunk of the tree to satisfy himself how near he could come to the prisoner 's body , and yet miss it . At length the party of French and Indians were forced to retreat , but carried with them their captive , whom the savages determined to roast alive . He was tied to a tree , and the fire was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention of the French commander , Molang . " My informant was positive , however , that the adventure with the Indians which his father related to him was an entirely different one ; and as its termination appears to have been so unlike this , and the early experience of Putnam in command of a company of rangers in the old French War was unquestionably filled with hazards and escapes not noticed by history , it appears to me that he is correct , and that the whole story may be taken as a new one . For greater convenience , I will allow the father to speak in the first person.t There was in my company , in the Connecticut regiment that I served in during the Revolution , a soldier by the name of Patterson . He was a young man , and his father and grandfather before him had served in Putnam 's Rangers against the French and Indians . * New American Cyclopndia , vol. xiii . p. 673 . As the facts stated in this article possess a histoilcal importance , the writer holds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inajjiry . His grandfather was of course too old to take the field in the Revolution , and his father was laid up with rheumatism , or something of that kind ; so Rufus , my comrade , had to sustain the honor of the family in this war  --  and well he did it . Three or four times during our campaigns , when we happened to see General Putnam riding by the camp , or on the march , Rufus would say to me , " Stephen , the first good chance I get , I 'm going to speak to the General , and ask him if he remembers my father and grandfather in the old war twenty years aoo " I knew what he particularly had in his mind ; it was an adventure that the General , then Captain Putnam , had with the Indians , in company with these men , father and son . I had often heard Rufus tell it , as they told it to him . It seems that Putnam was out scouting in the woods with only half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ambushed by a much larger party of Indians . The first volley disabled three of the men ; the Pattersons escaped by flight ; but Putnam , for some reason , was taken prisoner with the wounded men . The savages immediately proceeded to their horrible work of torture . Lying on the ground , unarmed , bound , and helpless , Putnam saw his unfortunate comrades taken one by one from his side , stripped , bound to a tree , and slowly tortured with a devilish ingenuity , the details of which are too shocking to repeat . When death had mercifully relieved the last of them from his torments , Putnam was himself tied to the tree , and the Indians began their caperings about him , brandishing their knives and tomahawks in his face , and shouting their exultation . The captive was fortifying his soul for the horrors of the fate that seemed to have overtaken him , and had abandoned all hope of earthly salvation , when it reached him in a most unexpected manner . The reports of two rifles were heard close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fell dead . Two others were wounded by the same balls ; and the savages , panic-struck at the suddenness // of the attack , and probably thinking that a large rescuing party was at hand , took to flight and disappeared . The rescuers , however , were only the two Pattersons , who , finding that they had effected their own escape by their fleetness , concluded that they could not leave their captain and comrades in the hands of the Indians without some attempt to deliver them . With a daring characteristic of the scout , they made their way in the darkness to a shelter within a few feet of the tree selected for the sacrifice , reaching the place just as Putnam was dragged up . The boldness and desperation of their attack insured its success . A few strokes of the knife released the captive , and the three hastened with all speed from the scene of their peril . After proceeding a few miles through the forest , Putnam halted , and told his companions that he had been without sleep for thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight lay before them to the nearest place of safety , he proposed to take just five minutes ' rest . Only five minutes , mind I " he said , giving to the elder Patterson his silvercased watch . " We can spare that much time , and the sleep will do me wonderful good . " He lay down on the ground and instantly fell into a sound slumber , while his humble companions watched over him . So sound and refreshing was his sleep that they hesitated to wake him as he had enjoined ; and full fifteen minutes had passed before they aroused him . lie sprang up and looked at the timepiece ; and discovering what time had passed , he flew into a rage , and reprimanded the men who had just saved his life in the severest terms , and not without a few round oaths , for venturing to disobey his orders . They received it , on their part , without anger , as they perfectly knew the man , and understood that he was a generous friend as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio to the nearest settlement was prosecuted without further remarkable peril . Rufus Patterson frequently told me that since the disbandment of the cobnial forces at the close of the French War , his father and grandfather had never met Putnam . I inferred , indeed , from all that he said  --  and he naturally liked to talk of the subject-that after this adventure they were detailed upon such service that neither of them was brought particularly to the notice of the Captain again . They heard , in common with their neighbors , that Congress had made him a major-general , and they learned with eage* interest , as the war went on , of the valiant service which their former Captain was giving his country in his high position ; but being very poor as well as very humble , and , since the infirmities of the one and the lameness of the other , never travelling beyond their little garden , no opportunity had offered since the beginning of the war for a meeting with the General . My comrade , in telling me this , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out General Putnam and ask him if he remembered the Pattersons . " Of course , I would n't ask nor take any reward , " he would add ; " but the General is a great man now , and I should be proud to tell him that I am the son of one of the men that saved him from torture and death by the Indians , and the grandson of the other . " His opportunity came in the Spring of 1779 , I think ; certainly , just before the British under Tryon invaded the State . It so happened that a brigade of Continentals was stationed within half a mile of the Pattersons ' house ; and a change in the divisions brought our regiment into that brigade , much to the delight of my comrade . The morning we reached this place , and before Rufus had obtained leave to visit his home , we received an order to be ready for muster and inspection at two o'clock , when General Putnam would review the brigade . " Now is your time , Rufus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accoutrements . But Rufus was a shy , bashful fellow , although a good soldier ; and I anticipated that he would never summon the courage to address the General on // this or any other subject . As it happened , he was saved the effort . The General rode on the ground very early , the orderly 's call had been sounded , and the companies were forming for roll-call . It was twenty minutes , at least , before the time for forming brigade-line , and the General spent the interval in riding about through the camps , looking at the men and the quarters . He passed around among our tents accompanied by the colonel and two or three other officers , all mounted . I perfectly remember how he appeared as he rode along in front of our company and looked sharply at us . He was middle-sized , neither tall nor short , strongly built , with a full , round fa9e , ilorid complex* ion , and eyes as keen as a hawk 's . He wore his full uniform of a major-general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse that he rode . It was the same that afterward carried him safely on his wonderful ride down the declivity at Horseneck ; a powerfnl , strong-limbed animal , black and handsome , and with a mettlesome eye and action . Just as this horse and his rider reached the front of our company , the orderly-sergeant came to the name of Patterson on his roll , and called it aloud . The attention of the General was instantly attracted . He reined in his horse . " Patterson-Patterson ! " he exelaimed . " Is there a man of that name in this company ? " " Yes , sir , " answered the sergeant . " Let him step out here . " Rufus took three paees to the front , and the General 's eager , animated face changed its expression to something like disappointment . " Humph  --  a young man , " said he . " Did you have any relatives in the French War l " " Yes , General , " answered Rufus , speaking fast , between excitement and anxiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rangers in Colonel Lyman 's regiment ; they have told me often about saving you from the Indians when- " " Are they alive ? Where do they vOL. vi. - *o live ? How can I find them I " Putnam asked in a breath , interrupting the story which none knew better than himself . " They are both alive , General , and live in that little house which you see yonder , with the roof rising above the top of the hill . " Both spurs went together into the sides of the black horse , and with a snort and a bound the animal was off at a mad gallop . The distance from the camp to the home of the Pattersons was , as I have said , about half a mile . The land ascended gradually towards the house , terminating in a hill , on the further side of which the dwelling stood . It was mostly fresh-ploughed soil , and three or more high stone fences crossed it at right angles with a line drawn straight from the camp to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ; but the General never stopped to inquire about that , lie reached the first fence with his aids ten rods behind him . We heard him shout to the noble animal that carried him , and over he went at a flying leap , which drew a cheer from every man that saw it . The aids pulled up and went around by the road . We watched the fearless horse and rider , and saw them rapidly clear the heavy ground , taking the intervening fences in the same style , and presently disappear from sight over the brow of the hill . The interview of General Putnam with the Pattersons was afterward related to me by their housekeeper , who witnessed it . She heard a quick rap on the door , and opening it , saw Putnam , who was unknown to her , sitting on his horse . " Are the Pattersons here ? " he asked . " Tell them both to come out here . " " Here 's an officer at the door wants to see you , " the woman called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back room . " Let him come in here , then , " gruffly replied the old man , who rightly regarded his years , his infirmities , and his good service to his country , as entitled to consideration . " If he wants to so // me worse than I do him , he can come where I am . " The General plainly heard the reply . " The devil take your impudence 1 " he roared . " And you too , " sturdily returned the other . " Do you know who I am ? " the General asked , emphasizing the inquiry with an oath . " No  --  and I do n't care , " responded old Patterson , with an expletive equally profane . " Did you ever hear of Israel Putnam , you old rascal ? " the General thundered , fast getting into a rage . The old man had been sitting where he could not see the other ; but at the mention of the name he rose from his chair , and hobbled on his crutches out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he eagerly exclaimed . " Good Lord , is he the man I 've been treating in this shabby way , at my own door ? " While he was coming slowly forward , trying to see the face of his visitor with his imperfect vision , Putnam recognized him ; and dismounting with a jump , he threw his reins to one of the aids who just then rode up , and running into the house , caught the old soldier in his arms , crutches and all , and embraced him , while the old man wept tears of pride and pleasure . The younger Patterson soon came limping in , and he was the recipient of a like hearty recognition by the bluff General . The next hour was passed by these three in pleasant , familiar intercourse , during which the rescue of Putnam from the savages was thoroughly discussed , the Pattersons readily forgetting , for the while , that their visitor had any other title or dignity than that of their old Captain . He spoke in terms of the warmest gratitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated and fruitless efforts to find them since that memorable escape ; and , as Rufus afterwards told me , they both felt , when he had gone , that his visit was worth ten years of good , wholesome enjoyment to them . " I suppose you have n't forgotten , General , " said old Patterson , rather grumblingly , " what a savage scolding you gave me for letting you sleep ten minutes too long while we were escap-ing ? " Putnam roared with laughter . " Did I do that ? " he asked . " Well , that was pretty hard ; but you know my ways , of course . Obey orders , first , last , and always ; that is my motto , you know . But did you feel as though you would be likely to let the redskins do their worst with me the next time ? " " No. sir , " replied the old soldier ; " I never thought any such thing . I was n't angry a bit . I never had a commander like Captain Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise . " General Putnam probably made due allowance for the old man 's extravagance of speech , and gave him credit for all he felt . " You are poor , I should judge , " he said , looking at the scanty furniture and bare floors . " Yes , General , " replied the son , " we have pretty hard work to live . It was hard before the war , when my boy was at home to help ; but he 's in the army , of course , fighting for the country , as his father and grandfather did before him , and as I would be doing now , but for this rheumatiz . " " I am far from rich myself , " remarked Putnam ; " hut I 've enough for myself and my family , and something to spare ; and nobody has so good a claim on the surplus as you two . Get me a piece of paper . " A scrap torn from the fly-leaf of a book was brought to him , on which he wrote some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I live , " he said , as he handed it to the son . One of the aids of the brigadier-general now came to report that the troops were in line , ready for review ; and with a hearty shake of the hand and a " God bless you 1 " General Putnam returned to the camp . The paper that he left was an order on the commissary of the brigade for a barrel of flour , a barrel of meal , a barrel each of pork , beef , and sugar , at the expense of General Putnam ; commodi
