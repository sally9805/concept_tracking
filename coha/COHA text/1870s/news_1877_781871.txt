txt A certain famous wit was once invited to dinner by a miser , who placed on the table two microscopic cutlets , with the ominous comment , " You see your dinner . " The wag promptly helped himself . to both , and retorted ' ' Yes , but I do n't see yours 1 " Time same inequality of division characterizes the descriptions given of the Russian officers by Col. BRACKENBURY and by his brother critics at the seat of war , the one taking all their good points , the other none at all . One account sets before us a model mess , containing " not a single man given to quarreling or intoxication " ; the other startles us with a crowd of gamesters , drunkards , and libertines , incapable in action , neglectful of duty , and , iu a word , amply verifying the bitter old saying , " The best army is the one which has lost all its officers . " But this seeming contradiction is easily accounted for . At home the majority of these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast amount of idle time on their hands , exposed to . all the temptations of a great city , with little or nothing to keep them steady . In the field they are seen under the purifying influences of hard service and trying duty , with a weighty responsibility to sober them and the hope of distinction to spur them on . In presence of the enemy the veriest scapegrace will often show himself capable of better things ; and few veteran commanders can not parallel from their own experience the famous assault of Minorca , when " the General 's threat that no intoxicated person should be allowed to join the forlorn hope Ppoduced a temperance unexampled in the annals of the regiment . " Russian officers may be broadly divided into two classes  --  men of good family , who have held commissions from the outset ' and veterans who have fought their way up from the ranks . Each class has its own characteristic merits and defects . The Porphyrogeuiti are lavish and careless , lax in their notions of duty , prone to high living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every sense " good company . " The self'made men are apt to be harsh and narrowminded , strict even to cruelty in obeying orders , but rigidly faithful , always attentive to duty , and , as those can testify who have encountered them in Siberia and Central Asia , oftenfarkinder , in their rough way , than men of more prepossessing exterior . Perhaps the best living type of this latter class is Gen. KOLPAKOVSKI , the military Governor of the Semiretchinsk ( Seven Rivers ) District , ill the north-east angle of Russian Turkistan . Possessed of vast strength and commanding stature , with a cool courage never shaken by any peril , he has earned the respect of the native tribes by a series of exploits such as they can fully appreciate . On one occasion he achieved a three day 's ride across the steppes , leaving on the way , utterly exhausted , eleven of his twelve Tartar attendants  --  in honor of which feat the tribe gave him an unpronounceable native title signifying " the chief with the iron body . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the following anecdote : During the campaign of 1871 , which first planted the Russian flag beyond the Chinese border , Gen. ( then Col. ) KOLPAKOVSKI was crossing the mountains with a detachment of Cossacks , when one of them announced that his horse had fallen lame . The Colonel promptly sent him back ; but when a second Cossack , coveting the like indulgence , came up with a similar complaint IiOLPAKOVSK1 bade him dismount and lead his horse over the rocks , an exercise which , in a temperature of 95 degrees in the shade , left the unfortunate man all but dead by nightfall . The charge of indifference to the welfare of their Men , so often brought against the town-bred officers , though lamentably true in many cases , is by no means so in all . Those Who were in St. Petersburg five years ago , remember the ease of a young subaltern who , after a long and hard day 's work , was found , late in the evening , teaching some of his men to read and write , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Russian officers are not of this type ; and what they may become under the training of the capital , a single instance will show . In 1872 , a young Lieutenant ill one of the " crack " regiments , being grossly annoyed by his comrades on account of his non-participation in their orgies , demanded satisfaction , and , being refused it , laid the ease before his Colonel . The latter treated him so discourteously as to provoke him to a challenge , which the commanding officer scornfully declined . Next morning , as the Colonel was strolling along the Nevski Prospect , ( the Russian Broadway , ) he found himself collared by the injured subaltern , who gave him a hearty thrashing there and then , the Colonel 's only effort at resistance being to ' shriek for the Police . The affair resulted in the Colonel being cashiered and his assailant reduced to the ranks ; but the latter 's bravery during the Khiva expedition regained him his former grade . Such facts require no comment .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
