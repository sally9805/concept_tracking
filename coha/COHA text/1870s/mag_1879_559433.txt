THE STAGNATION OF TRADE AND ITS CAUSE . THE nations of the world are suffering severe commercial depression . The public press in many countries abounds with unceasing comments on this painful fact . Public men of every kind , economical writers , and men engaged in industry , ardently discuss its nature and its consequences . The charitable come forward to relieve the sufferings which it creates , and plunge into discussions on the nature and fitting limits of beneficent charity . Writers of great power debate the causes and the presumptive remedies of this depression . Heavy reductions of wages are demanded by employers who have lost all profit , amid a war of strikes , in the name of the stagnation of business . The workmen retort that they are victims of the oppression of capitalists . Traders , under the impulse of severe losses and the agitations of despair , challenge the convictions of their reason , and , abandoning reflection and judgment , seek help from the delusive follies of protection . A kind of chaos seems to have come over the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings and these anxieties-spread over so many countries-one fact presents itself which is calculated to excite surprise . The depression has gone on and has been keenly discussed for years , yet its true nature and the real cause which has generated it do not yet seem to have been recognized . Every kind of explanation is given of it . It is made to be the offspring of multitudinous causes ; nevertheless , a clear perception of its true character , and of what has brought it to pass , is still wanting . Even chambers of commerce , filled with men of the highest commercial ability , appear to have some , if not theory , at least special view , of their own . Statesmen , too , speak of it as a subject which they do not understand . Not , indeed , that the right explanation is absolutely wanting-in some quarters it has been distinctly pointed // out  --  but it has not yet reached the stage of a publicly recognized fact . Yet to know what this fearful commercial depression means , and what brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for warning and for cure . There are misdoings on which responsibility for the calamity mainly lies , and there are mistaken practices to be shunned , and right action to be adopted , to bring the suffering to the earliest practicable end . What , then , is commercial depression ? Want of buyers . And how come buyers to be few and weak ? Because there is an immense diminution of the means of purchasing . And in what does the power of buying consist ? In goods to give in exchange-with the exception of a relatively small amount of articles previously made , in commodities produced for the very purpose of being exchanged with one another . This is the one characteristic peculiarity of the economical life of man . Particular goods , needed by the whole community , are made by special makers , and they are distributed to those who require them for use , that is , to consumers , by the makers obtaining from each other what they want for their own needs . The baker makes bread for the town , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supply of his wants . When the various producers are fairly occupied with their several industries , many exchanges are carried out , much buying and selling takes place , and trade is said to be prosperous . Commercial depression is the exact reverse . It is stagnant trade-trade paralyzed , and mills and factories work on a smaller scale or are closed , banks and commercial firms break , wages are lowered , workmen and their families are reduced to des*tution . All this misery comes from a single cause : there are fewer goods to buy with , less wealth to be exchanged , diminished supplies of food , capital , clothing , and raw materials wherewith to keep laborers at work . They are unable to maintain the full production of those commodities which society requires . In other words , simply and plainly , commercial depression is poverty-poverty among consumers and would-be buyers . This poverty first springs up among those who have been deprived of the ordinary products of their industry , and then it passes on to sellers who find that buyers fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods to give in exchange . Mere truisms these , we shall be told ; what help can they bring ? The knowledge , be it answered , of the malady from which the world is now suffering , of the cure to be adopted , and of the bad practices to be avoided in the future . They are every-day truths , // no doubt , but such common truths are emphatically the strength of political economy , and of the proper conduct of business . The practices which they speak of , known as they are to all , are the very things which occur to no one when unusual pressure steps in , and are the very forces which make nations rich or poor . They reveal the essence of all industry and of all trade , common and obvious though they be . At the present moment they give rise to the critical question , How has it come to pass that the goods wherewith to buy have become so few ? Diverse answers are given to this question , which are not truisms-very far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no money to buy with , " exclaim shopkeepers ; but such an answer does not throw the faintest light on the dark problem . Nations are not made poor , nor their mines and factories shut up , nor emigrant laborers driven back to their old homes , because gold and pieces of paper are in one place rather than in another . Money , whatever be included under the term , is a mere tool , absolutely nothing else . It renders no other service to mankind than to place property in different hands ; it does not add to or diminish commodities . As well explain the badness of the wheat crop by talking of the farmer 's carts . Whether a country is prosperous or depressed , the quantity of money contained in it varies by very trifling amounts . The means with which every man buys are his income , and incomes , be they rent , profits , wages , or dividends , are nothing else but the share each man obtains of the commodities produced . These shares may become much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are taken being increased or diminished , and yet no change will have taken place in the quantity of coin in the country . Money , then , reveals nothing which will help us to understand the causes of the commercial depression . A far more favorite explanation is found in the phrase " over-production . " It seems supported by such visible evidence . Vast stocks are piled up at mines and factories waiting for buyers , but none come . Merchandise is offered in every market all over the world , but no orders for shipment arrive . Production , people say , has been overdone ; the natural wants of consumers have been grossly exceeded by speculative manufacturers ; can any one wonder that purchasers can not overtake them ? That there is over-production now going on , with much harm to traders , is an undeniable fact . The existence of the excessive stocks and the dismissals of workmen are proofs of overmaking // which can not be gainsaid . How this over-production has been brought about will be explained presently . Nevertheless , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second stage of the disease , not the first . It is a common occurrence that particular markets should be brought under severe reduction of prices and difficulty of sales by an over-supply of commodities ; but this over-supply is local , temporary , and speculative . It tends rapidly to cure itself . Merchants and producers , with heedless eagerness , have taken an exaggerated view of the capacity of a particular market to dispose of a large amount of their goods . They make ventures , which are essentially experiments whether the market will take off the wares hazarded . Such miscalculations were frequent in the colonial trade when the colonies were smaller , and the steamboat and the telegraph had not yet come forward to reveal the true state of the markets . But these miscalculations speedily cure themselves . Traders are not permanent gamblers , and this kind of over-production soon reckons up its losses and ceases . The depression which now weighs upon the world exhibits features of a different kind . Its distinguishing characteristic is that it sweeps over many countries . It presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easily conceivable that England should have produced more goods than China could buy under her circumstances , or India , or America , or Russia . She may have reckoned on the ordinary demand from one of these countries ; it may have failed her through causes peculiar to each case , and then her goods may have found no buyers . The consequences to some may have been painful-factories for a while over-stocked , and makers and men involved in temporary trouble . But general over-production , extending over many countries simultaneously , is a totally different matter ; it can not be regarded as possible . The world is far short , as yet , of that stage when there is already wealth enough-when no one desires to have more enjoyments , and when he will make no industrial effort to obtain them . The maximum of necessaries and gratifications has not yet been reached by mankind . The reverse is true-millions of men and women have not enough to consume . They want more and work for more , and this means that by producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off . This increased production moves upon the old lines . Each branch of industry furnishes more goods , and these can be sold easily , because each producer has a larger supply of his own products wherewith // to purchase those of others . Great production on every side can not imply scarcity of purchasing power and of buyers , but the direct contrary . The continuance of production after the means of buying have disappeared may easily become excessive , and generate mischievous effects ; but that excess will be the offspring of underproduction in some quarter which has suspended its ability to trade . We thus arrive at over-consumption , that is , the consuming and destroying more wealth than is made , as the true explanation of that commercial depression which may be termed universaL Subsequent partial over-production has aggravated it , but was not its original parent . It thus becomes a matter of surpassing interest to inquire , if possible , what are the causes which have brought the world into this condition . How has it happened that so many nations have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thereby have landed themselves in impoverishment and distress ? We may hope to learn from such an inquiry some lessons that may guard against the recurrence of so great a misfortune . How , then , has it come to pass that the means of buying , that the quantity of goods to exchange , have been so fearfully reduced ? Let us turn our eyes , in the first place , to India and to China : these countries will furnish us with terrible illustrations of over-consumption . They were visited with great famines ; and there is no overconsumption severer than that created by famine . The cost of cultivation is increased , laborers are fed and clothed , tools bought and used , seed destroyed , a whole year 's capital annihilated , and there is no crop ; no replacement of the things destroyed . The population is ground down to poverty , many perish-as Ireland testified in 1847 ; a second outlay of food and clothing has to be expended for one crop ; the power of buying is annihilated . Comforts and luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be supplied to China and India all but vanished from English and American markets . How was Manchester to sell calico , and Bradford woolen cloth , to the East when there was nothing to pay for them-no Chinese and Indian wealth to send back in exchange ? Depression and its cause here present themselves very vividly to the eyes of all who have the will and the intelligence to see . Let us now turn to the United States : they have instruction to give us of the highest value . They occupy a prominent place in this cycle of depression . In no small degree they set it revolving . The part which America took in creating the commercial depression was // of her own choosing : China and India suffered from a dispensation of Providence . America never gave a thought to the obvious law that to consume more than is restored by subsequent industry lands man and nation in impoverishment . She constructed railways with mad eagerness in the wilderness , never stopping to inquire what it was that she was doing . She never deigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What so prolific of wealth as railways ? Had not Robert Stephenson pointed out years ago that the railways had paid off the national debt of England ? These iron roads were the very contrivance for making the American people rich ; they would bring their vast fields and enormous products into close neighborhood with the markets of the world . Those who had settled , or were intending to settle , in the far West , investors eager to employ their capital , speculators on the stock-exchanges , all rushed forward to build railways . They fed and clothed countless laborers , burned huge stocks of coal in making iron , emptied the warehouses and stores of the Eastern States on the busy workers in the West , consumed and destroyed immense accumulations of wealth . The goods perished ; but by what were they replaced ? By rich agricultural crops , by manufactured products streaming forth from mills and factories ? By nothing of the kind . The consumption of wealth made tunnels and embankments , and long lines of rails , and that was all . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been identically the same as if the energetic laborers of America had been set to dig holes in the ground and to fill them up again . Here was over-consumption indeed . But , it will be asked , Does the construction of railroads necessarily impoverish ? No , not necessarily ; but the distinction merits the most careful attention from all who wish well to their country . Railways , docks , factories , mines , and similar constructions , are what political economy calls fixed capital , of which the distinguishing characteristic is that their cost , the capital consumed in constructing them , is not repaid at once , but only after a period more or less long , generally for years . A small portion of what they use up in being made is replaced out of profits each revolving year ; the remainder , though a diminishing quantity , continues to be an uncompensated loss . If , therefore , the construction of fixed capital is carried out to excess , diminution of wealth is the necessary consequence . But what is excess ? What defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninvested savings available at the time . But what are savings ? The amount of wealth produced , the surplus // beyond what restores all the capital laid out in production , profits and wages included . Savings are really surplus income coming in beyond what the owner had to spend naturally , or the manufacturer requires to replace all his cost . That surplus may be consumed in any way without harm ; it may be thrown into the sea , and no poverty is incurred . It is not savings yet ; it becomes savings when it is not laid out in luxuries or increased enjoyment , but is applied as capital to enlarging the means of future production . The man who has ten thousand pounds a year , which he can spend lawfully without injury , if he devotes three thousand pounds to the draining of his estate , spending only seven thousand pounds on his living , saves . He makes his land a more productive machine for wealth , and its produce is permanently larger . Precisely in the same manner , if a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved , there is no over-consumption , no impoverishment . Every expense of the nation had been provided for-what had been won over and above could be disposed of in any way without loss . The United States built railroads , not out of savings , but out of capital , and became poorer and depressed . But the mischief does not end here . Over-consumption brings in those leaps and bounds in trade of which Mr. Gladstone speaks . It makes a nation bubble over with excitement . The demand for commodities is unnaturally increased . The railway works call for iron and coal , and endless other articles . The supply gave rise to higher profits and wages ; the movement was felt in every store . Luxurious expenditure raised its head ; multitudes of bankers , stock-brokers , engineers , manufacturers , multiplied their purchases , and enlarged their destruction of wealth . Then burst forth new speculations , fresh enterprises , the undulation of excitement and consumption ever expanding . The laborers feel the impulse ; and , if they are Englishmen , and not Frenchmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the universal move* ment . They marry in greater numbers and at an earlier age , thus sowing in this artificial ground the seed of much misery in the future . Then at last comes the rebound . There is no more to buy with , and overwhelming is the collapse . Commercial depression avenges the universal misconduct with sufferings whose acuteness is but too well understood . Such was the course pursued in America , and what have been its consequences ? From 1873 until the last bountiful harvest brought back a portion of their lost wealth to the wasteful , a commercial // depression weighed down the country severer yet than that which overtook England . Coal and iron mines stopped working , blastfurnaces were blown out , factories stood still , hundreds of thousands of working people were reduced to idleness , wages rapidly fell , railway traffic declined , immigrants fell away , destitute laborers left the country , strikes broke out into open rebellion , and a widespread mercantile stringency harassed the whole nation for years . If we cross the Atlantic to Germany the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effect . In 1870 Germany waged a mighty war with France  --  and what but famine can vie with war in destructiveness to wealth ? Think of the multitudes of men whom it converts from producers into consumers only ! War replaces nothing that it destroys ; impoverishment is its inevitable offspring . But did not the indemnity make all right for Germany ? What might not two hundred and twenty million pounds effect in the way of remedy ? Everything , if only they had reached Germany in the shape of goods , of useful wealth , to replace as capital what had been consumed . But what could gold avail for the relieving of German distress ? The currency of Germany was not deficient , and the new gold could be applied to no restoring process . It could not be turned into wheels for moving machinery , not become food and clothing for a laboring and distressed people . So long as it remained in Germany , all that it could accomplish was to put material wealth into different hands , and this it could do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been if it had been locked up and hoarded , if it was bound to remain in Germany . A large portion of this gold was applied to military purposes , to the building of fortresses . Their cost was enormous ; they consumed without reproducing , precisely as the American railroads , with this difference , however , on the bad side , that in the end the railroads will repay their cost and be permanent increasers of the national wealth . Nor was this all the harm that the indemnity gold did . Another portion the Government lent to speculators , who retained it within the country . They bought German goods in abundance : prices rose , brilliant profits were realized , and the same fatal tale was repeated . Luxurious consumption spread ; instead of restoring what the war had destroyed by parsimony , prodigality magnified the disaster , and the French gold wore the appearance of a clear contrivance devised by France for avenging her reverses . France presents a spectacle of a different kind ; yet France , // too , was a victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on within her territory . Her fields were laid waste , her food for men and horses destroyed , her factories widely suspended where contending hosts were struggling , her laborers called away from their industry and enrolled in unproductive regiments , her capital annihilated in guns and gunpowder . Then came the indemnity ; but , fortunately , her thrifty peasants had piled up hoards in their rural homes : it could be lent to the French Government , and leave France without any injury to her industry or her practical wealth . But what was not gold had to be sent away in material wealth , and each year as it revolves finds France pressed with an increase of taxation , amounting to thirty millions of pounds sterling . If ever nation might have been expected in modern times to exhibit the picture of universal ruin it was France . It was far otherwise . France astonished mankind with a power of fighting depression , a strength of recovery , unequaled in history . Her people suffer , but with no sense of overwhelming poverty . The piledup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what is this wonderful sight due ? To the practice of the greatest of economical virtues . France saved . She met impoverishment with parsimony . She diminished the consumption of enjoyments , to apply the resources thereby , gained to the maintenance of her capital employed in production . These are the realities of practical political economy , and what fruit do they not bear ? England now comes upon the stage . She is found walking in the same path of over-consumption . Since 1870 England has been busy with destroying more wealth than she made , to a degree unequaled by any other country except , perhaps , America . Innumerable are the forces which bear on her commercial position . She trades with all the world , she manufactures for many nations , her industries depend on their power of purchasing ; their fortunes she necessarily shares . If her customers thrive , she prospers ; if their means of buying fail , the blow is felt in every corner of her land . Their prosperity and their adversity are really also her own . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the world in exploring the causes of her suffering . She was a partner or a victim of their over-consumption , besides what she practiced on her own account . One mode of destroying wealth she abstained from : till quite recently , she did not indulge in the over-consumption of war and great armies . Yet war has affected her deeply-war carried on by her customers . At an earlier period // the great war of the American secession created the cotton famine of Lancashire , stripped her of the means of manufacturing , and threw vast masses of her population into destitution . The Austro-Prussian and Franco-German wars , the devastating hostilities carried on by China in the far East , the struggles in Servia and Turkey , the exaggerated armaments of Russia and Germany , wasted an immense capital , and vastly diminished their power of supporting British industry . Further yet , England took a part in the rashnesses of other countries . She gave help in the invasion of the American wilds by railroads ; she bought a colossal amount of American bonds which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away her iron and other wealth , and got only paper documents in return . Thus she practically consumed her wealth-for to lend it is to lose it for the time-without replacing it at home with new products obtained from abroad , and consequently shared in the penalty which had fallen on the Americans for over-consumption . But England did much more in promoting the process of over consumption . She imitated the American proceeding of creating an excess of fixed capital . She poured out loans in splendid profusion upon foreign countries , nominally for the development of their industry by railways and other instruments of production . Some she gave to solvent debtors , others to insolvept ; but the effect in both cases was identical as to the diminution of her wealth . For the time , for the creation of depression , it matters not whether she lent to a country which would repay or to one which would not . She parted with her capital : she lessened her stock of goods and of means of reproducing ; she sent away that which , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption . The loans were reckoned as money ; but money was not the thing lent . England has no money , no gold and silver , to lend ; commodities are all that she can give to borrowers . If she bids them draw bills upon her , she can obtain money , if demanded , wherewith to face those bills by purchasing it with her merchandise . To lend became a devouring passion on the Stock Exchange of London . Peru and Venezuela , Honduras and Guatemala , Turkey and Egypt , swallowed up countless millions of English wealth . The grand colonies came forward with a sounder plea for borrowing . They pointed to their vast , expanding trade , to their tillage and their flocks , and they dwelt on the mighty help which railroads and other machinery could render them in developing the natural resources of their country . England relied on excellent interest and a brilliant future . // Her hope and her faith were not misplaced ; but again she forgot that she was over-consuming-that she was losing more capital than she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the unhappy British wealth . The working-classes were impelled by the loans to figure , and to figure largely , in the universal over-consumption . The loans went out in commodities , and the commodities were made by English labor . Ironclads for Turkey , rails and locomotives for America and the colonies , clothing for their men and women , now prospering on what they had borrowed , were energetically supplied from England . Sales were enormously increased ; labor was in vigorous demand by employers reveling in large profits ; prices of all articles advanced ; iron mounted to twenty pounds a ton-the same iron which now fetches only six pounds  --  and luxurious enjoyment broke out on every side . Who stopped to inquire whether this roaring business was legitimate ; whether England was making for eager borrowers , getting nothing but acknowledgments of debt in return ? Masters and men were not responsible for these loans ; that was the affair of Stock-Exchange men and bankers . All that they knew was , that their products were in great demand , and were handsomely paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-consumption ; for English laborers do not save . The wealth of the nation was largely destroyed in drink and luxuries . But this was not all . The union leaders took advantage of the situation to enforce that ignorant policy which has led to so many disastrous rules for withholding the worth of wages , and preventing the workingmen from giving back work worth what they received . Strikes , with their suspensions of industry , while consumption was going on at an accelerated pace , followed in numbers . It would seem as if men had enlisted themselves in a race how to impoverish themselves and their country most swiftly . Nor does this end the catalogue of woes . Profits would not be outdone by wages in the pleasant function of over-consuming , of living on the destruction of capital ; never heeding that they were galloping into poverty . New enterprises were pushed forward ; new factories and other fixed capital created ; new mines opened ; new stocks accumulated . No one dreamed of the day , so dark upon the world now , so slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when buyers would die away ; when markets lately so brilliant would be overloaded , and commercial depression would reign supreme in the darkness . vOL cxxvlll. - NO. 271. 39 // Thus opens upon us the second scene in this wonderful drama , the second stage in the process of over-consumption  --  the period of over-production . The curtain was first lifted in America . In 1873 the American people found that the poverty-creating practice of building an excess of fixed capital could be carried on no longer . The day of reckoning broke upon the promoters of illegitimate railroads . A severe crisis fell upon the money markets of the United States . A shock struck American credit , and Europe would buy no more American bonds with her goods . The concussion propagated itself over the mines and factories of Europe , especially over those of England , which had supplied so many materials for the American railways . Loans died away , and with them the demand for those manufactured products in which they were lent . Buyers vanished . The iron and the coal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not wanted nor inquired for ; profits were converted into losses ; the rate of wages became intolerable . As trade fell away , the thought of a temporary lull , to be followed by a revival of the former briskness , fed hope in anxious makers . They shrank from reducing or stopping their works ; they recoiled from dismissing workmen whose services they might soon be eager to regain . But the sting of their trouble lay in the new works added on to the old ones  --  the extended factories , the mines sunk down at great depths . So they struggled on into over-production . They went on making , as buyers went on failing  --  the over-consumption of fixed capital sentenced them to the sufferings of over-production . But the stern facts of the situation became visible at last . Mills and mines were then closed in numbers-for the laws of trade , like those of nature , are peremptory . Where buyers are wanting , manufacturing and exchange must cease , whatever men and masters may say or do . Many men could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlastingly repeating itself , for these men lived , and did nothing for their livelihood . Wages were reduced and men struck , and fearful was the loss which the strikes made and are still making . On those who still remained in the mills , reduction after reduction was successively imposed ; for still buyers failed to present themselves in expanding numbers . The cost of production has been lowered for many goods , but customers have not yet recovered their power to buy ; time still is wanting for them to acquire wealth wherewith to purchase . But the evil of over-production is gradually healing itself . The stoppage of works and diminution of manufacturing have gone on // for some time , and vast accumulations of unsalable stocks have weilnigh disappeared . The great evil , indeed , of over-consumption still remains , but not in so acute a form . The trouble which weighs down the whole commercial world is still excess of mechanical and manufacturing power in the face of decayed ability to buy ; but this excess is found now , not so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the ordinary natural manufacturing machinery . The poverty of buyers has been brought down by the over-consumption below the former level : consumption can not purchase even up to the old customary extent . If the word production is to be used in this relation  --  and it is ever on the lips of many-over-cost of production would be the phrase that would best describe the actual commercial situation . The goods offered for sale are too dear for the means of consumers . Uncontrollable forces place them out of their reach , except at lower prices , or compel them to go without them altogether . Reduction of the cost of production , therefore , is the only outlet by which employers can escape the abandonment of their business , until other forces have restored to the nations their ancient power of purchasing . It is a situation identical with that created by famine . What happened to Ireland in 1847 has now befallen wide regions of the civilized world . And , now , what are the remedies to be applied for the mitigation and ultimate termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various kinds are proposed with much passion . One especially is advocated with great fervor by the working classes and their advocates . It takes its stand on the assumed fact of over-production . It imputes the blame of the calamity to this alleged proceeding , and proclaims that the cure will be obtained from its direct opposite . More goods , it argues , are made than consumers can be found to buy ; and they sink to prices which can not meet the cost of production . Reverse the practice-s-make less , it is vehemently urged ; work short time  --  and a cure will be effected . It is admitted that the market can not clear off the goods at existing prices , and that the laborers must receive less remuneration . Let the reduction be taken in five or four days ' work a week instead of six  --  the rate of wage per day will then be kept up . The over-production will be stopped , all the goods made will be sold , and in good time the sunshine will again reappear . This policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that industry which supplies the life of mankind with // those commodities which are summed up in the word wealth . A country is rich when much is produced ; it is poor , and its people live at a low level , when there is little made , little to divide among them . Now , what does this policy counsel ? Make less ; let there be less wealth . Work four days a week instead of six ; let the price of the goods and the rate of wage remain where they are now . And this advice to keep goods dear is urged at a time when all the commercial distress is the consequence of the one fact that there is little to buy with , little to give in exchange . Are such men unable to perceive the obvious truth that , if every man in a nation worked half time and produced half the quantity of goods , every man would be only half as well off ? But worse stilL The preachers of this policy make two assumptions which are perfectly false . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods and their price will both continue unchanged . The very reverse of this will take place : the goods under short time will be dearer to make and will be dearer to sell . In every manufacturing business there are heavy charges to be faced which will not be reduced by working fewer days in the week . Interest on capital will be the same , so also the rent of the buildings , the expense of pumping up the water from the mine , the charges for superintendence and office-work , the wear and tear of the machinery . These expenses were charged on the production of six days ; they will now fall on the goods manufactured in five or . four , and inevitably they add to their cost of production , and consequently to the price which must be demanded for producing them . Many of the buyers who bought the goods of the five days will now be unable to afford them ; the over-production will be increased , the depression more intense , and the necessity for a further reduction will become irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle is sound in policy , it will be applied to all trades , and goods dearer in every shop will be the inevitable consequence . The working classes are the greatest buyers and consumers in a nation ; their money , even if not diminished , will encounter higher prices , and will not go so far in purchasing ; they will have condemned themselves by short time to live upon a lower scale , with fewer comforts to enjoy , by their own act . Can it be a matter of surprise if the counselors who urged the enforcement of short time were described as advising workmen to commit suicide ? What a contrast does the opposite method of proceeding present ! The laborer would receive the same diminished wage for // the week , but he works and produces during six days . The price of the goods can be lowered , for the reduction of wages has diminished the cost of production , and there are as many things made as previously . Fresh buyers come in who could not afford the former price . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from loss till the wealth of the country has expanded . More is produced on such a system in the various industries all round . The power of buying is thus increased , for there is more to give in exchange . The depression is attacked , face to face , fn its very heart ; the waste which created that depression is gradually restored by enlarged production , and , with the growth of commodities made , profits and wages are benefited together . But there is another additional fallacy contained in the demand for short time . It involves the assumption that a minimum rate of wages can be decreed and enforced at the pleasure of the laborers . No more egregious delusion can befall wretched mortals . In all purchases the buyer is supreme . He decides whether the article shall be bought ; and , if the price exceeds either his means or his desire to acquire the article , there will be no purchase . Nor will he be without other resources . He will betake himself to other sellers ; he will fall back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably with more good will . This is a consideration of very serious import to a nation like Eng-. land , which owes her commercial greatness , and with it the very existence of a large portion of her population , to her command of distant markets all over the world . The demand for a minimum wage , if one could conceive it to be persisted in , might bring countless English laborers , not only to the workhouse , but to starvation . The sufferings of stagnant trade have brought home this thought of foreign rivals to the feelings of impoverished masters and workmen in many countries . Even in England , the stronghold of free trade , the cry for protection is increasingly heard . Not that protection is demanded in plain terms ; for the people of England are profoundly convinced that protection is nothing but pure folly . It is disguised under the pleasant name of reciprocity , which is simply protection with an excuse for it . " The French refuse to buy our cottons , " exclaims the embittered cotton-spinner ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall thus accomplish two things : we shall punish France , and do good to the distressed silk-manufacturers of England . They will be protected against competing strangers with their long hours of working and low // wages . The national industries shall not be extinguished by an invasion so cruel . " But will this do any good to the cotton-spinner himself ? for there is the rub . In truth , this language is scarcely rational-to be excused by a natural feeling of resentment for a supposed wrong . Reciprocity asks for the imposition of protection when it dares not say that protection can be defended , least of all by a motive which has no *nnection whatever with the trade in whose behalf it is demanded . Protect the silk-maker because the cottonspinner is hurt : this is reciprocity in its full nakedness . A few truisms , it is believed , will suffice to make this clear . The first thing that protection does is , to ask where the goods were made ; its action turns upon the nationality of the merchandise . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the buying and the selling of them ? What rational principle can be pleaded for thrusting in the nationality of the goods between buyer and seller ? The price and the quality of the goods are the only things which concern them . Be the two men of the same nation , or be they , one a Frenchman , the other an Englishman , Tros Tyriusve , what matters it ? " Oh ! " the thoughtless reply , " the English buy French goods , but the French will not buy English goods in return . " Then with what does the Englishman make the purchase ? Trade is nothing but an exchange of goods of equal value . No one , be it man or nation , can buy unless it also sells . The English must give the French what their goods are worth , or they will never get them . " Exactly so , " it is replied . " The French may choose to say that they want nothing which England produces ; they may insist on being paid in money . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever introducing confusion into this very simple subject . England does not grow gold in her fields . If the Frenchmen insist on having gold , then England can not buy the French goods , unless some other country has given her gold in exchange for her goods ; she passes that gold on to the French , and there the matter ends . She has indirectly , but very really , given goods for goods ; she has sold as much as she has bought . There is no loss on either side ; each produces an equal worth of goods to exchange . It may make the explanation clearer if it be allowed to repeat here a passage which bears directly on this subject The ts*ith stands out in clear sunshine . Free trade can not and does not injure domestic industry . Under - free trade foreign countries give in every case as much employment to English workmen and capitalists as if nothing // had been bought abroad . English goods of the same value must be purchased by the foreigner , or the trade comes to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and sent away , or England will never obtain the foreign commodities . Free trade never does harm to the country which practices it ; and that mighty fact alone kills protection . Let those who are backsliding into protection be asked , Can and will the foreigner give away his goods to any country without insisting on receiving back , directly or indirectly , an equal quantity of that country 's goods ? Let the question be pushed home , and all talk about injury to domestic industry must cease ( " Chapters on Practical Political Economy , " p. 301 ) . But how does protection act ? It imposes a duty on the foreignmade article , and not on the one made at home . Thus , the price of the foreign commodity is raised-always to a height sufficient to make it dearer than its domestic competitor , or even to exclude it from the home market altogether . By this intervention , the home commodity , which was driven from the market by its naturally higher price , becomes the cheaper of the two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , or else the excess of price , of the domestic above that of the foreign article if it had been allowed to come in free ? The home buyers ; that is , the whole people of the country which imposes protection . They pay more to their own countrymen than they would have had to pay to the foreign maker . The difference is a tax imposed to support certain persons who would be unable to maintain themselves by the trade in which they are engaged . Clearly , then , it is a poor-rate paid by the protecting nation at its own cost , given to the home makers , an impoverishment of the public wealth , which they consume and destroy without giving any compensation for it beyond what the foreigner would have bestowed at his lower priee . Protection is an erroneous policy ; but it raises a fair issue : Shall the supplies which a nation wants be made at home or abroad ? And it can allege reasons plausible at first sight . But reciprocity , as it is now put , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not say that protection is a wise policy : far from it . But it says , in England , for instance : " The American diminishes our trade by putting a duty on English iron . He diminishes his own trade also , it is true , and he puts a tax on the American people , which they themselves have to pay . Still , he hurts us : let us hurt him in turn . " " But what good will that do us ? Will it increase our trade ? Will it cure our depression ? " " Not at all . But it will punish him ; and let us have this gratification , even though we can obtain it only by // taxing ourselves , and in addition contracting our already depressed trade . " Is it possible that any one grown up to man 's estate can utter such absurdities ? The demand for reciprocity is the child of a radical misconception-of the want of perception of a very simple fact . It mixes up and confounds together into one , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It chooses to regard two separa1*e trades as one ; and on this blunder its absurd advice is founded . It does not see that the production of silks is a business which stands by itself . England decides not to protect her silks , but to buy the French silks , thereby saving wealth and avoiding the losses which protection always entails . There the matter ends . The French pursue the reverse policy . They protect their cottons , and will not buy those of England . That is a foolish proceeding , for France puts a tax upon herself , and restricts the trade between France and England . But what motive does the bad form which France gives to her cotton trade furnish to England for altering the sound organization sht* has bestowed on the silk trade ? That organization was settled on its own merits without reference to anything else but silk . How can it be affected by what happens to cotton ? How can a bad form given to the cotton-supply be a reason for a bad form also being given to the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , touching at no point . Reciprocity may try for ever , but it will never find a reason why a country having received a hurt in one trade should , on that account , of her own doing , hurt herself in another . Finally , what is to be done to end the commercial depression ? Reverse the process which created it . Instead of over-consuming , make more wealth . Produce much , with earnestness and continuance of work , restoring the consumption that does and must go on with new wealth-making an addition to it by saving . The savings will be capital , instruments for increased production , and for accumulating a larger stock of wealth to be divided over the whole people . This enlarged stock will strike at the heart of the depression , as has been so manifestly shown by the effects on the commercial stock of the American people of the grand addition made to its wealth by the abundance of its harvests . That was a production of more , effected by the hand of Providence , but setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical truth that to make much all round is the root of all prosperity .
