Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS. from The little shepherdess ( 1875 ) Sweet innocent , whose rambling feet Have left the bleating fold To seek thy guardian 's gentle breast ,  --  Whose love has made thee bold ,  --  Teach me , with humble , simple trust , In Jesus to confide , Who as my watchful Shepherd lives , Who for my cleansing died . Sweet shepherd child , devoid of care And locked in slumber deep , Not asking , Is there danger near ? Or who thy flock will keep . Securely sleep on earth 's green breast ,  --  Thyself a sparkling gem . The heavenly Shepherd never sleeps ; God guards both thee and them . ' T is not an earthly Shepherd 's care That saves from death and harm ; My human weakness needs to lean On the almighty arm ; In every peril life shall bring , Whate'er my wants may be , Teach me to flee , in grateful trust , Shepherd Divine , to thee .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
