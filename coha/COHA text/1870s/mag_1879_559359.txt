THE " SOLID SOUTH . " I. THE " Solid South " is a reaction against proscription , attended by misgovernment , and a protest against the ever-recurring menace of Federal interference . There are many ways of punishing a people , just as there are many kinds of arbitrary power . The old methods have for the most part grown obsolete . It was left for the leaders of the Republican party , having confiscated more property and impoverished more non-combatants than were ever before submitted to the hazards of war , to invent a new process in the art of inflicting popular pains and penalties-that of freeing the slave and enslaving the free on the side of the vanquished . Nor was this all ; for , adding insult to injury , it was done on the assumption that the class enslaved , unfit to govern or to be trusted , was at once treacherous and cruel ; it was done , and its succeeding enormities have been justified , in the name of philanthropy , patriotism , and liberty , and in terms at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not last . With the overthrow of responsible governments , there came disorders , and , as a consequence of these , the destruction of material prosperity . Ruin in the South threatened ruin at the North . The party which wrought the mischief was unable to maintain itself in its mischief . It lost its footing therefore , slowly but surely , until , twice driven from power in the lower house of Congress , it is about to lose possession of the upper . To this conclusion the " Solid South , " united by proscription , has indeed played a most important part ; but it has been a part assigned to it by the Republican leaders themselves . The South is simply what the Republican party has made it . Failing to destroy by reconstruction , failing to divide by misrepresentations , // threats , and hard words , the policy now is to make the solidity of self-defense the pretext for a " Solid North , " and to accomplish at last what was designed at first , the perpetual ascendancy of sectional passions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican party have set themselves the task of educating the Northern mind ; and no occasion is missed for establishing and enforcing the assumptions on which the native white people of the South are to be subverted : that they are lawless in practice and disloyal at heart ; that they hate the blacks and seek to disfranchise them ; that they actually do suppress all liberty of speech and action ; and , finally , that if the whole power of the North is not consolidated to check their progress , they will presently control the Government , overthrow the national credit , and disgrace the national honor . These are mere sectional and partisan assumptions , which , if true , bode no good for the future of the Republic . But they are persisted in all along the Republican line with an ardor which never loses its selfglorifying righteousness , and a painstaking zeal in the fabrication of examples worthy the fanatical times of religious persecution . Every utterance which can be misquoted or misconceived is tortured into treason . Every fisticuff is elevated to the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South is wrested from its surroundings , and lugged off Northward to do duty as an informer against the humanity and opinions of the Southern people , to whom are assigned baser motives and a different standard of morality than prevail at the North . Thus tittle-tattle , hitherto employed by mischief-makers in the poor service of private pique , has got a promotion , has become a Government agent , and ranks as one of the forces in our public life . As far as the authors of this policy are concerned , it is useless for the South to offer so much as a plea in its own behalf . Like Sydney Smith 's old women who quarreled across an alley , the two can never agree because they argue from opposite premises . Nay , the premise set up by the Republicans was constructed in order that there might be no possible agreement . It may be fairly doubted whether the abject submission of the Southern mind to the dictation of the extremest Republican leader , selected for the purpose , would exempt the South from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican press , or secure that internal freedom from Federal tampering which is so necessary , not only to its domestic peace , but to its progress in good works and arts . // II . It is given out , apparently by authority , that the President has no idea of joining the stalwarts of his party in this new crusade against the South , but that , confessing a certain disappointment in the reception accorded his conciliatory policy by the Southern people , he will proceed without malignance upon the line of his duty , executing the Federal laws with rigorous impartiality . Assuredly , no one can complain of such a course , carried out in good faith . But everybody knows that , as a rule , there is considerable divergence between the professions and performances of men in great place ; and , as the relation of the South to the Government is still sufficiently equivocal to tempt partisans to rush in where statesmen dare not tread , and , moreover , as partisan legislation has furnished machinery to that very end , thoughtful people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specification , and therefore to be accepted with allowance , if not with anxiety . For example , the President need not say that in withdrawing the troops from the South he merely accepted the situation , carrying out the plan already agreed upon by his predecessor . Again , he might well spare himself the trouble of mentioning that , even if he desired to undo what he has done , he could not . Suggestions of this kind are presumptuous and misleading . They are unworthy to come from the Chief Magistrate of a great and united country , who is conscious of having done his duty by the whole people . They smell of the old leaven of sectional bigotry , and make one doubt whether the official who permits such expressions to escape him is capable of executing the Federal laws , designed in the first place for party service , impartially in the South . An election never occurs , North or South , but that on the side of the defeated there is plenty of outcry . Perhaps too often there is plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or false , are to be carefully collected by hostile agents appointed at Washington for the purpose , how shall we hope ever to be rid of the sources of sectional strife ? There will never be a party in power which will not use the machine made to its hand . There will never be an election in which it may not be used . It is the machine itself , and the President 's unquestionable application of it , which constitute the danger ; and , as he declares himself disappointed in the Southern people , it can hardly be hoped that he will not give his ear rather to the adventurers who run to him with wild stories // than to the less enterprising and demonstrative elements of society , which recognize neither his paternity nor his right of surveillance . For why should he be disappointed in the South ? He came among us , and we treated him as a President and a gentleman should be treated . Did he expect us to break up our party connections and relations and join his party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What has happened in the South the last twelve months which has not happened in the North ? We have reached the millennium in neither section . In both there are disorders and violence ; the strong are unjust ; the weak are trod upon ; and good men are not always able to quell bad men . But is this situation to be mended by renewing sectional bickerings , and throwing into the flame of evil , which always burns , the combustible materials of partisan interest and malice ? The principle of home rule has not yet been denied by any responsible American authority . By the operations of the administrative policy its practice was restored in the South . The President claims that in restoring it he only did his duty , which is true , and in which event party payment should not be asked . Undoubtedly beneficent results have followed . Undoubtedly beneficent results will continue to follow . The partisan solidarity of the South is referable , not to unfair elections , but primarily to the courses pursued respectively by the Republican and Democratic parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other has been proscriptive and unfriendly . The South , on the issues of the last few years , is Democratic , and for good reason . It would be strange if it were not . It is the effort to array the North against us on a line of proscription , simply because we have resisted and do resist proscription , which seems unreasonable , and which we contest . At this time there is , practically , no Republican party in the South to contest elections with the Democrats . In South Carolina and Louisiana , where it subsisted by military sufferance , and was represented by armed encampments , the withdrawal of the troops left it without a reason for continued existence . It fell to pieces literally by its own rottenness . In Louisiana , at the recent election , its remnants united themselves with the wildest rag-money lunatics ; in South Carolina there was not enough left of it to put a ticket in the field . Yet the Republican press of the North , taking the old set of bankrupt vagabonds and jail-birds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and pointing to Democratic majorities in South Carolina , where there was no Republican organization , as // proof of foul play . And because the people of the South dare to defend themselves , they are denounced en masse as traitors to liberty and humanity , whose chief delight is " bulldozing " and ballotbox-stuffing . Against this unfair and illiberal dealing the South protests , and the protest is universal , embracing all the responsible elements of life . There is thus a real difference between a " Solid South " and a " Solid North . " The South is " solid " in its own defense . The Republican leaders would have the North " solid " in continued pursuit and persecution of the South . At this rate we should never have any peace , never have any sectional repose , never have any national prosperity and glory in which all might share ; but we should go on forever , criminating and recriminating , steadily impairing the public credit , ultimately to close the account in bankruptcy , repudiation , anarchy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans invites us . That policy is not only aggressive , but is based upon an assumption which , if it be true , means the overthrow of republicanism-the incapacity of the people of the South for self-government . III . The people of the South are nothing if not sentimental . Climatic influences have , of course , had much to do with this idiosyncratic feature of Southern life ; but it is also the offspring of conditions equally potent : the institution of slavery , which built up great homesteads and homestead affections , for one ; a leisurely , isolated , provincial existence , affording the opportunity and the means for the equivocal culture of the voluptuary , not the severe training of the schools , for another ; a traditionary reverence for England and things English , an inherited love of old English literature , a belief in the social , domestic , and political system of England , or rather in a mistaken conception of that system , for a third . The Southern lad who has been educated at home knows a little Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his repertory embracing a mass of crude knowledge , sometimes familiar , sometimes useless , but always engaging , crowded in between Addison and Swift and ilallam and Macaulay . Of mathematics he is almost as ignorant as of Greek ; and , with a store of what , for the want of a better term , the world agrees in calling polite learning , lacking not in readiness , he lacks accuracy , the source and resource of modern thought and action . He is thug , in the materialistic debates of a // thoroughly materialized generation , an ill match for the cool and wary disputant , who throws rhetoric to the dogs and plies the heartless logic of statistics . The whirligig of time , come at last to the aid of the North , has brought in its revenges . For fifty years , during the bucolic period of the republic , the South sent its best men into public life , the North its worst . The Southern statesman may not have been always a planter or even a rich man ; but , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was a conservative . In a sparsely settled agricultural community , yielding to the foremost talent , professional incomes necessarily small , a seat in Congress was , in dollars and cents , as lucrative employment as was to be had . To him whose fortune made him independent of venal considerations , the place itself was sufficiently tempting . So the South never wanted for efficient representatives : men in full sympathy with the spirit of the age ; men adequate to all the exigencies of the time ; good judges of constitutional law , though poor judges of facts and figures , which did not happen to rule ; good declaimers and debaters upon the theoretic topics which arose out of an angry sectional controversy . The North , on the other hand , in many instances , sent her lackeys to Congress . Her rising merchants , lawyers-citizeus of real worth and mark-could seldom afford to abandon great and paying enterprises , to give up richly rewarded professional pursuits , to struggle for political preferment , which not only demanded sacrifices , but required the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With rare exceptions they staid at home . The scrub who could scuffle , the pettifogger who might not get a practice but who could serve a corporation , went to Washington ; and these were unable to cope with the gentlemen of the South either in honesty or in capacity . To be sure , there were many notable exceptions . When Tom Marshall stumbled upon John Quincy Adams in the House-when Hayne shied an unwary lance at Webster in the Senate  --  the force of the whole culture upon half culture showed itself , to the discomfiture of two men of real genius . But such scenes were rare . The rule was that the Southerner came off victor in most of the fights and got most of the glory ; and for the reason given , and no other . Times have changed ; conditions are reversed . Beneath this illusory stream of glory a steady undercurrent ran . A conspicuous Southern statesman , Mr. Toombs of Georgia , recently boasted that during eighteen years service in Congress he had never obtained a // dollar for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so squeamish . While he declaimed they mamnuvred : a light-house here , a custom-house there ; to-day a railway subsidy , to-morrow a river improvement ; fat cuts in all the general appropriation bills ; land grants and water grants , year in and year out , from one session to another . Truly , the Southerner had to pay dearly for his glory ! Finally the war came , and , the North equipped , the South without equipment  --  a victim to misleading theories and calculations , each of which in its order came to grief  --  the issue was simply that of force against force , and , as discerning men on both sides saw at least a year before the close of it , there could be but one result . iv . The overthrow of the Confederacy verified the predictions and vindicated the opinions of the conservative intelligence of the South , which had opposed disunion , and was dragged into the secession movement by the violence of the times . It also produced an element previously unknown in the South  --  a bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of war . Since 1865 the Republican party has done what it could to debauch and destroy these germs of a new and sound political life ; and if it has not quite succeeded , its failure has been due rather to the strength of the germs than to any lack of tormenting ingenuity in its methods . I shall not burden this hasty r*sum* with a recital of the nagging which divided time with the muddling , throughout the short-sighted treatment bestowed upon the Southern people and the Southern question by the Republican leaders . It is sufficient to say that the charge of exceptional hostility to the negro rests mainly upon devices brought about to produce antagonism and to prevent an honest understanding and cooperation between the native races , and that the cackle about " social ostracism " rests upon no foundation worthy of respectful consideration . The wonder is , not that there has been so much bloodshed at the South , but that , under the circumstances , there has been so little . But , much or little , the country at large can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside political pressure tends but to inflame . Administrative meddling begets conflicts of jurisdiction in the courts , State and national ; between the two stools , justice falls to the ground and malefactors make their escape . He is a poor judge of human nature , or else very // ignorant of the Southern character , who does not know that the well-being of the negro must originate at home ; most certainly it can not be shaped or hastened by missionaries carrying banners on which sectional and partisan inscriptions , carefully worded to convey the greatest possible offense to the native white population , are emblazoned . The negro is placable and kindly  --  the fortunate possessor of a sweet , loving , and generous nature . He is yet half a savage . His future is shrouded in mists which are not very penetrable . A free man , a citizen , a voter , he should be left to work out his destiny  --  a hard one at best-in hi* own way . Rescued from the agitation of which he has been the victim , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate himself and to be educated , slowly of course ; to be useful , contented , and happy ; perhaps to develop , with increasing aspiration and advancing civilization , faculties now merely susceptible and imitative into forces of which he does not dream . But , employed for party service as he was employed for domestic service , he is a devil incarnate ; a barbarian , useful to the basest purposes ; the easy prey of the vilest . No true friend of his but would take him out of politics as a factor or leading issue . Handled for ten years as an instrument of torture and pillage by unscrupulous camp-followers who remained in the South to rob the dead and dying left by braver and better men upon the field , the time may come when he will compose the Tenth Legion in the Army of Repudiation , already mustering in the North , to sweep down upon New England , with New England 's own battle-cries in his mouth and the reflection of hell itself in his eyes . Better , far better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if you please , into voting the Democratic ticket , than attach him again to the fortunes of a corrupt and heartless body of mercenaries , having no local interest or ties , to be used by them for incendiary purposes . Better , far better , leave him to his fate with the conservative intelligence of the South , which comprehends his peculiarities and sympathizes with his real wants and needs , than have him trained and sharpened for efficient service in future agrarian movements . It is absurd , if not monstrous , to suppose that he can ever govern in the South , or anywhere else . The scheme to force his ascendancy is merely a job to transfer Tweedism from the North to the South , and to multiply the Tweeds in the fancied interest of the Republican party . The negro is a creature of circumstance , easily led . He voted the Republican ticket while there was a Freedman 's Bureau to serve him rations , while there were promises of " forty // acres and a mule " to lure him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the power of the armies he had seen sweep over the country . These withdrawn , he fell under the ordinary domestic influences , and is to-day voting the Democratic ticket with the cheerful adaptability of his nature . He is at least out of harm 's way . He is beginning to depend less upon the Government and more upon himself . In his person and property he is as safe as a man , ignorant and poor , can be . A true philanthropy , whose first duty is to advise itself , would see the wisdom of letting well enough alone . Nobody pretends that the condition of the negro is an enviable one . It is only affirmed that it is better than it was under his old or his new master , the planter or the carpet-bagger ; and that his future can not be improved by going back for counsels or practices into the period of reconstruction . In its organized capacity , neither party cares anything for the negro . Each would enslave him to its uses . But there is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a humanity which is not partisan , born of old ties and associations , common griefs , fellow feeling , which link the homestead and the cabin , not perhaps by hooks of steel , but by " the mystic chords of memory " which stretch across the chasm between the present and the past . To this humanity , and to it alone , the destiny of the negro may be safely intrusted . If it does not educate and elevate him , the fault will be his , and not its want of interest and effort . The Republican party has done much to stamp this out ; but , thank God , it is not yet extinct ! V. In these random notes upon the " Solid South , " I have attempted to give , in a suggestive way , the case of the Southern people against the Republican leaders , with some reference to their case for themselves ; and by the term " Southern people " I mean , distinctly , the responsible classes , on whom the Government and the Northern people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be restored ; the native white population as distinguished from the irresponsible , entirely ignorant , and helpless blacks , who , having no volition of their own , must and will be controlled , either in the home interest by those who represent it , or in the rotten-borough interest by partisan agents sent down to usurp the honest and beneficent functions of home rule . I have charged that the Republican // party , which for ten years had sole custody of the Government , ignored all that was good and cultivated all that was bad in the South . I have hinted that there are people in the South who , " forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before , " not only love their country , and are loyal to all that should constitute its greatness and pride , but entertain sound opinions upon the material issues which press upon our day and generation . My conclusion is that , if the Republican policy of meddling and muddling , of nagging and double-dealing , continues , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half accomplished ; that it will loosen the South from its conservative moorings ; and that , when the unlucky moment comes , instead of a reservoir of wholesome ideas , we shall find the South a magazine of combustibles , ready to be used by adventurers and charlatans . The circumstances attending the last Presidential election put a serious strain upon our elective system , and it was the South which saved the country from civil strife and secured the peaceful settlement of a most dangerous issue . It is the South to-day , the " Solid South , " to which the friends of social order and honest money will have to look for reinforcements when the tug of war is really at hand . How shall they fare if , in the mean time having leveled suffrage in the South to the low standard of suffrage at the North - yea , to a lower-having elevated ignorance into a power , and employed this power to prostrate and debauch the intelligence which could only organize and direct it for good-they find the South detached from its fixed principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ripe for political adventures ? Be it remembered that this cry about the " Solid South " and a " Solid North " is but an echo , after all . The country had four years of a " Solid South " against a " Soljd North . " Each side spoke its mind freely out of the cannon 's mouth ; the declamation was vociferous , the rhetoric was magnificent , the argument was conclusive . Good men on both sides , satisfied with the result , wish to forget the unhappy events which led to it . Is it possible that any wise man can believe that continuous debate on the old sectional lines can bring us nearer to a happy consummation of the questions in dispute ? But the Republican leaders say : " We do n't want to do this it is you . Cease to mistreat the negro , learn to love your country , guarantee the security of life and property and freedom of speech : // that is all we ask , and , by all the gods of a solid North ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , conceiving itself a peer and not a vassal , might say : " What right have you to use such language ? The assumption on which you base it is false . The spirit in which it is delivered is born of cowardice and cant . You seek no peace . You care nothing for the negro . Freedom of speech , and the security of life and property , are the last things which you would have established in the South . Your aim is continued disturbance , on which you hope to trade and derive a profit . Your game is to goad us into the imprudent utterances of outraged manhood . For years you legislated against us . For years you have maligned us . You lose no opportunity to insult us . Well , if the North can stand it , the South can . The present generation of Southern men is not responsible for slavery or the war of secession . Nearly all of the active leaders of the South were obscure young men when the war began . The leaders who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes good government , the government of the people , we are equally interested with you . In private virtues , as in public spirit and in public virtue , we claim to be at least your peers . As for you  --  the radical leaders of the Republican party , who would rekindle the smoldering fires of an almost extinguished sectional fury to gain a partisan victory-we make no disguise of our feeling toward you ; we detest and distrust you : detest you for your mean pursuit of us ; distrust you for your hypocrisy and corruption . You alone , among Americans , have caused the cheek of honest Americans to blush for their country in every part of the world . You aloiie , mountebanks and malignants that you are , have driven our flag from the seas , to convert it on the land into a drop-curtain to conceal your machinations against the liberty and peace , the prosperity and fair good name of a section of your countrymen , sprung from the same origin as yourselves , and having an equal right to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are able to drag your neighbors , a majority of the good people of the North , down to your baseness , to poison their very blood with lies , and to array them solid ' against us on the line of an insincere , proscriptive charlatanism , so be it . We wash our hands of the consequences . Degrade ourselves by alliance with you , contaminate ourselves by intriguing with you-that we will not do , because you have exhausted the resources of human forgiveness by transcending the limits set upon // human endurance . In seeking to dishonor us , you have dishonored yourselves ; and , though death and the devil stood at the door , we 'll none of you ! " The South might say this , and more ; and , in moments of exasperation , many an honest , liberal Southern man , who entertains opinions and sentiments and sympathies with the foremost thinkers of the North , has been tempted to say it . I am sure that he does not live , if in a discourse of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thoroughly respects the character and polity of New England . than I do ; who warms more heartily to her prowess , her courage , and her geniality ; who has a kindlier laugh for her grotesquerie ; who is freer of prejudices against her , hay ing indeed none except such as favor her , and would elevate her munificence , her culture , and her thrift into examples to be constantly set before the ill-taught , the half-taught , the indolent , spendthrift , and impoverished South . And yet , speaking to the radical leaders in question , and to them alone , I do make bold to reiterate the words I have written down and to hold them true ; and , sure of the intelligence and candor of the average Northern audience , and fearing not to disturb the ghostly back numbers of the " North American Review " by recording them in these pages , I should be surest of all in Faneuil Hall itself ! The Republican party is a sectionalist . It has done what it could to create the " Solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solid North . " At length it has the appearance of the desired array of sectional forces . The effect upon parties affords pretty and timely speculation for the newspapers . The result , for the people at large , may be foretold by any thoughtful person ; for vicious agitation leads inevitably to loss of business , public confidence , and credit , opens the way for corrupt enginery and adventurers , and , in the end , threatens the demolition of either liberty or property , and oftenest of both .
