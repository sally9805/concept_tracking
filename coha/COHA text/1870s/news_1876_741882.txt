txt Recently the workmen in one of the Californian mines struck a stream of water at the depth of 2,200 feet . It rose with great rapidity until it reached the height of 400 feet , when the pumps prevailed upon it to pause . Whether it can be further induced to vacate the mine and permit the workmen to resume their labors remains to be seen . A flooded mine is unfortunately uo novelty , but the flooding of this particular mine has led to a discovery of vast importance to scientific persons and fishmongers . The water is not of that cool and delightful quality so pleasing to the temperance lecturer .. No temperance song has yet been written which could be sung in its praise with the least propriety , for it is not merely warm , but positively hot . It is admirably adapted for the composition of the sinful beverage with which the Californian miner clarifies his vision so that he can perceive the spiritual snakes that are invisible to ordinary eyes ; but except in connection with whisky , sugar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hot water were , nevertheless , found quantities of fish of au entirely new pattern . Like the fish of the Mammoth Cave , they are destitute of eyes , but unlike all previous fish , they can live only iu hot water . When the experiment of placing them iu cold water was tried . they immediately showed symptoms of suffering from cold fins and tails , and presently died in great anguish . Of course , their color was a bright red , in consequence of the prolonged boiling which they had undergone , and it is probable that they were eaten on the spot by the hungry miners . The existence of fish in hot water will bring joy to the heart of the believer iu natural selection . It is a proof that when nature slowly and by almost imperceptible degrees heats the water in a subterranean fish-pond , the fishes which heist upon cold water will gradually die off , while others who like a somewhat  --  higher temperature will survive . In time , this survival of the hottest will result in the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is evidently what has taken place in California . An entirely new species of fish has been developed , and the discovery of the " Cyprinus Brooklynensis " ? as it is understood that the new hot-water fish is to be appropriately called  --  is a strong argument in support of the theory of development by aid of natural selection . The importance of this discovery to fishmongers , keepers of restaurants , and housekeeners generally can hardly be overestimated . If boiled fish can be caught , all the trouble now required in cooking raw fish will be avoided , and if it is possible to develop a race of fishes that can live in boiling water , it is equally possible to develop a breed of hot-water lobsters , or clams , or oysters . All that would be necessary would be a close imitation of the processes of nature . If we stock a pool of water with lobsters , and slowly increase its temperature so as to reach the boiling point , in the course of a hundred years we shall find the then surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiring nothing but sauce to fit them for immediate eating . Whether it would . he possible to develop a race of roast t uxkeys by breeding the birds in a hot-house , in which the temperature should be increased say one degree every six months , may be doubted , since at a high tempera. ture eggs would be hatched with such rapidity as to seriously inconvenience a ben-turkey of slow and methodical habits . Still , the existence of living roast turkeys does not seem much more improbable than the existence of living fish in a boiled state seemed a week ago ; and the day may yet come when our poultry can ho placed on the table without undergoing the fearful risli of cooking at the hands of a newly-imported Hibernian , and our fish can be eaten on the banks of their native caldron , without the aid of a frying-pan or a gridiron . There is but one thing which casts the slighest doubt upon the possibility of the development of boiled fish . The California , miners insist that they have seen the hotwater fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not doubt that they make the assertion iu good faith . Still , it would be interesting to know if they drank any of the hot water , in a properly medicated state , before catching the fish . If so , there is a possibility that the vision of boiled fish was only a delusion of the imagination . It is currently reported in alcoholic circles that the California miner often sees in his uneasy dreams whole men agcries of ' curious animals , including not only those already known to naturalists , but other and hitherto unclassified beasts , birds , and reptiles of the most eccentric conformation and undesirable habits . If we are to class the boiled fish of the Red Dog Mine with the insubstantial fauna of California dreams , there is an end . of the exultation with which Darwinians and . lovers of fish diet have received the story of the flooded mine . Let us , however , hope for better things , and cling to the belief that the " Cyprinus 4rooklunensis " is a blessed and boiled reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
