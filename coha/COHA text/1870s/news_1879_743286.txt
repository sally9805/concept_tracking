txt Should the legal-tender notes be withdrawn , as it is almost certain that they will be in time , it is generally understood that the notes of the national banks will be the reliance of the country as far as paper currency is concerned . It is , therefore , to the last degree necessary that these notes should be made not only absolutely secure as to ultimate redemption , but readily and constantly convertible into gold . Anything short of that would be a mistake , and would impose possibilities of danger in the future to which it would be criminal to close our eyes . There is already no doubt as to the intrinsic value of the national bank notes . It is perfectly certain that no holder of them can , in the long run , lose a dollar by them . The bonds deposited by the banks are ample security for their redemption , and the process provided by law for bringing about that redemption , in case of insolvency , is as complete , wellguarded , and as rapid , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no reason to fear that the country will again resort to the varying , insecure , and confusing system of State banks . Whether the legal-tender notes are withdrawn entirely , and the bank-notes are loft to form , with coin , the currency of the country , or whether the legal-tender quality of the Government paper only is abolished , and it is left in the form of Treasury notes receivable for Government dues , tho perfect intrinsic value of the bank paper will remain the same . It will still be current in every part of the land . It will still be protected as carefully as now from any possible depreciation and from counterfeiting , and it will still be issued to corporations which , from their wide distribution , will be able to know and satisfy the legitimate commercial needs of the country . It is hardly conceivable that from such a system as this Congress would turn to the revival of one which , at its best , was no better than this , and which at all times included many institutions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that the note system of the national banks is radically defective , because the notes , while convertible by law with either coin or " lawful money , " are not , as a matter of fact and in practice , kept convertible . Except by the operations of the Redemption Bureau at Washington , which are entirely confined to the exchange of old and worn notes for new ones , and . which accomplish nothing but to keep the bank paper clean and whole , there is , in reality , no redemption of the notes , for the reason that there is no motive for any actual redemption . The volume of the bank-notes is very pearly the same as that of the legal tenders in which they are redeemable ; they serve precisely the same purposes in ordinary transactions ; they are legal tender from one bank to another , or to the bank which issued them , and there is no occasion for their presentation . Practically , the real burden of redemption lies on the shoulders of . the Government , and the gold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their turn , sustain the bank-notes . But should the legal tenders be withdrawn , or cease to be a medium of redemption for the bank-notes , the situation would be greatly changed . We should then have a paper currency which could be expanded at the discretion of the banks , with its ultimate redemption secured , but with its actual convertibility depending on the reserve of gold which the banks chose to keep on hand . This reserve might or might not be sufficient in times of distress , and the only method by which it could be kept sufficient would be a plan provided by law for keeping the notes regularly , freely , and constantly , not only convertible , but converted . Such a provision is an indispensable condition to the safety of free banking as we have it , ? to securing all the very great benefits which free banking is calculated to confer without the risks to which it is exposed . For it must not be forgotten that no paper currency is absolutely sound for which gold can not be had at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comply with this condition it becomes dangerous , because it may be increased in volume , in times of inflated credit , beyond what the real demands of legitimate business require . And the danger is greater the more apparently prosperous the country becomes . In. ? periods such as we have just passed through , there is very little chance of bank- notes , even if they are the solepaper cur rency , being issued in excess . But in periods such as we have entered upon , when the spirit of speculation encroaches constantly and insidiously upon the judgment of prudent bankers , the chance for such an excess may be very great . Nor is the chock sufficient which is imposed by the obligation to deposit United States bonds for the ultimate redemption of the notes . That check is a very powerful one , and ought never to be dispensed with , but , as the banks may comply with it , and still bo tempted to put out a quantity of notes for which no ' reserve exists adequate to maintain constant convertibility , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no form of inflated credit which is so mischievous and demoralizing as this . Its inevitable effect is to produce a fictitious enhancement of prices . which , being caused by paper money , non-exportable , is not wholly subject to correction by the general forces of trade . A country doing business on a currency actually equivalent to gold may be subject to groat fluctuations of business , to excessive stimulation , followed by a corresponding depression , as the experience of England during the last eight years illustrates . But there is always the tendency in these difficulties to correct themselves , and whatever excesses the country may indulge in , the banks as issuers of currency are not involved . Naturally , the contrary is the case where banks are relieved from direct and constant responsibility to keep their notes convertible into gold . We shall not now undertake to point out the means by which the condition on which we have insisted may be carried out . We believe it to be entirely feasible , and we desire to call attention , at this juncture , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
