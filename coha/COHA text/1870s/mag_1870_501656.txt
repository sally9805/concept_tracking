IN THE GALAXY for March , 1869 , I asked , " Will Murder Out ? " and narrated some leading cases which , with the homicidal statistics of New York for thirteen years , seemed to compel a negative answer to the question . Since that time , several murders have occurred in the metropolis and its vicinity which are yet enigmas , and in all human probability will remain so . Chief among them is the Nathan murder at No. 12 West Twenty-third street , which occurred between the hours of 12:30 and 3 o'clock A M. of Friday , July 29 , and which , from the character of its victim and its startling incidents , became a celebrated crime . Everywhere it was for many days the prevailing topic of conversation , and the columns of the leading journals of the country were almost monopolized with the statement and discussion of its facts . There was nothing in the popular interest to indicate any morbid taste for the horrible , but the universal excitement caused by the event was due to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . It was a foul murder done in the presumed security of the home of the victim , and no man could be sure that he would not next be sacrificed to secure the safety of prowling brutality . Having briefly given the leading facts of the murder , so that subsequent revelations can be understood , it is my main purpose to relate the thus far unsuccessful groping of the police for the assassin . The narrative will offer cumulative evidence that murder will not " out " at any man 's bidding ; but on the contrary , that when unwitnessed , if the murderer leaves no positive proof of his identity behind him , ingenuity and energy are frequently powerless to make it out . Benjamin Nathan was a millionaire of New York , well known and highly esteemed for his personal qualities . Descended from an old Jewish Portuguese family , he was a native of New York , as his father had been before him . Born to opulence and correct principles , he had added to the one , and closely adhered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelite in his faith , he was catholic in his sympathies , and gave of his abundance to the needy of all creeds . A man of culture and refined tastes , he moved in intelligent and accomplished society . The peaceful and natural death of such a man would have caused public expression of sorrow ; but when his son , who went to his bedroom at 6 o'clock in the morning to call him to a devotional duty of the day , found him lying upon the floor bloody and mangled out of semblance to his kind , with nine gaping wounds upon his head , it is not surprising that there was a general cry of horror , and that the people with one voice demanded the capture and punishment of the murderer . Superintendent Jourdan and Captain Kelso , who immediately took personal charge of the case , saw all its difficulties at a glance . In some respects the crime told its own story too distinctly for Jourdan , who years ago became known as the keenest detective on the continent , to believe himself mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the event had lifted a criminal from ordinary larceny to a murder of rarely paralleled brutality . Intent only upon theft , the intruder rifled the clothes of the sleeping man , which lay on a chair remote from the bed , of a Perregaux watch , No. 5,657 , three diamond shirt studs , what money the pocket-book contained , and the key of the small safe which stood in // the library beside the door opening into the bedroom . Going to the sa fe , he knelt down before it , opened it , and began his examination of its contents . Some noise he made awakened Mr. Nathan , who sprang from his bed , and the thief springing up at the same moment , the two men met in the doorway , the face of the thief being brought into bold relief by the gaslight to his left . Not knowing of Mr. Nathan 's defective vision , he saw himself identified , and believing his retreat cut off , he struck savagely at Mr. Nathan with a short iron bar turned at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " dog . " From this point there is a succession of enigmas until the assassin left the room , after rifling the safe of whatever portable valuables it contained . Carrying the 4 " dog , " he went stealthily down stairs , unfastened the front door , which had been carefully secured at 12:20 o'clock A. M. , laid the " dog " down on the hall floor , and passed out into the street . From this point there are other enigmas , but not so baffling as those within the house . The weapon and the unnecessary brutality were the chief difficulties . There were puzzling questions , as to how the outlaw had entered the house , as to the manner in which the blows had been given , as to how the stricken man had fallen , as to how the blood smears had got upon the wall and door-casing , with others of less interest ; but none of these were vital to the pursuit , and they were considered more as a relaxation from the weightier matters involved than for their intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " great puzzler . " Had any ordinary burglar 's tool been used , or the instrument been one that any thief of high or low degree had ever been known to use , the case would have been clearer , and Jourdan would have known what sink of iniquity to stir in order to start the murderer ; but this " docr " whose appearance in dicated long use in its legitimate sphere , led only into the mechanical world , and widened the circle of inquiry from tens to tens of thousands . But paralyzed as the detectives were by the " docr " the effect of that mangled corpse in the same way was scarcely less . Rarely had murder been more cruelly done , and never since Bartholomew Burke was found with his body gashed by thirty-sbc wounds had the police been confronted with a sight so horrible . Jourdan , looking upon such a sight as this , asked what burglar or sneak-thief would have wasted time and courted destruction by work like this , but found no answer in his long experience or intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other baffling facts encountered at the outset of the investigation , secondary in importance it is true , but of such gravity that in ordinary cases they would be considered insuperable obstacles . Groping his way from the time and place of the murder , Jourdan speedily found that prior to the crime no one had been seen lurking about the house who could be connected in any way with the deed . Again , there were no marks of violence upon the house . There was nowhere the faintest trace of a " jimmy " upon a door or window , nor any sign discernible of a burglarious entrance . Nor had the murderer left any trace of his personality , except that perplexing " doo* " Not a scrap of his clothing had been torn from him to tell the tale of his identity , nor had he left anywhere in the house the imprint of either his hand or foot . Attempting to glean something of value from the time intervening between the murder and the moment of its discovery , Jourdan found nothing but a doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely in declaring under oath , that when he passed the house at 4:30 A. M. he tried both front doors , and they were fastened ; and when he passed again a little before 6 o'clock , he noticed that the hall door was closed . There was positive and stronger evidence , however , that // the door was not only unlocked but partly open at least an hour before the murder was discovered . The testimony on this point also introduced a man in laboring dress , carrying a dinner pail , who at * o'clock ascended the steps of the house , and , having picked up a paper from the topmost step , went on his way . That man and that paper at once became and yet are mysteries . It will be seen that Superintendent Jourdan had only negations to go upon . As a first and obvjous step , the house was thoroughly searched , first for signs of the murderer , and , these failing , for the missing property . From cellar to garret it was thoroughly examined , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next the water-tank was emptied , without result ; and lastly the waste-pipes of the closets and wash-basins were flushed , and the street sewers carefully examined for a long distance in all directions , but no trace of the articles was found . Absolute proof having thus been obtained that the missing property of the murdered man had been carried from the house on the person of the murderer , Jourdan next caused the flooring of the stable to be taken up and the edges of the boards to be examined by experts to determine whether such an instrument as the " dog " had been used in putting it down . He received a negative reply . Now , Washington and Frederick Nathan , sons of the deceased , Mrs. Kelly , the housekeeper , and William Kelly , her adult son , were sleeping in the house when the murder was committed , and their sleep was undisturbed throughout the night by any suspicious or unusual sound . All of the search of the house which has been referred to was accomplished without the knowledge of its inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the result of all this labor , Captain Kelso , standing at the side of the murdered man , said to Superintendent Jourdan , " An outsider ? " and the Chief answered decisively , " No doubt of it . " There was the gratifying fact , however , that the officials , within six hours from the discovery of the crime , were in possession of various facts subsequently developed on the inquest , which completely exonerated all the inmates from any suspicion of complicity in the deed . There was no reasonable ground for suspecting any of them ; but as the police were confronted at once with the tragedy and a strange family , they were of course compelled to closely scrutinize the character and antecedents of all those who were in the house at the time . There were blotches of blood upon the night-gown of Frederick Nathan , and his socks were soaked in blood ; but it was plain that these stains resulted from contact with the corpse after his brother had discovered it . It was equally plain that the few faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers made vastly more numerous and conspicuous than the reality , were made by him as he ran down to the street with his brother to give the alarm . There were many little circumstances connected with both the young men and the two Kellys , which to jealous minds might be , and did become , " confirmation strong as proofs of Holy Writ , " but , put into the crucible of detective experience , evaporated into utter nothingness ; and before the murder was a day old all of the inmates , in the minds of those familiar with the case , were as completely cleared of all suspicion as they soon afterwards became in the public mind , after passing through a terrible ordeal of suspected guilt . Out , therefore , into the whole wide world , the officials were forced to project the appliances of detection , with the hope of discovering the assassin . Instantly all the police force of the city was set to work watching the pawn shops and jewelry stores for the appearance of the stolen property , and searching all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dog . " This labor was also gradually extended into almost every department of mechanics , as the . " dog " was in the end claimed as a tool of almost every trade . According to the confident assertions palmed upon the police , it may have been used by ship-carpenters , boatbuilders , post-tn miners , ladder-makers , slaters , pump-makers , sawyers , sceneshifters in theatres , or by iron-moulders as a clamp for flasks ; and lastly one person wanted all rag-pickers held for the crime because he was sure the so-called was the hook of one of that fraternity . It is plain , therefore , that an instrument that might have been used by any one of these craftsmen , must have led the detectives into an inexhaustible field for search . That the missing property was not discovered was due solely to the prudence of the . assassin . He could have offered none of the articles for sale without detection , so close was the surveillance in regard to them . A mistake was indeed made by the family in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was soon rectified and a correct statement given to the public , Jourdan saying , with rare common-sense for a policeman , that there could not be too many people looking out for these things . But although the watch has been strict and incessant up to the present writing , no trace of any of the articles has been found , and it is evident that the assassin has either thrown them away so that they shall never be found , or , if more covetous than sensible , has secreted them to await disposition when the excitement shall have died away . It seems almost morally certain , however , that they never reached the channels of habitual crime , as these were thoroughly searched for them , and moreover every known or suspected criminal in New York was required to account for himself during the night of the murder . The thieves were never so overhauled before , and never was there such a sudden and universal hegira of the professionals from the city ; nor has there ever been of late years so little crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-third street atrocity . The power of money was added to detective acumen as an additional means to drag the murderer from his hiding place , and the second proclamation issued by Mayor Hall offered large rewards , which were adroitly divided to make the most of every chance of finding a clue to the assassin ; but although supplemented by the offer of $io , ooo reward by the New York Stock Exchange , of which Mr. Nathan had been a member for thirty years , they all remained unproductive . Yet it was not for lack of knowledge of the money to be given for information , for never were rewards brought so generally to public knowledge . The ywere posted in huge placards all over the city , and were sent in multitudes in small hand-bills all over the country . Never was a criminal more earnestly and intelligently sought for than in this case , and never was a search more barren of results . The pursuit certainly did not fail for lack of popular assistance , as Superintendent Jourdan was in constant receipt , for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in all kinds of places , which contained every variety of hints , theories , and supposed information . Some few of these missives were plainly dictated by an earnest and disinterested desire that the murderer should be apprehended , and a sincere purpose to aid in the efforts to that end . But of such there were very few . The perusal of these hundreds of letters would do much to convert the most skeptical to a belief in the original depravity and innate stupidity of mankind . Such eagerness to accuse personal foes of a most heinous crime , such assumptions of superior capacity , and such extreme desire to extract a little individual profit out of blood so wofully shed , I never saw before and do not desire to see again . There was indeed a satisfaction in finding . that // only three persons in all the nation proposed that the murderer should he hunted down by bloodhounds , and offered to furnish the animals for that purpose . It was some comfoA to make the most of this comparatively encouraging fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fellow , determined to do his utmost to destroy a business rival or personal foe , continually writing that a Pine street broker whom he named ought to be watched , and finally demanding his arrest and openly charging him with the murder . Another of comprehensiye malice advanced his theory and vented his spleen thus : DEAR SIR : All stock brokers are scoundrels . I have only met with one exception in all my experience . I am satisfied some miserable stock broker or operator has murdered Mr. Nathan . The idea of a sneak-thief or burglar is simply absurd . Mr. Nathan may have been honest ; if he was , he was surrounded on all sides with rascals , and he held some papers in his safe which some scoundrel wanted . To get at these papers he killed Mr. N. XVhat those papers were I have n't the slightest idea . Now watch every member or any one connected directly or indirectly with the Stock Exchange . ROBERTO . There were scores of letters insisting upon the guilt of one of the sons or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even an attempt to frighten Mrs. Kelly into believing that she was suspected , as she received the following note through the post-office : They have found out that you know more than you tell . This makes you an accessory or party to the crime . To hide anything is criminal . Your only hope is to tell before you 're arrested . There were many clumsy and malicious attempts to aid in fastening suspicion upon the young Nathans ; one of the most clumsy and despicable of which was a letter addressed to Washington Nathan and dropped in the street so that it should reach Jourdan 's eyes . It reads thus : MR . W. NATHUN . DEER SUR : In reply to your Request , all I have got to say is that if you will not do it , why , I wo n't of course ; for I do n't want to have my hand in the Bloody Work . Hoping for a reply , I remain yours , C. BOWARD . But the meanest of all these missives , because of its speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received damning proofs . I am in employ . The city is not a safe place . I hope for a reward when all has blown over . In haste , A FRIEND . A quack doctor , holding the rules of spelling and the detectives in equal and utter contempt , sent this , with his name signed and his business card enclosed : BosToN , August 4 , i87o . To the Chief of Police New York . SIR : I am of the opinion that the detectives know that Washington Nathan committed the murder upon his father and the merderer can pay twice the amount of the reward offered to screne himself . Why has the detectives not obtaned a serch warrent and serched the whole and of Washington affects in the city and out of the city . If what has been stated is true a jury would convict W- . Nathan . As I look a things the detectives have done not a thing to bring the merder to punishment . Your &amp;Ce . Another , sharing in the general curiosity to discover how the assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , July 3 ! , 1870 . DEAR SIR : Passing the house of Mr. Nathan this afternoon , my attention was especial . ly drawn toward the front portico over the steps . It seemed easy to my eye for a person to climb to the window of the room over the front door . There is a narrow mouldin , . or // shelf may be two or three inches in width , on the front of No. 14 , which ends about half the height of Mr. Nathan 's portico . A person could , by using this shelf and holding to the columns of the portico , swing himself on top of the same . Once there , an entrance through the library window would seem an easy matter , especially if the window had been left unfastened . If you will have the goodness to examine the front of No. 14 , you will , I think , notice a mark or marks of a boot or scrape on the brown-stone front of the building . I noticed such a mark this afternoon , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt , I thought I would address you a line calling your attention to this . Yours truly , J. B. H. Superintendent John Jourdan . The way by which the assassin entered the house is yet a matter of theory ; but the police , for reasons that do not seem conclusive , have rejected the hypothesis presented in this letter , and the weight of opinion among them seems inclined in favor of the basement door , which is supposed to have been accidentally left unlocked . There was another class of letters dealing in personalities , which it was evi* dent were dictated either by an honest purpose to aid the authorities , or an intense desire to get an enemy into trouble . These were the letters from all parts of the counf*ry detailing the sudden appearance of suspicious persons in the localities of the writers . It is marvellous how many men of hang-dog faces and sneaking demeanor were to be found just after the murder . One was seen in a far-off town of Michigan , who it was subsequently found had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in his life . An old lady summering at Greenwich , Conn. , wrote of the arrival at her hotel in a buggy of a man and woman who " behaved queerly . " Although her honesty was apparent in every line , she had encountered nothing more serious than a taciturn gentleman and a lady in a fit of sulks . A barber in Jersey City wrote to say , that on the day Mr. Nathan was killed two suspicious-looking men came to his shop . One got shaved and had his hair cut , and the other , the hardest-looking one of the two , got his hair cut only . But this , and the fact that they said they were going to " Cincinaty , " were the only suspicious circumstances mentioned . A gentleman of Princeton , N. J. , wrote of a young man appearing at his door Sunday morning , who was respectably dressed , but " seemed shy , and said he was going to Philadelphia , but had no money . Some of the family remarked , His hands are stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he then drew them down and muttered , Blackberries . ' ' * This pilgrim with the stained hands was " so exceedingly reticent , " and " his appearance so genteel , and his manner so false , " that he must perforce be the Nathan murderer . A gentleman at Amenia , N. Y. , told how he was reading the account of the murder on Saturday at the depot when a stranger asked , " What is the news from the city to-day ? " to which he answered , " Nothing in particular ; " but the stranger looking at him inquiringly , he said further , " There has been a shocking murder of a prominent citizen of New York . " The stranger , however , manifested no surprise and asked no more questions . The reader concluded he had read the account , and proceeded to remark on the boldness and object of the crime , and mentioned the name of the murdered man , when the stranger , " without saying he was acquainted with the family , or making any other remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and in nearly the same breath asked if there was any war news . " In many ways his behavior was singular , and he departed abruptly and without apparent cause on a southern train a few minutes later . Next day he got into jail in a neighboring town as the Nathan assassin , but proved to be only a harmless lunatic . Stran*st of all the stories of suspicious appearances , was that which came // officially from the detective department of the Philadelphia police , in a letter telling of " a man lurking in a thinly populated part of our city , under circumstances of a very suspicious character . He was first seen on Saturday asleep in a corner of a field , and was then lost sight of until Monday afternoon . Some two miles away from the first place mentioned , he was then seen to emerge from some bushes near the side of a road , and also close to a railroad bridge . He requested of a party passing by the loan of a newspaper . One of them had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at once proceeded to talk about the Nathan murder . While he was reading he showed signs of being greatly agitated , and in the midst of the account a train of cars appeared in sight , and without notice he jumped behind some bushes and concealed himself ; after the train passed he reappeared , and when questioned about his strange conduct said that some of his friends from New York , which place he left on Friday , might be on the train , and he did not care they should see him in his sad condition . " This man had stockings " with marks of blood upon them , " and on his trousers were " spots , ap .. parently blood . " He also wore three studs , supposed to be diamonds , and a watch and chain , the chain partly concealed . The Philadelphia police were firmly convinced that this was the murderer , and out of these circumstances grew the report so widely published of the arrest of the assassin in that city . The story originated with two bricklayers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed off and gave it to the newspapers as a first means of arresting the suspected . Naturally enough , nothing more was ever seen or heard of the man of the hushes and spots of blood . One last case of this kind is given in the following : READING , Aug. 3 , x87o . Dect . JORDAN , New York . DER SIR : Last Saturday afternoon a young man arrived in this town . He was small  --  a little below medium height-weight about 135 or 40 lbs-had on a gray suit with light cap . Had a large amount of money-Two large rolls of bills one of large denomination-some being 50 's . His conduct appeerd strange to the writer . He evidently did not earn his money by work by the manner he exhibited and spent it treating every one-He arrived here about 4 or 5 O'clok in afternoon and left in a few hours saying he was going to Phila for a few days from there to New York stay a month and then to Europe-He stopped at a relatives  --  a german watchmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours he was here-he accompanny him to depot . He said he had worked nothing for five years and had just come from the plains , Why should he stay so short a time with his relatives here ? Why such rough hands if only traveling ? There were scores of letters purporting to give information , and of these only those confined to the " dog " were found to be of value . The others either related to matters of which the authorities were more fully informed than the writers , or made distinct assertions which were subsequently , after a vast deal of labor , found to be unqualifiedly false . A single specimen of this class must suffice , and here it is : To Superintendent J. JOURDAN . SIR : The murderer and an accomplice of Nathan can be found in a street between Norfolk and Clinton , and between Houston and the Tenth Ward , not far from an old slaughter-house . Part of the missed articles can be found in the sub-cellar of what was once a packing-house . I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of revenge . Such letters as this-of which there were several , but all the others relating to the stolen articles exclusively-added greatly to the labors of the case , as in every instance detectives were detailed to exhaust the matter ; for Jourdan was // 543 determined to neglect no chance , however remote , and would not turn a deaf ear to any plausible story , however disreputable its origin . Some of these letters , however , received no other attention than a contemptuous smile , as was the case with that of the individual who , believing the sensational story of the three bloody finger-marks on the Nathan wall , told where the man with the fourth finger missing who had made those marks could be found . As there were no finger-marks whatever in the Nathan house , the joke was a failure . J ourdan , however , had most amateur assistance in the formation of theories of the murder . It is amazing how many born detectives there are in the country unappreciated . These geniuses rushed boldly forward on this occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be added , claiming pay for ability they rated so highly . In all these scores of theories and suggestions there was little that was original and nothing that was valuable . The most of them presumed the guilt of one of the inmates , thus naturally assuming the most obvious and least tenable theory of the case ; and floundering as all did in partial knowledge of the facts , their deductions were invariably erroneous . The bulk of the letters of this class suggested that the missing property would be found in the waste-pipes of the house , but none of them were received until after Jourdan had exhausted the possibility . Some , however , were more original , as that of one citizen suggested that the " murder was committed by a man whose object was to find among the papers in the victim 's pocket-book or safe the record of the combination-lock of the Broad street safe , with a view to its robbery . . . . Having been discovered by Mr. Nathan , he killed him because he was known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murdered man should be examined for the image of the murderer . It is proper to say that this was not done , for the reason that Jourdan had no faith in the expedient , as it had before failed in his experience . One person in Buffalo , who was not ashamed to sign his full name , wrote thus : I will not review anything , but simply state that by some means I am aware that the murderer is still in New York on a sick bed . He has either red or brown hair , is of middle age ) stout built , and no acquaintance of Mr. Nathan . He struck so terribly only out of fright , not from hatred . His having so much money , he will not dispose of the watches . He will work hard to shift the crime upon the shoulders of*another . The only available means to throw him off his guard is a sham arrest and trial of some trustworthy individual , which can easily be accomplished as there is so much money offered . This sham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the person tried be condemned and the execution be indefinitely postponed . Then hush about all and keep a wary eye everywhere . Another , with an eye to the dramatic , had faith in the exactly opposite course , and sent the following without date or signature : I propose ; that , when the Inquest draws to a close , and there remains no evidence sufi. cient to hold any one ( although there may or may not be suspicions ) , That something like the following course be pursued-While an unimportant witness is on th' stand , the Inquest to be adjourned , in this way : some one of position , as a detective , Captain of Police or other proper person , shall interupt the inquest by wispering , in an earnest and misterious way to the Coroner-The Coroner shall then adjourn the inquest . Meanwhile by the proper person and in a proper way , it must be intimated to the whole party assembled especialy to the reporters of the press , That the Detectives have struck a traiZ-cerz'ain , skure , infalible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a moments notice . That they ask for a little time , merly to suround the case with the proper evidence , So that when they bring their man , conviction will come with him . And ' meanwhile , every movement of the guilty party is being closely watched so that he canot escape . It must be broadly intimated that the most cuning criminal is shure tofo*-get something that something had been discovered . All this with startling coments will be published in the papers . The // guilty party will believe himself to be watched , and if there is anything the least bit human in him , it is likely he will expose himself by some strange action . Out of all these letters Superintendent Jourdan gleaned nothing of use but the information before referred to as to the various trades it i which the " dog * may have been used . There was yet another class of letters calling upon him to invoke the supernatural to solve the mystery of the murder , and giving him the benefit of dreams . These were not numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cities , are suggestive of the superstition yet existing in the centres of civilization . " An Interested Reader of the Particulars " announced that " a lady in Brooklyn wishes you to consult a clairvoyant with regard to the horrible Nathan murder . She has known wonderful disclosures in that way . " A gentleman doing business in Broadway solemnly wrote : On the morning of Mr. Nathan 's assassination , between the hours of 2 and 4 o'clock , a " medium * of this city ( a woman ) had a vision of what she believes to be the whole scene . It seemed to her that there were three persons in the transaction , one an old gentleman , who was the victim , another a young man who committed the murder , and the third what she took to be a woman , whose back only appeared in view . The vision was so distinct and terrible that the medium aroused the inmates of the boarding-house by her cries , to whom after coming out of the trance she described what she seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a portrait of Mr. Nathan , she instantly recognized the face as that of the victim aforesaid . She believes that she could as quickly recognize the young man if brought into her presence , and claims that she can repeat words that passed between the assassin and Mr. Nathan immediately before and on the first assault . The parties to the murder , she declares , live in Mr. Nathan 's house . She insists that the " dog " had been concealed a long time for the purpose to which it was put , and that the jewelry , etc. , taken were buried on the premises , and are there to-day .. There was more to the same purport , but I pass to a dreamer who says : I do not think it foolish to send you the dream I had the othernight . I thought I was on the roof of Mr. Nathan 's house , and I was attracted by a little piece of string hanging from one of the chimneys . I pulled it up and found the missing things , which consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches , three studs , some money , papers and a weapon . Another dreamer says : NEW YORK August 1870 concerning Mr B. Nathan . to the Sup Jordon Esq Sir I was Dreeming 3 knights that everything that was robed of Mr Nathans safe is hiden in the yard water closeth of Mr. Nathans Primusers 23d St Bet Bricks and Seelling I hope you will Be so Kind and have it Serched in the Water closeth iii yard Bet Seelling &amp; Bricks if my dreem be found thryho &amp; then Ill Send you another communication yours . G. hope to see it in Tuesdays Paper He was as good as his word , for nothing more was heard of him . Even at a point as remote as Chicago , people were dreaming about the murder . A Dane in that city saw the servant girl of Mr. Nathan as the one who committed the murder . He also saw a clothes-brush stained with blood . Still another class of letters were those of a taunting character from thieves who instinctively delighted in the failure of the police to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation of scrawling their pleasure in anonymous notes clothed in the peculiar patois of rascality . These missives were few in number and commonplace in character , and the single specimen appended is sufficient to indicate the character of all : // Wash , on that biz you and your fly cops are a set of green suckers you cant get the dead wood on nobody you think you got some one dead to rights do nt you your hell you areput Boston Jones on he knows his biz in a horn does that dog look , like a cheese cutter or what  --  or would you sooner go a fishin plenty of caseys Say look here old fel the cove what blowd the safe got away with the ham you bet The reader can form some idea of the amount of labor forced upon Superintendent Jourdan and Captain Kelso when told that there was no hint in all these hundreds of letters which seemed in the least degree sensible that was not acted upon until it ended in failure . As the net result of the most extraordinary search ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time these pages are written , are precisely at the point whence they started , both as.to facts and theories , except in a partial identification of the " dog . " They have not gained an atom of information of any value by the labor of weeks , and their diagnosis of the case remains unchanged . They believe now , as they have from the first , that the intruder in the Nathan mansion on that terrible night was a " duffer , " by which name the police mean one who , following some honest pursuit during the day , occasionally sallies forth at night to commit a house robbery . There are hundreds of these men who are entirely unknown to and unsuspected by the authorities , and are the most dangerous , because the least under surveillance , of all the criminal classes . The business of the duffer in the Nathan house was theft only , and he went there without any definite plunder in view . He was discovered while at the safe , which he would not have had the wit to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victim , and the murder came as an inevitable event . It was consummated in a manner and with a weapon natural to a duffer , and to no one else . Nobody but a duffer would have carried the weapon from the room to drop it inside the door . The brutal coward feared that he might meet some one in the gloomy spaces of that great stairway , and when about to pass in ( o the open streets , which were safer , he cast it from him . Nobody but an unreasoning brute , inexperienced in the detective agencies of the law , would have carried away such articles as the watches and medal , or , having done so , could have kept them concealed so long : the caution and cunning of stupidity driven to cover are unequalled . Nobody but a duffer would have gone out the front door , thus recklessly and uselessly assuming the risk of stepping from his bloody work into the clutch of a patrolman , or having done so would have neglected to close it carefully behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust it ajar and give the other chance against him of hastening by hours the moment when his crime must be discovered . Nobody but a duffer. in stepping from that house could have been so completely lost in the aggregate of humanity that no trace of him could be found . Rejecting , as they were compelled to do , the hypothesis that the murder was done from within the house , the officials had no choice but to seek for the murderer among either the professional or amateur criminal classes . The first they have searched thoroughly , and the second to the best of their ability . Yet among the second , according to their theory , the assassin must be found , if found at all . The truth may be far from their theory , and if time or accident ever dispels the impenetrable cloud that envelopes that terrible scene , it may be found that experience is as useless in criminal matters as it is valuable in many other affairs of life . For the present , it is sufficient to say that John Jourdan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a level with the newest patrolman under his command . With this murder and this penetrating but utterly barren pursuit before us , how shall we answer the question , " Will murder out ? " EDWARD CRAI'SEY.
