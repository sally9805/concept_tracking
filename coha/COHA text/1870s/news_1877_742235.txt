txt It is very easy to mock at the despised American Indian , but after all there is no doubt that he is a man ; at least , up to a certain point . He is not only capable of fighting in a way that justly exasperates the newly-scalped soldier , but ho also possesses a keen love of domestic peace , and in the pursuit thereof displays remarkable ingenuity . This is sufficiently proved by the manner in which the Owasso Indian disposes of his babies during the long winter months which he is compelled to spend chiefly in his wigwam . However ardent a child fancier a man may be , there are times when the noise of children becomes intolerable to him . In this respect the Owasso is like his white brethren . Ho may be passionately fond of his babies , but when he puts on his dressing-gown , and sits down in his study to spend a pleasant Winter evening in reading the latest work on the " Theory and Practice of Scalping " he does not like to be disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by an infantile rehearsal of the tribal war dance in the back parlor . Were ho a white man he would probably urge his wife to take the children and make a long visit to her mother . Such an expedient would , however , be despised by a true Owasso brave , especially as in most cases he brains his wife 's mother with a war-club before the end of the honeymoon . The Owasso is , of course , au ignorant pagan , but there is a good deal of the intelligent angel in him at times . He has grappled with the problem how to dispose of his infants during the Winter , and has solved it in a way that secures the greatest attainable comfort both to his babies and himself . Early in November the Owasso father prepares as many water-proof birch-bark bags as lie has infants . In each of these he places a baby , and then , having sealed up the bags with native pitch , carries them to a lake lying sonic distance north-west of Lake Superior . This lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few white men have penetrated , ' and in which no Owasso ever thinks of fishing . In its deep waters he sinks the bags and their infantile contents , and then wends his way homeward with the happy air of a man who has proved himself a kind father and secured the certainty of a quiet Winter . When May arrives and the ice has melted , the Owasso father takes his grappling hook and seeks again the lake at the bottom of which rest his hermeticallysealed children . It usually takes him but little time to fish up his family , as lie knows exactly where the bags lie . Sometimes an unprincipled father is guilty of poaching among other men 's babies , and occasionally the wrong baby is caught by mistake . Poaching , whether intentional or accidental , is , however , so severely punished that offenses and mistakes of the kind are exceedingly rare . When the bags are opened the babies are found to be sleeping so soundly that they have to be shaken with considerable energy before they awake . As soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in a way that clearly demonstrates their healthy and vigorous condition . There are skeptics who will deny that a hermetically-sealed infant can remain under water for six months without giving up its entire ghost . With such people it is entirely useless to argue . The fact that the Owasso babies do pass their Winters under water , and that ninety-eight per cent . of them are fished up in a healthy state every Spring , rests upon the unimpeachable testimony of a California editor , who derived his knowledge of the matter from a white man who had lived two years with the Owasso tribe . If any one doubts his story , he is ready to point out on the map the precise location of the lake where the infants spend their Winters . It is difficult to imagine that.dispssionate men would seek any farther evidence . As for the scientific persOns.wlio deny that a baby can live for months at the bottom of a lake , let them first experiment with a few Owasso babies before arrogantly deciding what that variety of infant is capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the OWasso fathers is hold up for imitation to the fathers of inchoate American voters . If any man wishes to see if white babies can hibernate under water , he had better make his experiments with caution . He should begin with his less valuable chil- dron , or with a few small boys borrowed from his neighbors , and in no case should he keep them six whole months under water . In the case of a small boy who has developed unusual lung-power by constant practice on the tin horn , it might be safe to leave him for three weeks , or even a month , at the bottom of a pond , but as a rule every sunken infant should be fished up once a week for examination . Of course , accidents might occur during the progress of these experiments , but the man who fears to ran the slightest risk will never make any valuable discovery , and has no right to criticise bolder and . more determined men . Moreover , what is the small boy that his imaginary value is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least hesitation in vivisecting the most estimable animals in the alleged interest of science , and they could hardly consistently object to the sinking of a few experimental boys , in order to ascertain if our entire juvenile population can be thus successfully kept out of mischief from November to May .
