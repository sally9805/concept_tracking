txt Every now and then a scientific person makes a discovery of real merit . The majority of scientific persons prefer to discover comets that nobody can see ; new metals , of which nobody can ever collect enough to make a pin 's head ; or new chemical poisons which the discoverers decline to swallow . Such useless discoveries as these can not be said to reflect much credit upon science , especially when compared with a discovery of such enormous interest as that of the scientific person who has just announced that he has found out the precise nature of a burn . Most people think that they already know what a burn is , and , if pushed for a definition , will tell you that it is the result of sitting down on a red-hot stove or of putting the lighted end of a cigar in the mouth . Of course , this is no definition at all . It does not explain what a burn is , but only how a burn may be produced . If a man were to define Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to make six Democratic white men to out-vote eighteen Republican black men , he would commit the same mistake of confounding cause and result . The scientific mind does not make these blunders . When Prof. HUXLEY thoughtlessly sat down on Mrs. HUXLEY 'S kitchen stove , he undoubtedly learned precisely what the feeling of a burn is , and what effect lime-water and oil have when applied to a singed scientific person ; but if he had been asked to define a burn , he would have modestly replied that he could not do it . Patriotic Americans will be glad to know that what Prof. Huxuv and all the other foreign scientific persons confess themselves unable to do , has just been done by an American scientific , person whose name it is best to withhold from the public just at present . This able person has burned himself with all sorts of things upon all the accessible places of his person , solely in the interests of science . Thus he learned that a burn is always painful , and when that fact was fully impressed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when viewed from a scientific standpoint . It was not long before he was able to answer this question . He found that extreme heat when applied to the surface of the body solidifies the fluid within the perspiratory ducts , and this solid substance pressing upon the nerves produces pain . The next thing was to discover what substance would dissolve this solidified fluid and thus relieve the pain . Here again he was successful , finding that common baking soda has precisely the desired effect . So confident is he of the truth of this remarkable series of discoveries that a few evenings since lie invited a party of friends to come and see him burn himself ; and in their presence he repeatedly exhibited the great moral spectacle of a scientific person in the act of baking , broiling , and scalding himself , and subsequently undergoing almost instantaneous repairs with the help of his wife 's baking soda . At his next exhibition he proposes to use soda bought especially for the purpose , and it will then be safe to mention his name . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exasperating to the housekeeping mind than the surreptitious use of baking materials by meddling husbands . This new theory of the nature of a burn has been so clearly demonstrated that it is impossible to doubt its truth . A burn is nothing more than a solidification of the matter in the perspiratory ducts . As these duets are situated in the skin , it follows that no part of the human body can be burned except the skin . If wo carefully remove the skin from the palm of the hand we can grasp red-hot iron without receiving the slightest pain . Of course , surgeons who profess to cauterize wounds by the insertion of hot irons are guilty of deceit and quackery . If a hole of the depth of half an inch is made in the human leg by one of the teeth of a Spitz dog , no amount of heat applied to that wound can burn anything but the skin surrounding its edges , for the obvious reason that there are no perspiratory ducts in the interior of the leg . Doubtless , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there are no perspiratory duets in the throat or stomach . It is evident that a man deprived of his skin would be absolutely fire-proof , and this fact shows us how wo can attend theatres and sleep in large hotels without the slightest fear of fire . Two objections may be urged against tho new theory of the cause and cure of burns . It will probably be said that persons have been severely burned to a depth far below that of the skin , and that this fact proves that the skin is not the only part of the human body , which can be burned . The answer to this objection is plain . When a scientific theory has been conclusively demonstrated , all alleged facts which conflict with it should be disregarded . It has been proved that a burn is simply a peculiar and abnormal condition of the perspiratory ducts , and wo should therefore refuse to listen to any pretended facts which contravene this theory . Ac to the efficiency of baking soda as an infallible remedy for burns , it will probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are composed of soda , mixed with a little flour , are usually burned to a cinder in the process of baking ; and that this would not happen if soda really possessed the quality ascribed to it by the discoverer of the now theory of burns . This objection seems to be an unanswerable one , and should be frankly admitted to be such . Nevertheless , the fact that soda will instantly cure a burn has been demonstrated , and we must therefore quietly but firmly refuse to be influenced by any facts in conflict with it . Hereafter all prudent people will either be flayed alive , or will cover themselves from head to foot with soda , mixed with mucilage , or some other adhesive substance . They will thus have nothing to dread from fire , and like ABEDNEGO and his two fireproof companions , will be able to walk into all sorts of furnaces with ease and comfort . Had it not been for this great discovery , we should have continued to burn ourselves in ' gross or in detail , without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that soda would cure them . This shows what a remarkable thing science is and how much good it may do if used wisely and in moderation .
