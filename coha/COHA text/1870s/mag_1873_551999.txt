portrayal of the world in its relations to the universe ; as one member of a mighty band . The fourth question , " How do we regulate our lives ? " discusses morality , its dependence on divine command ; war and peace ; the principle of nationality ; monarchy and republicanism - ( of the latter he has no exalted idea ) ; nobility ; universal suffrage , etc. , etc . We need not enlarge the list of social questions ; they are such as occupy the attention of every thinking man . In two appendices he writes about the great authors of Germany , and the great musicians . What he has to say is of interest , though it has by no means the importance of the earlier part of the book . In making mention of this volume we have tried as dispassionately as possible to set before our readers , in a few words , a brief analysis of a book which , we feel sure , both from the nature of the subjects treated , the serious manner of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will make its mark upon the time , not so much as an attack upon what we venerate , as an apology for those who honestly differ from the majority of their brothers . An English translation is announced . - M. d'Ideville 's journal ; not originally intended for publication , records the impressions produced at the moment upon an intelligent and attentive observer by the memorable events which happened in Italy during the two years and a half that followed the Peace of Villafranca , and by the distinguished men concerned in them . The point of view is that of a young French secretary of legation who sympathizes with the old nobility of his country , and is no admirer of the government he serves ; who hates revolutionists , and shares the opinion of those statesmen who regard the unity of Italy as a danger to France , but who is fascinated by Cavour 's personal magnetism , so that he exclaims , " This man whom my conscience reproaches me for loving so much appears to me greater every time I think of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices , and sedulously strives to describe incidents and the actors in them with an impartial hand , but he can not entirely conceal his satisfaction when he has a story to tell to the disadvantage of the ex-Emperor , of Benedetti , Rattazzi , or Garibaldi . Its second title shows the raison d ' */re of the book , which is ' to throw light on the ? hort-comings of : the Imperial diplomacy rather tha to illustrate Italian history , though mu . h space is devoted to that country and its statesmen . A story , which has been in print before , included in a part of this journal which appeared in some of the French newspapers , is told by M. dIdeville upon the authority of Cavour 's private secretary , who had it from Cavour himself . One day Prince de Ia Tour d'Auvergne , French Minister at Turin , a man described as a grand seigneur who had unlimited confidence in himself and a great propensity to irony , called on Cavour , and expressed his regret that he had a painful task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval ofCavour 's attitude , - and he then read a despatch from Count Walewski , declaring distinctly that any attempt on the part of the Sardinian government to annex Central Italy would be considered as a violation of treaty . " Cavour , his head in his hands , listened without interrupting the reading of the despatch ; then , when the minister of France had finished , he replied with a confused air , Alas , you are right , my dear prince ; what M. Walewski writes you is not calculated to encourage our hopes , I admit ; we are sharply censured ; but what would you say if I , on my side , read you what comes to me directly from the Tuileries , this time , and from a certain personage you know ? ' At the same time with a mocking air he drew from his pocket a letter bearing the same date as the despatch , in which M. Mocquard ( Napoleon 's private secretary ) assured him confidentially from the Emperor that the projects of annexation were regarded with a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complications which might arise . " Subsequently , when Napoleon , under the influence of the Empress , attempted to retract his promises , Victor Emanuel , taking the French Minister aside at a ball , expressed to him his irritation in the most violent and bitter terms , concluding , " Who is he , after all , this man , this - ? The last-coiner of the sovereigns of Europe , an intruder among us . Let him remember then what he is and what I am , - I , thc chief of the first and oldest race that reigns in Europe . " The minister quietly replied , " Sire , with your Majesty 's permission , I have not heard a word that has just been said . " The king abruptly left him , but later in the evening tapped him on the shoulder and said with a smile , " It is not indispensable , is it , my dear prince , to report at Paris our *68 March , // conversation this evening ? Besides , have you not yourself said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author , " Your Emperor will never change ; his fault is always to wish to conspire . God knows if he needs to to-day . Is he not absolute master ? With a country powerful as yours , a large army , Europe tranquil , what has he to fear ? Why does he continually disguise his intentions , go the right when he means to turn to the left , and vice versa * .... It is the peculiarity of his genius , it is. the way he prefers , he practises it as an artist , a dilettante , and in that rc$le he will always be the first and greatest of us all . " This remark was made when complaining of the absence of the French Minister , who had been recalled at the time the Sardinian forces invaded the Romagna , and had not been allowed to return to his post , though a year had elapsed . When a minister was sent it was M. Vincent Benedetti , since so well known as envoy to the Court of Berlin . The Marquis de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of Benedetti , then a consular pupil , and attached him to the embassy as consuL Without powerful connections , he successively became secretary of legation , charge ! d'affaires , and director of political affairs in the foreign office under Thouvenel . While holding the latter place he had been named second plenipotentiary to sign the treaty ceding to France Nice and Savoy . He has since , " with the modesty habitual to him , " attributed to himself the honor of the negotiation , which , however , was substantially concluded before his arrival at Turin , where he remained but three days . M. Benedetti and our diplomatist sympathized so little , that the latter soon obtained a leave of absence preparatory to a transfer . He thus describes his sometime chief : To suppleness and perseverance " he unites an extreme finesse , a keen intelligence , and especially a remarkable facility for work . His physiognomy is , beyond contradiction , one of the most refined and intelligent that can be found . His features are regular , the forehead remarkably developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners and gestures are awkward and embarrassed ; despite his efforts , he feels himself ill at ease in a world where he has not lived ; a feeling of restraint is concealed under a 369 stiffness which sometimes unintentionally borders on impertinence . There is nothing which is at the same time more annoying and more comical than to see him attempt a sprightly tone and playful remarks ; he had no doubt learned from M. de la Valette that to excel in light talk was suj5re ! rne ban ton . The poor pupil has made vain efforts to imitate the marquis , he has not passed mediocrity in that way ; there is no reproach in that , though . M. Benedetti is a profound egotist ; like his patron , he has not had the talent to make friends and the ability to surround himself with clients and creatures : more ambitious , more concentrated , more grave , the Corsican diplomatist has directed all his faculties , all his energies , to a single end . " M. d'Ideville adds in a note that " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedetti a lofty intelligence and , what is more precious and rare , character . " The experience of the Chevalier Constantine Nigra , for many years Victor Emanuel 's influential envoy to France , strikingly illustrates the narrow exclusiveness of the aristocratic circles of Turin . Signor Nigra , the son of an obscure country phlebotomist , owes his elevation to his own energy and merit . While he was still a secretary in the foreign office , M. de la Tour d'Auvergne , who had often seen him there , proposed inviting him to dinner , and said so to Cavour . " What are you thinking of , my dear prince , no one invites Nigra , " was the reply . " Afterwards , when Nigra returned from his post at Paris on leave of absence , he said to a friend , " What a singular country ours is .

His royal Majesty is no favorite of our author , who gives his full-length portrait , of which only a few touches can be repeated here .

" On the other hand , Victor Emanuel is accorded the great finesse of the Italian race and no lack of natural wit . " His dominant quality is courage pushed to rashness . " In letters written by him to a celebrated woman , M. d'Ideville was surprised to find tenderness and delicacy of feeling . March , Much is told of Cavour . Especially interesting is the account of the scene when Garibaldi , from his place in Parliament , declared that it was " impossible for him to press the hand of a man who had sold his country to the foreigner , and to ally himself to a government whose cold and mischievous hand had attempted to foment a fratricidal war " ; and when the patriotic minister so resolutely curbed his fiery temper . " If emotion could kill a man , " said he the next day to a friend , " I should have died on my return from that session. ** This entertaining volume - these extracts have by no means exhausted its interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's diplomatic experience at Rome ( 1862 - i866 ) , Athens , and Dresden . ART . RECENTLY , Messrs . Doll and Richards have had on exhibition two remarkable water-color paintings by Mrs. W. J. Stillman , who , as Miss Spartali , had already , before marriage , won much merited esteem from coworkers and connoisseurs in her art in London . The smaller of these pieces is called Forgetfulness , and represents a young woman seated by a low window overlooking a lagoon of Venice . A little in front of this casement stands a large spinning-wheel , with which the damsel has apparently been occupied . Now , however , she has leaned back in her chair , her head resting against the jamb of the window-frame , and only holds the loose flaxen thread in her idle right hand . With the other she grasps a book , vfhich in turn she allows to sink listlessly towards her lap . She is dressed in black , - a full-skirted robe flowing down from the close bodice which clasps her from the waist up to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white lawn , from which , at the shoulders , fall back the socalled " angel-sleeves , " of the same material with the skirt , black , lined with a red , approaching cherry . The lawnsleeves are hard in texture , and perhaps the least successful portion of the whole . The girl 's hair , which is of a glowing amber-golden hue , surrounds with its waving mass a face of bright and perfect color , - all this beautiful blond vision of the head blooming softly forth from the background of a rich tapestry curtain drawn away from the window on the right . The round green panes are visible , just without , where the casement swings ajar ; and through the aperture you look off over pale green waters , where a gondolier is seen rowing his slender , gloomy little craft . In the distance , a long , low pile of reddish buildings hints Venice proper , lying asleep on the sea ; with a soft , warm sky above , evenly blent of blue and white . It would be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is so tenderly imbued . In its presence we seem to become conscious of those invisible radiations which are experienced from the proximity of actual beings . It is not too much to say that there is exhaled from this reposeful figure something akin to that rich and soothing sense of a refined femininity which it is so difficult to describe , yet which many of us must have felt distilled into us from pictures by certain few of the Italian masters . Both Forgetfulness and the Galilean Monk , the larger picture , exhibit that prevalence of rich , harmonious contrasts , darkness rounding and ripening itself into light , and that peculiar spirituality which , by an apparent paradox , inheres in a fervidly sensuous coloring , when developed with grace and moderation , and which recalls the sentiment of the Venetian schooL The figure // Art . of the Galilean Monk , as it happens , is placed by an open window , in very much the same way as is that of the young woman . This time , however , the window opens upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind which rises the dazzling , plastered dome of what to inexperienced eyes might be a mosque , or other religious edifice . In the background is a hill , worked in with a welded mass of subdued but generous tints , and in the left corner a glimpse of deep , deep blue , - no doubt the Sea of Galilee . This monk- for so we must call him - might well be taken for a representation of Christ , bating some realistic features which would , perhaps , obtrude unpleasantly upon the orthodox mind , and were it not for the presence of a medkeval missal on his lap . Otherwise , we have here the " face without blemish and enhanced by a tempered bloom , " in accordance with the supposed contemporary description of Christ , fished up in the eleventh century by Anselm of Canterbury ; also , the black eyebrows almost joined together , and " long fingers , like his mother 's , " which Bishop John of Damascus ascribes to the Saviour . His countenance is gentle , serene , and firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little depression in the forehead between the eyebrows imparts an expression of suffering though calm sensibility , most consonant with one 's impression of the Christ 's face , which must have shown , by just some such little sign as this , the constant endurance of little daily shocks from the gross or petty misapprehensions of fellow-beings . The two sparrows , jerking up sedate little gray tails , as they nibble the crumbs this kind priest , whoever he be , has placed on the window-sill for them , call to mind words of the New Testament which might have been inspired by this very scene . In the execution here , as in the other piece , there appear to be weaknesses ; for instance , the somewhat scratchy appearance of the trees in the garden ; and perhaps , too , it would have been better to veil the wasted thinness of the ascetic hand which lies upon the open book . But the faults form altogether the minor part of the work ; they will receive notice enough from those who are not inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Stillman 's pictures illustrate the method of the more recent and powerful of the English watercolorists ; but they moreover teem with delicate and appreciative truthfulness , and 37 ' breathe throughout a pure and lofty sincerity which , if it were more often seen in the work of our own painters , would be the harbinger of health and prosperity in American art . - In the opening exhibition at the new gallery of the Boston Art Club , interesting opportunities were afforded for instituting some comparison between certain products of foreign schools and recent efforts of our own painters . Local art here held its ground very well , despite the presence of a Bougeauran ,  --  a Mother and Child , with , apparently , a boy St. John , - a noble group , sitting against a clump of Brittany rosemary , but rather distinguishable for large and lucid beauties of form , and even color , than anything especially joyous and pleasing . Mr. Bellows contributed a landscape in oil and two in water-color , all of which indicate the same advancement in his art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is a want , especially in his foliage , which doubtless strict study ( and only that ) might supply . An autumnal forest scene by McEntee , with a silent pool in the centre , limpid , yet unlighted , and stained a deep umber by the leaves at the bottom , was satisfactory and soothing , both for its pensive sentiment and its excellence of representation . Among the most excellent in style was a small landscape by F. D. Williams , - a country-road , with sheep , and a background of blue hills , in which the grays and blues of American scenery were happily reproduced , in a suitable , clear , bright atmosphere . On the other hand , Mr. John R. Key displayed a large landscape , The Brook , which , along with some merits , was also distinguished by coarseness and materiality ; and a view of California Big Trees , which had too strong a relish of the venerable insincerity of the Bicrstadt method . A large canvas , too , from the brush of the latter , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indians and their tents in the foreground . The upper portion of the picture is very turbulent , the mountaintops seeming to be quite at loggerheads with the clouds , which fall heavily upon them . We should be glad to welcome from Bierstadt something more proportionate in goodness to the fame he enjoys . A little Christabel by Vedder - a dark and dreamy little piece - hung in the smaller room . F. I-I . Smith , in whom may have been observed a considerable versatility , and the power to paint simply and pocti // Ad. cally , was represented by a picture of a waiter-girl , scarcely harmonious in composition and color , and with something bold and displeasing about it ; recalling also too strongly Liotard 's famous Chocolatii*re . Besides these , however , there were numerous good pieces worthy of description , bearing the names of Hunt , Norton , Appleton , Brown , Ordway . A flower-piece by W. A. Gay - chrysanthemums of different colors heaped in a pretty dish , against a golden , peacock-ornamented screen - showed how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and fruit A good array of water-colors had been massed upon one of the walls , among which was a study of a yellow . apple and fresh hazel-nut , by W. Hunt , presented to Walter Smith , Esq. , by the Leeds Art School , and illustrative of a very worthy style of water-color painting . Something akin to the method of Mrs. Stillman , with , however , a difference in the choice of subject , was to be found in a water-color by Francis Lathrop of London , also recently exhibited in the Royal Academy . A young woman , opening a door out of a quaint , dim-lighted ball and stairway , holds a platter of milk to tempt a timid kitten with arching back and wistful face . This is conceived in a delicate chord of green and gray , with harmonious contrasts in the colors of the dress . Altogether , the exhibition , comprising as it did between one and two hundred pictures , no one of which , perhaps , was absolutely bad , was a gratifying success . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings painters and lovers of art together in its reunions , and which possesses in its new galleries increased facility for exhibitions , much is to be hoped and expected . It supplies a primary want quite as important in its way as that of art-schools and museums . But it remains with the patrons of art to complete the efficiency of thesq exhibitions by purchasing from them , so that painters may think it worth while always to contribute their best work . In New York , the brisk sale of pictures , almost constantly going on , passes chiefly into the hands of . dealers , for the simple reason that the exhibitions of the National Academy of Design , though at first vigor. ous and promising , were not stimulated and sustained by purchase . The contrary is the case in London , where it has become the fashion to purchase from the artist through the Royal Academy exhibitions . The Art Club promises to reserve one of its rooms March , as a repository for pictures on sale , whence , if purchased , they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be a wise step , and much good might be anticipated as its result . - The most marked trait of English art , as opposed to that of any other nation , is the tendency to run into specialisms , - its extreme individualism in all provinces , from design even to criticism , answering in this to that dominant tendency of the national mind towards self-assertion at the expense of any association of talents or generalization in perception . Certain traits of the most purely negative character are common to all English artists , - want of docility , not only unteachableness , but unschoolableness ; they have no wish to be merely individuals in a school , and , with the best wish thereto , success is unattamable . With an occasional individual genius of the highest type , there is no national artistic character . Hogarth , Turner , Reynolds , Gainshorough , Blake , Rossetti , Burne Jones , Watts , and maybe a few more , rise to great heights of true artistic excellence , and to fullest perception of the emotional and plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead plain of the most appalling mediocrity , and each in his time as an individual protest against the frivolity and superficiality of the art of the day . The art of Greece , of Venice , of Florence , of modern Paris , even of Germany , has certam positive scholastic qualities , plastic , technical , academical , which bind their artists together in a larger individuality , and it may often be a point hardly to be decided if a certain picture belong to a certain great master , or merely to an unnamed disciple , of his school ; but in English art we only recognize the school by the want of any coherence ; if the work be poor , by the want of all scholastic or plastic quality ; if great , by its intense individuality and utter unlikeness to anything else . But in design , pure and simple , the power of expressing ideas in black and white , in conveyance of the objective idea without reference to the subjective coloring or emphasis , Englishmen have always held a high place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the school of Punch , have shown a power and clearness of perception , and a directness and finesse of execution , which make them the only class work in England worth distinction . Turner 's power in design was of the very highest ; but in all his finished // Art . work so lost in his plastic qualities that it can not be treated as we can treat that of the men we have mentioned . In selecting , for the point of a coniparison between the great Englishmen and the great Italians , the delineation of childhood , Mr. Colvin , specialist in criticism , erudite in all that pertains to either school , and conversant to the limits of culture in all that has been said or written on these themes , has chosen his ground , not only with a happy perception of what was best and truest in his own countrymen , but what was of widest and most tender interest to all who will read his book , * and has made a monograph which will strengthen his reputation as critic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done well , the best has always been done in purity and childlike simplicity ; and Blake himself , the mightiest of their masters , and the purest and most childlike of them as well , merits to be put forward , as , indeed , Mr. Colvin puts him , as the representative of English design . What he says of this in his introductory chapter is well said and well worth saying , not only as true , but as opening , in a wider sense than first appears , the nature of English art . " There is a sentiment , a susceptibility of the spirit , a mode of regarding young children both with the eye and heart , of which I seem to see that the dawn , as expressed in art , accompanies the dawn of the English school ; and which I want the reader to taste in its perfection , to catch at its freshest moment . For that we must go back a hundred years , when we shall find it making itself felt in most forms of art to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject through the supernal regard of the Italian to the human devotion of the Englishman , loving children as such , and basing his studies on the three designers par excellence of his country , - Blake , Stothard , and Fl.axman . We need hardly take exception that he has given either of the latter a greater degree of merit than he was entitled to the measure of degrees in art is perilous and overbold . Flaxman is an English foible ; and what he did least worth doing - because it was borrowed and simulated too , namely , his Hellenism - Englishmen take as the greater virtue , or something brought from * Children in Italian and English Design . By SLONEY CoLveN , M. A. , Fellow of Trinity College , Canibridge Seeley , Jackson , and Halliday . London . s5*'s. 373 afar , which they do not in his case perceive to be merely far-fetched . What is of more importance , that comparative justice should be done , we can hardly mistake Mr. Colvin as doing with emphasis , if not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one , of the English or any other school , has ever expressed th' enchanted soul and lightsome spiritual essence of childhood in its human joy and purity , with anything comparable to the twofold charm of verse and design that is to be found in one , at least , of the works of William Blake , - the result of a diviner gift than any either of the speculative or the analytic genius . " Blake was , in fact , as compared with Flaxman , a marvel of imaginative genius , with a plastic talent which , like Shakespeare 's and Michael Angelo 's , made its own canons , and established its own standard of culture . What he was he would have been , had all ancient art perished in its day . Flaxman was but a pale , if close reflex of the manner and gesture of Greek art ; what he might have been if left to himself we can only conjecture , for so little of himself is left to judge by , that , when we take the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , but of others ' forms of speech ; perception , but only through forms which others had set for him ; and what he has done we can well lose and not be poorer . To lose Blake were to lose a knowledge of one human faculty , - to lose one of the happiest pages of the world 's art . Flaxman we are content should be English , Greek , French , anything . Blake we love to feel was human , and of a humanity of which all spiritual-minded men partake . And were it but for what Mr. Colvin has done for Blake , and for his tasteful reproduction of a few of his designs , we should be grateful for his book . These reproductions , in one of the comparatively recent forms of photography , are fac-similes of monochrome designs from Blake 's illustrated books , and , to those who have not access to his works , will show the indescribable *uzivets* and almost unrivalled energy and clearness of purpose , which characterize them . Of Flaxman and Stothard we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of illustration ; nor is there anything in their nsanner or conception which makes them difficult to comprehend or to reproduce in commoner ways ; but nothing less than photography could render even this partial justice to Blake . // Music . MUSIC . ITALIAN Opera once more ! At least , so the handbills and street-posters persist in styling it ; although the Italian element in its composition stands rather in the background , the best of the singers being German , American , and French , and the best of the operas being the work of German and French composers . The singing , however , is done in the Italian language ( with a pleasing variety of accents ) , which fact may give some coloring of appropriateness to the name , which otherwise does not mean much . The powers that rule over such things seem to have settled it that a few weeks of Italian Opera are what no well-regulated " season " can do without ; and we have accordingly annual visits from that great musico-dramatic nondescript , variously diluted as circumstances may command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " star* ' sort , other attractions not easily discoverable , if indeed they actually exist . In fact , but for the presence of two or three of the bright , particular stars , it were perhaps better not to speak of the company and performances at all , lest , like Hamlet , we " fall a cursing " ; and railing at the inevitable can only result in waste of breath and temper . Suffice it to say that Madame Lucca and Miss Kellogg have found very much the same supporting power in the " company " that an acrobat finds in the pile of chairs on the top of which he is balancing himself . The chairs , to be sure , serve to keep him up in the air , but it is the acrobat himself that keeps the pile from falling to the ground and bringing him down with it . Of Madame Lucca herself it is hard to speak in moderate terms ; so thoroughly human an actress we have rarely seen . There seems to be a general , perhaps inevitable , desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the proverbial quality of all comparisons , we think that a comparative study of the two artists would not be wholly unprofitable . There are many points of resemblance between them . Both are essentially lyric actresses , rather than singers pure and simple , having the same power of realizing the highest dramatic conception of both poet and composer , and seeming able to draw inspiration from an abstract idea , a grandly pregnant situ*-tion , even when poet and composer have March , shown themselves incapable of worthily developing such situation or idea , and , in fine , both sho* - ing the same tendency to break through all worn-out conventionalities and stage traditions . In other words , both are thoroughly orz*oinaZ artists . But here their resemblance comes to an end . They are as widely different in individuality , and in their conceptions of the same or similar situations and characters , as they are in personal appearance and /iml*re of voice . There always seemed to us to be something of another world about Nilsson , something preterhuman , at times almost uncanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who surrounded her , to bring with her a breath as from Valhalla , unsafe for mortals to come in contact with ; there was an element of fierceness in her passion not quite human nor yet entirely godlike , a mixture of the Northern Valkyna and the tigress . In the love-scene in Faus4 for instance , we could not help thinking ( mu/otis mutandis ) of Jupiter and Semele , and half expected to see Faust shrivel up and fall at her feet a heap of ashes . Lucca , on the other hand , is transcendently human , with all the intense human and womanly qualities . She and Nilsson are to each other as Beethoven 's Leonora * and Wagner 's Brtinnhilde.t The purely musical element is perhaps more preponderant in Lucca than in Nilsson , and her acting is often apparently quite as dependent upon the music as upon the situation : witness the way in which her whole being floats on the melody Tn I ' as die ' in the fourth act of the Jlugzteno/s , the melody seeming to catch her up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to waft her as on a cloud into Raoul 's arms , forgetful of all save her love . Lucca 's acting in this scene may well be considered her finest effort , finer perhaps as an artistic whole than anything that we have seen from Nilsson , or indeed any other lyric actress ; but then it must be borne in mind that the scene itself is one of peculiar dramatic possibilities , one in which a really great actress finds more scope for all her * In FidelinI In Die Walkiire , Siegfried , and Die Odtterdmn-merung // 1873. powers than any other in the whole range of operas such as have been presented to our public , with perhaps the single exception of the prison-scene in Beethoven 's Fideijo , - a situation of extreme difficulty withal , in which the heroine , Valentine , is torn by many conflicting emotions , so that it might well be the despair of any but a transcendent artist . The music also is perhaps the finest in all of Meyerbeer 's writings , - one of the very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly inspired by the situation , to the forgetting of himself and all ignoble , claptrap effect . Here , if anywhere , Meyerbeer has been naturally and spontaneously great . Even Richard Wagner , who has seen through all Meyerbeer 's charlatanries as have few beside him , and who has ever been Meyerbeer 's severest critic , says of this scene : " We observe that , despite the composer 's ( Meyerbeer 's ) most distinct incapacity to give us from his own musical faculty the slightest evidence of artistic vitality , he raises himself , nevertheless , to the highest and most incontestable artistic power in certain passages of his opera music . These passages are the offspring of a genuine inspiration , and if we examine more closely , we shall perceive whence this inspiration has sprung , - clearly from the poetic nature of the situation itself .

Her utter despair at being forever cut off from Raoul was terribly expressed in every feature and gesture , in spite of her ladylike repose of bearing , and determination not to " make a scene " at parting . The way in which she kissed the Queen 's hand was as intense a dramatic expression of emotion as if she had torn her hair and swooned about the stage as is usual with prime donne in similar straits , and can be tanked with the piercing , volume-speaking look that Nilsson gave her brother , Enrico , in Lucia , where he proposes her marriage with Arturo , to which glance the brother might well answer in dismay , " Mi guardi e taci ? " Lucca 's Leonora in Donizetti 's Favorita may well be compared with Nilsson 's Lucia as a creation of something out of nothing , - only that La Favorita as an opera is even a feebler effort than Lucia di Lammermoor ; an opera of which Robert Schumann wrote in his note-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sit through two acts .

We wish that our public and all publics had more opportunities of hearing artists like Madame Lucca or Miss Nilsson sing in such operas , that they might be firmly impressed with the weakness , the worse than triviality , the utter artistic vulgarity of the music . Great melodic power Donizetti certainly has ; there is even a certain quasi-dramatic quality of a rather vague sort in his melodies ; while casually glancing over the piano scores of some of his operas , we can understand the enthusiasm of his admirers , whose war-cry is ever " divine melody , " " easy , natural , musical expression , " and heaven knows what not else of similar purport .

Far from being the " glorification of Melody , " the " apotheosis of Melody " as we often hear these operas called , they are for the most part the vilification of Melody , the insulting and degrading of Melody and dragging her through the mire ! Ordinary singers may make these things only mildly offensive , But with ar/is/s like Lucca or Nilsson the discrepancy between what might be and what is becomes intolerably exasperating . Lucca 's **argherita in Faust differs from Nilsson 's impersonation as the two women differ from one another .

Miss Kellogg comes back to us as complete an artist as ever , the pure , penetrating quality of her voice seeming even more beautiful , if possible , than in past seasons . As a singer , as far as purity of style and method , and fine , sympathetic , musical expression go to make one , we should rank her even above Madame Lucca or Miss Nilsson . Her singing is , in fact , almost absolutely faultless .

This college has some peculiar excellences in its organization which appeal directly to our musical sympathies . There has of late years been no want of good musical instruction both in and out of our various conservatories , music-schools , etc. , but there has been felt a want of some organization which could be looked to as a standard in the various branches of technical musical education . This want the college in question may to a certain degree claim to supply . The teachers in each department look to some one definite head for guidance in the management of their various classes . The head teacher in each department has been brought up in the same school of playing or singing as the other teachers under his direction , many of whom have for some years been his own pupils and coworkers , so that a pupil may begin at the lowest grade in any department and successively pass on to higher and higher grades , without being forced to adopt a new system at each successive step .

The department of stringed instruments is under the direction of the members of the Quintette Club themselves . They are well enough known throughout the country to let their merit speak for itself , and their individual excellences as artists and their long association together point to their being able to found a school of stringed instruments in which there shall be no essential discrepancies of style or method . // SCIENCE . WE have already had something to say about the spots on the sun , and their curious relations to terrestrial phenomena . We have seen that the occurrence of the aurora-borealis and the cyclical disturbances of the compass-needle are determined by those gigantic solar storms which give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have also given some of the facts which seem to indicate a remarkable coincidence between the periodicity of the spots and the periodicity of Asiatic cholera , though we freely admit that this coincidence may be purely fortuitous . To distinguish between those cases of agreement , among different orders of phenomena which are evidence of true causal relationship , and those which are merely accidental , is often possible only at an advanced stage of inquiry , and after a very wide induction of instances , or a complicated deduction from known principles . The scientific student is , however , quite legitimately employed in hunting up instances of coincidence , even though he must be content to let them stand as empirical facts for want of adequate data for interpreting them . In this humble way , astronomy , the most advanced of the physical sciences , began its career by the ascertainment of sundry periodicities in the heavens for which no one could assign the reason ; and now it is just this initial sort of work which chiefly concerns us when we study meteorology . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockyer observes : " Surely in meteorology , as in astronomy , the thing to hunt down is a cycle , and if that is not to be found in the temperate zone , then go to the frigid zones or the torrid zone to look for it , and if found , then , above all things , and in whatever manner , lay hold of it , study it , record it , and see what it means . " Now , it is remarkable that the first decided periodicity which has been observed in storms of rain and wind carries us directly to the sun-spots . Naturally , the place for seeking to detect such periodicity should be within the tropics , where the winds blow so much more uniformly than in the temperate zones . A year ago , when Mr. Lockyer went to India to observe the eclipse of the sun , he found that a regular period of about eleven years in the maxi mum intensity of the monsoons was generally recognized in Ceylon . Every eleventh year , as a general rule , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . est quantity of rainfall . Sometimes , as might be ezpected , the cycle is not entirely regular , and twelve or thirteen years elapse before the recurrence of maximum intensity . But , on the whole , the undecennial period seems to be quite strongly marked ; while toward the middle of it occurs the minimum of wind and rain . Again , these eleven-year cycles are said to combine by threes to form grand cycles of thirty-three years , which curiously correspond with the epochs at which cholera breaks out with greatest virulence in India . Confirmatory evidence of the highest value is supplied by the observations of Mr. Meldrum . After showing that the cyclones , both in the Caribbean Sea and in the Indian Ocean , vary in number according to the frequency of sun-spots , this careful observer has proceeded to study the rainfall of Queensland , Adelaide , and the Mauritius , with the viex* of ascertaining its periodicity . As the cyclones are usually accompanied by prodigious rains , the periods of excessive rain might be expected to agree with those of extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former ought to confirm the testimony of the latter . This expectation is quite borne out by the facts . At the three points selected for observation , the total rainfall of the three years 1859 - iSfii , during the maximum of sun-spots , exceeded by fifty inches the total rainfall of the three years iSfifi - i565 , during the minimum of sun-spots . In Australia , twentytwo years of observations give a difference of eighteen inches between the rain of a year that is rich and that of a year that is poor in sun-spots . Mr. Lockyer finds a similar difference of thirty inches at the Cape of Good Hope , and of fifty inches at Madras . And from all this he rightly concludes that , in and near the tropics at all events , the effect of the solar storms upon terrestrial atmospheric disturbance is demonstrated . For although the desirable accumulation of proofs will necessarily require that systematic observations should be kept up for many years , nevertheless , 377 // Science . the facts thus far obtained point all in one way . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds or the rains , the verdict is unanimous . When the atmosphere of the sun is violently agitated , the tremor communicates itself to the atmosphere of our planet . Deductively , too , this is no more than what we might have expected . To minds unfamiliar with science , there may , indeed , seem to be no very obvious connection between a tornado on the sun , ninety million miles off , and a drenching rain on the Indian Ocean . The production of a storm on the earth , however , is only a question of heat , or of electricity , or , more properly speaking , of heat and electricity . A sensible variation in the quantity of heat daily received from the sun must give rise to atmospheric currents , and bring about a condensation of aqueous vapor . And there can be no doubt that the blackening of several hundred thousand square miles of the sun 's fiery envelope must perceptibly alter the amount of heat which he radiates upon the earth . The magnetic disturbance , also , shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not well be without its effect upon the electric equilibrium of the atmosphere . Thus , in both ways , the production of storms is brought about . As already observed , the correspondence between these sets of phenomena is most readily detected in tropical countries , where the winds ordinarily blow with great uniformity , and where rains fall at comparatively regular intervals . With the wider variations of temperature in the temperate zones , the phenomena of wind and rain become much more complicated and irregular in appearance . Even supposing the legitimate effects of the sun-spot to be the same over all parts of the earth , we must expect , in many localities , to find those effects obscured by other circumstances . In New England , the years i8yo , 1871 were unusually dry years , though the number of sun-spots was at the maximum , and the auroral displays were frequent and brilliant . Mr. G. 3 . Symons , in tabulating the results of observations on the British rainfall from 1725 to 1869 , finds few signs of an elevenyear period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years are so far apart as fifty-eight and one hundred and thirty-eight inches . In Canada , there was less rain in 1859- s86i than in 1855 - 1857 , though the former were maximum years for sun-spots . Observa March , tions at New Bedford , in Massachusetts , during the years 1832 - 1849 , give clear indications of an eleven-year period , but with the circumstances just reversed . During the years of frequent sun-spots , the rainfall is fifteen inches less than during the opposite years . A similar result is strongly brought out in Palestine and France , and somewhat less decisively in Italy ; while from the data furnished by Switzerland , it is difficult to draw any conclusion . The notable feature of these statistics is , not only that the law so clearly traceable in the tropics is , to a great extent , masked in the north temperate zone , but that over a considerable portion of the latter area its workings seem to be diametrically reversed . The periodicity is , to some extent , traceable ; but here the fiequency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wet weather . A new consideration , however , ought to be taken into the account . Mr. Symons , in reviewing the papers of Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Meldrum , observes that it is worth while to consider " whether the total precipitation over the surface of the globe can be expected to be increased by increased cyclonic energy . Increased rainfall surely means increased extraction of moisture from the air , and that involves one of two facts ( r. ) increased evaporation to supply the increased demand ; or , ( 2. ) rapid and great desiccation of the atmosphere . Without expressing a dogmatic or fixed opinion , it certainly seems to me more likely that the effect of cyclones is simply to alter the locality of deposition , " rather than to increase its aggregate amount . Or , in other words , the very disturbance set up in the tropics by the altered solar radiation may , by the tremendous rains thus occasioned , so far drain of its moisture the general atmosphere of the globe as to bring about a season of comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reasonable qualification , Mr. Symons is no doubt justified in saying that he should by no means regard the connection between rainfall and sunspots as disproved by a set of statistics exactly opposite to those obtained by Mr. Meldrum in the Indian Ocean . It would seem probable that over a considerable part of the earth 's surface such statistics must be forthcoming . And the whole question serves to illustrate the truth , so often exemplified , that mere statistics can enlighten us but little when given without the needful deductive interpretation . // Science . If it should turn out , on further inquiry , that the observed coincidence between the periodicities of the sun-spots and of Asiatic cholera - as noticed in our gossip of last August - answers to any real causal connection between the two sets of phenomena , the explanation will probably have to be sought in the climatic effects traceable to the sun-spots . We shall , simply have to speculate on the probable pathological consequences of an excessively wet or an excessively dry season , in Hindustan . Meanwhile we may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , - the little country of Holland , which has done so much for the political and religious emancipation of mankind , and which has always produced its full quota of literary and scientific workers , is now becoming distinguished for its achievements in the department of psychology . Dr. Van der Wijck has lately begun to sum up his extensive and profound studies in the first volume of his Zielkunde , which will form , when completed , a remarkably thorough treatise on psychical phenomena . This work covers very much the same ground as that which is covered by Professor Bain 's treatises on The Senses and the Intellect , and The Emotions and the Will ; but Dr. Van der Wijck , while basing his work , equally with Professor Bain , upon the latest results of physiological inquiry into the relations between physical and psychical phenomena , nevertheless occupies an entirely independent ground with reference to the materialistic implications which are too generally supposed to be inseparable from these conclusions . The close student of recent philosophical inquiry will regard it as significant , that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode and conditions of mental action with the declaration that idealism is the only hypothesis concerning the relations of matter and mind which is both consistently deduced from the data of consciousness and verified by them . The learned author very sensibly argues that the existence of consciousness we know directly and immediately , while the existence of matter , save as a mode of affection of consciousness , is merely the result of a complicated series of inferences . We have not space to argue or illustrate this point ; but it is worth noting by those who think that a writer who talks about nervecentres in connection with consciousness must needs be a m*tvrialist. - 379 Max Miiller has been delivering a lecture at Liverpool concerning Darwinism as tested by the phenomena of language . We can not give a full abstract of his argument , which will most likely be published before long , but there are one or two points which may profitably occupy our attention for five minutes . There is a fallacy , says Max Muller , latent in the very word " development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - not only the difference between ape and man , but the difference between black and white , or between high and low , or between hot and cold . Very well ; if Max MUller will find for us an absolute distinction between high and low , or between hot and cold , we will do our best to herald him as a greater discoverer than Newton and a subtler thinker than Spinoxa . What the word " development " - or rather the word " evolution " - implies , is that nothing is itself without being at the same time more or less of something else ; and of all the truths yet discovered in science or philosophy , this is unquestionably the deepest . One further assertion of Max MUller 's deserves serious notice . When Mr. Darwin says that some savage languages have no abstract terms , Max MUller replies that such common words asfatker and mot/zer are abstract terms ( ! ) . Now this is because Muller is pre-eminently a Sanskritist , or Aryan scholar of the old school . Accordingly he holds that pa-tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma , with the suffix tar , denoting the agent , and that the root pa means " to protect , " etc. ; all of which , if it be really sound philology , would show only that the Old Aryan language was spoken by a race which had already acquired considerable capacity for abstraction and generalixation . But the Old Aryan language is only a few thousand years old , and no such language was talked by primitive men , who probably dealt but sparingly with time-hallowed " roots , " and signified their states of consciousness by grunts which , if quotable , would go but little way toward showing their capacity for abstract reasoning . But upon this we need not enlarge . We say only this , that to cite IndoEuropean examples in discussing primeval language is about as pertinent as to cite the laws of Manu in discussing primeval society . It is equivalent to forgetting all about the kitchen-middings , and it ignores contemporary savages into the bargain . // POLITICS . THE article of Mr. Coleman 's , published in the December number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment he received at the hands of the New York and New Haven Railroad , brought out as a sort of echo a quantity of letters and communications , of which Mr. Coleman will make use in due time , when our readers will probably be surprised at the amount of feeling displayed by the writers , - the sense of outrage , imposition , extortion , injustice , which the railroad management of the country excites in the mind of the public . It used to be said that the railroads were badly managed because " the people did not want anything better " : cars were crowded , baggage was knocked to pieces , conductors and brakemen were uncivil or brutal , because ours was a simple country , with republican institutions ; not that there was in the minds of the apologists any belief in a necessary connection between republicanism and rudeness or cruelty , but because the existing evils seemed a constituent part of the status quo , which it was an article of the American religion to worship with a blind faith . We were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we may call it so , is no longer an idol , and we have become sceptical , not to say incredulous , when we hear it said either that the railroad system , or the steamboat or hotel-elevator , or fireproof-safe system is admitted to be " on the whole adapted to the needs of our civilization . " The matter may be looked at from a thousand points of view ; from that of the passenger maimed for life , the shipper eased of extortionate freight , the swindled bondholder , or the plundered community . We have before us a circular letter written last fall by a Boston firm to its Western correspondents , which gives a very striking picture of the helplessness of the individual in his struggle with great corporations . What the reply of the Boston and Albany Railroad may be we do not know , but it is not fair to presume in these cases that there is a very good one . The important part of the circular is as follows : - BOSTON , October 35 , 1872 . GENTLEMEN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and Albany Railroad Co. , in sending broadcast through the West public notice that no property consigi*ed us would be received by them at Albany for transportation to us , unless freight and charges on such were prepaid , we are forced to take this course to set us right with our friends and shippers throughout the West . During the past two years we have received considerable grain over the Red , White , and Blue Transit Lines , such coming to this city over the B. &amp; A. R. R. , one of the copartners to such lines . This grain has been largely short in weight , the losses in transit on cars being many times large and often excessive . We have repeatedly called attention of th' R. R. Co. to such shortages , but they have invariably , and usually in an arrogant and arbitrary way ( a way peculiar to this corporation , as our merchants all can testify to ) , refused to pay any attention to our demands . We have submitted to this species of robbery as long as we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , take the stand , that , as common carriers , the railroads are liable , and should be held responsible , for failure to deliver property intrusted to them , in like good order and quantity as received by them ; that , when we can prove a certain quantity shipped in a car at the West , we are entitled to a like quantity delivered us here , or payment for the shortage . We therefore declined paying the B. &amp; A. R. R. Co. a lot of their freight bills unless they would allow our shortages , which we were desirous of having them look into , to satisfy themselves as to the justice of . They , however , most positively refused to notice our claims against them , but said we must pay their bills as presented , rz*At or wrong , and , if wrong , trust to their refunding them when they see fit ; and as we have not submitted to their arbitrary demands , but have decided to hold out , and let our courts settle the question , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sheer malice , to injure us - of notifying all their Western connections to refuse all property consigned us unless freight was prepaid . This is not through fear that they shall lose by us on freight their due , as they , have commenced suit against us for amount of their bills , and we have given 380 March , // Politics . them a bond to cover same , so they are secure on that score ; but it is done simply so to annoy us as to make us surrender unconditionally to them . We propose to see , however , if we have any rights at all in the matter , or whether the railroad corporations are the supreme law in themselves , and everything must yield to them . The B. &amp; A. R. R. Co. have even gone so far as to refuse to receive at Albany grain for which we hold through bills of lading , contracting to deliver such at East Boston ; and through their influence flour and bran in transit to us , and for which we also hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , have been stopped at Toledo and Cleveland . We are also daily in receipt of advices from our friends , that cars for shipments intended for us are being refused by them at all points throughout the West . ScUDDER , BARTLETT , &amp; Co . Such private griefs as these , however , are matters of small moment . If we wish to see the system as it affects larger interests , we must look at such iniquities as those practised by the Erie Railroad , with its retinue of judges and legislators ; at the doings of the " reformers* ' of the Atlantic and Great Western ; at the proceedings of the " Marginal Freight ' * Company , recently unearthed by the Legislature of Massachusetts ; or at the affairs of the Union Pacific Railroad , the typical corporation of the day , with its land grant of 12,800 acres to the mile , and government subsidy besides , its Credit Mobilier parasite , its hundred millions of worthless stock , and its principal projector distributing shares among members of Congress at nominal prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking it back when they become frightened . As to the evils of the present condition of things , there is a remarkable unanimity of opinion ; as to the remedy , no one who has any to propose has yet found it possible to convince the public that it can do more than stay the ravages of the disease for a time . That railroads are gigantic monopolies , over which the principle of competition has no control ; that their enormous wealth enables them to set themselves above the law and above justice ; that they are in the hands of irresponsible and unscrupulous men , whose sole interest in transportation is the money that can be made out of the public by it ; that the building 381 of roads out of the proceeds of bonds , secured by a land grant from the government , and flooding the country with an imaginary security known as stock , which represents nothing except the opportunity for speculation , is corrupting and pernicious ; that a railroad to-day means , to the greater number of the people who project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of money from the public under cover of a public service - all this is admitted . There is also a general unanimity of opinion , among those who have given much thought to the subject , as to the functions which railroads ought to subserve . No one doubts that railroads are , in modern times , the real highways of a country , or that the charges paid by passengers and freight are in reality a " transporation tax ' * levied upon the business of the country , whether the tax is collected by private or public hands . It is obvious , therefore , that the tax for fares and freight ought to be considered , like income or stamp taxes , in connection with the general tax system of the country , and that the first question in regai-d to it ought to be , how can the necessary income be raised so as to bear least heavily upon the industry of the country ? Any one can see for himself that the production of the most necessary articles of commerce must depends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , is the great centre of the production of coal and petroleum in the United States ; but the market for coal and petroleum in New York is governed primarily by the arrangements which the producers in Pennsylvania are able to make with the transportation lines . So much is this the case , and so ruinous of late years have become the delays caused by the differences between producers and transporters , that vigorous attempts are now continually making to solve the difficulty by a union of the two , and the creation of a joint monopoly . These consolidations are only just beginning . Their natural end would be the consolidation , in the hands of a vast consolidated railroad , of all industry which needs transportation for its products . This is the solution of the " railroad question " which most recommends itself to railroad men . But when all this is admitted , how much nearer are we to a solution of the question ? There are one or two branches of it , to be // Politics . sure , which are comparatively simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd condition . Forty years ago , when railroad construction began , it was the universal custom to build roads " on stock . " A number of men subscribed the amount required to lay the track and equip the line , and in return received certificates of indebtedness , in the shape of stock . If more money was needed , after the railroad was finished , money could be raised on bond and mortgage . The stockholders were , in those early days , the real owners just as much as a man is the owner of a house for which he has paid , though some one else may hold his note for part of the purchase-money . The stockholders were therefore entitled to elect directors , and , through them , to manage the property . Before long , however , as the wealth of the country , and , with the wealth , credits , increased , it was discovered that this process might be reversed ; that as soon as a charter was obtained , the promoters of the enterprise , instead of paying money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might , if they pleased , mortgage the road to begin with , issue bonds , and with the proceeds of those bonds build the line . Then the stock could be divided among the promoters , and as soon as it became valuable they could sell it , and count their sale as so much clear gain . The next step was the invention of " land grants , " which made the mortgage a far simpler matter . At present the system is this Half a dozen patriotic gentlemen go to Washington and urge the necessity of building a road through some unsettled part of the West , for the purpose of developing the resources of that section , or making a connecting link in one of the great national highways between the Atlantic and the Pacific , or moving the crops to tide-water , or some other equally important object . As they are generally gentlemen who have friends in Congress , and who pay their political assessments with even more regularity than their taxes ( Mr. Thomas C. Durant testified the other day in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the election of a senator from Iowa ; and Mr. Burbridge , that he had contributed $5,000 towards the election of another from Nebraska , and that he always contributed from $s , ooo to , $ 2,500 a year toward politics ) , their petition is listened to readily . According to their representations , it is impossible to build the road without a subsidy . Congress at once March , gives them a grant of land by way of assistance . This they immediately mortgage , issuing bonds for the amount of the mortgage , and at the same time put into their own pockets the stock . The sales of the bonds yield enough to build the road ; and the income is perhaps enough to pay the interest on them . But meantime the projectors are getting no returns for their money . By this time , the stock , if the road looks at all well , has some value , and they begin to sell it . Gradually , as they want more money , they sell all of it , and very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road quite sufficient to reimburse them for their trouble . But what has become of the road ? The stockholders own it , and the stockholders are now speculators who have bought up the shares on the market , and have no interest in the stock , except to get rid of it at an advance . Here begins a series of speculations in the stock which generally end in " corners , " new issues , and general depreciation of the property . The speculative stockholders elect a speculative board of directors , and with their help issue new mortgages , enter into contracts with other roads , of the lease or guarantee kind , and at last they cease to be able to pay interest on their debt ,  --  the original mortgage . Meanwhile , the real owners of the road , the people who paid for the bonds , have no voice in the management , and are , throughout , at the mercy of the " stock . " They can , of course , foreclose the mortgage , but , for this purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred small investors , widows , orphans , and trustees , scattered over the country , and foreign countries , not accustomed to act together , and ignorant of one another 's whereabouts ; besides this , by the time that foreclosure is possible , the work has been done , and the property has lost its value . It is plain that the retention of the legal ownership of railroads in the hands of the stockholders , in the case of roads which have been built " on bonds , " is an entire mistake . The ownership of a railroad ought to be in the hands of those who have really built it with their money , or , to put it in another way , those who wish to own a road ought to be obliged to pay for doing so . No doubt , if land grants are given up , the opportunity of a great deal of this kind of speculation will be done away with ; but a more radical remedy is needed , and the only sure means of preventing such speculation // Politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of railroads . If railroad mortgages were made impossible , railroads would necessarily be built by the money of those who felt a sufficient interest . and confidence to subscribe . This , however , is not the main question . Even if railroads were deprived of the power of borrowing on mortgage , and every line in the country were owned by the men whose money had built it , we should be as far as ever from having got rid of monopolies . Railroads would still be immense corporations , with " perpetual succession , " totally unrestricted by competition . It would still be for their interest to combine , and the general tendency of railroad combination would be exactly what it is now : it would tend towards a gigantic consolidation of all the lines under one management , having , within the limits suggested by the managers ' prudence , absolute control of the markets and also of the legislation of the country , so far as it affected their own interests . With packed legislatures , with paid or intimidated judges , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able-bodied brakemen , conductors , and switch-tenders , they would be in just that position most dreaded by all lovers of liberty , - a powerful and enormously rich corporation , surrounded by a timid , weak , and hopeless public . While we were still engaged in singing p*ans over the glorious institutions of our happy country , we should suddenly find that our institutions had disappeared , and that we had riveted round our necks the chains of a worse despotism than any we ever lamented for our fellow-creatures . This is really no imaginary picture , as any one will admit who recollects the stronghold , absolutely inaccessible to the law , which Fisk and Gould erected and for a time maintained in New York , or the military operations of the employees ofthe Erie and the Susquehanna Railroads during the " Susquehanna War , " and who has followed with any attention the helpless struggles of the government of the United States - formerly supposed to be quite able to take care of itself- in the foul toils of the Union Pacific Railroad . Two ways have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting these difficulties . The first is that of supervision by the State . According to legal theory , a railroad is , like any other corporation , a creature of the State , called into existence and endowed with certain powers for the 383 public benefit . These powers it must exercise with care and according to law , under penalty of the revocation by the State of its right to exist . On paper this looks well enough , but it is needless any longer to discuss the value pf State supervision , because we have had it now for forty years , and the results are what we see around us . Instead of the State 's supervising the railroads , the railroads supervise the State . The other is the absorption of the railroads by the State . Although this scheme has not been much agitated , the agitatioii is pretty sure to come , just as the agitation for the absorption of the telegraph service by the post-office has already come . The railroads are not any better managed than the telegraphs , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both services . The Postmaster General , in his recent report , states what is , we suppose , an undeniable fact , that the press associations , by combination with the telegraph companies , are enabled , through discriminating tariffs , to make the establishment of newspapers which have not the privileges secured by association a matter of difficulty ; and every one knows in a general way that the " freedom of the press , " supposed to have been secured to us by the struggles of our ancestors , means in modern times rather the liberty of the already existing press to do and say what it pleases , than the liberty of any one who feels himself wronged or oppressed to find through the press a medium of communication with the public . Capital , of course , can always find expression , but it is not capital in these days which suffers acutely at the hand of the oppressor . No doubt if the telegraph became a branch of the post-office , and were well managed , opinion would be less severely taxed than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , and well managed , the evils of the railroad system would be greatly modified . The question of expense has not the importance which , at first sight , it seems to have , because , as we have said , there is no real revenue from railroads under any circumstances . A certain number of millions of dollars are leviedhy some one everyyear for transporting men , women , and children , merchandise and baggage , over the roads . Whether this sum is collected by the government or by corporations , it is a tax , which represents the interest on the capital sunk in the construction of the highways , and which the public must in any case pay . // Po/ilics . The community will be neither richer nor poorer , whether this tax is collected by Vanderbilt or by the United States , unless there is a difference in the economy and skill exercised in the collection . Suppose a country with a single road , the capital of which is $ ioo , ooo , ooo , and which costs exactly $50,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fourteen per cent on the cost . Under the present system the difference between fourteen and seven per cent goes into private pockets . If the country assumes the road , issues bonds for $ ioo , ooo , ooo , and manages it exactly as it was managed before , the fourteen per cent will still be collected ; seven of it will go into the pockets of the original owners , and the other seven will just be equivalent to the interest on the bonds issued . The pubs lic which pays the tax is in precisely the same position in either case . On the other hand , suppose that the road was wastefully managed while in private hands , that twenty-one per cent instead of fourteen were wrung out of the public by the company , and that a third of it was used in purchase of fast horses , wine , and other luxuries for the directors . In such a case , this third is so much pure burden on the industry of the country ; and if the State by assuming the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by just that amount ,  - -  an effect which the industry of the country would soon show . In other words , the question is one of better or worse management ; and when we have said as much as this , we have almost admitted that , with politics in its present condition , the assumption of the railroads by the state is not a thing to be desired by anybody except by senators and congressmen , who are seeking places for their friends . Bad as the present management is , there is at least the satisfaction of knowing that in serious cases , where an unusual number of people have been slaughtered , or an exor March . bitant amount of thieving done , there is something like responsibility . Companies can be sued , and even be made to pay heavy damages . Individuals , too , may be forced to restore stolen goods . But with the roads in the hands of the United States or of the separate States , no one would have any redress , for official responsibilit* is broken down , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can against Gould or Vanderbilt . With railroads in the hands of the government , political backs would take to the road , and plunder the public , as they now do in the post-office and the custom-house . The change would simply add another hundred thousand or so of offices to the already enormous spoils which are at the disposal of victorious parties in State and national politics . With this patronage " civil-service reform ' * and " decentralization " would become mere . empty phrases , because they would be no longer possible . We should then know , not merely what it is to be plundered , but what it is to be governed by a " ring " of the most fabulous power , with machinery so perfect that nothing short of violence could have any effect with it . In short , when the civil service is really reformed , and the departments at Washington and other capitals are managed on principles which insure , as far as practicable , efficiency and honesty in the officials , it will be time enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it will to think of the transfer of contested election cases to the courts , when we have secured a strong judiciary , and of a thousand other reforms , when we have secured a competent force with which to carry them out . At present , changes of machinery will do us little good which do not at the same time bring with them more radical alteration in the motive power itself .
