ART . VIII . - THE PROSPEcTS OF TilE PoLITIcAL ART . IN the literature of politics there is perhaps no word which meets the eye so often as the word " liberty , " and there is no nobler word in it . There is certainly none about which so many touching associations cluster . We never speak of it without calling up a thousand memories of disasters and triumphs which are among the greatest glories of the human race . The Old Cause , as Sidney called it on the scaffold , has , like religion , its saints and martyrs and legends ; and there is , perhaps , nothing , except religion , for which men have done and endured so much . Nearly all the great revolutions which form the stages in human progress were accomplished in its name , and so strong is the hold it has secured in the popular imagination , that we always speak of it as the highest political good . A people which has it is commonly believed to have all ; a people which has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we come to inquire what this liberty is which has , for so many thousand years , kept the world in a blaze , we find it is in itself rather an ideal than a tangible good ; that the long struggle for it has been rather an energetic yindication // of human dignity and independence than the pnrsnit of solid happiness . It is rather a means than an end ; rather something which may be made an instrnment of human cnltnre , or indeed a condition of human cnltnre in the highest sense , than a satisfaction of human aspirations . For it does not satisfy . The ' peoples who have had it have been in all ages the least content , the most restless , the most eager in pursuit of something beyond liberty , of which liberty was but the promise or foretaste . In fact , the liberty of which we hear and read so much , - and of course it is what is commonly called civil liberty we have here in mind , - for which so many orators have thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of government ; what its defenders have sought has been , not so much that men 's relations in society should be regulated in a particular way , as that the power of government , or the sovereignty , as it is called , should be lodged in a particular place . The political history of the civilized world is made up almost exclusively of disputes about the seat of the sovereignty . Nearly all the troubles of the ancient republics were contests about the manner in which this authority should be distributed , and about the conditions under which it should be exercised . When we speak of any of them as having fallen , what we mean is simply that the power passed from the many to the few , or to one . Media*val history is made up in much the same way . The earlier part of it exhibits the sovereignty exercised by a large number of small potentates ; the latter part of it , the gradual absorption of the sovereignty by a few great monarchs . And the long struggle for constitutional government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment , has been in the main an effort on the part of the people to secure a share in the sovereignty for themselves . When we talk of political progress , what we generally mean by it is the gradual success of the people in securing either wholly or in great part the substitution of their will for somebody else 's will in the direction of national affairs . We do not always or necessarily mean that they are securing a better administration of the national affairs , or more security for life or property at home , or more dignity or influence abroad . Indeed , I can not better illustrate the distinction than by saying that the two most important political revolu // tions of the modern world , that of 1640 in England and that of 1776 in America , arose out of a controversy about a tax ; but the question iu dispute was , not whether the tax was a good or bad one , but whether the king or the people had the right to levy it . All this , doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring out a little more clearly the fact that the cIvilized world has been , down to our day , occupied so incessantly with the task of fixing the form of the government , that not only has the form of the government come to be popularly regarded as the great end for which states exist , but that very little progress has been made in the art of government . tThe question how to secure liberty , that is , how to secure a share in the sovereignty for the many , has occupied the race so constantly since the dawn of history , that very little attention has hitherto been bestowed on that greatest of all political questions , the use which we sh*nld make of liberty after we have *got it . Sovereignty is , after all , only a means ; the end for which political societies exist is right living , and not any particular distribution of the supreme power ; and the sole claim of civil liberty on human affection and admiration lies in the fact that under it human faculties are found to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations the widest and loftiest range . Of course this struggle could not go on for so many hundred years without being accompanied , through the mere growth of civilization , by a great many reforms in legislation ; but the reforms in legislation were not its final or main object . Had they been , the movement towards democracy might have been arrested at any given time , or in any given place , by the establishment of a paternal despotism or of an enlightened oligarchy . The father of the late Grand Duke of Tuscany , or the Bernese or Venetian patricians , might fairly have said that they did for the people as much as the people were at all likely to do for themselves . lit has indeed been a favorite conservative fancy in all ages that the mouths of political agitators might be stopped by the provision of peace and plenty , justice and security , for the many by a ruling and enlightened few . Occasionally it has seemed as if this vision // were going to be realized , but the illusion has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , has been unsteady , but it has been continuous ; it has often been imperceptible for brief periods , but it has never ceased . All compromise has been found impossible , and we are now on the point of seeing it close all over the civilized world , by the reference of every great question of national concern to universal suffrage , - which is simply a name for the widest possible distribution of the sovereignty . Considering how severe the struggle has been , and bow largely wealth , power of organization , and religion have been on the side of privilege , it is hardly wonUerful that it should have lasted so loub , or that it should have resulted in so few contributions to the science of government . Indeed , when we come to review the stock of political ideas , and the political mechanism now in our possession , and compare them with those bequeathed by the iloman Empire to the modern world , we have reason to be astonished , if not ashamed , of the smallness and insignificance of the additions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of government we have really added nothing but the representative system , an admirable contrivance , it is true , which has made possible in the modern world what was not possible in the ancient world , - a large democratic state . * ) In the government of municipalities , as we received it from the ancients , we can not be said to have made any improvements , except such as the advance in the physical sciences have forced upon us ,  --  such as improved means of lighting and ventilation and locomotion . In provision for popular cleanliness and recreation , and in sewerage , our cities are inferior to the IRoman cities . We have , it is true , discovered in popular education one preventive of crime , of which the ancient world knew nothing ; but then , although we understand the laws of political economy , which the Romans did not , and honor labor , which they did not , and have got rid of slavery , which dragged their empire down , we find the government of our great cities just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before such a state of things as presents itself in New York and Chicago to-day , modern democracy stands nearly as helpless as the oligarchy stood before tho // Roman mob in the last days of the Republic . To the art of rapidly civilizing and assimilating populations in a lower social condition , which the Romans possessed in so high a degree , and of which no satisfactory explanation , I think , has ever been offered , the modern world can certainly lay no claim . It is , indeed , only in our day and on this continent that the experiment has been renewed with any degree of success , though some very remarkable results begin at last to be attained by the English in India ; and yet it is not made here without considerable loss to the higher influence in the process , far greater , there is reason to believe , than Rome suffered in bringing the Gaul or Iberian or Briton up to her own level . As regards the administration of justice , including under that term the whole of the machinery by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have certainly contributed little to the work of our judicial ancestors . The Roman law has been for ages , and still is to modern jurists , what the Colliseum was to mediaeval builders , - a great quarry from which the materials of all other systems have been drawn in rich abundance ; and to this day there is no civilized country in which it is not resorted to for guidance in those nicer applications of morality for which the increasing complication of human affairs is constantly calling . We have , it is true , made a great and beneficent contribution to civilization in our system of international law- , but the very foundations of this we have drawn from Roman jurisprudence . The Romans could not construct it as long as their empire included the civilized world , since international law arose out of the existence of a large number of equal and independent states . Political economy , too , is the work of the modern world . The Romans knew nothing of it , and their ignorance eventually proved fatal to the empire ; but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised so marked an influence on the government of modern states , a wide field of observation and a long and tich experience were absolutely necessary , and these the ancients did not possess . If we take up Adam Smith , the father of the science , and examine closely the materials from which his conclusions are drawn , we shall find that it has taken the social and political life of many nations and many // ages to furnish them . Political economy was , in short , in its beginnings , and must largely remain till the end , the product of observation , and for fruitful observation length of time and wideness of field are absolutely essential . It must be confessed , too , that in no country in the modern world is the machinery for the exposition and application of the law nearly so perfect as that which the IRomans possessed for several centuries . No modern nation has managed to retain in its bar the intellectual 6lite of its population , as the iRomans did , and secure from its foremost men that assiduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made Roman jurisprudence one of the noblest products of the human understanding . Our superiority to the ancients in the clearness and tenacity with which we hold certain humanitarian ideas is unquestionable , but then we have struck out few or no fresh ones . The idea of the brotherhood of man is older than modern civilization . Its practical application in the IRoman Empire was prevented even in Christian times by the constitution of the state , which rested on conquest and slavery . But then we have had it in our charge for full twelve hundred years , and it is only in the present day that it can be said to be making its way into politics and exercising a marked influence on legislation , although during the greater part of that period there have been half a dozen states in which the experiment might have been tried , and during the whole of it we have had a great ecclesiastical organization expressly devoted to the duty of preaching it . The family has in our hands undergone some amelioration . Women and children occupy a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but owing rather to the softening of manners than to improvements in positive law . Of course , in instituting these comparisons , I do not mean to assert that the state of society now is not greatly superior to anything that was known in the ancient world . In personal purity and practical humanity particularly , our superiority is known to all readers of history , and modern society is a free society . What I mean to say is , that the improvement in the condition of society has not been the consequence of , and has not shown itself or has shown itself only faintly , in , legislation . // In fact , the stream of social progress may be said to have run separate from that of legal progress . Nations have been , on the whole , better than their laws . If , for example , we were to have judged of the manners of any European people , down to the close of the last century , by its criminal code , we should have concluded it to be far more brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state of religion by the legal relations of the Church to society , we should have concluded that religion had no influence on men 's lives at all , or only a degrading one . When we come to inquire how it is that the art of government has not kept pace with the other arts , how it is that soeLty has made more rapid progress than legislation , that in the field of statesmanship the modern world has achieved so much less than in the field of natural science , we find ourselves face to face with a somewhat complicated problem . CQnsidering the amount of attention politics have always absorbed , how deeply interested every human being is in the proper regulation of his relations with his fellows , it does at first sight seem very wonderful that as soon as the proper scientific method was discovered , and the scientifiQ spirit began to grow , human society did not form one of the earliest objects of its application ; that observation and experiment , collection of facts and comparison and induction , did not play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical sciences ; that , in short , the much-talked-of study of mankind should have exercised so little influence on the lawgiver . It must not be supposed that it is democracy only which has discovered anything good in the people . There has , it is safe to say , never been a system of government which did not rest on the assumption that those who lived under it loved good rather than evil , and desired justice to be done . The worst tyrants have counted , or affected to count , on the attachment of the great body of their subjects . In all that we read of the kings being a terror to evildoers , and of the magistrates not bearing the sword in vain , it is taken for granted that the evil-doers were but a small minority , and that the bulk of every community rejoiced when the sword fell . The happiness of his people , too , has always been set forth as the main object of a wise ruler 's care , and a // knowledge of his people a requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that the legislators were bound to adapt their legislation to the people , that popular wants , wishes , and weaknesses should form the basis of it , and that , in short , the inductive method should be used in the work of government , seems not to have been recognized or acted on till the present century . Bacon , strange to say , after showing the applicability of his new philosophic method to everything else , stopped short when he came to politics , and announced that with regard to this " he preferred to be silent . " Elsewhere he speaks of government as a mystery into which the governed should not pry , although in treating of the laws he shows that the usefulness of his philosophy in politics ran in his mind . The most powerful hindrance to scientific legislation has been one of the great sources of law ,  --  custom . " There is , " as the poet says , " a sanctifying power in years ; What age has rendered gray appears divine . " The tendency in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the difficulty of doing a thing decrease the oftener one does it , but to find pleasure in doing it because one has often done it , probably does more to smooth the path of life for us than any other feature of our mental constitution . It takes the sting out of the hardest lot , and often converts what at first were real misfortunes into sweeteners of our existence . It spares everybody half the wear and tear of the world , by enabling him to do a large part of his work without having to call on the will for a separate effort for each act ; and it makes and has always made some of the hardest social yokes sit so lightly as scarcely to be felt at all . Now habit , or custom , as it is more generally called , has always played in politics a part even more important than it has played in private life . Its influence on the career of n*ations has been just as strong and far-reaching as its influence on the career of individuals . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is yet far indeed , we may be sure all political systems will largely rest on it . All governments may be said , down almost to our own day , to have rested on it . " llast thou well considered , " says Carlyle , " all that habit // does in this life of ours ; how all knowledge and all practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of the unknown , impracticable ; and our whole being is an infinite abyss , overarched by habit , as by a thin earth-rind , laboriously built together ? " But if every man holds confined within him a mad man , what must every society do , - society which , in its commonest state , is called the standing miracle of this world ? Without such earth-rind of habit , call it system of habits , in a word , fixed ways of acting and of believing , - society would not exist at all . With such it exists , better or worse . Herein , too , in this its system of habits , acquired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitution of a society ; the only code , though an unwritten one , which it can in no wise disobey . The thing we call written code , constitution , form of government , and the like , what is it but some miniature image , and solemnly expressed summary of this unwritten code ? " Now custom opposes itself to change , and even change for the better , in several ways . First of all it makes it dijicult , even when the existing state of things is thoroughly rotten . Then it gives the established order a character of sanctity ; in other words , it makes change seem impious ; and last of all , it makes it seem dangerous and inexpedient . One of the most striking illustrations of its power in giving the established order of things a sacred character is the growth in modern Europe of the doctrine of the divine right of kings , as it used to be called , or of legitimacy , as it is now called , under cover of which ruthless military conquerors grew in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the Lord 's anointed , the dispensers on earth of his mercy and justice . In fastening on all things new the mark of danger , custom has had at its back , too , that most ancient of all political beliefs , that the golden age was in the past , which was simply a poetic way of expressing the idea that all change meant decline , that the more men differed from their ancestors in their ways of thinking and acting the worse they were . As far as politics was concerned , Christianity did little or nothing to dispel this belief . For the first thousand years of its existence the Church treated the condition of the world as hopeless , and taught the believers - that is , the only portion of society which was troubled by its // evils , and was willing to labor for reform - to expect no im* provement on this side of the grave . Mortal eyes were not to behold the promised land , and he was the wisest man who placed least value on the things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , hope began to exert a marked influence on politics , and a belief in the perfectibility of human society , or at least in its capability of indefinite growth , began to gain ground , and give vigor to reformatory effort , only after long-continued observation of the fact that , in spite of its badness , society did improve , and improve steadily . The rapid advance of discovery and invention , too , after the introduction of the new scientific method , kindled expectation to an extraordinary degree with regard to the social future , especially after the influence of scientific research on men 's material condition began to be fairly perceived ; so that in the sixteenth century men began to look for the kingdom of God on earth , and look on the world as a sphere worthy of men 's highest powers . But the spread of this faith was naturally slow , and it is only within the present century that we have ceased to hear " the wisdom of our ancestors " used as one of the standing arguments against political or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fast hold the old doctrine had taken on the human mind than the importance which one constantly finds attached in political literature , as if it were a striking discovery , to Bacon 's observation , " Antiquitas s*eculi juventus mundi , " that what we call antiquity , in point of time was in reality the youth of the world , - its age of ignorance and inexperience . Perhaps nothing has formed a greater obstacle to the growth of scientific legislation , however , than ignorance of human nature . Human nature , it has to ' be remembered , is the main element in all social and political problems ,  --  human nature as it is , and not as it ought to be , or as we should like to see it , - a proposition which seems simple and commonplace enough , as I here state it , but which has , nevertheless , been ignored or forgotten in nine out of ten of all the schemes of reform ever set on foot . The consequence of this non-recognition or forgetfulness is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the regeneration of mankind , accounted // for by the fact that some body of persons who ought to have been public-spirited were selfish ; others who ought to have been wise were foolish ; others who ought to have been industrious were lazy ; and others , again , who ought to have lived at home peaceably , went about robbing and murdering . Now this is very much as if a chemist should tell us of the wonderful results he would accomplish , the valuable contributions he would make to the arts , if it were not for the fact that bodies would only combine in certain proportions , or if the action of heat did not expand or that of cold contract . The weaknesses of men , their follies , vices , passions , prejudices , are for the purposes of the statesman or social philosophei essential parts of all questions of government . He can not eliminate them : he must deal with them ; and if his schemes fail on account of their existence , his failure is just as complete , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there is one very striking and very mysterious quality in human nature which does a good deal to complicate all political problems , and that is , that in men in masses this nature is very different in many respects from what it is in individual men . Individuals , in short , are greatly changed when they are combined into great bodies . Motives act on them with different degrees of force ; considerations which weigh powerfully with a man in his own home weigh very little with him when he is at a public meeting , or marching in a procession , or in the ranks of an army . We are forced to admit , too , however firmly we believe in the freedom of the individual will , or however thoroughly convinced we may be of its control over the career of the individual , that as a member of society , he lives under a different law , and that on the destiny of society his ' free will , as far as we can see , exerts but little influence . How this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the individual 's freedom ends , and that of the laws of the social organism begins , are questions on which I do not purpose entering here . They are parts of that great controversy about liberty and necessity which began when man first began to study his own nature , and will probably last as long as the race lasts , but which has derived fresh heat of late from the attempts which have been making to construct a sci // ence of society . Even if we admit , however , that no such attempt will ever be completely successful , there is no denying that some very important contributions towards it have been made by close observation of social phenomena , and that even if we have not discovered the laws of society so as to be able to predict accurately the course of human affairs , we have discovered certain tendencies of society with sufficient accuracy to form in many fields an excellent basis for legislation . Take as an illustration of this the advance that has been made in the means of securing dise4fline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries , and held with perfect honesty , that to obtain obedience from men in an abnormal state of restraint fear inspired by terrible penalties and constant repression were the only instruments of any efficacy . This theory has now been almost totally abandoned in practice , as the result of observation and experiment , and now as much reliance is reposed on appeals to men 's self-respect , by mere disciphinarians as by philanthropists . For the discovery of social tendencies , bowever , for purposes of legislation , wide observation of phenomena and the industrious and careful collection of materials are absolutely necessary . IBut no such processes were carried on down to a very recent period , for two reasons : the first was , that nobody thought them necessary ; the second , that the machinery for collecting them did not exist . Europe emerged from the Middle Ages with an ideal of the state , in which human nature appeared as a thing to be curbed and subdued , and not a thing to be accommodated or trained . In this ideal , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible only to God for its exercise . The nobility also were of divine ordinance , and were intended to be an ornament and bulwark for the throne , and a guide and director for the common people . The state itself was to be first of all united thoroughly under one faith , one king , and one law . It was to be self-supporting , to produce within its own borders everything necessary for its sustenance in peace and its defence in war . Foreign commerce , and , indeed , all intercourse with foreigners , was an evil to be kept within as narrow limits as possible . War was not an evil ; even Bacon declared it to be to the body politic // what exercise was to the human body . The king was the father of his people ; he prescribed their belief , the employments in which they should engage , the manner in which they should invest their capital , nay , sometimes eveii the material of their clothing . The authority to do this came to him from on high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from tradition , partly from the Church . In this ideal , of course , justice and security had a high place ; but of the means of promoting them he was sole judge . If his plans miscarried , it was ascribed either to popular perversity or the Divine wrath . If to popular perversity , the sanctions of the law were made more terrible , heavier punishments were prescribed ; if to the Divine wrath , prayers , fastings , and offerings were resorted to . In a system of this kind statistics were of no use , and accordingly none existed , and would hardly have existed , even if the machinery for collecting them had been attainable . How far , indeed , the idea of experimental politics was from the minds of the men of all parties , and has continued to be almost down to our day , was well illustrated in some of the leading attempts at reform . Few men entered on the work of reform in the sixteenth and saventeenth centuries with the idea simply of extirpating abuses . They generally had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh ideal of either Church or State , which they sought to substitute for the old one , but without mixture or compromise . Their objection to the old order of things was not simply fhat it failed to answer its purpose , but that it occupied the ground on which their own heavenly city was to stand . But even if there had been any general desire to arrive at political conclusions under the guidance of experiment and observation , the administrative machinery in every country was too defective for the collection of accurate or trustworthy statistics . Very little , therefore , was or could be known by any goveminent of the numbers , resources , tastes , habits , tendencies , or progressions of its subjects . Great and striking evils were indeed met by legislation ; but as to the effect of the law , there generally prevailed as much ignorance as indifference . Provinces were remote ; distances , measured by time , were enormous . The civil service was in the rudest condition ; the art of cob // lecting and arranging figures was unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it had been attained . Nearly all political writing , therefore , was purely spenulative . The argument started from a series of assumptions , resting largely on ancient history or biography , and ended in a kind of poet 's dream . The preambles to edicts or acts of Parliament , which for ages contained the only reasons for a law which the people was permitted to receive , were , in nine cases out of ten , statements of moral maxims or religious dogmas . Men were directed to do this or avoid that in the general interest of virtue , or for the honor of God . And it is no less singular than true , that attempts to make law conterminous with morality , to enforce legally the practice of private virtues or the performance of religious duties , have been marks of a declining and rudimentary condition of the political art . One of the most curious features in the history of the Roman law is , that as the empire decayed , the jurists fell off in learning and acuteness , and the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce the performance of self-regarding duties by legislation , and to make religion the formal basis of politics , became more and more frequent . The legislator who , before passing a law , consults simply his own view of fitness , or abstract moral rules , or religious ideas , or philosophic iaxvs , and when he finds his laws hard to enforce simply increases the penalty which sanctions them , belongs to the old school . He who , before he passes a law , asks , Can I enforce it ? what effects is it likely to produce besides the one I have directly in view ? what does human experience tell us as to the working of similar measures ? what difficulties does my own knowledge of human nature suggest that it is likely to meet with ? - he who asks these questions belongs to the new school . The gulf between them is nearly as wide as that which separated the alchemist from the chemist . The principle once established , that the impracticability of a measure is the strongest objection that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of legislation depends , for the most part , and under most circumstances , on the ease with which it can be put into execution and on the nature of the effects which follow it , and we open up an entirely new field in politics and give a new character to our civilization . We initiate a revolution in the art of // government , and one that promises results no less fruitful for human happiness than those produced by the application of the experimental method to other sciences . In fact , we for the first time apply the laws of the human understanding to that " great problem of man , " as the German historian calls it , - " how to live in conscious harmony with himself , with his neighbor , and with the whole to which he belongs . " It may safely be taken for granted that the conflict about the form of government being now over , and democracy having remained , and being almost certain to remain , during the remainder of the present cycle of civilization , master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extraordinary activity , both in the collection of facts and of generalizations from them for political purposes . The governmental machinery in all civilized countries has been brought to a high degree of perfection ; the accumulation of statistics has become easy , and great skill has been attained in the arrangement and collation of them . Thousands of trained observers are engaged in n'oting with minuteness every phenomenon of society . Every year witnesses immense additions to the store of our knowledge with regard to human wants , weaknesses , desires , and tendencies , as displayed in trading , travelling , manufacturing , marrying , educating , governing , obeying , fighting , eating , drinking , and even pleasure-hunting . There is hardly an act of our lives that we do not perform under the inspection of a social philosopher or a curious traveller , of a revenue commissioner or a legislative committee . The materials for political deductions already form a huge mass , and they increase from year to year with growing rapidity , under the influence of the process of assimilation now going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be both unconscious and conscious . By unconscious assimilation I mean that which is the indirect effect of greater security and improvement in the means of locomotion , the growth of intercourse between the inhabitants of different countries , and the increasing familiarity of every people with foreign literature through the spread of education . The enormous demands on the resources of authors made by the reading public of our day , and especially in the field of light literature , forces authors to search for // their materials over an ever-widening field . There is hardly a phase of the social life of any country in Christendom with which novel-readers , for instance , are not now familiarized , through the plots and illustrations of their favorite writers . Moreover , the isolation in all fields of thought under which nearly all that is distinctively national iii ideas and expression has grown up may be said to be no longer within our reach . The man who in any field of intellectual labor takes pains to protect himself from foreign impressions by complete seclusion runs imminent risk , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding his finest thoughts in last year 's gift-books , and his discoveries not only anticipated , but grown stale . Indeed , no matter what literary product is now presented to us , we find it difficult to say in what proportion any country or age has contributed to its growth . Of the effect of this growing community of ideas on manners I need hardly speak . Combined with travel , and the minute attention paid to foreign affairs by the newspapers , it is producing a sameness of type in many ways of thinking and of acting all over the world , which social and political philosophers - and not without some very good reasons - deeply deplore , but which , nevertheless , seems necessary to the realization of the social ideal which the modern world has set before itself as the goal of its striving . By conscious assimilation I mean the effort , which has only shown itself markedly within the present century , but which every nation is now making in a greater or less degree , to adopt for its own use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other countries . In other words , there has grown up in the sociology of our day what may be called a comparative department , the work of which is done mainly by the press ; but all reformers assist in it , and there is perhaps no feature of democratic civilization which marks so distinctly the line which separates it from that of the medieval , and still more that of the ancient world . Down to the French Revolution , indeed , one might say down to the fall of the first French empire , - the great aim of sociologists and politicians was to preserve the national manners and the national social arrangements distinct and pure . That a contrivance or idea was // foreign was considered a good reason for not adopting it ; that it was native , a sufficient reason for retaining it . The work of comparing the national institutions with those of other countries for any purpose except that of self-glorification was treated as a traitor 's work , and involved a kind of martyrdom . But there is now hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not diligently carried on by the ablest and purest minds of every country . With regard to education in all its stages ,  --  to the government of cities , the management of hospitals , the care of the public health , the prevention of crime , the management of prisons , the regulation of the means of public locomotion , the construction and arrangement of dwellings , the composition and preparation of food , the organization and discipline of police , the relations of labor to capital , and of politics to morals and religion , - there is no civilized nation which is not engaged in watching the experiments of its neighbors , and taking notes of them for its own use . In the field of comparative legislation , properly so called , this same process is also to be witnessed , and it is much more rapid than those who are not familiar with it imagine ; but it has been so long the object of special cultivation at the hands of jurists , that less need be said about it than about the larger field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , I may explain by saying that the main feature of legal reform everywhere is the introduction of rules of pure equity , and the subjection of procedure to purely logical and rationalistic methods . The process of codification , for instance , which did not begin until early in the last century , has done away with a state of things on the European Continent which to this generation seems almost incredible , so deeply was society entangled in a network of local usages . There were two hundred different systems of law actually in force in some of the states of Italy little more than a century ago ; a single village often lived under laws of its own ; Germany had much the same story to tell ; that portion of France north of the Loire , if anything , a worse one . Niehuhr speaks of a house and small estate , if I remember rightly , in IDantzic , which descended from generation to generation , under a custom peculiar to that piece of property . Now the result of codification , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to bring the codes of all countries into closer resemblance , and for the simple reason that they all draw , in making their changes , on the great store of principles and maxims which the Ro1iians did so much to accumulate , and to which the labors of every generation of philosophers add something , and which , being neither more nor less than applications of pure morality to human affairs , belong to no nation or age iii particular , but are the patrimony of all , and profitable for all . In the classification of offences , the modes of punishment , the rules of evidence , the laws of marriage and divorce , the laws of inheritance , the limitations on the province of government , the modes of taxation , - one perceives everywhere a gradual but steady disappearance of the differences which for the last twelve hundred years have so strongly marked the jurisprudence of the various states of Christendom . It is hardly necessary to say more , by way of indicating the great extent to which the facts which furnish the materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take notice , in order to legislate successfully , are multiplying . His field of observation is no longer confined to his own country ; it is coextensive with Christendom . lie may get a suggestion from England , a warning from Pussia , an example from France , just as readily as from his own state . When we come to ask , however , what are the nature and fitness of the machinery which the civilized world possesses , or is preparing to enable it to do the work of collecting , arranging , compariub , and inferring , which this abundance of material makes necessary , and which the growing complexity and delicacy of social as well as international relations imperiously call for , we find ourselves in the presence of a question of exceeding difficulty , with which , however , nearly everybody 's mind is consciously or unconsciously filled . Nevertheless , anything one can say about a radical answer to it in the present stage of the discussion is pretty sure to wear the appearance of rather wild speculation . The question is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it , that is , a government of large assemblies , or , as has been well said , government by public meeting , " made up of all sorts of persons , none or next to none of them having any special // qualifications for their task beyond agreeing generally with their constituents as to the more prominent public questions , and being therefore competent to express their wishes in an indefinite way , can ever be made an instrument of scientific legislation , that is , can exer perform that nice adjustment and readjustment of men 's legal relations which the peculiar nature of modern civilization constantly calls for . It is becoming clearer and clearer every day that the hope that the time is near when a short and simple code will supply the legislative wants of modern commercial communities is utterly chimerical . The number of new laws doubtless need not grow as it now grows ; but as human wants multiply , and the means of gratifying them multiply , laws are sure to multiply too . Every new phenomenon creates new relations with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal rule or the modification of the old one , and this demand must be met , if not by skilled , then by unskilled legislation . The whole civilized world is now trying to meet it by legislative assemblies . To government by public meeting every civilized country has come or is coming . Parliaments are the great boast and glory of our age , and they have two undoubted , never-to-be-shakeu claims on popular respect and admiration . One is , that they are the outward and visible sign of the victory of democracy over oligarchy and monarchy . Their rise into power marked the passage of the sceptre , after that long struggle of which I have already spoken , from the hands of the few to the hands of the many . The other is , that their existence and activity are tokens that the people are really managing their own affairs , and that their will , be it well or ill expressed , is the law of the land . But , nevertheless , it is clearer every day , - all thoughtful men acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving more and more unequal to the burdens society now lays on them . Their task in simple agricultural communities , such as all communities were down to the beginning of this century , was simple enough . They had to keep things fixed as they were , and they did it . They have now to make things go , and they do not do it . What with ignorance , haste , want of training , and the distractions of an infinite variety of details and of multifarious conflicting interests , legislation is becoming // in every legislative body in the world often rather a positive hindrance than a help to healthy progress , and a sapper rather than strengthener of public morals . The remedy which has been sought , and to some extent applied , is the appointment of committees or commissions for the examination of questions that it would be too outrageous and too ridiculous to treat off-hand by general debate ; but such committees naturally partake more or less of the character of the body which appoints them , and , as the creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their recommendations for the most part unheeded . And yet these committees and commissions may really be said to be the sole attempts which we now make in the direction of reform in the legislative machinery . I risk nothing in saying that this state of things can not last very long . What the nature of the final remedy will be I do not pretend to predict , but nothing is more certain than that the next great political revolution in the Western world , which will take place after the popular delight in parliaments as mere symbols of victory has passed away , will be some such change in their organization as will not only supply the means of giving prompt , but also scientific expression to the popular will , or , in other words , will place men 's relations in sQciety where they never yet have been placed , under the control of trained human reason . I suppose nobody rises from the consideration of the social and political condition of the world in our day , without asking himself with more or less misgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , even after we have done everything we can do to make progress healthful , are we coming to ? Where and when are the bad tendencies which we all see so thickly around us to be arrested , and by what agencies ? When is " the transition period , " as it has got to be the fashion to call an uncomfortable and perple*ting state of things , to be over ? These are questions hard to answer , and which most of us are often obliged to take refuge from in general reliance on the greatness of man 's destiny , and on the law of growth , under which history warrants us in believing human society , as well as meaner things , has existed from the beginning , and will exist till the end . They certainly can not be answered satisfactorily , but they // nevertheless suggest some reflections , which may save most of us the need of answering them . It is not difficult to see that the cycle of civilization which succeeded to that of Greece and Rome is complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much such as that in which Rome found herself in the closing days of the Empire . The triumphs of her arms and her polity , continued through several hundred years , brought her at last all along her vast frontier into contact with hordes of barbarians , who for ages had sat in darkness , but the hour of whose liberation at last had come . They broke through her boundary line in every direction , and wasted and destroyed treasures without number , but nevertheless saved enough of her traditions , of her learning , and of her art to take up the work of civilization where she had left it , and carry it forward , with better methods and a loftier ideal than she had ever known . The lesson of that great catastrophe , the most tremendous in human history , was clearly this , that Providence , in the government of the world , cares little for individuals , little for nations , and little for races even , but everything for mankind . The most fortunate of historic communities those that have been most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect and human energy to explore - have found , as Greece and Rome found , when they reached the end of their career , that as long as any portion of the human race lagged behind , continuous advance was impossible ; that at last the inevitable hour came , when the meanest and most despised had to be admitted not only to share , but even in savage haste to trample under foot , the fruits of ages of glorious toil ; that , in short , it was a fundamental law of the social organization , that none should labor for themselves alohe , and that progress must be diffused sooner or later among all . The body of persons known as the upper or educated classes of society , who taken altogether , both here and in Europe , have formed a kind of intellectual state , and in whose safe-keeping the interests of civilization have been since the Dark Ages , and to whose labors are mainly due all the advances the world has since made in art , in literature , in science , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their empire // almost to the remotest parts of the globe , the barbarians can no longer be kept out . With some the mere growth of industrial enterprise under the stimulus of science has brought us into contact ; with others the mere cultivation of humanitarian ideas . Steam and commerce have brought the negro and Chinaman to the gates of our civilization , clamorous for admission ; the spread of education and the increasing strength of moral ideas have brought the poor and despised and ignorant of all other races . For the frontiers of this modern empire are not territorial , but social ; its barbarians are found within its own borders , in the streets and lanes of its own cities . Their rush into the forum and into the temples and palaces and libraries is not an agreeable sight to witness , and it would be foolish to expect that under their ruthless touch many gifts and graces will not be obscured , many arts will not be lost , many a great ideal , at whose shrine the best men and women of thirty generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth to be seen no more . Moreover , those who flatter themselves that we are to have no stage of darkness , that the renaissance is already at hand , if history teaches us anything , assuredly deceive themselves . The process of development is in the moral as in the physical world exceedingly tedious . The " mills of God , " as we are constantly reminded , " grind slowly , " and the good that it takes ages to prepare for men , it often takes ages for them to learn to enjoy . We shall , doubtless , now pass through a period of much ignorant fermentation ; we shall see a great number of old experiments repeated , with the old and well-known result ; a great many old discoveries rediscovered , and a great many attempts to embody in legislation wild anticipations bred and nourished through generations of ignorance and privation . But then we know that no conquest of the human intelligence will again be lost ; that the records of human experience are beyond the destroyer 's reach ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed ; that all that is best in human thought will find every day readier expression and wider influence ; and that , whether the end be far or near , it is certain .
