txt There are several points of interest in the letter of our correspondent in Alabama , printed yesterday morning , to which it ' may be well to call our readers ' attention . Alabama has had a political history , since the doge of the war , not unlike that of most of the States that went into the rebellion . From being one of the strongholds of the Democratic Party , it became a Republican State , and has now again passed into Democratic hands . The first change was , of course , due to the negro vote , the second was due to the abuse of that vote . Our correspondent points out that Mr. Snir , NcErt , the autocrat of the Republican Party in the State for the past forty or five years , has managed to ruin the party by recklessly using it as the instrument of his own ambition and greed . He is an unscrupulous adventurer , and calling around him men of his own class , he has managed to make the Republican Party responsible for ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the State Government . ? has been able to do this principally by the influence he enjoys at Washing1a ton , and the control which the traditions of the Senate , opposed as they are to the principles of the Constitution and the interests of the people , have given him over the Federal appointments in his State . By this means'he has not only brought the party to defeat iu Alabama , but he has contributed largely to the disrepute into which the party has fallen on account of its policy in the South . The question of party management in Alabama has , therefore , a national interest , because Alabama is , to a great extent , a representative of the South , and calls for similar - treatment with the whole section . If we were to regard only the visible present outcome of . the party rule in Alabama , as in other States , we might justly feel that the prospect is gloomy . The representation of the State in the Senate by such a man SPENCER , into whose hands falls the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , is about as mischievous a result as could possibly- be looked for , and if his power were to remain unrestrained , the hope of achieving or deserving success for the Republican Party in that quarter would be very small . But one of the points in our correspondent 's statement to which we should like to direct the attention of our readers is , the proof which and earnest Republicans in his State , The poison is calling out its own antidote . It is a healthy sign that there is enough honesty , independence , and courage in the party to resist SPENCER 'S vicious influence . It shows that ho does not iNpresent the party , and that Republicanism in the South is ? not necessarily identified with his reckless and outrageous conduct . Gov . SMITH , in a letter to Senator CAMERON , which our correspondent quotes , describes the situation tersely and clearly . Alluding to SPENCER 'S peculiar tactics , he says : " The distribution of Federal offices has boon a great source of complaint . With very few exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , and in utter disregard of the wishes acid counsel of a large majority of the best and wisest men of the party . * * He has managed the party in this State as the slaveholder managed his slaves . He has employed overseers to compel Republicans to cultivate his political crop . He has paid these overseers with Fedoral offices , and they have for him manipulated conventions by means of bogus proxies and other frauds . Should we accept your plan of compromise , they would resort to einiilar practices to control the suggested convention . SPENCER wants time for his overseers to travel over the State on government pay to get him up a bogus representation in the convention . We are trying to organize for honest government in Alabama , which , of course , precludes all compromise with SPENCER . " Tins points at once to the evil and the remedy . SPENCER has built up his power in the State by the control of Federal patronage . It can only be broken down by taking that patronage from him and distributing it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : lienias in the State . We do not suppose that we are near enough to the millennium to obtain the separation of the Federal offices from political considerations , but no grosser political blunder can be made than to Bur-. render these offices to the manipulation of one man , to be used for his private advantage . Even on the lowest theory of the distribution of offices , their influence belongs to the party , and should be employed to strengthen the party in all its elements . It is an absurd offense against the . Republican Party itself to turn over all the Federal Patronage in a State as a perquisite of the ? position of United States Senator . No man can justly ask for the appointment of a bad officer , or even for an undue share in the appointments for his personal friends . . The ablest and most devoted men of the whole State should be brought into consultation , and every effort should be made to reinforce the party in every section and among all elements . If this were done , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these could be found , it is evident that Alabama could again be made a reliable Republican State . This conclusion is supported by another point in our correspondent 's statement , to the effect that there is a considerable proportion of the Democrats of the State who are quite willing to see a good Republican candidate elected to the Presidency . We have always held that all through the South there are , many natives of the section who , knowing the results of the war to be irreversible , would prefer to see them in the guardianship of a Republican National Administration , if only that Administration would do its  --  best to promote good government in the South . The men to whom we refer distrust the Democratic Party , and dread the hopeless struggle which that party is sure to make , when it gets the power , against the settled will of the nation regarding the issues of the war . It is from this class that the Republican ' Party can be recruited in the ? South if a wise policy is adopted . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest system of appointments to Federal offices in the South would of itself go far toward achieving that result , and establishing Republicanism there on firm foundations .
