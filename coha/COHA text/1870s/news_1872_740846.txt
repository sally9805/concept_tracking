txt The House Committee of . Ways and Means in the State Legislature , has been instructed to investigate the circumstances attending the award of the gravel contract by the late Commissioners of Public Parks to a Company , of which Messrs . RUSTED and FREAR were the managing partners . For the benefit of the Committo and the public , we present the following summary of the ? case as it stands . Mr. Husrzo 's story is that in the year 1870 , he , in connection with other gentlemen , organized the Hudson River Gravel Company . which entered into competition with the lessees of the gravel banks near Peekskill and on the opposite bank of the river . Command of capital enabled this Company to compel its competitors to enter into its service , and so enabled them to secure on their own terms , the trade with the City of New-York . At the olose of the season of 1870 the business was found to be unprofitable , and the Company was wound up . In the Winter of 1871 , Mr. RUSTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Peekskill Gravel Company , and secured . at a rental of $10,000 a year . a lease of the Red Hook banks , ( yielding the superior quality of gravel required Ly the Park Commissioners. ) and procured sub leases of other banks in Peekskill Bay , which produced gravel of a similar quality . This Company fixed the price of the gravel at $3 50 a cubic yard , delivered at the Central Park . The Park Commissioners being unable to purchase the quality required elsewhere , were compelled to pay this price , as well as the extra thirty cents per yard demanded for screening the gravel . Mr. RUSTED and his partner had no arrangement with the Park Commissioners as to the award of the contract , and their profits on the business never exceeded ten per cent . The story of Mr. JESSE RYDER differs materially from the foregoing . From the commencement of the Central Park , he furnished . the original Board of Commissioners with very nearly all the gravel they required . After the war , and up to the Summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 per cubic yard , delivered . With this price he was perfectly contented . and so were the old Park Commissioners . He never suffered in any way from competition till the Hilton , Sweeny and Field 's Commission transferred the contract from him to RUSTED &; FERAL He was , at that time , supplying gravel at $250 per cubic yard . They did not offer to supply the gravel at a lower price , nor did they offer to furnish it from Red Hook . They were not proprietors of any gravel bank , but as they had the order for gravel , and he had the material , he sold to them at a reduced profit to himself . The Company was very destitute of capital , and put him to great inconvenience by the irregularity of their payments . They lost money in 1870 , because they had to pay Tom McCormnrx  --  a friend of SwitErrr ? an extravagant price for conveying the gravel from the river to the parks . If RUSTED &; FREAR cleared only ten per cent . on their business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , there must have been " bad management , or silent partners , or leeches somewhere . " Thus far the question of veracity between Mr. RUSTED and Mr. RYDER . As affecting the tax-payers of New York . the facts are simply these . In August , 1870 , the newly-appointed Tammany Park Commission found that their predecessors had been purchasing gravel at $2 50 per cubic yard . After a short ' interval , the purchasing of gravel was placed in the hands of HILTON , and the price was suddenly advanced , first to $3 50 per yard , and then to $3 80 , though the gravel came from the same banks as before . Something like 27,000 cubic yards of gravel were purchased at this figure , involving a loss to the tax-payers of New-York , as compared with the price paid by the old Board , of $33,000 . Whatever were the reasons for paying the thigh price demanded by the Peekskill Gravel Company , they certainly were not imperative . This is proved by the fact that an offer from responsible parties is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering to supply gravel-front the same bank at substantially the former price . Here , then . is the case in a nutshell . Under the administration of Messrs . GREEN , STEBBINS and their associates , gravel was purchased at an average price of $2 60 . Hirrox no sooner gets control of the parks than the price advances to $3 80 . HILTON is no sooner out of the Department , and Col. STEBBINS put in his place , than the old offer of $2 60 is renewed ; and this , be it noted , for the same quality of gravel , taken from the same bank . To explain this mysterious transaction . perhaps it would be well for the Committee to send for Judge HILTON , as well as for Mr. VAN NORT and Mr. BARKER . In a letter addressed to us on the subject , in December last , HILTON states that all the gravel used in the parks was purchased by either Mr. VAN Nor ' , then Controller of the Department , or by Mr. BARKER , the purchasing clerk . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of New-York how they came to be cheated out of $33,000.
