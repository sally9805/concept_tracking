THE STANDARD OF VALUE . IF one should claim that the precious metals formed the only standard of value which Providence ever intended civilized men to use , he would find an ample base for his argument in the simple comparison of the thought , research , and experiment which have been devoted to the invention of some other standard with the results obtained . A century and a half have now elapsed since John Law first induced the French Government to put the theory of " fiat money " into practice ; and during that time statesmen , financiers , economists , and theorists of every grade have tried to find some improved system of measuring values . Standards real and standards ideal have been constructed without end , but none have ever left the paper on which they were written without carrying disastrous failure with them . Leaving out a few bankrupt or semi-bankrupt nations whose poverty will not allow them to command the precious metals , the commercial and financial world of to-day is , with respect to its standard of value , precisely where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shekels of silver , " current money of the merchant . " So small a matter as a change of twenty per cent . in the ratio of the value of silver to that of gold now embarrasses the better half of the commercial and political world . Bimetalism is pronounced a failure by one party , and monometalism shown to be ruinous by another ; and the only party which declares itself to have an easy solution of the difficulty is believed by every one else to be the victim of an hallucination approaching insanity . After three years of debate and discussion , after the most exhaustive investigation by commissions and individuals , every nation which has felt the trouble is bewildered as to how it can be met , and waits in utter helplessness for something to turn up . The great cause of the stationary condition of society with re // spect to the standard of value is undoubtedly the abscnce of a clear appreciation of the nature of the subject on the part of the public . Our whole education from infancy upward leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or other unit of value to which we have been accustomed , as something equally absolute and invariable with the ground on which we tread . There is nothing in our ordinary daily experience to suggest the idea that one dollar can differ from another in value , or that the dollar of to-day , whether made of paper , gold , or silver , can fail to be identical with that of a century ago . To see the fallacy of this view  --  to apprehend clearly that the word " dollar " is only a name , and is not in itself a standard of value at all-requires a breadth of experience or a depth of study which does not generally fall to the lot of the community at large . When one insures his life or sells a piece of property on long time , he calculates the exact amount that may be ultimately due with a precision which shows his entire forgetfulness of the fact that the real value of what he is to receive may vary , no one knows how much , by fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he is to be paid . Whole nations have submitted to variations in this unit of value which would have bcen politically impossible but for a lack of education in this respect . It is only when the effect of a change is seriously and widely felt , as it is now felt in our own country , that public attention is strongly directed toward the difficulty . Our experience since 1862 has given our people an education on this subject which has fallen to the lot of few of their predecessors of equal intelligence . Few have seen their standard unit in the course of two or three years depreciate to less than one half its original value , and then recover itself again through a period of fifteen years without any such break in the continuity of debt and credit as has generally characterized a return from paper money to specie payments . Instead of discarding our paper money , and readjusting the debts incurred under it , we have brought it up to the standard of a coinage which has itself rather increased than diminished in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though a nominal , were not a real standard of value , and the silver panic has led them also to see with equal clearness that , if one of the precious metals is an invariable standard , the other can not be . The conclusion that neither of them is necessarily such a standard as we want is too obvious to be enforced . After this severe but practical lesson we are in a better condition than any // people ever were before to reach some intelligent conclusion respecting an improvement of the standard . It is one of the misfortunes of the situation that attempts to show the defects of the precious metals as absolute standards of value have been confined almost entirely to that class of theorists who are least able to form an intelligent opinion on the subject . Sensible men see very clearly that , whatever the imperfections of th' coin standard , we shall under it be secure against the disaster and ruin which would be the certain result of the policy of those who oppose it . It is , therefore , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances might appear the only safe course , sticking close to the frying-pan rather than be thrown into the fire . But the uncertainty which hangs over the future of the precious metals , and especially of gold , is such that we may well doubt whether this line of argument is a safe one on which to base our permanent future policy . We shall , therefore , regard the question of a standard as an entirely open one , and consider what are the real requirements of the standard of the future . Every one now sees , with a clearness which is painful to some and pleasant to others , that the dollar of to-day is worth twice as much as was that of fifteen years ago , a fact which is familiarly expressed by saying that the purchasing power of the dollar has increased . But every one does not see with equal clearness how this increase in the purchasing power is to be determined in a manner sufficiently definite and certain to form the basis of a monetary system . What we commonly call purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our first task will be to show that it admits of a more or less precise determination when we consider only our own time . We readily concede that there is no way of comparing the value of a house , a shekel of gold , or a day 's labor in the time of Abraham with the corresponding objects of the present . But we are justified in assuming that an average man 's life and activity of the present generation are equivalents of the life and activities of the average man of the generation preceding and following . Whatever criticism this proposition may be subjected to , we apprehend that no one will deny that this equality of value between the whole communities of successive generations , after making allowance for change of population , is more nearly real than any supposed equality between the value of an ounce of gold or a pound of silver at two epochs . This has been so well // understood by economists that attempts are frequently made to utilize tables of prices for the determination of the fluctuations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple standard of value " is a project based on this process , which has never received the attention which it deserves . Nor have the principles on which such a standard should be fixed always been stated with sufficient precision to leave no room for doubt and dispute in their application . The principal source of doubt is found in the fact that different commodities will give different results , so that an average result must be taken . In taking this average there is room for much doubt and dispute , unless an exact method is laid down . This will be our apology for a somewhat elementary exposition of the proper method of procedure . We must begin by taking some one thing , no matter what , as a provisional standard , and then finding the apparent fluctuations in the values of all other things as measured by it . The most convenient provisional standard is the current money of the country , because we have in the market reports and the rate of wages the actual measures we want , giving the values of all ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the average price of all the important products of human labor as measured in the current money for which sales are made . This is a problem which involves no serious difficulty when once the principles on which it is to be investigated are clearly apprehended . In the few attempts which have been made to reach a solution it has been usual to take the average value of a certain number of staple products , perhaps ten or twenty , without respect to their relative importance . This indiscriminate average does not , however , give us the best result ; we want what a mathematician would call a " mean by weights , " the " weight " of each product being proportional to the amount actually produeed or brought to market . This course answers the double purpose of avoiding a difficulty and leading to a more accurate conclusion . The difficulty which is avoided is that of dealing with those articles of which there are many grades differing greatly in price . Take flour , for instance . There may be half a dozen grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Which of the prices must we take as that of the staple article ? One might regard each grade as a separate article in taking the average , and he would thus have nominally a greater number of articles than his neighbor who , considering all grades of flour as forming together a // single article , should take the average price of all sold . But , when the system of taking the mean with respect to quantities produced is acted on , the same result will be reached on either plan . The idea on which this system is founded is this : Suppose we bring together a collection of samples of all the important products of the country or of the world , the quantity of each sample being a certain percentage of the total quantity produced , and every grade being properly represented . We may suppose the collection so chosen as to represent the product of a year 's labor of an average producer . If there were ten million producers , the collection would be simply the ten-millionth part of the total product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there should be a hundred different products , the indiscriminate method would be to add up the hundred separate prices and divide the sum by 100 to obtain the mean price . The mean by weights would be found by making an invoice of the collection showing its total value in current money and dividing this total by the number of units in the collection . It makes no difference , however , what number we divide by , so long as we never change it , or whether we divide at all , since all we want are the variations in the total value from year to year and from generation to generation . If the collection represents the year 's labor of the average producer , the theory would be that its real value always remains the same , and that all changes in its apparent value , as measured in current money , arise from changes in the actual value of the money unit . The purchasing power or absolute value of this unit would be inversely proportional to the price of the collection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of years , we should obtain the purchasing power of the dollar unit for the same period by simply taking the reciprocal of the price . All that is wanting for a complete solution of the problem is to fix the quantity of each product and of each kind of labor which must be put into the collection in order that everything may be represented in its true proportion . To do this requires an intimate acquaintance with the arts and manufactures of the country , both with respect to quantities and qualities , such as very few men possess . With the aid of this knowledge , however , the problem will admit of a satisfactory solution , and we conceive that a more instructive lesson in the theory of values could not be presented to the nation than that which would be contained in the publication of the value of the current dollar determined in this way at stated periods . // The question would be purely one of fact , and ought to be treated as such . If properly considered , there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cost of a permanent commission to make the required investigation would be so insignificant alongside of the value of the knowledge to be obtained as not to be worthy of consideration in estimating the desirableness of the measure . The main point we have hitherto made is , that there is no reason why a standard dollar containing a fixed weight of the precious metals should remain of invariable value , but that , on the contrary , we have every reason to suppose that its value does fluctuate . It is true that these fluctuations are for the most part so slow that money of this kind is the best which has ever been actually tried by civilized men . But this does not afford a sufficient reason for adhering to the standard if it can be shown that these slow fluctuations will probably be so wide as to cause serious disturbances in the commercial activities of the country . Now , it is a well-known historic fact that there have been several instances of very wide fluctuations in the purchasing power of the precious metals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fluctuations may not recur in the not distant future . The question divides itself into these two I. Are the fluctuations probable ? 2 . What is the extent of the real evil which they will inflict upon the community ? The first question may be answered by saying that we have every reason to anticipate the slow advance of a gold famine , which will result in a gradual but ceaseless appreciation of that metal unless new sources of gold supply are discovered . That any such sources exist can not be confidently maintained : if they do exist , it may be asserted with a high degree of probability that they will be speedily discovered and worked , and that the inevitable advance of the famine will thereby only be delayed . The rapid progress of every kind which the present generation has witnessed is too apt to lead to the inference that there is no limit to human discovery in any direction . But this is not to be assumed as true of everything , and the supply of purely natural products like gold is something respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The famine will not , however , arise simply from the diminished supply of gold , but from the increasing demand which we must expect as a result of the continual increase of wealth . A great increase in the value of the metal will , from the nature of its uses , // produce but a small diminution in the demand for it for purposes of household and personal decoration . Its absorption in these applications may , therefore , be expected to go on without much reference to the probably increasing scarcity . In view of these probabilities , it seems almost hopeless to expect that a gold dollar will ever again circulate with a silver dollar of only sixteen times its weight , unless the coinage of the latter is restricted . The question of the economical effects of changes in the standard of value is one which has been too much neglected . The general fashion has been to say what , so far as it goes , is undoubtedly true , that the only effect of such a change is to make a corresponding change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every one pays for the articles he purchases is divided among the producers and sellers of such articles , it follows that , every time prices rise , producers and sellers , considered as a body , receive a greater nominal money compensation for their labor . Although this increase may at first be very unequal , it must ultimately be divided among all classes through the action of supply and demand . Then everything goes on as before . Every man has a larger or smaller income than before , and pays out for his wants , in the same proportion , a sum larger or smaller , so that his wants are satisfied just as before . A well-known exception to these facts of distribution is found in the relation of debtor and creditor with respect at least to such debts as are outstanding at the time of the change of values . It has , of course , been recognized that the burden of all such debts is necessarily increased or diminished proportionately with the value of the money in which they are to be paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could overlook it . Really , however , it is less important than appears at first sight , since it affects not the sum total of wealth , but only its distribution , or , to speak more accurately , its ownership . These obvious but really slight effects of changes in the standard are the only ones with which the writings of the mass of economists have made us familiar . A few have , however , gone further , and sought , though generally in a very brief and unsatisfactory way , to point out other effects of such changes . A quotation from Hume , which has been so often repeated as to be familiar to every student of the subject , shows how an influx of the precious metals quickens trade and industry . It is generally considered that the opposite cause , a rise in the value of such metals , and therefore in // the current money unit of the country , is prejudicial to trade and industry . But the subject has generally been dismissed with such brevity of detail as to leave an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only attempt at a really exhaustive investigation of the subject which the writer has met is found in two chapters of the recent work of Francis A. Walker. * The result reached by this writer coincides in a general way with the opinions of his predecessors , and may be summed up by saying that an appreciation in the value of the dollar tends to the disadvantage of that important class whose business it is to manage the capital of the country , and who employ the money of others in business enterprises . In view of the fact that these enterprises generally inure more to the benefit of the country than to that of the projectors , and frequently lead to good results when the latter are precuniarily ruined , he considers that a very slow depreciation of this currency , if produced by an increase in the supply of the precious metals , and not by governmental action , is beneficial rather than the opposite . So far as the investigations of Walker and other economists extend , their reasoning appears to be perfectly sound . We consider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill founded from the circumstance of their leaving out of sight one of the most important factors of the problem , namely , the effect of changes of the standard in producing a universal deception among the community in respect to the increase or diminution of its wealth . This factor is so important as to need very close consideration . All men in this and other countries are accustomed from youth to measure the increase or diminution of their wealth by dollars or other denominations supposed to be units of value . To a definite number of these units , say a thousand , a certain idea of importance is attached which can only be very slowly altered by changes in their purchasing power . The reason of this is obvious . These changes entirely elude all ordinary investigation , and are made known only by a collation of facts which can not be effected without long and painstaking research . Even when the facts are understood , the idea that the change is in the value of the commodities measured , and not in that of the dollar itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental discipline is necessary to get rid of it . Indeed , we question whether the most profound economist can be entirely successful in this respect . * " Money in its Relations to Trade and Industry . " // Wealth being measured by dollars , the first effect of an actual depreciation of the standard is to increase the nominal valuation of the wealth of the country . The result of this is to produce a general elation in the minds of the community with respect to its pecuniary prosperity . The elation is , however , experienced in different degrees by different classes according to their position as debtor or creditor . To take one or two familiar illustrations , suppose a factory worth $10,000 to be mortgaged for $5,000 . The owner of the factory and the mortgagee are each worth $5,000 . Now suppose the purchasing power of the dollar to fall to one half its former value . The factory being , then , worth $20,000 , the owner will be worth $15,000 , so that his wealth is , in his own estimation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The assistant employed on a fixed salary is in the position of the creditor until his salary is increased in the same ratio with the diminution in the value of the current unit . He renders to his employer services which are really worth twice as many dollars as before , yet he only receives the same number . His employer makes large profits , while he himself is unconscious of loss , and looks forward with pleasure to an assured increase of salary . Laborers also find no difficulty in securing , from time to time , a small increase in their wages , and the elation thus produced compensates for the depression which they ought to feel from the more rapid rise of the necessaries of life . They feel richer than before , notwithstanding that their wages really purchase less of the necessaries of life . They are , for a long time , quite satisfied if their employer will " split the difference , " and add fifty per cent . to their wages when prices have doubled . The men of enterprise who are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who receive the greatest benefits . By a depreciation of the dollar to one half , they are unconsciously relieved from one half of their debts , and of course enjoy a prosperity entirely out of proportion to their real merits . It is perfectly true , as Professor Walker shows , that a great stimulus is thus given to enterprise . But he does not lay sufficient stress on the fact that enterprises are thus encouraged and made to pay in appearance when they do not pay in reality . The trouble , it will be remembered , is not merely that men are led into enterprises , but that the latter are made to appear successful when in reality they may be total failures . Under ordinary circumstances , the man who is doing a busilless that does not pay is brought to a speedy standstill , while // under a depreciating currency he is led on and on to no one knows where . For example , suppose the purchasing power of the dollar to diminish regularly about ten per cent . per annum . Then every enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . at the end of the year would really be yielding nothing at all , and the projectors would be simply wasting the money of their patrons . We have here the explanation of a well-known historical fact , that eras of depreciating currency have always been eras of extravagant expenditure , to be followed by periods of long depression , from which the community recovers but slowly . Those who are familiar with the enterprises which preceded the great panic of 1837 will see that the conclusions which we have presented as natural results of the depreciating dollar are little more than a summary of the facts of our history during the years 1830 to 1837 . The effects of the appreciating dollar , such as we have had during the last ten years , are , of course , in every respect the opposite of those we have just depicted . Nominal values having " shrunk " to one half , the average man is greatly depressed at finding one half of his nominal wealth gone , though in reality he may be as rich as ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual member of the community informed from day to day of the rise in the values of his dollars , and led to calculate his prosperity accordingly . We admit that the effect has been to discourage business enterprises by making them fail to pay the projectors when they really paid the community . But the purely commercial effects are not by any means the most important ones . A purely imaginary evil is changed into a real one by large classes of the community assuming it to be real , and vainly endeavoring to combat it . Should we compare the wages of labor during the last ten years with the prices of the necessaries of life , we should probably find that every fall in the former was accompanied or preceded by a yet larger fall in the latter , so that in reality the power of the laborer to command the necessaries of life has at no time greatly diminished . But the laborer is unmindful of this fact , and never fails to fight against the continual diminution of his nominal pay . As he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise in the cost of his daily bread , so now he is extremely dissatisfied if he can not reap some of the advantage of a fall of prices . The necessary result is to aggravate the evil by diminished production , which again makes the necessaries of life he requires yet more scarce and dear . The regular progress of society requires // the continuous and orderly coöperation of every class of producers , and , whenever one class refuses to work for such compensation as society can afford , the action of the whole machinery is disarranged , and every one suffers . That great changes in the value of the currency , such as we have assumed for the purpose of illustration , are , on the whole , an evil , no one has ever denied . But it has been very generally maintained that the slow depreciation produced by purely natural causes is beneficial rather than prejudicia ? . For the reasons already assigned , we can not share this view , which amounts to saying that a slight depreciation in regard to values may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may give rise to by stimulating enterprise are , we conceive , more than compensated by its evils in leading to enterprises which do not pay , and inducing habits of extravagance by encouraging unwarranted expenditures . Our ground is , that the effects of various rates of depreciation or appreciation differ , not in kind , but only in degree , and that , in consequence , substituting a slow for a rapid depreciation greatly lessens the evil , but does not change it into a good . We conceive that it is on the whole rather better that every man should feel a little poorer than he really is than that he should feel a little richer . He thus has an inducement to save which , though it may be hard for the time being , will lay the best foundation for future prosperity . At the same time , we freely concede that an invariable standard which always gives him a correct impression , is better than either a depreciating or an appreciating one . That a standard of value with the use of which no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest social desiderata of our day , no one will deny . If commercial panics would not thereby be rendered impossible , they would certainly be shorn of more than half their terrors . But almost all practical statesmen look upon this object as so entirely unattainable , that any one proposing a method of attaining it is apt to be set down among the advocates of absolute money as a visionary enthusiast . The first and natural impression is that general fluctuations of price are as necessary as the fluctuations of supply and demand among individual commodities , which no one ever expected to prevent . Yet we can not but believe that , when the case is once clearly understood , a remedy will not seem so far beyond human ingenuity as it now does . The economist who looks upon // the question from a practical point of view will not attempt to diminish the fluctuations in the relative supply and demand of individual commodities , and will seek to prevent only those wide fluctuations in general value which really arise from the one cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium and for credit . The problem is not therefore to modify in any way the relations of commodities in general , but only to devise some means by which the supply of the single pair of twin commodities , money and credit , shall be kept uniform . In other words , all we want is a dollar of uniform value , as measured by the average of commodities . The only means yet proposed for attaining this end is that of the establishment of a multiple standard of value . Under this system the payment of debts due at the end of long periods would be affected not by delivering an assigned weight of gold or silver coin , as under the present system , but such a quantity as would suffice to purchase a collection of miscellaneous commodities like that described in the first part of the present paper . That this system of payments would be a better one than that now adopted needs no argument ; but there is a difficulty in the way of its adoption which does not appear to have been duly considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt and credit , from day to day in time , and from class to class in society . The books of every bank show a mass of credit on the one side and of debit on the other so great that an absolutely uniform system must be kept up in discharging the one and diminishing the other . Coin dollars being the only practical medium for effecting these payments , they must remain of uniform nominal value . The result of the adoption of the multiple standard for long payments would therefore be to cause confusion in bank arrangements owing to the uncertain number of coin dollars which it might be necessary to pay or to receive . Take , for instance , the case of life-insurance companies , the business of which most requires such a standard of value as we have described . All its receipts are deposited in banks and its investments made accordingly . Special arrangements would therefore have to be made in order that by them its bank accounts , or loans on mortgages , should be adjusted to the multiple standard . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to avoid indefinite confusion , to extend it to the whole current business of the country . This would , however , be entirely impracticable , without some radical modification of the plan . We conceive , however , that a modification of the plan which // shall avoid all these difficulties is perfectly practicaL A multiple standard must to this extent be the basis of any practical plan that the legal-tender dollar shall be defined as a quantity of something , no matter what , sufficient to purchase in the public markets , at average wholesale prices , a definite collection of commodities . The only trouble is , that neither the purchasing metals nor any other one commodity possesses the quality of invariableness of value to such a degree that a given weight of them will effect this purchase . A gold dollar weighing twenty-five grains will sometimes purchase more and sometimes less than the required amount . Clearly such a dollar can never afford the standard we require . But it is equally clear that if we could from time to time increase or diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would always exactly fill the required condition , we should have all that we want . We conceive that a little careful consideration will show that a result equivalent to this can be attained much more easily than would appear at first sight . The first and most obvious method of attaining the object is to issue a paper currency which shall be redeemable , not in gold dollars of fixed weight , but in such quantities of gold and silver bullion as shall suffice to make the required purchases . We have already shown that the determination of this quantity does not offer the slightest difficulty , when once a system is carefully devised . It will always be possible to have a commission , above all sinister influence , ready to report at any time precisely what weight of gold or silver bullion the Government or a bank ought to pay for its notes . This scheme will appear less novel if we notice that it is a golden mean between two extremes , hitherto adopted not only by ourselves but by all civilized nations . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of definite weight , the other its entire non-redemption . Is it difficult to see that redemption in a weight of coin to be fixed by the value of the latter may be equally practicable with either of these systems , and more satisfactory than either ? It is impossible within the limits of a single article to work out all the details of the proposed plan . We shall , therefore , pass to a modification of it , which may involve greater difficulty , but will yield the advantage of a system of coined money . There is no difficulty whatever in the Government changing the amount of gold in the dollar which it issues from week to week , or from month to month , so that the purchasing power of the bullion it contains shall be that of the tabular standard . The only difficulty voi*. cxxIx. - No. 274. 16 // is that the coins already out can not be immediately altered to correspond to the change . But can not such an alteration be slowly effected ? We have to consider two cases : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard , so that the amount of gold is to be diminished ; 2 . When they are below the standard , so that it has to be increased . In the first case it will be found that the dollars already in the hands of the banks and the public are really worth more than the standard allows . If free coinage were continued under the new and light standard , the holders of such coins would immediately carry them to the mint to be recoined , so that the change would be rapidly effected . The better policy would , however , probably be that of our present coinage of silver dollars , the Government purchasing bullion in the market and coining the new dollars from it as long as any profit could be made by the operation . The new and light coins would then at first be as valuable as the older heavier ones , for the same reason that our silver dollar , containing only 85 cents ' worth of metal , is as valuable as a gold dollar of 100 cents . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin to bear a premium ; and , finally , when the lighter coins were sufficient in quantity , the values of the two classes would be in the ratio of their quantities of metal , and a profit could no longer be made by the operation . If this course should be deemed too slow , there would be no insuperable objection to the Government 's establishing a free coinage of the new dollar , or issuing certificates on the basis of the new coinage for bullion or heavier coin deposited . The latter course would bring us substantially to the first of the above plans : that of paper money payable in a varying quantity of bullion . For reasons already mentioned it is hardly to be expected that there will ever arise an occasion for raising the standard of gold coinage . The whole tendency of our civilization and of the increase of trade and wealth is to increase the value of gold , and we can hardly suppose that this increase will ever be changed to a rapid diminution unless new sources of supply , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity arise for increasing the standard , no insuperable difficulty would arise . It Would , of course , not be politic to take away or diminish the legaltender qualities of the dollars already in circulation . Should they prove to be too light , the rule would be that no more gold should be coined except such as was up to the new standard . At first no coin of the new standard would be demanded , but , with the increase // of population and commerce , the lighter coins would gradually command a scarcity value , and would before long come np to the required value of the new coinage . They would then be worth more as a legal tender than as bullion , and it is not impossible that the profits to be made by counterfeiting would prove a serious evil . Should this prove to be the case , there would be no difficulty in the Government 's adopting a course the reverse of that recommended in case the coinage proved to be above the multiple standard , by assuming the loss upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ones . This could be done by exchanging the new coinage for the old ones , and , if the latter did not voluntarily come in fast enough , assigning a certain time within which they must all be presented for exchange , or their legal-tender quality be lost . We have presented all the difficulties of the case , in their worst form . They will , we conceive , prove less insuperable the more one considers the extreme facility with which the community adapt themselves to varying forms of money . To one who had never known anything but metallic money , the adoption of a paper currency would have appeared quite incredible . The proposed variable coinage is , we conceive , a far smaller variation from the regular habits of our people than a paper currency would be if introduced among a people who had never seen one . To see the importance of some system which shall recognize the variable value of the purchasing metals , we have only to reflect upon the disastrous results of these variations upon the industrial and commercial interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that gold has risen at least ten per cent . in value within two or three years . This increase affects nearly every debt and every commercial transaction from the greatest to the smallest the world over . Is it possible that the nations can go forward much longer without recognizing such changes ? SIMON NEWCOMB .
