txt During the month just closed , numerous attempts were made to wreck passenger trains on the different lines of railroad throughout the country . Happily , none succeeded in causing the loss of human life , although , in most instances , the preparations were of such an elaborate nature as to make escape seem miraculous . On one road in the West it was reported , if we remember rightly , that a wall was built with loose flags across each rail . Luckily for the safety of his charge , the engineer happened , as if from an instinct of danger , to be keeping a sharper look ahead than usual , and saw the barricade in time to put down brakes and weaken the force of the collision . The locomotive kept the track , and nothing was injured . The point selected for the disaster was sufficiently elevated to make it favorable for a fearful crash . There was another case in which an old rail had been procured and tied across the track . With such a barrier it - was , doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord used for binding the rail had been exposed to the weather until its strength had all departed . The result was that when struck by the engine , it fell to pieces like so much loose jute . The annual series of attempts to wreck trains on the New-York , Hartford and NewHaven and Shore lines began early . In spite of the efforts that were said to have been made by the Directors of the roads referred to for the purpose of bringing offenders to justice , two or three persons only have been convicted within the past few years , and even these were not punished in proportion to their crimes . The latest instance of an attempt to wreck a train on the Shore Line occurred on Friday . The express train , due in New-Haven at midnight , while passing through a belt of wood ilea . Stratford , dashed across and cut asunder a tie that had been secured to the track . The damage to the locomotive was trifling . No arrests were made . Now , although the Directors of the Shoro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take such a shocking way to revenge real or fancied wrongs , it i satisfactory to know that railroad Directors elsewhere have done better . We published yesterday a short paragraph from the Titusville ( Penn . ) Courier , in which was given some account of a frustrated plot to slaughter a train load of passengers on the Parker and Karns City Railroad .. Two men of Emlenton , Penn. , named CLUNE and PIIINECY , who , it is supposed , had an old score to settle either with the engineer , firemen , brakemen , baggage-men , or conductor , went , as alleged , to the trestle-bridge crossing Bear Creek , and deliberately drew some two hundred spikes from the rails , leaving the latter in such a shaky condition that for a train to pass over in safety was not considered within the range of probability . To make assurance doubly sure , a rail was displaced . Yet the train did pass over , and withal so smoothly that , excepting the men engaged in various capacities on board , no one knew of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Courier reporter : " If the plot had succeeded the slaughter would have been most horrible , as the entire train , with its large load of human freight , would have been dashed to pieces on the rough and rugged rocks in the deep and dark ravine below , the height of the bridge being about ninety feet . " By order of the directors of the company , these facts were kept from the public , and smart detectives promptly put to work " on the case . " The difficulty to obtain a clue was so great that several weeks elapsed before CLUE and PRINECY were arrested . We have not often felt warranted in saying a kind word for a railroad company , and it is , therefore , with all the more satisfaction that we can do so in this instance . As to the guilt or innocence of the men under arrest , it is impossible to offer an opinion at present , but if all the railroad companies that are responsible for the safety of passengers using their roads were to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the revengeful discharged employe might soon give up their horrible attempts to wreck trains .
