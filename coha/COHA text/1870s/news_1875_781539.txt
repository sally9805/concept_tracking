txt What a slaughter there would be of political reputations if the public had only a longer memory ! Here is Gov . TILDEN , for example , at present resting after his little starring tour in his favorite character of the Model Reformer , " and preparing himself for a new representation of the classic part of " HERCULES TILDEN slaying the Tammany Hydra . " The Governor is not exactly a new figure iu politics , though many people seem to think that he awoke about four years ago from a long period of hybernation , which began somewhere about the close of the public life of the late SILAS WRIGHT . When the Governor doesnot drop into the melting mood over the departed glories of the days of WRIGHT and MARCY , he is pretty sure to adopt the heroic strain of reference to his share a the struggle of 1871 . Between those two periods his memory is either a blank , or lends itself to some very strange liberties with facts . Here , for instance , is one of the choice bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not of those who accept men who seek shelter under the Democratic flag while they betray the rights and interests of the people . Applause . I am in favor now , as in 1871 , of shooting as a deserter any man calling himself a Democrat who plunders the people . " This was spoken at the time when the Governor said that he felt " like a Grecian in the age of DEMOSTHENES speaking to the Athenians . " Mr. TILDEN must have been thinking of the celebrated substitutes for DEmoSTIIENES ' essentials of oratory ? " brass , brass , BRAss . " Leaving on one side for the see what he thought about them in 1870 . The process by which Mr. TILDEN 'S alleged conviction on this subject . was reached may help us to understand its precise character and value . In 1870 SAMUEL J. TILDEN was , as he had been for some years before , Chairman of the Democratic State Committee . No man knew better than he the character of the men who had contrived to possess themselves not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisputed authority in the Democratic councils of the State . He had seen TWE ED 'S rise , from the penniless position of a bankrupt chair-maker , to the rank of a millionaire , whose " palatial stables " were the envy of lesser rascals , and whose sumptuously-furnished mansions in town and country were admiringly described by his toadies in the press . Mr. TILDEN not only knew that every dollar of this wealth must have come out of the pockets of the taxpayers , but he also knew how freely it was spent for the campaign expenses a the Democratic Party . He was behind the scenes when the shameful election frauds of 1868 were perpetrated , and as the conspirators began to gather in the fruits of repeating and ballot-stuffing , Mr. TILDEN fulfilled his duty to his fellow-citizens by dpliver-lug prosy harangues about " centralization . " He was still one of the chief wire-pullers of the party in 1870 , and the solitary proof which he afforded of his opposition to the plans of TWEED consisted in a protest against the charter of that year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always claimed a great deal of credit for this production , and has always boasted of the clearest foreknowledge of the effects of the enactment of that law . But ho certainly sought no occasion to publicly relieve his bosom of the dreadful forebodings which he entertained in regard to the future of the City , and he did all in his power to make people forget that TWEED , SWEENY , and the rest of the gang were mere common plunderers , by working contentedly beside them iu political committees , and by accepting their dictation iu conventions of the Democratic Party . At the convention which assembled at Rochester in the Fall of 1870 Mr. TILDEN had a chance to show whatever of manliness or of honesty there was left in him . He had seen how futile it was to dispute TWEED 'S orders in a Senate the majority of which the ox-chair-maker had bought at so much per head . He knew that there was an equally obedient majority in the Assembly who submitted , for well-understood reasons , to the bullying dictation of Tom FIELDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party whip . Mr. TILDEN knew something of the inside working of Legislatures ? could guess what it cost to manipulate a body like that which diseTs41041 Statguhi it370. aiis- what . kind of annual provision would need to be made to go on mampulating its successors . He could not be ignorant of the fact that TWEED had his grasp upon the throat of the Democratic Party of the State of New-York , and that then , if ever , was the time to stir it up to make one last struggle for release . Mr. TILDEN knew that the " slate " ? approved of by that convention would never have been submitted had it failed to receive the approval of TWEED and SWEENY . Probably no man in the State understood better than SAMUEL J. TILDEN how much Gov . HOFFMAN had done to earn renomination at the hands of his masters of the Ring , and the kind of work he was expected to do to earn the higher honors still in store for him . The man who claims to have refused Fisx 's retainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who signed the Erie Classification bill ; the politician who saw through the iniquity of the tax levies , and the irresponsible despotism set up by the charter , ought to have had a very poor opinion of the Governor without whose signature they would not have become law . To a convention to which Mr. TILDEN refused to admit even as contestants the delegates of the Youug Democracy , and to an audience largely composed of the crowd of thieves and shoulder-hitters who had come to sustain the cause of TWEED , it would have been somewhat startling to hear the ornamental Chairman of a dummy State Committee give free expression to his views about the character or the policy of the real heads of the party . A bold , independent speech at the opening of the convention , about the rottenness of the courts , the corruption of the Legislature , the swindling on the canals , and the plunder of the City , might have changed the whole current of recent political history . It would certainly have entitled . the man who made it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could trust to the discretion of the Chairman of the State Committee , otherwise he would not have had the chance of appearing at Rochester in that capacity . They had . become familiar with the stock harangue about " centralization , " and they knew it was good for similar duty many times more . It was only seasonable to have a few references thrown in about BISMARCK , LOUIS NAPOLEON , and the French Republic , and it was particularly refreshing to hear that the real danger of the country was that of coming under the heel of a bureaucratic despotism . And so the farce went through , with Mr. TILDEN as the leading actor of the occasion , making grimaces over imaginary perils and shutting his eyes to real ones ? straining at the gnat of Federal interference with elections , and swallowing the camel of the twin despotism of the Tammany and Erie Rings . Mr. TILDEN , by his share in the mummery at Rochester , helped to bring TWEED and his gang within reach of the national Capitol , to give a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to wring some additional millions of plunder from the tax-payers of New-York.
