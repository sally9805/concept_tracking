txt If you turn to my cable dispatches in Slay you will find that THE NEW-YORK TIMES had earlier information than any other journal of diplomatic courtesies " passing between Count Schouvaloff and Lord Derby , and in spite of contradictions , official , semi-official , and journalistic , I maintained later in the month that notes had been exchanged . ? I , said that Lord Derby had summarized the points brought out in tho great debate and committed them to paper , and that the Minister had defined British interests in such a way that there could he no mistake about them . I also stated that Schouvaloff would bring back from St. Petersburg a note in reply . I did not see any necessity to modify my statement under the inspiration of certain leading European newspapers and the official evasions of Under Secretaries in the House of Commons . At last the murder is out . Yesterday 's Observer ( which , by the way , is the property of the Daily Telegraph proprietary ) published the two interesting documents in full , and to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my later dispatches I informed you that Lord Derby had not been quite satisfied with the Russian reply in regard to Constantinople ; that Schouvaloff 's principal instructions on that head had been communicated verbally , and that Lord Derby had asked that they should he put down in writing . I still have reason to believe that this is the case , though my informant is not quite sure that this incident did not precede the note . The matter is , however , of uo great moment , since it is made pretty clear in the Russian reply that the Czar means to occupy Constantinople , and it must be equally certain that such an intention can not be satisfactory to Lord Derby . Russia has a wily and an insidious way in diplomacy . Whether it is a way that should be permitted to obtain in the communications of great powers , one with another , is a matter of opinion . It is the habit of England to show her hand frankly at the outset of the game . Russia only shows part of hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poker player . suzzesta that the other cards are exactly the opposite to what they really are . Now , at the beginning of the present troubles Russia over and over again declared on her honor that she had no designs on Constantinople , and that her one solo and distinct object was to protect the Christians in the dependent States and enforce the Turkish reforms sho had demanded at the Conference . That keeps awkward objectors to a larger scheme quiet for the time being until the bigger game is developed : - That is Russia 's way , and it can not bo denied that it is a successful way . If Russia had said what she says now some months ago , even Mr. Gladstone would have been alarmed . If the Czar had said , " I shall begin my active protection of ' the martyred Bulgarians ' in Europe by taking Kars and Erzeroum in Asia ; and I mean to dictate terms of peace at Constantinople , " he would have united the British Parliament and the English nation in one solid block , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been properly trained , and he knew how to utilize the freedom of opinion of a free country , how to gain time , . and how far to go on the forbidden course before pulling up to parley again , so that his next discussion should he in presence of an entirely new situation . In the meantime , the subsidized papers of Europe prepare the way for the broader outlook , and so it comes to pass that demands which months hack would have been resented are now regarded with calmness , if not with toleration . It is certain that Gortschakoff 's discreet reply to Derby is not written in the frank lines of the English note , and that it does not sufficiently indorse the English views to give that satisfaction to the Ministry which will insure the permanent . neutrality of Great Britain . On this point something will possibly be said in the House of Lords , for certain papers ( the above included ) have been moved ? for and will he produced  --  to-night . It is also possible that in the ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will move for the extra grant of money for military and naval contingencies in regard to which I cabled you some days ago . A much less sum , however , will be asked for , the same amount , possibly , as that which Mr. Gladstone obtained during the ** War . Some of the money has already been spent in advance , for the army which may be called upon to occupy Egypt is already equipped . This military provision is quite distinct from the other army ordered to ho in readiness when Lord Beaconsfield dispatched the fleet last year to Besika . Bay . The two armies do not possibly number more than 60,000 men , but they form a nucleus which could be augmented , and in case of war England would put into the field a large force of native Indian troops . England 's danger lies in delay , but so long as Russia keeps somewhere near the British programme there is no chance of interference . The country has made so many sacrifices of dignity and position for the maintenance of peace since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her once greatly-cherished ideas set at naught and ignored by her European neighbors . This apathy of decadence , or confidence of the strong , whichever it may be , is bound to lead England into a tremendous difficulty some day , when she will need all her money , her pluck , and her patience . Events march so rapidly that there is no knowing how soon the discomfiture of England may come about . A serious reverse would do John Bull no harm . Fat , lazy , luxurious , a period of real trial would bring out his latent energy ; and an exchange of ledgers for swords is not a had thing , from a politico-economic point of view , for a nation which has gone through a long course of adoration of the golden calf. ? Six weeks later than the date originally and positively fixed , the Russians have commenced the passage of the Danube . Their attempt up to this date has met with only partial success , though sufficient , no doubt , to end in the victory for which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt above Rustchuk , but they got across near Matchin , and possibly ere this they have taken Matchin itself , a by no means inconsiderable triumph . It had been gravely asserted that the Russians would not enter the Dobrudscha for fear of new political complications , but they are there , though it is thought they will not think it advisable to put a great force in operation at that point . It would nevertheless be feasible enough to push their entire Army through the Dobrudscha ; for Von Moltke indicated that as the best line of country for au attempt to turn the Balkans . The conditions have somewhat changed since then , and ere this you will have received from your special correspondent at Bucharest a careful survey of the country and its difficulties , through which the Russians have to make their way when the Danube is safely crossed . From Asia the news is vague and contradictory . It is clear enough , however , that , notwithstanding an occasional brilliant victory on the part of the Turks and Circassians , the Russians are pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centres they have set down for " occupation , " and finally , of course , for " acquisition . " These two terms in the Russian note to Lord Derby will have a good many journalistic and parliamentary changes ruing upon them before the war is at at end and the great difficulty of the future arrives  --  the terms of peace and the division of the spoil .
