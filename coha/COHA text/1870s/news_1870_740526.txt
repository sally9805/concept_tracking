txt Eastern papers contain frequent notices of the arrival of consignments of California salmon . several cargoes have already been shipped ; and the business , so prosperously begun , is likely to increase rapidly . From Mexico to Alaska , every clear stream running into the ocean is frequented by salmon . These fish even ascend small streams which one can jump across ; and the number which frequent large streams is wonderful . The size , quality , and even shape , vary considerably in the different streams  --  the smaller and more slender fish being found in mere brooks , where the resemblance to brook trout is very close . The largest 140.101011 arc probably caught in the Sacramento River . And while this fish , theoretically , must have clear water , it is remarkable that it seems to thrive in the muddy waters of the Sacramento .

In Oregon , Washinton Territory and Alaska there is no limit to the supply of salmon . The streams at certain seasons of the year are literally jammed with these fish . Contracts are frequently made with the Indians to catch and Pack a barrel of salmon for $1 to 61 60 , the first party finding salt and barrel .

Salmon cured by drying and smoking might do better ; but for some reason , very little encouragement has been extended to this way of preparing salmon for market . As the salmon , after being caught , depreciates rapidly by a high temperature , the fish to stand the long transportation overland , minst be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it can be laid down as fresh as when taken from the river . There are parties who are ready to freeze salmon by the car load . Now that it clear that we have got the fish , and the Atlantic cities have the markets .
