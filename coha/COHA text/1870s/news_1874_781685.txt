txt It was GOETHE , we believe , who said that the most dreadful wild beast in the world is a boy  --  an opinion which CARLYLE , perhaps , had in mind when he gave judgment that all males of the human species should be barreled up during the hobbledehoy period of their existence . And yet these sages knew only the European boy , a Cresitiire who , to the Western eye , is the embodiment of tame submission . ' What would they have said had they been subjected to a daily infliction of the halt-fledged , free and independent American citizen I Would not the Geheimrath have recommended cages for his wild beasts , arid the Hero-worshiper have suggested the addition of spikes to his barrels , to teach boys , by example , the experience of the . heroic REGULUS I But above and beyond the boy ordinary of the , Americana , we have that boy ' on the 4th day of July , and during the week or ten days before that date . What a creature ! An animal respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whose idea of the expression of feeling is detonation ; . who finds eloquence in the fizzing of squibs , and wit in the corruseatiOn of Roman candles ; to whom the going up of rockets is the highest flight of fancy , and whose notion of the most delicate form of humor is the setting off of a pack of fire-crackers in an empty barrel under as ancient maiden lady 's window  --  that is , when the more exquisite touch is unattainable , of setting them off under her petticoats . Titily , this creature is an awful dispensation , and sometimes makes us think that if too high a price can not be paid for liberty , there may too high a price be paid for Independence . But this American boy is often one of the " children of a larger growth . " He has been , sometimes seen nearly six feet high , and wearing on the breast that glows with the ardent spirit of a freeman , a glittering pin of the most startling brilliancy , and which , if bought at TIFFANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . In fact , as all people of quiet habits find out yearly , the celebration of our Declaration of Independence of the mother country has resolved itself simply into a saturnalia of noise and the smell of gunpowder . Why it is that rejoicing should take the form of a dreadful racket and a vile odor , may not be more ' indiscoverable than what song the Syrens sang . But until the philosophers have solved that question , we may accept the custom as one of the relics of barbarism . Of these , only two have thus far had formal recognition . One , slavery , we have got rid of ; the other , polygamy , the pickle of Salt Lake still preserves from absolute putrescence . But a third is undoubtedly our way of celebrating the defiance our forefathers flung in the teeth of obstinate , thick-headed old GEORGE III . The wildest , most degraded savages that LIVINGSTONE or BAKER met in the heart of Africa express their joy at any event to them important , just as we do ours at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise ; although of artificial means to make an unpleasant effluvium nature and their habits relieve them of all necessity . They howl , they beat wooden drums , they blow horns , and if they call , possess themselves of a few old muskets and discharge them , blowing each other 's eyes out and their own hands off , just as we do , and they are as happy as we are , and as rational . We pride ourselves upon our intelligence and our high civilization ; and yet we go on year after year in this wasteful and ridiculous exhibition of our rudeness and . the poverty of our resources , burning up and blowing into smoke and stink and unutterable annoyance hundreds of thousands of dollars , with the risk of maiming ourselves and burning our houses over our heads . Perhaps all our readers do not know that the responsibility for this rests chiefly upon one man  --  JOHN ADAMS . Yet it was the venerable and venerated first Vice President and second President of the United States who advised that Independence Day should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crackers ; " and his injunction has been obeyed with a deference to the will of " the fathers " which American sons have not always exhibited . Now , in view of this fact , and to introduce some variety into the celebration of our national holiday , we make this suggestion : That on the coming Fourth , and ever afterward , in every city , township , village centre , corners , or junction in these United States there shall be provided for every five hundred male inhabitants under twenty years of age an effigy of JOHN ADAMS , which effigy shall at high noon be set up in some public place and consumed with powder by the said inhabitants , using either Chinese crackers , squibs , or other explosive and ill-smelling contrivances . That all male persons named ADAMS who have attained the age of twenty-one years shall take their turns in ringing all the bells of the churches and other public buildings , for three hours at 6 A. M. , at noon , and at 6 P. M. ; and that if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets ringing hand-bells , and also blow during the same hours the whistles of all the steam-engines within the places they inhabit . Provided , always , that at Boston , or wherever the descendants of the said JOHN ADAMS reside , his eldest representative shall read the Declaration of Independence during such combustion , explosion , and bell-ringing ; while at the same time the Handel and Haydn Society shall be present and sing in full chorus the old popular song of " Adams and Liberty " ; and that this year Mr. JOHN QULNCY ADAMS shall occupy the Governor 's chair of Massachusetts , ( " tor this occasion only , " ) which shall be brought out for that purpose , and from that seat of honor publicly direct the performances . In this way would poetical justice be done , and the celebration have some much-needed historical significance . We owe the ADAMS family too much to delay longer this recognition of its connection with our celebration of Independence .                 @ @ @ @
