txt founding the Roman Catholic Church , so that it could not be easily shaken . This they have nearly accomplished by State and City grants of land and . moneys . The amounts which the various Romanist churches have received . either from the Common Council or the Legislature , during the past few years , would be incredible , were we not so hardened to such . appropriations . Their next blow was aimed at the free schools , in carrying through the appropriation for " sectarian schools . " Though but partially effective , this blow will be repeated either this or some succeeding year . with more complete success . Already some of our Ward . schools are supplied entirely with Catholic teachers . and everything is " expurgated " from the books taught which might seem to smack too much of liberty of conscience and of thought . Many of our citizens will undoubtedly see the day  --  unless some great revolution breaks forth ? when the Board of Education of this City wilt be as thoroughly Roman Catholic as Tammany is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  has been aimed , during this session , in the bill for " hereditary religion . " By this it is assumed . that every Protestant charity dealing with the enfants perdue of our streets , is engaged in spreading a false religion , and therefore must annually expurgate ( or criminate ) itself before the Legislature . under a penalty of one hundred dollars for each offense ! As a correspondent suggests , the natural amendment to this act would be a provision requiring every Protestant householder to make an annual statement , under oath , that he had never invited his Roman Catholic servants to family devotions , or " otherwise interfered with their religious belief . " These incredible insults to the courage of our Protestant bodies would never be given by these demagogues if our own leaders had not shown themselves in the whole question such utter cowards . When the most eminent public men of the country are afraid to speak a word for one of the grandest events in the history of liberty , because the priests will denounce them before the ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools of the priests as SenatorNonTON and his associates , will propose such insulting acts as this in the Senate of the New York Legislature ? If our Protestant bodies do not arise and show some manhood , they will deserve to be thus trampled on and . insulted by the delegates of the Catholic masses in these counties . And they may be certain that the treatment they have thus far received from the Tammany Ring is mild and considerate to what is in store for them . Mow Long Will Protestants Endure There is a steady and insensible change going on in this State in the seat of political power , which involves most important consequences , and which our readers ought to carefully weigh . The population of this City and the surrounding counties , owing to immigration and . the prolific power of a laboring class , is increasing at an enormous rate . The interior and agricultural counties are growing in a much less rapid degree . It is true that in the last decade our Metropolis has greatly fallen off in growth , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the middle classes are transferring themselves to the adjacent counties . The increase of Westchester and Kings is still immense , as compared with that of St. Lawrence and Oneida . It is also the lowest laboring classes which increase the most rapidly , as is the experience everywhere in the civilized world . Our political power follows population , and the result is that the governing power of this portion of the State , and in consequence the whole State is fast centering itself in the ranks of the lowest and . most ignorant class of the whole community  --  the Irish Catholic laborers and tenement-house population of New York and . its vicinity , led by shrewd native demagogues . Each year gives this class a greater numerical value . They work together as a compact battalion under able and audacious leaders . They control in the City administration enormous sums of money . Where they are deficient in votes , they can create them . The timid or the ambitions Americans who have belonged to the same party organization , have not nerve or principle enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they despise . Thus it happens that this accumulation of ignorant voters in one corner of the State controls more and more every year the interior counties . Were it left to itself , it could do little , as even the plundering of the City treasury would soon be checked by the honest yeomanry of the rural districts . But this mass of voters here is in affiliation with a large party in the country , the majority of whom are directly opposed to them in all their ideas and habits . Party links , and the hopes of emolument and office , bind the two opposing wings together , and the Democratic Party of Now-York State is simply the tool of the Irish Catholic laborers and their demagogues in this City . The course the latter have marked out for themselves is simple and clear . They bad first to get absolute possession of the government and income of this wealthy capital . This they have done . Next , they aimed at                 @ @ @ @
