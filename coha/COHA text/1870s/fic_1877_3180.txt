This collection consists of sketches of Pacific Coast life , most of which have appeared , from time to time , in the Overland Monthly , and other Western magazines . If they have a merit , it is because they picture scenes and characters having the charm of newness and originality , such as belong to border life . The poems embraced in the collection , have been written at all periods of my life , and therefore can not be called peculiarly Western . But they embody feelings and emotions common to all hearts , East or West ; and as such , I dedicate them to my friends on the Pacific Coast , but most especially in Oregon .

The New Penelope and Other Stories And Poems . THE NEW PENELOPE . I may as well avow myself in the beginning of my story as that anomalous creature -- a woman who loves her own sex , and naturally inclines to the study of their individual peculiarities and histories , in order to get at their collective qualities . If I were to lay before the reader all the good and bad I know about them by actual discovery , and all the mean , and heroic , attributes this habit I have of studying people has revealed to me , I should meet with incredulity , perhaps with opprobrium . However that may be , I have derived great enjoyment from having been made the recipient of the confidences of many women , and by learning therefrom to respect the moral greatness that is so often coupled with delicate physical structure , and almost perfect social helplessness . Pioneer life brings to light striking characteristics in a remarkable manner ; because , in the absence of conventionalities and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the surface as they never would have done under different circumstances . In the early life of the Greeks , Homer found his Penelope ; in the pioneer days of the Pacific Coast , I discovered mine . My wanderings , up and down among the majestic mountains and the sunny valleys of California and Oregon , had made me acquainted with many persons , some of whom were to me , from the interest they inspired me with , like the friends of my girlhood . Among this select number was Mrs. Anna Greyfield , at whose home among the foot-hills of the Sierras in Northern California , I had spent one of the most delightful summers of my life . Intellectual and intelligent without being learned or particularly bookish ; quick in her perceptions and nearly faultless in her judgment of others ; broadly charitable , not through any laxity of principle on her own part , but through knowledge of the stumbling-blocks of which the world is full for the unwary , she was a constant surprise and pleasure to me . For , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among their disadvantages want of actual knowledge of things -- the latter accounting for the former . I had several times heard it mentioned that Mrs. Greyfield had been twice married ; and as her son Benton was also called Greyfield , I presumed that he was the son of the second marriage . How I found out differently I am about to relate . One rainy winter evening , on the occasion of my second visit to this friend , we were sitting alone before a bright wood fire in an open fireplace , when we chanced to refer to the subject of her son 's personal qualities ; he then being gone on a visit to San Francisco , and of course very constantly in his mother 's thoughts , as only sons are sure to be . " Benton is just like his father , " she said . " He is self-possessed and full of expedients , but he says very little . I have often wished he conversed more readily , for I admire a good talker . " " And yet did not marry one :  - -  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fire , whose pleasant radiance filled the room , bringing out the soft warm colors in the carpet , and making fantastic shadows of our easy-chairs and ourselves upon the wall . " Mr. Greyfield was your second husband ? " I said , in an inquiring tone , but without expecting to be contradicted . " Mr. Greyfield was my first , last , and only husband , " she replied , with a touch of asperity , yet not as if she meant it for me . " I beg your pardon , " I hastened to explain : " but I had been told --  " " Yes , I can guess what you have been told . Very few people know the truth : but I never had a second husband , though I was twice married ; " and my hostess regarded me with a smile half assumed and half embarrassed . For my own part , I was very much embarrassed , because I had certainly been informed that she had lived for a number of years with a second husband who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced . Doubt her word I could not ; neither could I reconcile her statement with facts apparently well known . She saw my dilemma , and , after a brief silence , mentally decided to help me out of it . I could see that , in the gradual relaxing of certain muscles of her face , which had contracted at the first reference to this -- as I could not doubt -- painful subject . Straightening her fine form as if ease of position was not compatible with what was in her mind , she grasped the arms of her chair with either hand , and looking with a retrospective gaze into the fire , began : " You see it was this way : the man I married the second time had another wife . " While she drew a deep breath , and made a momentary pause , I seemed to take it all in , for I had heard so many stories of deserted Eastern homes , and subsequent illegal marriages in California , that I was prepared not to be at all surprised at what I should learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about it the very day of the marriage . We were married in the morning , and in the afternoon a man came over from Vancouver who told me that Mr. Seabrook had a wife , and family of children , in a certain town in Ohio . " Another pause followed , while she seemed to be recalling the very emotions of that time . " Vancouver ? " I said : " that is on the Columbia River . " " Yes ; I was living in Portland at that time . " In reply to my glance of surprise , she changed the scene of her story to an earlier date . " Mr. Greyfield had always wanted to come to California , after the gold discoveries ; but when he married me he agreed not to think of it any more . I was very young and timid , and very much attached to my childhood 's home , and my parents ; and I could not bear the thought of going so long a distance away from them . It was not then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but a long six months ' pilgrimage through a wilderness country infested by Indians . To reach what ? another wilderness infested by white barbarians ! " " But I have always heard , " I said , " that women were idealized and idolized in those days . " " That is a very pretty fiction . If you had seen what I have seen on this coast , you would not think we had been much idealized . Women have a certain value among men , when they can be useful to them . In the old States , where every man has a home , women have a fixed position and value in society , because they are necessary to make homes . But on this coast , in early times , and more or less even now , men found they could dispense with homes ; they had been converted into nomads , to whom earth and sky , a blanket and a frying-pan , were sufficient for their needs . Unless we came to them armed with endurance to battle with primeval nature , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts in any kind of a tub out of doors under a tree , and iron them kneeling on the ground , to support themselves and half a dozen little , hungry young ones , were welcome enough -- before the Chinamen displaced them . We had some value as cooks , before men , with large means , turned their attention to supplying their brothers with prepared food for a consideration below what we could do with our limited means . And then the ladies , the educated , refined women , who followed their husbands to this country , or who came here hoping to share , perchance , in the golden spoils of the mines ! Where are they to-day , and what is their condition ? Look for them in the sunless back rooms of San Francisco boarding-houses , and you will find them doing a little fine sewing for the shops ; or working on their own garments , which they must make out of school hours , because the niggardly pay of teachers in the lower grades will not allow of their getting them done . Idealized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where we clamor for paying work of some kind , for something to do that will enable us to live in half comfort by working more hours than they do to earn lordly livings . " How much soever I might have liked to talk this labor question over with my intelligent hostess at any other time , my curiosity concerning her own history having been so strongly aroused , the topic seemed less interesting than usual , and I seized the opportunity given by an emphasized pause to bring her back to the original subject . " Did you come first to California ? " I asked . " No . I had been married little over a year when Benton was born . ' Now , ' I thought , ' my husband will be contented to stay at home . ' He had been fretting about having promised not to take me to California ; but I hoped the baby would divert his thoughts . We were doing well , and had a pleasant house , with everything in and about it that a young couple ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up anything he had strongly desired ; and seeing how much he brooded over it , I finally told him to be comforted ; that I would go with him to California if he would wait until the baby was a year old before starting ; and to this he agreed . " " How old were you at that time ? " " Only about nineteen . I was twenty the spring we started ; and celebrated my anniversary by making a general gathering of all my relatives and friends at our house , before we broke up and sold off our house-keeping goods -- all but such as could be carried in our wagons across the plains . " " You were not starting by yourselves ? " " O no . There was a large company gathering together on the Missouri river , to make the start in May ; and we , with some of our neighbors , made ready to join them . I shall never forget my feelings as I stood in my own house for the last time , taking a life-long leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about that . " " I want to hear what you choose to tell me ; but most of all about your second marriage , and what led to it . " " It is not easy to go back so many years and take up one thread in the skein of life , and follow that alone . I will disentangle it as rapidly as I can ; but first let us have a fresh fire . " Suiting the action to the word , my hostess touched a bell and ordered a good supply of wood , which I took as an intimation that we were to have one of our late sittings . In confirmation of this suspicion a second order was given to have certain refreshments , including hot lemonade , made ready to await our pleasure . When we were once more alone I begged her to go on with her story . " We left the rendezvous in May , and traveled without any unusual incidents all through the summer . " " I beg pardon for interrupting you ; but I do want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it not terrible ? " " It was monotonous , it was disagreeable , but it was not terrible while everybody was well . There were compensations in it , as in almost any kind of life . My husband was strong and cheerful , now that he was having his own way ; the baby throve on fresh air and good milk -- for we had milch cows with us -- and the summer months on the grassy plains are delightful , except for rather frequent thunder storms . The grass was good , and our cattle in fine order . Everything went well until the cholera broke out among us . " " And then ? " " And then my husband died . " " Ah , what have not pioneer women endured ! " " Mr. Greyfield had from the first been regarded as a sort of leader . Without saying much , but by being always in the right place at the right time , he had gained an ascendancy over the less courageous , strong and decided men . When the cholera came he was continually called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort the living . " " And so became the easier victim ? " My remark was unheeded , while my hostess lived over again in recollection the fearful scenes of the cholera season on the plains . I wanted to divert her , and called her attention to the roaring of the wind and beating of the rain without . " Yes , " she said ; " it stormed just in that way the night before he died . We all were drenched to the skin , and he was not in a condition to bear the exposure . I was myself half sick with fever , and when the shock came I became delirious . When I came to myself we were a hundred and fifty miles away from the place where he died . " " How dreadful ! " I could not help exclaiming . " Not even to know how and where he was buried . " " Nor if he were buried at all . So frightened were the people in our train that they could not be prevailed upon to take proper care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dead . After my reason returned , the one subject that I could not bear to have mentioned was that of my husband 's death . Some of the men belonging to the train had taken charge of my affairs and furnished a driver for the wagon I was in . The women took care of Benton ; and I lived , who would much rather have died . Probably I should have died , but for the need I felt , when I could think , of somebody to care for , support and educate my child . My constitution was good ; and that , with the anxiety about Benton , made it possible for me to live . " " My dear friend , " I exclaimed ; " what a dreadful experience ! I wonder that you are alive and sit there talking to me , this moment . " " You will wonder more before I have done , " she returned , with what might be termed a superior sort of smile at my inexperience . " But how did you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our train was about at the place where the Oregon and California emigrants parted company , when I recovered my reason and strength enough to have any concern about where I was going . Some of those who had started for Oregon had determined to go to California ; and the most particular friend Mr. Greyfield had in the train had decided to go to Oregon instead of to California , as he first intended . Now , when my husband was hopeless of his own recovery , he had given me in charge of this man , with instructions to be governed by him in all my business affairs ; and I had no thought of resisting his will , though that bequest was the cause of the worst sorrows of my life , by compelling me to go to Oregon . " " Why can not people be contented with ruling while living , without subjecting others to the domination of an irrevocable will , when they are no longer able to mold or govern circumstances . I beg your pardon . Pray go on . But first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded to trust your affairs proved trustworthy ? " " As trustworthy as nearly absolute power on one side , and timid inexperience on the other , is likely to make any one . When we arrived finally in Portland , he took my wagons and cattle off my hands , and returned me next to nothing for them . Yet , he was about like the average administrator ; it did not make much difference , I suppose , whether this one man got my property , or a probate court . " " Poor child ! I can see just how you were situated . Alone in a new country , with a baby on your hands , and without means to make a home for yourself . What did you do ? did you never think of going back to your parents ? " " How could I get back ? The tide of travel was not in that direction . Besides , I had neither money nor a sufficient outfit . There was no communication by mail in those days oftener than once in three months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from the East . O , no ! there was nothing to be done , except to make the best of the situation . " " Certainly , you had some friends among your fellow-immigrants who interested themselves in your behalf to find you a home ? Somebody besides your guardian already mentioned . " " The most of them were as badly off as myself . Many had lost near friends . I was not the only widow ; but some women had lost their husbands who had several young children . They looked upon me as comparatively fortunate . Men had lost wives , and these were the most wretched of all ; for a woman can contrive some way to take care of her children , where a man is perfectly helpless . Families , finding no houses to go into by themselves , were huddled together in any shelter that could be procured . The lines of partition in houses were often as imaginary as the parallels of latitude on the earth ; or were defined by a window , or a particular board in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . My object was to get a real home somewhere . As soon as I could , I rented a room in a house with a good family , for the sake of the protection they would be to me , and went to work to earn a living . Of course , people were forward enough with their suggestions . " " Of what , for instance ? " " Most persons -- in fact everybody that I talked with -- said I should have to marry . But I could not think of it ; the mention of it always made me sick that first winter . I was recovering strength , and was young ; so I thought I need not despair . " " Such a woman could not but have plenty of offers , in a new country especially ; but I understand how you must have felt . You could not marry so soon after your husband 's death , and it revolted you to be approached on the subject . A wife 's love is not so easily transferred . " " You speak as any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was something more than that in the feeling I had . I could not realize the fact of Mr. Greyfield 's death . It was as if he had only fallen behind the train , and might come up with us any day . I waited for him all that winter . " " How distressing ! " I could not help saying . Mrs. Greyfield sat silent for some minutes , while the storm raged furiously without . She rested her cheek on her hand and gazed into the glowing embers , as if the past were all pictured there in living colors . For me to say , as I did , " how distressing , " no doubt seemed to her the merest platitude . There are no conventional forms for the expression of the utmost grief or sympathy . Silence is most eloquent , but I could not keep silence . At last I asked , " What did she do to earn a living ? " " I learned to make men 's clothes . There was a clothing store in the place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pants ; and finally I got to be quite expert , and could earn several dollars a day . But a dollar did not buy much in those times ; and oh , the crying spells that I had over my work , before I had mastered it sufficiently to have confidence in myself . Sancho Panza blessed the man that invented sleep -- I say , blessed be the woman that invented crying-fits , for they save thousands and thousands of women from madness , annually ! " This was a return to that sprightly manner of speech that was one of Mrs. Greyfield 's peculiar attractions ; and which often cropped out in the least expected places . But though she smiled , it was easy to see that tears would not be far to seek . " And yet , " I said , " it is a bad habit to cultivate -- the habit of weeping . It wastes the blood at a fearful rate . " " Do n't I know it ? But it is safer than frenzy . Why I used -- but I 'll not tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my marriage with Mr. Seabrook . As I told you , everybody said I must marry ; and the reasons they gave were , that I must have somebody to support me ; that it was not safe for me to live alone ; that my son would need a man 's restraining hand when he came to be a few years older ; and that I , myself , was too young to live without love !  - -  therefore the only correct thing to do was to take a husband -- a good one , if you could get him -- a husband , anyway . As spring came round , and my mind regained something of its natural elasticity , and my personal appearance probably improved with returned health , the air seemed full of husbands . Everybody that had any business with me , if he happened not to have a wife , immediately proposed to take me in that relation . All the married men of my acquaintance jested with me on the subject , and their wives followed in the same silly iteration . I actually felt myself of some consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became irksome . " " How did all your suitors contrive to get time for courtship ? " I laughingly inquired . " O , time was the least of their requirements . You know , perhaps , that there was an Oregon law , or , rather , a United States law , giving a mile square of land to a man and his wife : to each , half . Now some of the Oregonians made this " Donation Act " an excuse for going from door to door to beg a wife , as they pretended , in order to be able to take up a whole section , though when not one of them ever cultivated a quarter section , or ever meant to . " " And they come to you in this way ? What did they say ? how did they act ? " " Why , they rode a spotted cayuse up to the door with a great show of hurry , jangling their Mexican spurs , and making as much noise as possible . As there were no sidewalks in Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door , or knock at one , if they had so much politeness . In either case , as soon as they saw a woman they asked if she were married ; and if not , would she marry ? there was no more ceremony about it . " " Did they ever really get wives in that way , or was it done in recklessness and sport ? It seems incredible that any woman could accept such an offer as that . " " There were some matches made in that way ; though , as you might conjecture , they were not of the kind made in heaven , and most of them were afterwards dissolved by legislative action or decree of the courts . " " Truly you were right , when you said women are not idealized in primitive conditions of society , " I said , after the first mirthful impulse created by so comical a recital had passed . " But how was it , that with so much to disgust you with the very name of marriage , you finally did consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the kind that came riding up to doors , proposing on the instant ? " " No , he was not : but he might as well have been for any difference it made to me , " said Mrs. Greyfield , with that bitterness in her tone that always came into it when she spoke of Seabrook . " You ask ' how was it that I at last consented to take a husband ? ' Do you not know that such influences as constantly surrounded me , are demoralizing as I said ? You hear a thing talked of until you become accustomed to it . It is as Pope says : You ' first endure , then pity , then embrace . ' I endured , felt contempt , and finally yielded to the pressure . " Why , you have no idea , from what I have told you , of the reality . My house as I have already mentioned , was one room in a tenement . It opened directly upon the street . In one corner was a bed . Opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A table and two chairs besides my little sewing-chair completed the furnishing of the apartment . The floor was bare , except where I had put down an old coverlet for a rug before the bed . Here in this crowded place I cooked , ate , slept , worked , and received company and offers ! " Just as an example of the way in which some of my suitors broached the subject I will describe a scene . Fancy me kneeling on the floor , stanching the blood from quite a serious cut on Benton 's hand . The door opens behind me , and a man I never have seen before , thrusts his head and half his body in at the opening . His salutation is ' Howdy ! ' his first remark , ' I heern thar was a mighty purty widder livin ' here ; and I reckon my infurmation was correct . If you would like to marry , I 'm agreeable . ' " " How did you receive this candidate ? You have not told me what you replied on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pioneer life . " I turned my head around far enough to get one look at his face , and asking him rather crossly ' if there were any more fools where he came from , ' went on bandaging Benton 's hand . " The recollection of this absurd incident caused the narrator to laugh as she had not often laughed in my hearing . " This may have been a second Werther , " I remarked , " and surely no Charlotte could have been more unfeeling than you showed yourself . It could not be that a man coming in that way expected to get any other answer than the one you gave him ? " " I do not know , and I did not then care . One day a man , to whose motherless children I had been kind when opportunity offered , slouched into my room without the ceremony of knocking and dropping into a chair as if his knees failed him , began twirling his battered old hat in an embarrassed manner , and doing as so many of his predecessors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , a long lank figure , faded old clothes , and a whining voice . " " He told me that he had no ' woman , ' and that I had no ' man , ' a condition that he evidently considered deplorable . He assured me that I suited him ' fustrate ; ' that his children ' sot gret store by me , ' and ' liked my victuals ; ' and that he thought a ' heap ' of my little boy . He also impressed upon me that he had been ' considerin ' the ' rangement of jinin ' firms for some time . To close the business at once , he proposed that I should accept of him for my husband then and there . " " And pray , what did you say to him ! " " I told him that I did not know what use I had for him , unless I should put him behind the stove , and break bark over his head . " This reply tickled my fancy so much that I laughed until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind to say that . " You see , we burned fir wood , the bark of which is better to make heat than the woody portion of the tree ; but is never sawed or split , and has to be broken . I used to take up a big piece , and bring it down with a blow over any sharp corner to knock it into smaller fragments , and something in the man 's appearance , I suppose , suggested that he might be good for that , if for nothing else . I did not stop to frame my replies on any forms laid down in young ladies ' manuals ; but they seemed to be conclusive as a general thing . " " I should think so . Yet , there must have been some , more nearly your equals , attracted by your youth and beauty , loving you , or capable of loving you , to whom you could not give such answers , by whom such answers would not be taken . " " As I look back upon it now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken and did not , that I regret . There were men of all classes nearly ; but they were not desirable , as I saw it then , or as I see it now . It is true that I was young , and pretty , perhaps , and that women were in a minority . But then , too , the men who were floating about on the surface of pioneer society were not likely to be the kind of men that make true lovers and good husbands . Some of them have settled down into steady-going benedicts , and have money and position . The worst effect of all this talk about marrying was , that it prepared me to be persuaded against my inner consciousness into doing that which I ought not to have done . My truer judgment had become confused , my perceptions clouded , from being so often assailed by the united majority who could not bear to see poor , little minority go unappropriated . But come , let us have our cakes and lemonade . You need something to sustain you while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that she needed a brief interval in which to collect her thoughts and calm a growing nervousness that in spite of her efforts at pleasantry would assert itself in various little ways , evident enough to my observation . A saucepan of water was set upon the hot coals on the hearth , the lemons cut and squeezed into two elegant goblets , upon square lumps of sugar that eagerly took up the keen acid , and grew yellow and spongy in consequence . A sociable little round table was rolled out of its seclusion in a corner , and made to support a tray between us , whereon were such dainty cakes and confections as my hostess delighted in . There was an air of substantial comfort in all the arrangements of my friend 's house that made it a peculiarly pleasant one to visit . It lacked nothing to make it home-like , restful , attractive . The house itself was large and airy , with charming views ; the furniture sufficiently elegant without being too fine for use ; flowers , birds , and all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they so often are in the houses of people who are fond of pretty and curious things , but have no really refined taste to arrange them . Our little ten-o'clock lunch was perfect in its appointments -- a " thing of beauty , " as it was of palatableness and refreshment . So strongly was I impressed at the moment with this talent of Mrs. Greyfield 's , that I could not refrain from speaking of it , as we sat sipping hot and spicy lemonade from those exquisite cut-glass goblets of her choosing , and tasting dainties served on the loveliest china : " Yes , I suppose it is a gift of God , the same as a taste for the high arts is an endowment from the same source . Did it never strike you as being absurd , that men should expect , and as far as they can , require all women to be good housekeepers ? They might as well expect every mechanic to carve in wood or chisel marble into forms of life . But it is my one available talent , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt it was one chief cause of my trouble , by attracting Mr. Seabrook . " " You must know , " I said , " that I am tortured with curiosity to hear about that person . Will you not now begin ? " " Let me see -- where did I leave off ? I was telling you that although I had so many suitors , of so many classes , and none of them desirable , to my way of thinking , I was really gradually being influenced to marry . You must know that a woman so young and so alone in the world , and who had to labor for her bread , and her child 's bread , could not escape the solicitations of men who did not care to marry ; and it was this class who gave me more uneasiness than all the presuming ignorant ones , who would honor me by making me a wife . I know it is constantly asserted , by men themselves , that no woman is approached in that way who does not give some encouragement . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary politeness and friendliness into a covert advance . The cunning of the " father of lies " is brought to bear to entrap artless and inexperienced women into situations whence they are assured there is no escape without disgrace . " During my first year of widowhood my feelings were several times outraged in this way ; and at first I was so humiliated , and had such a sense of guilt , that it made me sick and unfit for my work . The guilty feeling came , I now know , from the consciousness I had of the popular opinion I have referred to , that there must be something wrong in my deportment . But by calling to mind all the circumstances connected with these incidents , and studying my own behavior and the feelings that impelled me , I taught myself at last not to care so very much about it , after the first emotions of anger had passed away . Still I thought I could perceive that I was not quite the same person : you understand ?  - -  the ' bloom ' was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame , that a woman in your situation could not be left to be herself , with her own pure thoughts and tender sorrows ! Was there no one to whom you could go for advice and sympathy ? none among all those who came to the country with you who could have helped you ? " " The people who came out with me were mostly scattered through the farming country ; and would have been of very little use to me if they had not been . In fact , they would , probably , have been first to condemn me , being chiefly of an uneducated class , and governed more by traditions than by the wisdom of experience . There were two or three families whose acquaintance I had made after arriving in Portland , who were kindly disposed towards me , and treated me with great neighborliness ; especially the family that was in the same tenement with me . To them I sometimes mentioned my troubles ; but while they were willing to do anything for me in the way of a common friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience , or sitting with me when Benton was sick -- as he very often was -- they could not understand other needs , or minister to the sickness of the mind . If I received any counsel , it was to the effect that a woman was in every way better off to be married . I used to wonder why God had not made us married -- why he had given us our individual natures , since there was forever this necessity of being paired ! " " Yet you had loved your husband ? " " I had never ceased to love him !  - -  and that was just what these people could not understand . Death cut them loose from everything , and they were left with only strong desires , and no sentiment to sanctify them . That I should love a dead husband , and turn with disgust from a living one , was inexplicable to them . " " My dear , I think I see the rock on which you wrecked your happiness . " For the moment I had forgotten what she had told me in the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her married to a living husband , and loving only the memory of one dead . She saw my error , and informed me by a look . Pushing away the intervening table with its diminished contents , and renewing the fire , Mrs. Greyfield proceeded : " It would take too long to go over the feelings of those times , and assign their causes . You are a woman that can put yourself in my place , to a great extent , though not wholly ; for there are some things that can not be imagined , and only come by experience . " " Benton was two years and a half old ; a very delicate child , suffering nearly all the time with chills and fever . I had occasional attacks of illness from the malaria , always to be met with on the clearing up of low-lands near a river . Still I was able to sew enough to keep a shelter over our heads , and bread in our mouths , until I had been a year in Portland . But I could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited . About this time I made the acquaintance of Mr. Seabrook . He was introduced to me by a mutual acquaintance , and having a little knowledge of medicine , gave me both advice and remedies for Benton . He used to come in quite often , and look after the child , and praise my housekeeping , which probably was somewhat better than that of the average pioneer of those days . He never paid me any silly compliments , or disturbed my tranquillity with love-making of any sort . Just for that reason I began to like him . He was twelve or fifteen years older than myself ; and more than ordinarily fine-looking and intelligent . You have no idea , because you have never been so placed , what a comfort it was to me to have such a friend . " " Yes , I think I know . " " One day he said to me , ' Mrs. Greyfield , this sitting and sewing all day is bad for your health . Now , I should think , being so good a housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarders ; and I believe you could stand that kind of labor better than sewing . ' We had a little talk about it , and he proposed trying to find me a house suited to the purpose ; to which I very readily consented ; for , though I was wholly inexperienced in any business , I thought it better to venture the experiment than to keep on as I was doing . " " How did you expect to get furniture ? Pardon me ; but you see I want to learn all about the details of so strange a life . " " I do n't think I expected anything , or thought of all the difficulties at once . " " Which was fortunate , because they would have discouraged you . " " It is hard to say what has or has not been for the best . But for that boarding-house scheme , I do not believe I should have married the man I did . " As I was saying , Mr. Seabrook never annoyed me with attentions . He came and talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air that disarmed apprehension on that score . Mrs.  - -   - -   , my neighbor in the next room , once hinted to me that his visits were indicative of his intentions , and thereby caused me a sleepless night . But as he never referred to the subject , and as I was now full of my new business project , the alarm subsided . A house was finally secured , or a part of a house , consisting of a kitchen , dining-room and bed-room , on the first floor ; and the same number of rooms above . I had a comfortable supply of bedding and table linen ; the trouble was about cabinet furniture . But as most of my boarders were bachelors , who quartered themselves where they could , I got along very well . " " You made a success of it , then ? " " I made a success . I threw all my energies into it , and had all the boarders I could cook for . " " Mr. Seabrook boarded with you ?  - -  I conjecture that . " " Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first I liked it well enough ; I had so much confidence in him . But in a short time I thought I could perceive that my other boarders were disposed to think that we looked toward a nearer relationship in the future . Perhaps they were justified in thinking so , as they could only judge from appearances ; and I had asked Mr. Seabrook to take the foot of the table , and carve , because I had so much else to do that it was impossible for me to do that also . Gradually he assumed more the air of proprietor than of boarder ; but as he was so much older and wiser , and had been of so much service to me , I readily pardoned what I looked upon as a matter of no great consequence . " It proved to be , however , a matter of very great consequence . I had been established in the new house and business four or five weeks , when one evening , Benton being unusually ill , I asked Mr. Seabrook 's advice about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated my apartments from those occupied by a family of Germans . I chose that room for myself because it seemed less lonely , and safer for me , to be where I could hear the voice of the little German woman , and she could hear mine . In the same manner my kitchen joined on to hers , and we could hear each other at our work . Benton being too ill to be dressed , was lying on the bed in my room , and I asked Mr. Seabrook to go up and look at him . He examined him and told me what to do , in his usual decided and assured manner , and went back to the dining-room , which was also my sitting-room . As soon as Benton was quieted , so that I could leave him , I also returned to the lower part of the house to finish my evening tasks . " There is such a feeling of hatred arises in my heart when I recall that part of my history that it makes me fear my own wickedness ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blight our own natures ? " " Undoubtedly ; but that would be a sort of frenzy , and would finally end in madness . You do not feel in that way . It is the over-mastering sense of wrong suffered , for which there can be no redress . Terrible as the feeling is , it must be free from the wickedness you impute to yourself . Your nature is sound and sweet at the core -- I feel sure of that . " " Thank you . I have had many grave doubts about myself . But to go on . Contrary to his usual habit , Mr. Seabrook remained at the house that evening , and in the dining-room instead of his own room . I was so busy with my work and anxious about Benton , that I did not give more than a passing thought to him . He , also , seemed much pre-occupied . " At last my work was done , and I took a light to go to my room , telling Mr. Seabrook to put out the lights below stairs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , ' said he , ' I have something to tell you that you ought to know . ' He very politely placed a chair for me , which I took . His manners were faultless in the matter of etiquette -- and how very far a fine manner goes , in our estimate of people ! I had not the shadow of a suspicion of what was coming . ' Mrs. Greyfield , ' he said , with great gravity , ' I fear I have unintentionally compromised you very seriously . In advising you to take this house , and open it for boarders , I was governed entirely by what I conceived to be your best interests ; but it seems that I erred in my judgment . You are very young -- only twenty-three , I believe , and -- I beg your pardon -- too beautiful to pass unnoticed in a community like this . Your boarders , so far , are all gentlemen . Further , it has been noticed and commented upon that -- really , I do not know how to express it -- that I have seemed to take the place in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact or in expectancy , could be expected or permitted to occupy . Do you see what I mean ? ' " I sat stunned and speechless while he went on . ' I presume your good sense will direct you in this matter , and that you will grasp the right horn of the dilemma . If you would allow me to help you out of it , you would really promote my happiness . Dear Mrs. Greyfield , permit me to offer you the love and protection of a husband , and stop these gossips ' mouths . ' " " You do not think he had premeditated this ? " I asked . " I did not take it in then , but afterwards I saw it plainly enough . He pressed me for an answer , all the time plausibly protesting that although he had hoped some time to win my love , he had not anticipated the necessity for urging his suit as a matter of expediency . In vain I argued that if his presence in the house was an injury to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . I indignantly declared that it was not my fault that my boarders were all men . I was working for my living , and would just as willingly have boarded any other creature if I could have got my money for it ; a monkey or a sheep ; it was all the same to me . He smiled superiorly on my fretfulness ; and when I at last burst into a passion of tears , bade me good night with such an air of being extremely forbearing and judicious that I could not help regarding myself as a foolish and undisciplined child . " That night I scarcely slept at all . Benton was feverish , and I half wild . All sorts of plans ran through my head ; but turn the matter over any way I would , it amounted to the same thing . The money I must earn , must come from men . Whether I sewed or cooked , or whatever I did , they were the paymasters to whom I looked for my wages . How , then , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being misunderstood . In one breath I resented , with all the ardor of my soul , the impertinence of the world 's judgment , and in the next I declared to myself that I did not care ; that conscious innocence should sustain me , and that I had a right to do the best I could for myself and child . " But that was only sham courage . I was morally a coward , and could not possibly face the evil spirit of detraction . Therefore , the morning found me feverish in body and faint in spirit . I kept out of sight of my boarders , except Mr. Seabrook , who looked into the kitchen with a sympathizing face , and inquired very kindly after Bennie , as he pet-named Benton . When my dinner was over that day , I asked the little German woman to keep the child until I could go on an errand , and went over to Mrs.  - -   - -   , my old house-mate , to get advice . " Do you know how much advice is worth ? If you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not like it , you will not take it . Mrs.  - -   - -   told me that if she were in my place , as if she could be in my place ! she would get rid of all her troubles by getting some man to take charge of her and her affairs . When I asked , with transparent duplicity , where I was to find a man for this service , she laughed in my face . People did talk so then , and what Mr. Seabrook said was the unexaggerated truth . It did not occur to me to examine into the authorship of the rumors ; I was too shrinking and sensitive for that . " When I reached home I found Mr. Seabrook at the house . A sudden feeling of anger flashed into my mind , and must have illuminated my eyes ; for he gave me one deprecating glance , and immediately went out . This made me fear I was unjust to him . That evening he did not come to tea , but sent me a note saying he had business at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that when he did return it would be better to have my mind made up to dismiss him entirely out of the country , or to have our engagement made known . " That threw the whole responsibility upon me ; and it was , as he knew it would be , too heavy for my twenty-three years to carry . To lose the most helpful and agreeable friend I had in the country , to banish him for no fault but being too kind to me , or to take him in place of one whose image would always stand between us : that was the alternative . " The next day an incident occurred that decided my destiny . I had to go out to make some purchases for the house . At the store where I usually bought provisions I chanced to meet a woman who had crossed the continent in my company ; and she turned her back upon me without speaking . She was an ignorant , bigoted sort of woman , of an uncertain temper , and at another time I might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when I was in a state of nervous alarm , it cut me to the quick . With great difficulty I restrained my tears , and left the store . While hurrying home with a basket on my arm , almost choked with grief , I passed a kind old gentleman who had always before had a pleasant word for me , and an inquiry about my child . He , too , passed me with only the slightest sign of recognition . I thought my heart would burst in my breast , so terrible was the sense of outrage and shame --  " " Which was , after all , probably imaginary , " I interrupted . " The insult of the ignorant , ill-tempered woman was purely an accidental display of those qualities , and the slight recognition of your old friend the consequence of the other , for your face certainly expressed the state of your feelings , and your friend was surprised into silence by seeing you in such distress . " " That , very likely , is the true explanation . But it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of mind I was in , go after people , and ask them to tell you whether or not they really mean to insult you , because you are only too certain that they do . I was sick with pain and mortification . How I got through my day 's work I do not remember ; but you can understand that my demoralization was complete by this time , and that when Mr. Seabrook returned I was like wax in his hands . All that I stipulated for was a little more time ; he had my permission to announce our engagement . " My boarders and every one who spoke to me about it congratulated me . When I look back upon it now , it seems strange that no one ever suggested to me the importance of knowing the antecedents of the man I was going to marry ; but they did not . It seemed to be tacitly understood that antecedents were not to be dragged to light in this new world , and that " by-gones should be by-gones . " As to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man might be dishonorable , even criminal , though he had the outside bearing of a gentleman . " " Did he propose to relieve you of the necessity of keeping boarders ? " " No . The business was a good one ; and , as I have said , I was a success in this line . My constitution was good ; my energy immense , in labor ; my training in household economy good ; and , besides , I had a real talent for pleasing my boarders . I was to be provided with a servant ; and the care of the marketing would devolve upon Mr. Seabrook . With this amelioration of my labors , the burden could be easily borne for the sake of the profits . " " What business was Mr. Seabrook in ? " " I never thought of the subject at that time . He was always well dressed ; associated with men of business ; seemed to have money ; and I never doubted that such a man was able to do anything he proposed . Women , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Afterwards , of course , I was disillusioned . But I must hasten , for it is growing late ; and either the storm or these old memories shake my nerves . " I had asked for a month 's time to prepare my mind for my coming marriage . At the end of a week , however , Mr. Seabrook came to me and told me that imperative business called him away for an absence of several weeks , and that , in his judgment , the marriage ceremony should take place before he left . He should be away over the month I had stipulated for ; and , in case of accident , I would have the protection of his name . My objections were soon overruled , and on the morning of his departure we were married -- as I believed , legally and firmly bound -- in the presence of my family of boarders , and two or three women , including Mrs.  - -   - -   . He went away immediately , and I was left to my tumultuous thoughts . " " May I be permitted to know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me that you must have sometimes yearned for the ownership of some heart , and the strong tenderness of man 's firmer nature . " Mrs. Greyfield looked at me with a curiously mixed expression , half of sarcastic pity , half of amused contempt . But the thought , whatever it was , went unspoken . She reflected a moment silently before she answered . " I have told you that my heart remained unweaned from the memory of my dead husband . I told Mr. Seabrook the same . But I admired , respected and believed in him ; he was agreeable to me , and had my confidence . There can be no doubt , but if he had been all that he seemed , I should have ended by loving him in a quiet and constant way . As it was , the shock I felt at the discovery of his perfidy was terrible . " My ears were yet tingling with my new name , when , everybody having gone , I sat down with Benton on my lap to have the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed over their relinquished freedom . I was very soon aroused by a knock at the door , which opened to admit an old acquaintance , then residing in Vancouver , and a former suitor of mine . Almost the first thing he said was , ' I hear you have been getting married ? ' ' Yes , ' I said , trying to laugh off my embarrassment , ' I had to marry a man at last to get rid of them ! ' " ' You made a poor selection , then , ' he returned , rather angrily . " His anger roused mine , for his tone was , as I thought , insolent , ' Do you think I should have done better to have taken you ? ' I asked , scornfully . " ' You would at least have got a man that the law could give you , ' he retorted , ' and not another woman 's husband . ' " The charge seemed so enormous that I laughed in his face , attributing his conduct to jealous annoyance at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our mutual excitement , unsettled my confidence . He was not inventing this story ; he evidently believed it himself . ' For God 's sake , ' I entreated , ' if you have any proof of what you say , give it me at once ! ' And then he went on to tell me that on the occasion of Mr. Seabrook 's late visit to Vancouver , he had been recognized by an emigrant out from Ohio , who met and talked with him at the Hudson 's Bay store . That man had told him , my informant , that he was well acquainted with the family of Mr. Seabrook , and that his wife and several children were living when he left Ohio . " ' Can you bring this man to me ? ' I asked , trembling with horrible apprehensions . " ' I do n't know as I could , ' said he ; ' for he went , I think , over to the Sound to look up a place . But I can give you the name of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . ' I had him write the address for me , as I was powerless to do it for myself . " ' I am sorry for you , ' he said , as he handed me the slip of paper ; ' that is , if you care anything for the rascal . ' " ' Thank you , ' I returned , ' but this thing is not proven yet . If you really mean well by me , keep what you have told me to yourself . ' " ' You mean to live with him ? ' he asked . " ' I do n't know what I shall do ; I must have time to think . ' " ' Very well ; it is no affair of mine . I do n't want a bullet through my head for interfering ; but I thought it was no more than fair to let you know . ' " ' I am very grateful , of course ;  - -  I mean I am if there is any occasion ; but this story is so strange , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it all in at once , with all its consequences . ' " ' I know what you think , ' he said finally : ' You suspect me of making up this thing to be revenged on you for preferring Seabrook to me . I 'd be a damned mean cuss , to do such a turn by any woman , would n't I ? As to consequences , if the story is true , and I believe it is , why your marriage amounts to nothing , and you are just as free as you were before ! ' " I fancied his face brightened up with the idea of my freedom , and a doubt of his veracity intruded upon my growing conviction . Distracted , excited , pressed down with cares and fears , I still had to attend to my daily tasks . I begged him to go away , and not to say a word to any other mortal about what he had told me ; and he gave me the promise I desired . That was a fatal error , and fearfully was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me quite remarkable prudence for one in your situation . " " So I thought then ; but the event proved differently . " " Pray do tell me how you bore up under all this excitement , and the care and labor of a boarding-house ? The more I know of your life , the more surprised I am at your endurance . " " It was the care and labor that saved me , perhaps . At all events , here I am , alive and well , to-night . I sometimes liken myself to a tree that I know of . It was a small fir tree in a friend 's garden . For some reason , it began to pine and dwindle and turn red . My friend 's husband insisted on cutting it down , as unsightly ; but this she objected to , until all the leaves were dry and faded , and the tree apparently dead . Still she asked for it to be spared for another season ; and , taking a stick , she beat the tree all over until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there it stood , a mere frame of dry branches , until everybody wished it out of the way . But behold ! at last it was covered with little green dots of leaves , that rapidly grew to the usual size , and now that tree is the thriftiest in my friend 's garden , and a living evidence of the uses of adversity . But for the beating it got , it would now be a dead tree ! I had my child to live and work for ; and really , but for this last trouble , I should have thought myself doing well . I had found out how I could make and lay up money , and was gaining that sense of independence such knowledge gives . Besides , I was young , and in good physical health most of the time before this last and worst stroke of fortune . That broke down my powers of resistance in some directions , I had so much to resist in others . " " Do you see what o'clock it is ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting up , let 's make a night of it . I feel as if I could not sleep -- as if something were going to happen . " Very cheerfully I consented to the proposed vigil . I wanted to hear the rest of the story ; and I knew she had a sort of prophetic consciousness of coming events . If she said " something was going to happen , " something surely did happen . So the fire was renewed , and we settled ourselves again for " a night of it . " What did you do ? and why do you say that you committed a fatal error by keeping silence ? " " By suffering the matter to rest , I unfortunately fixed myself in the situation I would have avoided . My object was what yours would have been , or any woman's -- to save all scandal , until the facts were known to a certainty . I was so sensitive about being talked over ; and besides felt that I had no right to expose Mr. Seabrook to a slanderous accusation . It was not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took one night to think the matter over . It was a longer night than this one will seem to you . My decision was to write to the postmaster of the town from which Mr. Seabrook was said to come . Now that would be a simple affair enough ; the telegraph would procure us the information wanted in a day . Then a letter was five or six months going and coming . In the meantime I had resolved not to live with Mr. Seabrook as his wife ; but you will see how I would , under the circumstances , be compelled to seem to do so . I did not think of that at first , however . You know how you mentally go over impending scenes beforehand ? I meant to surprise him into a confession , if he were guilty ; and believed I should be able to judge of his innocence , if he should be wrongly accused . I wrote and dispatched my letter at once , and under an assumed name , to prevent its being stolen . When that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , that was impossible . My mind ran on this subject day and night . " The difficulties of my position could never be imagined ; you would have to be in the same place to see them . Everybody now called me Mrs. Seabrook , and I could not repudiate the name without sufficient cause . I was forced to appear to have confidence in the man I had married of my own free will . Besides , I really did not know , of a verity , that he was not worthy of confidence . It seemed quite as credible that another man should invent a lie , as that Mr. Seabrook should be guilty of an enormous crime . " Naturally I had a buoyant temper ; was inclined to see the amusing side of things ; enjoyed frolicsome conversation ; and in a general way was well fitted to bear up under worries , and recover quickly from depressed conditions . The gentlemen who boarded with me were a cheerful and intelligent set , whose conversation entertained me , as they met three times a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gave them the privilege of saying playful things to me about him daily . To these remarks I must make equally playful replies , or seem ungracious to them . You will see how every such circumstance complicated my difficulties afterwards . " You know , too , how pliable we all are at twenty-three -- how often our opinions waver and our emotions change . I was particularly mercurial in my temperament before the events I am relating hardened me . I often laid in a half-waking state almost all night , my imagination full of horrible images ; and when breakfast-time came , and I listened to an hour of entertaining talk , with frequent respectful allusions to Mr. Seabrook , and kindly compliments to myself , these ugly visions took flight , while I persuaded myself that everything would come out right in the end . " A little while ago you asked me if I did not love Mr. Seabrook at all ?  - -  did not long for tenderness from him ? The question roused something of the wickedness in me that I confessed to you before ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if you think any woman in her twenties is quite reconciled to live unloved ? I had not wished to marry again ; yet undoubtedly there was a great blank in my life , which my peculiarly friendless condition made me very sensible of ; and there was a yearning desire in my heart to be petted and cared for , as in my brief married life I had been . But the coarseness and intrusiveness I had experienced in my widowhood had made me as irritable as the ' fretful porcupine ' towards that class of men . The thought of Mr. Seabrook loving me had never taken root in my mind . Even when he proposed marriage , it had seemed much more a matter of expediency than of love . But when , after I had accepted him as an avowed lover , his conduct had continued to be unintrusive , and delicately flattering to my womanly pride , it was most natural that I should begin to congratulate myself on the prospect before me of life-long protection from such wounds as I had received , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ; for then , much more than now , and in a new country more than in an old one , a woman 's position depended on her relationship to men ; the wife of the most worthless man being the superior of an unmarried woman . Accordingly I felt my promised importance , and began to exult in it . " " In short , you were preparing to become much more subject to the second love than the first ; a not infrequent experience , " I interrupted . " You certainly must have loved a handsome , agreeable , courteous , and manly man , who would have interposed between you and the rude shocks of the world ; and you had begun to realize that you could , in spite of your first love ? " " And to have a feeling of disappointment when the possibility presented itself that after all these blessings might be wrested from me ; of horror when I reflected that in that case my last estate would be inexpressibly worse than the first . " " There was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing I was perfectly clear about . Not to be dragged into crime or deserved disgrace , I was determined upon . How I should avoid it was where I was in doubt . " " I am very anxious to know how you met him on his return . " " There was no one in the house except myself , and Benton , who was now quite well again for the time . I was standing by the dining-room window , arranging some ferns in a hanging basket , and Benton was amusing himself with toys the boarders were always giving him . I heard a footstep , and turned my head slightly to see who it was . Mr. Seabrook stood in the door , regarding us with a pleased smile . " ' How is my wife and boy ? ' he said , cheerily , advancing towards me , and proffering a kiss of greeting . " I put up my hand to ward him off , and my heart stood motionless . I seemed to be struck with a chill . My teeth chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " Naturally , he was surprised ; but thinking perhaps that the suddenness of his return , under the circumstances , had overcome me , he quickly recovered his tenderness of manner . " ' Have I frightened you , my darling ? ' he asked , putting out his arms to fold me to his breast . Not being able to speak , I whirled round rapidly , and hastened to place the table between us . Of course , he could not comprehend such conduct , but thought it some nervous freak , probably . " Turning to Benton , he took him up in his arms and kissed him , asking him some questions about himself and toys . ' Could you tell me what is the matter with your mamma , Bennie ? ' he asked , seeing that my manner remained inexplicable . " ' I tink see has a till , ' answered Benton , who by this time knew the meaning of the word ' chill ' by experience . " ' She has given me one , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to feel faint , and sat down , leaning my head on my hand , my elbow on the table . " ' Anna , ' said he , addressing me by my Christian name for the first time , and giving me a little shock in consequence -- for I had almost forgotten I had ever been called ' Anna '  - -  'if I am so disagreeable to you , I will go away again ; though I certainly had reason to expect a different reception . ' " ' No , ' I said , suddenly rousing up ; ' you must not go until I have told you something ; unless you go to stay -- which would perhaps be best . ' " ' To stay ! go to stay ? There seems great need of explanation here . Will you be good enough to tell me why I am to go away to stay ? ' " ' The reason is , Mr. Seabrook , ' I answered , ' that your true wife , and your own children expect you at home , in Ohio . ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth out of him , if possible . If he should be innocent , I thought , he would forgive me . There was too much at stake to stand upon niceties of speech ; and I watched him narrowly . " " How did he receive such a blow as that ? I am curious to know how guilty people act , on being accused . " " You can not tell an innocent from a guilty person , " Mrs. Greyfield returned , with a touch of that asperity that was sometimes noticeable in her utterances . Then , more quietly : " Both are shocked alike at being accused ; one because he is innocent ; the other , because he is guilty . How much a person is shocked depends upon temperament and circumstance . The guilty person , always consciously in danger of being accused , is likely to be prepared and on the defensive , while the other is not . " What Mr. Seabrook did , was to turn upon me a look of keen observation , not unmixed with surprise . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I tell ? He always impressed me so with his superiority that even in that moment , when my honor and life 's happiness were at stake , I was conscious of a feeling of abasement and guiltiness that I dare accuse him to his face . Perhaps , he saw that I was frightened at my own temerity ; at all events he was not thrown off his guard . " ' Do I understand you to charge me with crime -- a very ugly crime , indeed ? ' he asked pointedly . " ' You know , ' I said , ' whether you are guilty . If you are , may God so deal with you as you have meant to deal with me . ' " I fancied that he winced slightly at this ; but in my excitement could not have seen very clearly . He knitted his brows , and took several turns up and down the room . " ' If I knew who had put this monstrous idea into your mind , ' he finally said with vehemence ; ' I would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , ' I replied : ' you could not expect me to tell you ; ' and I afterwards made that threat my excuse for concealing the name of my informant . " Mr. Seabrook continued to pace the floor in an excited manner , stroking his long blonde beard rapidly and unconsciously . I still sat by the table , trying to appear the calm observer that I was not . He came and stood by me , saying : ' Do you believe this thing against me ? ' " ' I do not know what to believe , Mr. Seabrook , ' I replied , ' but something will have to be done about this rumor . ' I could not bear to go on ; but he understood me . He leaned over my chair , and touched my cheek with his : " ' Are you my wife , or not ? ' he asked . I shuddered , and put my face down on my hands . He knelt by my side , and taking my hands in his , so that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and listen to him . What he said , was this : " ' If I swear to you , by Almighty God , that you are my true and only wife , will you then believe me ? ' " Mrs. Greyfield was becoming visibly agitated by these reminiscences , and paused to collect herself . " You dared not say ' yes , ' " I cried , carried away with sympathy , " and yet , you could not say ' no . ' What did you do ? " " I burst into a passion of tears , and cried convulsively . He would have caressed and consoled me , but I would have none of it . " ' Anna , what a strange home-coming for a bridegroom ! ' he said , reproachfully . " ' Go away , and leave me to myself , ' I entreated ; ' You must not stay here . ' " ' What madness ? ' he exclaimed . ' Do you wish to set everybody to talking about us ? ' Ah ! ' talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew it . But I wanted to seem brave ; so I said that in private matters we were at liberty to do as we thought right and best . " ' And I think it right and best to stay where my wife is . Anna , what is to be the result of this strange suspicion of yours , but to make us both unhappy , and me desperate ! Why , I shall be the laughing-stock of the town -- and I confess it is more than I can bear without flinching , to have it circulated about , that Seabrook married a wife who cut him adrift the first thing she did . And then look at your position , too , which would be open to every unkind remark . You must not incur this almost certain ruin . ' " ' Mr. Seabrook , ' I said , more calmly than I had yet spoken ; ' what you have said has suggested itself to me before . Stay here , then , if you must , until I can take measures to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your own counsel , and I can keep mine . I have spoken to no one about this matter , nor will I for the present . There is your old room ; your old place at the table . I will try to act as natural as possible ; more than this you must not expect of me . ' This business-like tone nettled him . " ' May I inquire , Mrs. Seabrook , how long a probation I may anticipate , and what measures you intend taking to establish my good or bad character ? A man may not be willing to wait always for a wife . ' " ' Very well , ' I replied to this covert threat ; ' when you tire of waiting , you know what to do . ' But my voice must have trembled , for he instantly changed his manner . There was more chance of winning me through my weakness than of intimidating me , coward though I was . " ' My dear Anna , ' he said kindly , ' this is a most mortifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pardon me if I seem selfish . I do not know how I am to bear several months of this unnatural life you propose ; and in thinking of myself I forget you . Yet your case , as you see it , is harder than mine ; and I ought to pity and comfort you . If my darling would only let me ! ' He stretched out his arms to me . It was all I could do to keep from rushing into them , and sobbing on his breast . I was so tempest-tossed and weary !  - -  what would I not have given to lay down my burdens ? " " That is where the unrecognized heroism of women comes in . How few men would suffer in this way for the right ! Had you chosen to ignore the tale that you had heard , and taken this man whom fortune had thrown with you upon this far-off coast , he might have been to you a kind friend and protector . Do you not think so ? " " Very likely . Plenty of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as men go . But I , by resisting the will of one bad man , made infinite trouble for myself . Are you becoming wearied ? " " No , no ; go on . " " I must pass over a great deal ; and , thank God ! some things have been forgotten . Mr. Seabrook took his old room down stairs . As before , he sat at the foot of the table and carved , but now as master of the house . Servants not being easily obtained , it was not remarked that my duties prevented my sitting down with my supposed husband at meals . He marketed for me , and received the money of my boarders when pay-day came ; and at first he did -- what he failed to do afterwards -- pay the money over to me . " You are curious to know how Mr. Seabrook conducted himself toward me personally , and in particular . For a few days , well ; so that I began to feel confidence that so honorable a gentleman would be proved free from all stain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent courtship , looking , as I could see , to breaking down my reserve , and subjecting me to the domination of a passion for him . If I had ever really loved Mr. Seabrook , it would have been a love of the senses , of interest , of the understanding , and not of the imagination and heart . I was just on the eve of such a love when it was fortunately put in check by my suspicions . For him to endeavor to create a feeling now that might , nay , that was intended to subvert principle and virtue , appeared even to my small worldly sense , an insult and an outrage . " When I talked in this way to him , he half laughingly and half in earnest always declared that I should get into the habit of forgetting our marriage before my ' proofs ' came from Ohio , unless he every day put me in mind of it ! and this willingness to refer to ' proofs ' threw me off my guard a little . He designed very cunningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and he feared the proofs might come before he had bent me to his will , his attempts lost even the semblance of love or decency . Many and many a night I feared to close my eyes in sleep , lest he should carry out his avowed purpose ; for locks and bolts in a house in those days were considered unnecessary , and I improvised such defenses as I could . I used to threaten to call in my little German neighbor , to which he replied she would probably recognize a man 's right to occupy the same apartment with his wife ! Still , I think he was deterred somewhat by the fear of exposure from using violence . " The recital of such sufferings and anxieties as these ; endured , too , by a young and lonely woman , affected me powerfully . My excited imagination was engaged in comparing the Mrs. Greyfield I saw before me , wearing her nearly fifty years with dignity and grace , full of a calm and ripe experience , still possessing a dark and striking beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three . What a wonder it was that with her lively temperament either for pain or pleasure ; with her beauty and her helplessness , she had come out of the furnace unscathed , as she now appeared . " How could you , " I said , with a feeling of deep disgust , " how could you allow such a man to remain in your house ? " " How could I get him out ? We were legally married , so far as anybody in Oregon knew , except himself . Everybody presumed us to be living amicably together . He was careful to act the courteous gentleman to me in the presence of others . If we never went out together , it was easily explained by reference to my numerous household cares , and Benton 's frequent illness . As I before said , no one could understand the position who had not been in it . I could not send him away from me ; nor could I go away from him . He would have followed me , he said , to the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go ? There was nothing for me but to endure until the answer to my letter came . Never was letter so anxiously desired as that one ; for , of course , I fully expected that whatever news it contained , would bring relief in some way . But I had made up my mind to his guilt , rightly judging that , had he been innocent , he would either have found means to satisfy me , or have gone away and left me altogether . " It had been six or seven months since my marriage . I had a large family of boarders to cook for , and Benton giving me a great deal of worry , fearing I should lose him . Working hard all day , and sleeping very little nights , with constant excitement and dread , had very much impaired my health . My boarders of ten said to me : ' Mrs. Seabrook , you are working too hard ; you must make Mr. Seabrook get you a cook . ' What could I say in return , except to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Once , carried away with indignation , I replied that ' Mr. Seabrook found it as much as he could do to collect the money I earned ! ' " " And you were set down at once as a vixen ! " I said , smiling . " Well , they were not expected to know how matters stood , when I had taken so much pain to conceal the truth . I was sorry I had not held my peace a little longer , or altogether . Men never can understand a woman 's right to resent selfishness , however atrocious ; even when they are knowing to it , which in this case they were not . I might as well have held my tongue , since every unguarded speech of mine militated against me afterwards . " " You allowed Mr. Seabrook to have all your earnings ? " " I could not prevent it ; he was my husband . Sometimes I thought he meant to save up all he could , to take him out of the country , when the hoped-for proofs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inclined to rejoice in his avarice . I would have given all I had for that purpose . Oh , those dreadful , dreadful days ! when I was so near insane with sleeplessness and anxiety , that I seemed to be walking on the air ! Such , indeed , was my mental and physical condition , that everything seemed unreal , even myself ; and it surprises me now that my reason did not give way . " " Did you never pray ? " " My training had been religious , and I had always prayed . This , I felt , entitled me to help ; and yet help did not come . I felt forsaken of God , and sullenly shut my lips to prayer or complaint . All severely tried souls go through a similar experience . Christ himself cried out : ' My God , my God , why hast forsaken me ! ' " " No wonder you felt forsaken , indeed . " " You think I was as tried as I could be then , when I had a hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hopeless . " " You were really married to him then ? " I cried in alarm : " I thought you told me in the beginning , that you were not . " " Neither was I ; but that did not release me . When at last I received an answer to my inquiries , confirming the statement of the immigrant from Ohio , it was too late . " " You do not mean ! "  - -  I interrupted , in a frightened voice . " No , no ! I only mean that I had committed a great error , in keeping silence on the subject at the first . You can imagine one of your acquaintances who had been several months peaceably living with a man of good appearance and repute , to whom you had seen her married , suddenly declaring her husband a bigamist and refusing to live with him ; and on no other evidence than a letter obtained , nobody knew how . To me the proof was conclusive ; and it made me frantic to find that it was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you told him that you had this evidence ? How did he act ? " " He swore it was a conspiracy ; and declared that now he had borne enough of such contumelious conduct ; he should soon bring me into subjection . He represented himself to me , as an injured and long-suffering man ; and me , to myself , as an unkind , undutiful , and most unwomanly woman . He told me , what was true , that I need not expect people to believe such a ' cock and bull story ; ' and used every possible means of intimidation , except actual corporeal punishment . That he threatened long after ; and I told him if he ever laid a finger on me , I should certainly shoot him dead . But we had not come to that yet . " " Long after ! " I repeated . " You do not , you can not mean that this wretch continued to live under the same roof with you , long after he knew that you would never acknowledge him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For years after he knew that I knew he was what he was , he lived in my house and took my earnings ; yes , and ordered me about and insulted me as much as he liked . " " But , " I said , " I can not understand such a condition of things . Was there no law in the land ? no succor in the society about you ? How could other women hold still , and know that a young creature like you was being tortured in that way ? " " The inertia of women in each other 's defense is immense , " returned Mrs. Greyfield , in her most incisive tone . " You must not forget that Portland was then almost a wilderness , and families were few , and often ' far between . ' Among the few , my acquaintances were still fewer ; for I had come among them poor and alone , and with all I could do to support myself , without time or disposition to visit . The peculiar circumstances I have related to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did carry my evidence , and my story together , to two or three women that I knew , and what do you suppose they said ? That I ' should have thought of all that before I married ! ' They treated it exactly as if , having gone through the marriage ceremony , I was bound , no matter how many wives Mr. Seabrook had back in Ohio . " " They could not have believed your story , " I said ; not being able to take in such inferior morality . " What they believed I do not know : what they said I have told you . I incline to the opinion that they thought I might be a little daft -- I am sure I must have looked so at times , from sheer sleeplessness and exhaustion . Or they thought I had no chance of establishing the truth , and would be better off to submit quietly . At all events , not one encouraged me to resist Mr. Seabrook ; and to overflow my cup of misery , he contrived to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Did you never go to men about your case , and ask for assistance ? " " At first I was afraid to appeal to them , having had so many unpleasant experiences ; and when I at last was driven to seek counsel , I was too late , as I before explained . " " Too late ? " " Yes ; I mean that the idea of my being Mr. Seabrook 's wife was so firmly seated in their minds that they could not see it in any other light . The fact of my having written and received a letter did not impress them as of any consequence . You will find this to be a truth among men ; they respect the sense of ownership in women , entertained by each other ; and they respect it so much that they would as soon be caught stealing , as seeming in any way to interfere with it . That is the reason that , although there is nothing in the wording of the marriage contract converting the woman into a bond-slave or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong on his wife is so seldom called to account . In the eyes of these men , having entered into marriage with Mr. Seabrook , I belonged to him , and there was no help for me . For life and until death , I was his , to do what he pleased with , so long as he did not bruise my flesh nor break my bones . Is not that an awful power to be lodged with any human being ? " " But , " I said , " if they were told the whole truth , that the marriage had never been consummated , and why , would they not have been moved by a feeling of chivalry to interfere ? Your view of their sentiments pre-supposes the non-existence of what I should call chivalry . " " There may be in men such a sentiment as you would call chivalry ; but I never yet have seen the occasion where they were pleased to exercise it . I would not advise any other young woman to tell one of them that she had lived alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , for seven months , without the marriage having been consummated . She would find , as I did , that his chivalry would be exhibited by an ineffectual effort to suppress a smile of incredulity . " " Can it be possible , " I was forced to exclaim , " that there was no help for you ? " " You see how it was . I have outlined the bare facts to you . Nobody wanted to be mixed up in my troubles , and the worst of it was that Mr. Seabrook got more sympathy than I did , as the unfortunate husband of a terrible termagant , who made his life a burden to him . He could talk in a certain way around among men , and put on an aggrieved air at home before the boarders , and what was the use of my saying anything . If it had not been for my little German neighbor , I should have felt utterly forsaken by all the world . But she , whatever she thought of my domestic affairs , was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all de time ? ' she said to me one day . ' You makes yourself sick all de time mit cryin ' ; an ' your face be gettin ' wite as my hankershif . De leedle boy , too , he sees you , an ' he gets all so wite as you are , all de same . Dat is not goot . You gomes to see me , an ' brings de boy to see my Hans . You get sheered up den . ' And I took her advice for Benton 's sake . " " What object had Mr. Seabrook in remaining where he was so unwelcome ? He certainly entertained no hope that you would finally yield ; and his position could not have been an agreeable one , from any point of view ; for whether he was regarded as the monster he was , or only as a sadly beshrewed husband , he must have felt himself the subject of unpleasant remark . " " He could afford to be remarked upon when he was a free pensioner upon a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I earned for him by ceaseless toil . I can see him now sitting at the bottom of the table , my table , flourishing his white hands , and stroking his flowing blonde beard occasionally as something very gratifying to his vanity was said ; talking and laughing with perfect unconcern , while he fattened himself at my expense ; while I , who earned and prepared his dinner for him , gasped half fainting in the heat of a kitchen , sick in heart and body . Do you wonder that I hated him ? " " I wonder more that you did not kill him , " I said ; feeling that this would have been a case of ' justifiable homicide . ' " The impulse certainly came to me at times to kill him ; or if not exactly that , to wish him dead . Yet when the opportunity came to be revenged upon him by fate itself , I interfered to save him . That was strange , was it not ? To be suffering as I suffered at this man 's hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him ? " " You could not alter your nature , " I said , " which is , as I told you before , thoroughly sound and sweet . It goes against us to suffer wrong ; but it goes still harder with us to do wrong . Besides , you had your religious training to help you . " " I had the temptation , all the same . It happened in this way : One night I was lying awake , as I usually did , until I heard Mr. Seabrook come in and go to his room . He came in rather later than usual , and I listened until all was still in the house , that I might sleep the more safely and soundly afterwards . I had , however , become so nervously wakeful by this time that the much needed and coveted sleep refused to visit me , and I laid tossing feverishly upon my bed when I became aware that there was a smell of fire in the air . Rapidly dressing , I took Benton in my arms and hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , should the house be in danger . There was a still stronger odor of burning cloth and wood in the lower rooms , but very little smoke to be detected . After looking into the kitchen and finding all right there , I feared the fire might be in the other part of the house , and was about to give the alarm , when it occurred to me that the trouble might be in Mr. Seabrook 's room . " Leaving Benton asleep on the dining-room table , I ran to his door and knocked . No answer came ; but I could smell the smoke within . Pushing open the door I discovered him lying in a perfectly unconscious state , and half undressed , on the bed , sleeping off the effects of a wine supper . A candle which he had lighted , and left burning , had consumed itself down to the socket , and by some chance had ignited a few loose papers on the table beside the bed ; the fire had communicated to the bedding on one side , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just ready to burst into a blaze with the admission of fresh air , which I had the presence of mind to prevent , by closing the door behind me . " There I was , in the presence of my enemy , and he in the clutches of death . I shudder when I think of the feelings of that moment ! An evil spirit plainly said to me , ' Now you shall have rest . Let him alone ; he is dying by his own hand , not yours -- why do you interfere with the decree of fate ? ' An exulting yet consciously guilty joy agitated my heart , which was beating violently . ' Let him die ! ' I said to myself , ' let him die ! ' " Very rapidly such thoughts whirl through the brain under great excitement . The instant that I hesitated seemed an age of cool deliberation to me . Then the wickedness of my self-gratulation rushed into my mind , making me feel like a murderer . ' O , God , ' I cried in anguish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test ? ' The next instant I was working with might and main to extinguish the fire , which with the aid of blankets and a pitcher of water was soon suppressed . " Through it all he slept on , breathing heavily , an object of disgust to my senses and my feelings . When all was safe I returned to my room , thankful that I had been able on the spot to expiate my murderous impulses . The next day he took occasion to say to me , ' I should n't have expected a visit of mercy from you , Mrs. Seabrook . If I had known you were coming , I should have tried to keep awake ! ' ' If ever you refer to such a subject again , ' I replied , ' I will set fire to you myself , and let you burn ; ' and either the threat deterred him , or some spark of generosity in his nature was struck by the benefit received , but he never afterwards offered me any annoyance of that kind . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind to him ? " " He was not unkind . Perhaps you can not understand such a character ; but he was one who would be kind to man , woman , or child who would be governed by him ; yet resistance to his will , however just , roused a tyranny that sought for opportunities to exhibit itself . Such a one passes in general society for a ' good fellow , ' because ' the iron hand in the velvet glove ' is scarcely perceptible there , while its ungloved force is felt most heavily in the relations of private life . If I had been in a position to flatter Mr. Seabrook , undoubtedly he would have shown me a corresponding consideration , notwithstanding his selfishness . It would have been one way of gratifying his own vanity , by putting me in a humor to pander to it . But knowing how I hated and despised him , he felt toward me all the rancor of his vain and tyrannical nature . It is always more dangerous to hate justly than unjustly , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody has always done wrong and knows it , and can not bear to suffer the natural consequences -- the disapprobation of the injured party , in addition to the stings of conscience . " " I suppose , then , " I said , " it has been the perception of this truth that has caused the sweetest and purest women in all time to ignore the baser sins of man , while calling their own sex to strict account . And yet I can not think but that this degree of mercy is injurious to their own purity and derogatory to their dignity . I remember being excessively shocked several years ago by having this trait of forgiveness in woman placed in its true light by an accidental publication in a New York paper , which was intended to have just the opposite effect . It was headed ' A Model Woman , ' and appeared in the Evening Post -- Bryant 's paper . With a curious desire to know the poet 's model for a woman -- though the article may have never come under his eye -- I commenced reading it . It ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good wife and two interesting little children . But he met and fell in love with a handsome , dashing , and rather coarse girl ; and the affair had gone so far as to lead to serious expostulation on the part of the wife . The writer did not relate whether or not the girl knew the man to be married ; but only that the two were infatuated with each other . " As the story ran , the wife expostulated , and the husband was firm in his determination to possess the girl at all hazards , concluding his declaration with this business-like statement : ' I shall take the girl , and go to California . If you keep quiet about it , I will leave a provision for you and the children ; if you do not , I shall go just the same , but without leaving you anything . ' The wife acquiesced in the terms . Her husband went to California with his paramour , and tired of her ( it was in old steamer times ) , about as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to New York a la prodigal , and was received back to the arms of his forgiving wife . The girl followed her faithless lover to New York , and failing to win a kind word from him by the most piteous appeals , finally committed suicide at her hotel in that city . The wife continued to live with the author of this misery upon the most affectionate terms . " That was the whole story . Is it possible , I asked myself , that the writer of that article , whoever he may be , could have meant its title in anything but irony ? Yet , there it stood on the front page of a most respectable journal , indorsed by an editor of the highest reputation . To my way of thinking , the wife was accessory to the crime ; had no womanly self-respect , no delicacy , no Christian feeling for her husband 's victim ; was , in short , morally , as guilty as he was ; and yet a newspaper of high standing made her out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , or for forgiving three of the most heinous crimes in the decalogue , because committed by her husband . I confess that since that day I have been prone to examine into the claims of men to be forgiven , or the moral right of women to forgive them certain offenses . " " When you examine into the motives of women , " said Mrs. Greyfield , " I think you will find there is a large measure of sordid self-interest in their mercy , as in the case you have just quoted . While some women are so weak , and so foolishly fond of the men to whom they became early attached , as to be willing to overlook everything rather than part with them ; a far greater number yield an unwilling submission to wrongs imposed upon them , simply because they do not know how to do without the pecuniary support afforded them by their husbands . The bread-and-butter question is demoralizing to women as well as to men , the difference being that men have a wider field to be demoralized in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their circumscribed field of action . " " Do you think that the enlargement of woman 's sphere of work would have a tendency to elevate her moral influence ? " " The way the subject presents itself to me is , that it is degrading to have sex determine everything for us : our employments , our position in society , the obedience we owe to others , the influence we are permitted to exercise , all and everything to be dependent upon the delicate matter of a merely physical function . It affects me so unpleasantly to hear such frequent reference to a physiological fact , that I have often wished the word female stricken from our literature . And when you reflect , that we are born and bred to this narrow view of ourselves , as altogether the creatures of sex , you can not but recognize its belittleing , not to say depraving effect , or fail to see the temptation ; we have to seize any base advantage it may give us . " When we had canvassed this , to us interesting , topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the relation of her history . " I find I must be less particular , " she said , " to give so many and frequent explanations of my feelings . By this time you can pretty well imagine them , and my story is likely to be too long , unless I abbreviate . " I had been living in the way I have described , for two years , and had learned to do a good many things in my own defence , very disagreeable to me , but nevertheless very useful . I had gotten a little money together by asking some of my boarders for pay before pay-day came , or by making such remarks as prompted them to hand the money to me instead of Mr. Seabrook . It was my intention to save enough in such ways to take me to California , where I felt confident , with the experience I had gained , I should be able to make myself a competence . This plan I had nourished in secret for more than a year , when I was tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , perhaps , that with every year that had passed since my arrival in Portland , the population had increased , and with this increase there was a proportionate rise in the value of property . Hearing business topics discussed almost every day at table , I could not help being more or less infected with the spirit of speculation ; and it often almost drove me wild to think how profitably I might have invested my earnings could I have gained possession of them for myself . " Having an opportunity one day to speak on the subject to a gentleman in whose honor I placed great confidence , I mentioned that I was tempted to buy some property , but that my means were so limited I feared I could not do so . He immediately said that he would sell me a certain very good piece of land in the best business locality , on the installment plan , and at a bargain , so that when it was paid up I could immediately sell again at an advance . Thinking this would accelerate the carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land of freedom , I eagerly accepted the proposition , and paid down all the money I had , taking a bond for a deed . The transaction was to be kept a secret between us , and he was to assist me in selling when it came the proper time , by deeding direct to my purchaser . I felt almost light-hearted in view of the fact that I should be able , after all , to achieve a kind of independence in the course of time . " " It seems to me , " I said , " that I should have grown reckless before this , and have done something of a desperate nature -- committed suicide , for instance . Did the thought never occur to you to end your bondage in that way ? " " My desperation never took that form , because I had my child to take care of . If I killed myself , I should have to kill him , too . But many and many a night I have felt it so impossible to be alive in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn out in mind and body , with Benton always ailing -- often very ill , that I have prepared both myself and him for burial , and laid down praying God to take us both before another day . But Death is like our other friends -- he is not at hand to do us a service when most desired . " I have told you that I used to cry a good deal . Weeping , though a relief to us in one way , by removing the pressure upon the brain , is terribly exhausting when excessive , and I was very much wasted by it . An incident occurred about the time I was just speaking of , which gave me comfort in a strange manner . I used sometimes , when my work for the day was done , to leave Benton with my German friend , and go out for a walk , or to call on an acquaintance . All the sights and sounds of nature are beautiful and beneficial to me in a remarkable degree . With trees and flowers and animals , I am happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a visit to Mrs.  - -   - -   , my old neighbor , who lived at some distance from me . The path led through the fir forest , and at the time of day when I was at liberty , was dim and gloomy . I walked hurriedly along , fearing darkness would overtake me ; and looking about me as I went , was snatching a hasty pleasure from the contemplation of Nature 's beneficence , when my foot caught in a projecting root of some tough shrub , and I fell prostrate . " In good health and spirits I should not have minded the fall ; but to me , in my weak condition , every jar to the nervous system affected me seriously . I rose with difficulty , and seating myself upon a fallen tree , burst into tears , and wept violently . It seemed as if even the sticks and stones were in league to injure me . Looking back upon my feelings , I can understand how man , in the infancy of the race , attributed power and will to everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too strong for him , and bruised him continually . " As I sat weeping with pain and an impotent resentment , a clear sweet voice spoke to me out of the dusky twilight of the woods . ' Do n't cry so much ! ' it said . Astonishment dried my tears instantly . I looked about me , but no one was near ; nor any sound to be heard , but the peculiar cry of a bird that makes itself heard in the Oregon woods at twilight only . A calm that I can not explain came over my perturbed spirit . It was like the heavenly voices heard upon the earth thousands of years ago , in its power to move the heart . It may make you smile for me to say so ; but from that hour I regained a degree of cheerfulness that I had not felt since the day of my marriage to Mr. Seabrook . I did not go to Mrs.  - -   - -   's that evening , but returned home and went to my bed without putting on clothes to be buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of similar incidents of the seeming supernatural . Then I said : " And how did your investment turn out ? " " As might have been expected by a more worldly-wise person . After succeeding , almost , I was defeated by the selfishness and indifference of the man I had trusted to help me through with it . He sold out his property , including that bonded to me , when nearly the whole indebtedness was paid , without mentioning his design , or giving me an opportunity to complete the purchase . The new proprietor went immediately to Mr. Seabrook , who , delighted with this unexpected piece of fortune , borrowed the small amount remaining to be paid , and had the property deeded to himself . A short time after he sold it at a handsome advance on the price I paid for it , and I had never one dollar of the money . The entire savings of the whole time I had been in a really profitable business , went with that unlucky venture . " " You were just as far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse of the power society gives men over women ! " I exclaimed with vehemence . " You may imagine I was bitterly disappointed . The lesson was a hard one , but salutary . I took no more disinterested advice ; I bought no more property . There are too many agents between a woman and the thing she aims at , for her ever to attain it without danger of discomfiture . The experience , as you may guess , put me in no amicable mood towards Mr. Seabrook . Just think of it ! There were three years I had supported , by my labor , a large family of men , for that is what it amounted to . My money purchased the food they all ate , and I had really received nothing for it except my board and the clothes I worked in . The fault was not theirs ; it was Mr. Seabrook 's and society 's . " " I will tell you what you remind me of , " I said : " You are like Penelope , and her train of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In my busy life , I have not had time to read Homer , " Mrs. Greyfield replied ; " but if any other woman has been so eaten out of house and home , as I was , I am sorry for her . " " Homer 's Penelope , if we may believe the poet , was in much better circumstances to bear the ravages of her riotous boarders , than you were to feed yours gratuitously . " " Talking about suitors , " said Mrs. Greyfield , " I was not without those entirely , either . No young mismated woman can escape them perhaps . The universal opinion among men seems to be that , if you do not like the man you have , you must like some other one ; and each one thinks it is himself . " The piquant tone in which Mrs. Greyfield uttered her observations always provoked a smile . But I caught at an intimation in her speech . " Sometimes , " I said , " you speak as if you acknowledged Mr. Seabrook as your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am speaking of things as they appeared to others . In truth , I was as free to receive suitors as ever I had been ; but such was not the common understanding , and I resented the advances of men upon the ground that they believed themselves to be acting unlawfully , and that they hoped to make me a party to their breaches of law and propriety . I laugh now , in remembering the blunders committed by self-conceit so long ago ; but I did not laugh then ; it was a serious matter at that time . " " Was Mr. Seabrook jealous in his behavior , fearing you might fancy some one else ? " " Just as jealous as vain and tyrannical men always are when they are thwarted in their designs . No real husband could have been more critical in his observations on his wife 's deportment , than he was in his remarks on mine . If I could have been guilty of coquetry , the desire to annoy him would have been incentive enough ; but I always considered that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of punishing him . When I recall all these things , I take credit to myself for magnanimity ; though then I was governed only by my poor uncultivated judgment , and my impulses . For instance , Mr. Seabrook fell ill of a fever not long after he appropriated my real estate . Of course , I was as bitter towards him in my heart as it is possible to conceive , but I could not know that he was lying unattended in his room , without offering assistance ; so , after many struggles with myself to overcome my strong repulsion , I visited him often enough to give him such attentions as were necessary , but not more . I had no intention of raising any false expectations . " " I hope you took advantage of his being confined to his room , to collect board-money , " I said . " I found out , in time , several ways of managing that matter , which I would once have thought inadmissible . When I had begged some money from a boarder , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then ordered me to do the marketing . Without paying any attention to the command , I served up at meal-time whatever there was in the house . This brought out murmurs from the boarders , and haughty inquiries from the host himself . All the reply I vouchsafed was , that what he procured I would cook . In this way I forced him to pay out the money in his possession , at the expense of my character as a good wife , and a polite one . He took his revenge in abusive language , and occasional fits of destructiveness in the kitchen , which alarmed my little German neighbor more than it did me . So long as he secured all my earnings , and deceived people thoroughly as to his real conduct , he maintained , before others at least , a gentlemanly demeanor . But this was gradually giving way to the pressure of a constant thorn in his flesh , and the consciousness of his own baseness . He could swear , threaten , and almost strike at slight provocation now . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was then I told him I should shoot him , if he dared it . " I ought to say here , that in the last year I had two or three families in the house for a short time . I do n't know what these real wives thought of me ; that I was a termagant probably ; but they were not the kind of women I could talk to about myself , and I made no confidences . A plan was maturing in my mind that was to make it a matter of indifference what any one thought . I had relinquished the idea of getting money enough together to make a sure start in California , and was only waiting to have enough to take me out of the country in any way that I could go cheapest . Another necessary point to gain was secrecy . That could not be gained while I was surrounded by boarders , nor while Mr. Seabrook was in the house , and I resolved to be rid of both . " " Oh , " I cried , delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am going to tell you by how simple an expedient . I starved them out ! " " How strange that in all those years you never thought of that , " I said laughing . " But , then , neither did Homer 's heroine , who kept a first-class free boarding house for twice or thrice as long as you . Do tell me how you accomplished the feat of clearing your house . " " It is not quite true that I had not thought of it ; but I had not dared to do it . Besides , I wanted to get some money , if possible . Perhaps I should not have done it at the time I did , had not a little help come to me in the shape of real friends . I was all the time like a wild bird in a cage , and the continual attempts to escape I was making , only bruised my wings . It occurred to me one day to go to a certain minister who had lately come to Portland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell them my story . This I did . " Instead of receiving it as fiction , or doubting the strange parts of it in a way to make me wish I had never spoken of them , they manifested the greatest interest and sympathy , and promised me any assistance they could give . This was the first recognition I had gotten from anyone as being what I was ; a woman held in bondage worse than that of African slavery , by a man to whom she owed nothing , and in the midst of a free , civilized , and Christian community . They were really and genuinely shocked , and firmly determined to help me . I told them all the difficulties in the way , and of the expedient I had almost decided upon , to free my house from every one ; for I thought that when his income stopped , Mr. Seabrook would be forced to go away , and seek some other means of living . They agreed with me that there appeared no better way , and I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , to drive away the boarders , for they were there only to eat ; and when provisions entirely failed , or were uncooked , there was nothing to be done but to go where they could be better served . I did not feel very comfortable over it , as many of them were men I liked and respected , whose ill opinion it was disagreeable to incur , even in a righteous cause ; and then no woman likes to be the talk of the town , as I knew I must be . The ' town talk , ' as it happened , in time suggested my further course to me . " Pray tell me if Mr. Seabrook followed the boarders , or did he stay and compel you to cook for him ? " " He stayed , but he did not compel me to cook for him . That I peremptorily refused to do . Neither would I buy any supplies . If he wanted a meal , he must go out , get his provisions , and cook them for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , lest I should share his plenty . This reduced our rations to nothing . I used to take Benton out and buy him good , wholesome food , myself eating as little as would support nature . Occasionally , now that I had time on my hands , I spent a day out among my few visiting acquaintances ; and sometimes I took a meal with my German friend . In this way I compelled my former master to look out for himself . " One night , there not being a mouthful in the house to eat , I went out and bought a loaf of bread and some milk for Benton 's breakfast ; for I was careful not to risk the child 's health as I risked my own . In the morning when I came down stairs the bread and milk were gone . Mr. Seabrook had breakfasted . ' Bennie ' and I could go hungry . And that brings me back to what ' town talk ' did for me . " It soon became noised about that Mr. and Mrs. Seabrook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on dreadfully , and that probably there would be a divorce . ' Divorce ! ' I said , when my new friend , the minister , mentioned it to me , ' divorce from what ? How can there be a divorce where there is no marriage ? ' ' Nevertheless , ' he replied , ' it is worth considering . If the society you live in insist that you are married , why not gratify this society , and ask its leave to be legally separated from your nominal husband ? ' " At first I rebelled strongly against making this tacit admission of a relationship of that kind to Mr. Seabrook . It appeared to me to be a confession of falsehood to those few persons who were in my confidence , some of whom I felt had always half-doubted the full particulars , as being too ugly for belief . And what was quite as unpalatable as the other was that my enemy would rejoice that for once , at least , and in a public record , I should have to confess myself his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , as that was the popular understanding already , which nothing could alter ; and that so far as Mr. Seabrook was concerned his triumph would be short-lived and valueless . They undertook to procure counsel , and stand by me through the trial . " " What complaint did you purpose making ? " I interrupted . " ' Neglect of support , and cruel treatment ; ' the general charge that is made to cover so many abominable sins , because we women shrink from exposing the crimes we have been in a measure partners to . My attorney assured me that , under the circumstances , Mr. Seabrook would not make any opposition , fearing we might prove the whole , if he did so ; but would let the case go by default . This was just what he did ; and oh , you should have witnessed his abject humility when I at last had the acknowledged right to put him out of my house ! " Up to the time the divorce was obtained , he kept possession of the room he had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired an Indian woman to take care of as one of the chores assigned her about the house . For myself , I would not set my foot in it , except on the occasions referred to ; but the rent , and the care of it , he had free . Such was the moral degradation of the man , through his own acts , that after all that had passed , he actually cried , and begged of me the privilege to remain in that room , and be taken care of , as he had been used to be . " " What did you answer him ? " " I told him never to darken my door -- never to offend my sight again ; that I should never be quite happy while his head was above the sod . O , I was very vindictive ! And he was as mild as milk . He ' could not see why I should hate him so , who had always had so high a regard for me . He had never known a woman he admired and loved so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's abjectness . " " It is not uncommon in similar cases . Dependence makes any one more or less mean ; but it is more noticeable in men , who by nature and by custom are made independent . And so you were free at last ? " " Free and happy . I felt as light as a bird , and wondered I could n't fly ! I was poor ; but that was nothing . My business was broken up ; but I felt confidence in myself to begin again . My health , however , was very much broken down , and my friends said I needed change . That , with the desire to quit a country where I had suffered so much , determined me to come to California . It was the land of promise to my husband -- the El Dorado he was seeking when he died . I always felt that if I had come here in the first place , my life would have been very different . So , finally , with the help of my kind friends I came . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no courage to undertake life among strangers , and they mostly men . " " On the contrary , I felt armed in almost every point . The fact of being a divorced woman was my only annoyance ; but I was resolved to suppress it so far as I was able , and to represent myself to be , as I was , the widow of Mr. Greyfield . I took letters from my friends , to use in case of need ; and with nothing but my child , and money enough to take me comfortably to the mines on the American River , left Oregon forever . " " To behold you as you are now , in this delightful home , it seems impossible that you should have gone through what you describe ; and yet there must have been much more before you achieved the success here indicated . " " It was nothing -- nothing at all compared with the other . I proceeded direct to the most populous mining town , hired a house , bought furniture on credit , and took boarders again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you never have the mining-stock fever , and invest and lose ? " " Not to any dangerous extent . One or two parties , in whose judgment I knew I might confide , indicated to me where to invest , and I fortunately lost nothing , while I made a little . My best mining-stock was a present from a young man who was sick at my house for a long time , and to whom I was attentive . He was an excellent young fellow , and my sympathies were drawn out towards him ; alone in a mining-camp , and sick , and , as I suspected , moneyless . When he was well enough to go away , he confessed his inability to pay up , and presented me with several shares in a mine then but little known ; saying that it might not be worth the paper it was printed on , but that he hoped it might bring enough to reimburse my actual outlay on his account ; ' the kindness he had received could not be repaid with filthy lucre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several thousand dollars . I made diligent inquiry for my young friend , but could get no news of him from that day to this . I have been fortunate in everything I have touched since I came to California . Benton grew well and strong ; I recovered my health ; Fortune 's wheel for me seemed to remain in one happy position ; and now there seems nothing for me to do but to move slowly and easily down the sunset slope of life to my final rest . " Mrs. Greyfield smiled and sighed , and remarked upon the fact that the hour-hand of the clock pointed to two in the morning . " It is really unkind of me to keep you out of bed until such an hour as this , " she said , laughing a little , as if we had only been talking of ordinary things . " But I am in the mood , like the ' Ancient Mariner ; ' and you are as much forced to listen as the ' Wedding Guest . ' " " There is one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " As a woman , I can not repress my curiosity to know whether , since all the troubles of your early life have been past , you have desired to marry again . Opportunities I know you must have had . What I want to be informed about is your feeling upon this subject , and whether any man has been able to fill your eye or stir your heart . " The first smile my question called up died away , and an introspective look came over Mrs. Greyfield 's still handsome face . She sat silent for a little time , that seemed long to me , for I was truly interested in her reply . " I think , " she said at last , " that women who have had anything like my experience , are unfitted for married life . Either they are ruined morally and mentally , by the terrible pressure ; or they become so sharp-sighted and critical that no ordinary man would be able to win their confidence . I believe in marriage ; a single life has an incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then rallying , with much of her usual brightness : " Undoubtedly I have had my times of doubt , when I found it hard to understand myself ; and still , here I am ! Nobody would have me ; or I would not have anybody ; or both . " " One more question , then , if it is a fair one : Could you love again the husband of your youth ; or has your ideal changed ? " Mrs. Greyfield was evidently disturbed by the inquiry . Her countenance altered , and she hesitated to reply . " I beg your pardon , " I said ; " I hope you will not answer me , if I have been impertinent . " " That is a question I never asked myself , " she finally replied . " My husband was all in all to me during our brief married life . His death left me truly desolate , and his memory sacred . But we were both young , and probably he may have been unformed in character , to a great degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he could be restored to me as he was then , I can only half imagine . What he would now be , if he had lived on , I can not at all imagine . But let us now go take a wink of sleep . My eyelids at last begin to feel dry and heavy ; and you , I am sure , are perishing under the tortures of resistance to the drowsy god . " " The storm is over , " I said . " I thought you felt that something was going to happen ! " " It will be breakfast , I suppose . By the way , I must go and put a note under Jane 's door , telling her not to have it before half-past nine . There will be a letter from Benton , by the morning mail . Good night ; or , good morning , and sweet slumber . " " God be with you , " I responded , and in twenty minutes was sleeping soundly . Not so my hostess , it seems , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked pale and distraught , and acknowledged that she had not been able to compose herself after our long talk . The morning was clear and sunny , but owing to the storm of the night , the mail was late getting in , a circumstance which gave her , as I thought , a degree of uneasiness not warranted by so natural a delay . " You know I told you , " she said , trying to laugh off her nervousness , " that something was going to happen ! " " It would be a strange condition of things where nothing did happen , " I answered ; and just then the horn of the mail-carrier sounded , and the lumbering four-horse coach rattled down the street in sight of our windows . " There , " I said , " is your U. S. M. safe and sound , road-agents and land-slides to the contrary and of no effect . " Very soon our letters were brought us , and my hostess , excusing herself , retired to her room to read hers . Two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found her lying with a wet handkerchief folded over her forehead and eyes . A large and thick letter laid half open upon a table beside the bed . " Read that , " she said , without uncovering her eyes . When I had read the letter , " My dear friend , " I said , " what are you going to do ? I hope , after all , this may be good news . " " What can I do ? What a strange situation ! " " You will wish to see him , I suppose ? ' Arthur Greyfield . ' You never told me his name was Arthur , " I remarked , thinking to weaken the intensity of her feelings by referring to a trifling circumstance . " Why have I not died before this time ? " she exclaimed , unheeding my attempt at diversion . " This is too much , too much ! " " Perhaps there is still happiness in store for you , my dear Mrs. Greyfield , " I said . " Strange as is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " She remained silent a long time , as if thinking deeply . " He has a daughter , " she at length remarked ; " and Benton says she is very sweet and loveable . " " And motherless , " I added , not without design . I had meant only to arouse a feeling of compassion for a young girl half-orphaned ; but something more than was in my mind had been suggested to hers . She quickly raised herself from a reclining posture , threw off the concealing handkerchief , and gazed intently in my face , while saying slowly , as if to herself : " Not only motherless , but according to law , fatherless . " " Precisely , " I answered . " Her mother was in the same relation to Mr. Greyfield , that you were in to Mr. Seabrook ; but happily she did not know it in her lifetime . " " Nor he -- nor he ! Arthur Greyfield is not to be spoken of in the same breath with Mr. Seabrook . " The spirit with which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile , in spite of the dramatic interest of the situation . The smile did not escape her notice . " You think I am blown about by every contending breath of feeling , " she said , wearily ; " when the truth is , I am trying to make out the right of a case in which there is so much wrong ; and it is no easy thing to do . " " But you will find the right of it at last , " I answered . " You are not called upon to decide in a moment upon a matter of such weight as this . Take time , take rest , take counsel . " " Will you read the letter over to me ? " she asked , lying down again , and preparing to listen by shielding her face with her hands . The letter of Arthur Greyfield ran as follows : " My Dear Anna : How strange it seems to me to be writing to you again ! It is like conversing with one returned from another world , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to explain , and some things that perhaps will not ever be explained satisfactorily to you , that I know not where to begin or what to say . Still Benton insists on my writing before seeing you , and perhaps this is best . " To begin at the beginning . When I was left for dead by my frightened comrades on the plains , I had not died , but was only insensible ; and I do not believe they felt at all sure of my death , for they left me unburied , as if to give me a chance ; and deserted me rather than take any risks by remaining any longer in that place . How long I laid insensible I do not know . When I came to myself I was alone , well wrapped up in a large bed-quilt , and lying on the ground close by the wagon-trail . Nothing was left for my support , if alive , from which I concluded that they agreed to consider me dead . " When I opened my eyes again on the wilderness world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind blowing cool from the near mountains ; but I was too much exhausted to stir ; and laid there , kept alive by the pure air alone , until sunset . About that time of day I heard the tread of cattle coming , and the rumbling of wagons . The shock of joy caused me to faint , in which condition I was found by the advance guard of a large train bound for the mines in California . I need not tell you all those men did for me to bring me round , but they were noble fellows , and earned my everlasting gratitude . " You can imagine that the first thought in my mind was about you and Benton . When I was able to talk about myself and answer questions , my new friends , who had laid by for a couple of days on my account , assured me that they should be able to overtake the California train , in which I supposed you were , before they came to the Sierras . But we had accidents and delays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . " At last we arrived in the mining country , and my new friends speedily scattered abroad , looking for gold . I was still too feeble to work in the water , washing out , or to dig . I had no money or property of any kind , and was obliged to accept any means that offered of earning a subsistence . Meanwhile I made such inquiry as I could under the circumstances , and in such a country , but without learning anything of any of my former friends and acquaintances , for two years . Before this time , however , my health was restored , notwithstanding great hardships ; and being quite successful in mining , I was laying up considerable gold-dust . " About this time a man came into our camp from Oregon . As I was in the habit of inquiring of any newcomer concerning you , and the people in the train you were in , I asked this man if he had ever met a Mrs. Greyfield , or any of the others . He replied that he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oregon , a year or two before -- he was sure he had heard of a young widow of that name . I immediately wrote to you at that place ; but whether the letter was lost on the way , or whether it was intercepted there ( as by some intimations I have from Benton , it might have been ) , no reply ever came to it . I also sent a letter to Mr.  - -   - -   , in whose care I had left you , but nothing was ever heard from him . " When I had waited a reasonable length of time I wrote again to the postmaster of the same place , asking him if he knew of such a person as Mrs. Greyfield , in Oregon . The reply came this time from a man named Seabrook , who said that there had been a woman of the name of Greyfield in Portland at one time , but that both she and her child were dead . This news put an end to inquiries in that direction , though I continued to look for any one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our original party , who confirmed the intelligence of your having gone to Oregon instead of California , and so settled the question , as I supposed , forever . " You may wonder , dear Anna , that I did not go to Oregon when I had the barest suspicion of your being there . The distance and the trouble of getting there were not what deterred me . I was making money where I was , and did not wish to abandon my claim while it was producing well , for an uncertain hint that might mislead me . " " Stop there ! " interrupted Mrs. Greyfield . " Do you think I should have hesitated in a case like that ? But go on . " " I knew you had considerable property , and thought I knew you were with friends who would not let you suffer --  " " Though they had abandoned him while still alive , in the wilderness ! Beg pardon ; please go on again . " " And that Oregon was really a more comfortable , and safe place for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greyfield groaned . " And that you , if there , would do very well until I could come for you . I could not suspect that you would avail yourself of the privilege of widowhood within so short a time , if ever . " " Oh ! " ejaculated my listener , with irrepressible impatience . I read on without appearing to observe the interruption . " To tell the truth , I had not thought of myself as dead , and that is probably where I made the greatest mistake . It did not occur to me , that you were thinking of yourself as a widow ; therefore , I did not realize the risk . But when the news came of your death , if it were really you , as I finally made up my mind it must be --  " An indignant gesture , accompanied by a sob , expressed Mrs. Greyfield 's state of feeling on this head . " I fell into a state of confirmed melancholy , reproaching myself severely for not having searched the continent over before stopping to dig gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our dear boy , whom I believed alive and well , somewhere , until I received Mr. Seabrook 's letter . " My dear Anna , I come now to that which will try your feelings ; but you must keep in view that I have the same occasion for complaint . Having made a comfortable fortune , and feeling miserable about you and the boy , I concluded to return to the Atlantic States , to visit my old home . While there I met a lovely and excellent girl , who consented to be my wife , and I was married the second time . We had one child , a girl , now eighteen years of age ; and then my wife died . I mourned her sincerely , but not more so than I had mourned you . " At last , after all these years , news came of you from a reliable source . The very man to whose charge I committed you when I expected to die , returned to the States , and from him I heard of your arrival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painful as this last news was to my feelings , I set out immediately for California ( I had learned from him that you were probably in this State ) , and commenced inquiries . An advertisement of mine met Benton 's eye only two days ago , and you may imagine my pleasure at the discovery of my only and dear son , so long lost to me . He is a fine , manly fellow , and good ; for which I have to thank you , of course . " " You see , he appropriates Benton at once . Never so much as ' by your leave . ' But Benton will not quit me to follow this new-found father , " Mrs. Greyfield said , with much feeling . " He may not be put to the test of a choice . You have a proposition to consider , " I replied . " Let me read it . " " No , no ! Yet , read it ; what do I care ? Go on . " " My daughter , Nellie , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good as one could desire . Benton seems to be delighted with her for a sister . And now that the young folks have taken such a fancy to each other , there is something that I wish to propose to you . It can not be expected , after all that has passed , and with the lapse of so many years , we could meet as if nothing had come between us --  " " Who suffered all this to come between us ? " cried Mrs. Greyfield , much agitated . " But I trust we can meet as friends , dear friends , and that possibly in time we may be re-united , as much for our own sakes , as the children 's . " " Oh , how can I ever forgive him ? Does it not seem to you that if Mr. Greyfield had done his duty , all this terrible trouble and illegal marrying would have been avoided ? Do you think a man should consider anything in this world before his wife and children , or fail of doing his utmost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any illicit relation , if its duties are not sacred and not to be set aside for anything ? I could never have done as he has done , blameless as he thinks himself . " The condition of Mrs. Greyfield 's mind was such that no answer was written or attempted that day nor the next . She sent a brief dispatch to Benton , asking him to come home , and come alone . I wished to go away , thinking she would prefer being left quite to herself under the circumstances , but she insisted on my remaining until something had been decided on about the meeting between her and Mr. Greyfield . Benton came home as requested , and the subject was canvassed in all its bearings . The decision arrived at was , that an invitation should be sent to Mr. Greyfield and daughter to visit Mrs. Greyfield for a fortnight . Everything beyond that was left entirely to the future . When all was arranged , I took my leave , promising and being promised frequent letters . The last time I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter Nellie . " I have adopted her , " she said , " with her father 's consent . She is a charming girl , and I could not bear to leave her motherless . Benton is very much attached to his father . They are off on a mountaineering expedition at present , but I hope they will come home before you go away . " " Are you not going to tell me , " I asked , " how you finally settled matters between Mr. Greyfield and yourself . " " He is a very persistent suitor , " she replied , smiling , " I can hardly tell what to do with him . " " You do not want to break bark over his head ? " I said , laughing . " No ; but I do almost wish that since he had stayed away so long he had never come back . I had got used to my own quiet , old-maid ways . I was done , or thought I was done , with passion and romance ; and now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doubt -- to love and not to love -- to feel revengeful and forgiving -- to think one way in the morning and another way by noon , is very tiresome . I really do not know what to do with him . " I smiled , because I thought the admission was as good as Mr. Greyfield need desire , for his prospects . " I think I can understand , " I said , " how difficult it must be to get over all the gaps made by so many years of estrangement -- of fancied death , even . Had you been looking for him for such a length of time , there would still be a great deal of awkwardness in the meeting , when you came together again . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Greyfield , " it is inevitable . The most artistic bit of truth in the Odyssey ( you see I have read Homer since you called me PENELOPE ) , is where the poet describes the difficulty the faithful wife had in receiving the long-absent , and now changed , Ulysses as her true husband . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and so will you . " " The minister will have to bless the reception then . And to confess the whole truth to you , we are corresponding with my friend of long ago in Portland . He has promised to come down to perform the ceremony , and as his health is impaired , we have invited him to bring his family , at our expense , and to remain in our home while Mr. Greyfield and I , with Benton and Nellie , make a tour to and through Europe .

A CURIOUS INTERVIEW . Vancouver 's Island furnishes some of the finest scenery on the Pacific Coast ; not grandest , perhaps , but quietly charming . Its shores are indented every here and there with the loveliest of bays and sounds , forming the most exquisite little harbors to be found anywhere in the world . The climate of the Island , especially its summer climate , is delightful . Such bright , bracing airs as come from the sea on one side , and from the snow-capped mountains of the mainland on the other , are seldom met with on either hemisphere . Given a July day , a pleasant companion or two in a crank little boat , whose oars we use to make silvery interludes in our talk , and I should not envy your sailor on the Bosphorus . On such a July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idled away the morning , splashing our way indolently through the blue waters of Nittinat Sound , the mountains towering behind us , the open sea not far off ; but all around us a shore so emerald green and touched with bits of color , so gracefully , picturesquely wild , that not , in all its unrestraint , was there an atom of savagery to be subdued in the interest of pure beauty . It was a wilderness not wild , a solitude not solitary ; but rather populous with happy fancies , born of all harmonious influences of earth , air and water ; of sunlight , shadow , color and fragrance . " My soul to-day is far away , Sailing a sunny tropic bay , " sang Charlie , bursting with poetry . The next moment " Hallo ! boat ahoy ! " and into the scene in which just now we had been the only life , slipped from some hidden inlet , an Indian canoe . " Is n't she a beauty , though ? " said Charlie , laying on his oar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious figure-head ! By George , that 's a pretty sight ! " And a pretty sight it was , as the canoe , with its red and blue-blanketed oarsmen , was propelled swiftly through the water , and quickly brought alongside ; when we had opportunity to observe that the crew were all stalwart young fellows , with rather fine , grand features , that looked as if they might have been cut in bronze , so immobile and fixed were they . Their dress was the modern dress of the Northern Indians , supplied by the Hudson 's Bay Company , of bright colors and fine texture . But what most engaged our attention was the figure of the fifteenth occupant of the canoe , who acted as steersman . He was evidently a very old man , and instead of being dressed in blankets , had on a mantle of woven rushes , and leggins of wolf-skin . A quiver full of arrows hung at his back ; his bow rested on his knees . On his grizzled head was a tall , pointed and gaily painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mammoth extinguisher . As the canoe shot past us , I imagined that I detected an expression of contempt upon the old man 's face , though he never moved nor spoke , nor in any way evinced any interest in us . " Eheu ! what a funny-looking old cove , " said Charlie , gazing after the canoe , " I should like to cultivate his acquaintance . " " Well , you have the opportunity , " rejoined Fanny , the third member of our party . " They are going to land on that point just ahead of us . " We were all watching them , fascinated by the noiseless dexterity of their movements , when suddenly there was nothing to be seen of either boat or crew . " Where the deuce have they gone to ? " asked Charlie , staring at the vacant spot where the canoe had disappeared . " Great heavens ! " cried Fanny , who , like her brother , used a very exclamatory style of speech ; " why , they have all vanished into thin air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I proposed that we should follow , and examine into the mystery ; but Fanny cried out , " O , for goodness ' sake , do n't ! I 'm afraid . If they have the power to make themselves invisible , they may be hiding to do us harm . " " It is only visible harm that I 'm afraid of , " answered Charlie , with his eyes still fixed wonderingly on the point of space where they had so lately been ; " pull fast , Pierre , let us find out what the rascals are up to . " Thus urged , I threw what force I could into my oar-stroke ( for I was but a convalescent ) , and very soon we came to the long sloping point of mossy rocks where we had expected to see the canoe 's passengers land . I own that I approached it with some caution , thinking it possible that a whirlpool might have sucked the boat and its freight of fifteen lives out of sight , in some point of time when our eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , and the whole place , both on water and on land , silent , sunny , and not in the least uncanny or alarming . We dropped our oars and gazed at each other in amazement . " Well , if that do n't beat the Dutch ! " was Charlie 's comment ; and I fancied that his brown cheek grew a shade less ruddy than usual . As for Fanny , she was in a fright , paling and shrinking as if from some terrible real and visible danger ; and when I proposed to land and investigate the mystery , fairly mustered quite a copious shower of tears with which to melt my resolve . " O , Pierre -- Mr . Blanchett , I mean -- oh , please do n't go ashore . I am sure either that these dreadful savages are lurking here to destroy us , or that we have been deceived by some wicked conjuror . Oh , I am so frightened ! " " My dear Miss Lane , " I answered , " I give you my word no harm shall come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform a conjurer 's trick right before our faces that we do not attempt to have explained ? By no means . If you are too nervous to come ashore with us , Charlie may stay with you in the boat , and I will go by myself to look into this matter . " Whereupon Fanny gave me so reproachful a look out of her great brown eyes that I quailed beneath it . " Do you think Charlie and I would leave you to go into danger alone ? No , indeed ; if you will be so rash , we will accompany you ; and if die we must , we will all die together . " That last appeal being made with a very touching quaver of a very melodious voice . For answer , I assisted her out of the boat , which Charlie was already fastening by the chain to some bushes near the bit of beach ; and tucking the little gloved hand under my arm , seized an opportunity to whisper something not particularly relevant to this story . The boat being secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stopping to gather wild roses and mock-orange blossoms , which , in spite of her alarm , engaged Miss Lane 's attention to such an extent that Charlie had gotten fairly out of sight before we missed him . But as we turned to follow , he confronted us with a face expressive of a droll kind of perplexity . " Not a red rascal in sight , " said he , glancing back over his shoulder , " except that queer old cove that was sitting in the stern . He 's just over there , " jerking his head in the direction meant , " sitting on his haunches like an Egyptian idol , and about as motionless , and about as ancient . " " But their canoe , " I said , " what could they have done with their canoe ? It is not in the water , and there is no sign here of their having dragged it ashore . " " They did n't land , not in the regular way , I mean , for I was watching for them every instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that canoe got out of sight so quick , is too hard a nut for me to crack , I confess . " " Let us not go near the dreadful old thing , " pleaded Fanny once more , her alarm returning . Again I proposed to her to stay in the boat with Charlie , which had the effect , as before , to determine her upon going with us ; which determination I strengthened by an encouraging pressure of the little gloved hand in my possession ; and without waiting for further alarms pressed on at once , with Charlie for guide , to the spot where the " dreadful old thing " was understood to be . And there , sure enough , he was , squatting on the ground beside a spring , where grew a thicket of willows and wild roses ; alone and silent , evidently watching , if not waiting , for our approach . " What will you say to him ? " asked Fanny , as we came quite near , eyeing the singular object with evident dread . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Charlie lightly . " If he is a live Indian he is sure to say ' yes ' to that proposition ; " and Charlie actually produced from his pockets some sandwiches , in a slightly damaged condition . Holding these before him , very much as one holds an ear of corn to a frisky colt he wishes to catch , he approached near enough to offer them , Fanny still holding me back just enough to let this advance be made before we came up . To her great relief the mummy put out a skinny hand , and snatched the offered provisions under its robe . " You see he is only a poor starving old Indian , " I said . " Me no poor -- no starve ; me big chief , " retorted the old man , glancing disdainfully at us , with eyes that now appeared bright . I exchanged telegraphic communication with Charlie and Fanny , seated her comfortably upon a mossy boulder , and threw myself at her feet , while Charlie disposed of himself also , within conversational distance . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insinuatingly . " My name is Nittinat -- this is my country ; this water is mine ; this earth , these stones -- all mine that you see . " " Such a great chief must have many warriors -- many people . I do not see any . Were those your people that I saw in the canoe ? " " Nittinat 's people all gone , " answered the old man sadly , dropping his chin upon his rush-clad breast . " But we saw a canoe with fourteen warriors in it , besides yourself , " Charlie eagerly asserted . " Where are those young men ? " " Me great medicine man ; make see canoe -- make see young men , " responded the owner of the place , with a wan yet superior sort of smile . Charlie glanced at us , then asked quite deferentially , " Can you make us see what is not here ? " " You have seen , " was the brief reply . " Ask him why we are thus favored , " whispered Fanny . " This young cloochman ( you see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , wishes to know why you opened our eyes to your great medicine . " " White man come to Nittinat 's land , white man see Nittinat 's power . White man ask questions ! "  - -  this last contemptuously , at which Fanny laughed , as asking questions was one of her reserved rights . " You must be an old man , since these waters are named after you , " suggested I. " Who was the first white man you remember seeing ? " " Hyas tyee , Cappen Cook . Big ship -- big guns ! " answered Nittinat , warming with the recollection . " This is a good lead , " remarked Charlie , sotto voce ; " follow it up , Pierre . " " You were a child then ? very little ? " making a movement with my hand to indicate a child 's stature . " Me a chief -- many warriors -- big chief . Ugh ! " said the mummy , with kindling eyes . At this barefaced story , Charlie made a grimace , while he commented in an undertone : " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How the old humbug lies . " At this whispered imputation upon his honor , the old chief regarded us scornfully ; though how such a parchment countenance could be made to express anything excited my wonder . " Me no lie . Nittinat 's heart big . Nittinat 's heart good . Close tum-tum , ugh ! " " White man 's eyes are closed -- his heart is darkened , " said I , adopting what I considered to be a conciliatory style of speech . " My friend can not understand how you could have known Captain Cook so long ago . All the white men who knew the great white chief have gone to their fathers . " " Ugh , all same as Cappen Cook . He no believe my cousin Wiccanish see big Spanish ship ' fore he came . " " How did he make him see it at last ? " asked Charlie , stretching himself out on the grass , and covering his eyes with his hat , from under the brim of which he shot quizzical glances at Fanny and I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from beneath his robe a necklace of shells , to which two silver spoons were attached , of a peculiar pattern , and much battered and worn . " Oh , do let me see them , " cried Fanny , whose passion for relics was quickly aroused . Charlie , too , was constrained to abandon his lazy attitude for a moment to examine such a curiosity as these quaint old spoons . " Only to think that they are more than a hundred years old ! But I can not make out the lettering upon them ; perhaps he is deceiving us after all , " said Fanny , passing them to me for inspection . I took out of my pocket a small magnifying-glass , which , although it could not restore what was worn away , brought to light all that was left of an inscription , probably the manufacturer 's trade-mark , the only legible part of which was 17-0 . " Did the Spanish captain give these to your cousin ? " I asked . " Ugh ! " responded Nittinat , nodding his tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see cappen . " " And stole the spoons , " murmured Charlie from under his hat . Fanny touched his foot with the stick of her parasol , for she stood in awe of this ancient historian , not wishing to be made a subject of his powerful " medicine . " " And so you knew Captain Cook ? " I repeated , when the spoons were hidden once more under the mantle of rushes , " and other white men too , I suppose . Did your people and the white people always keep on friendly terms ? " " Me have good heart , " answered Nittinat rather sadly . " Me and my cousins Wiccanish , Clyoquot , Maquinna , and Tatoocheatticus , we like heap sell our furs , and get knives , beads , and brass buttons . Heap like nails , chisels , and such things . If my young men sometimes stole very little things , Nittinat 's heart was not little . He made the white chiefs welcome to wood and water ; he gave them his women ; and sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White chief heap mean to make trouble about a few chains or hammers after all that ! " " Oh , the horrid wretch ! " whispered Fanny : " Does he say he killed half a dozen slaves for amusement ? " " If he did , Miss Lane , " I answered ; " was it worse than the elegant Romans used to do ? The times and the manners have to be considered , you know . " Fanny shuddered , but said nothing , and I went on addressing myself to Nittinat : " How many ships did you ever see in these waters at one time ?  - -  I mean long ago , in Captain Cook 's time ? " The old chief held up five fingers , for answer . " And you and your cousins were friendly to all of them ? " " Maquinna 's heart good , too ,  - -  close tum-tum . Sell land to one Cappen ; he go ' way . Sell land to other Cappen ; he go ' way , too . Bime-by two Cappens come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When one Cappen ask : ' Is the land mine ? ' Maquinna tell him ' yes . ' When other Cappen ask : ' Is the land mine ? ' Maquinna tell him ' yes , ' too , all same . O yes ; Indian have good heart ; no want to fight great white chief with big guns . He stay in his lodge , and laugh softly to himself , and let the white chiefs fight ' bout the land . Ugh ! " " The mercenary old diplomat ! " muttered Charlie , under his hat . " Here 's your ' noble savage , ' Fanny . Burn a little incense , ca n't you ? " But Fanny preferred remaining silent to answering her brother 's bantering remarks ; and if she was burning incense at all , I had reason to think it was to one who shall be nameless . " Did you always have skins to sell to so many vessels ? " I asked , returning to the subject of the trading vessels . " Long ago had plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Skin not good , throw ' em back to Indian . My young men take ' em ashore , stretch tail long like sea-otter , fix ' em up nice ; give ' em to other Indian , tell him go sell ' em . All right . Cappen buy ' em next time ; pay good price ; like ' em heap ; " at which recollection the mummy actually laughed . " How is that for Yankee shrewdness ? " asked a muffled voice under a hat ; to which , however , I paid no attention . " You speak of the white chiefs fighting about land . Did they ever use their big guns on each other ? Tell me what you remember about the white men who came here in ships , long ago . " " After Cappen Cook go ' way , long time , come Spanish ship , King George ship , Boston ship . Spanish Cappen no like King George Cappen . One day fight with long knives ; ( swords ) and Spanish Cappen put King George man in big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and went ; sold many skins . One time all go ' way but the Boston ships . Bime-by King George 's ships came back and fight the Boston 's . " " And you kept your good heart all the time ? Never killed the Bostons or King George men ? " At this interrogation , Nittinat shuffled his withered limbs uneasily beneath his rush mantle , and averted his parchment countenance . Upon my pressing the question , as delicately as I knew how , he at length recovered his immobility , and answered in a plausible tone enough : " Boston Cappen Gray , he build a fort at Clyoquot . My cousin Wiccanish sell him the ground , and Cappen Gray bring all his goods from the ship , and put them in the fort for winter . Our young men were lazy , and had not many skins to sell ; but they wanted Cappen Gray 's goods ; they liked the firewater a heap . So the young men they say , ' kill Cappen Gray , and take his goods . ' My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Nittinat say that bad too . But we tell our young men if they will do this bad thing , we will not leave them without a chief to direct them . So my young men came to Clyoquot to help their cousins take the big guns of the fort . But Cappen Gray find all out in time to save our young men from doing wrong . We tell him our hearts all good . He give us presents , make close tum-tum . No use kill Boston tyee when he give us what we want . " Charlie tilted up his sombrero , and shot an approving glance at the venerable philosopher that caused a smile to ripple Fanny 's face at the instant she was saying , " The horrid wretch ! " with feminine vehemence . To cover this by-play , I asked if Nittinat remembered the Tonquin . " Oh , come ! " ejaculated Charlie , starting up , " I say we have had enough of this artless historian 's prattle ; do n't you ? " " Consider , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compose yourself , my friend , while I continue my interviewing . " Turning to Nittinat I asked : " Why did the Indians destroy Captain Thorn 's vessel ? " " Cappen Thorn big chief ; no like Indian ; big voice ; no give presents ; no let Indian come on board without leave ; Indian no like Cappen Thorn . He get mad at my cousin Kasiascall for hiding on his ship ; keep him all night prisoner , cause he no punish his young men for cutting the boarding-netting . Kasiascall get mad . Next day no Indian go to trade with the ship ; then Cappen Thorn he send McKay ashore to say he is sorry , and talk to Indian ' bout trade . " Indian very good to McKay ; say not mad ; say come next day to trade plenty . Kasiascall , too , tell McKay all right ; come trade all same . But McKay he look dark ; he no believe my cousin ; think Indian lie . All same he tell come to-morrow ; and he shake hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorn , ' Indian say he trade to-morrow . ' Big Cappen walk the deck very proud . He say he ' teach the damned Indians to behave themselves . ' " Next day six white men come ashore to visit our lodges . My cousin treat white men well . Kasiascall and his young men go to the ship to trade . Pretty soon Kasiascall come back : say McKay look dark and sad ; say Indian buy plenty of knives and hide under their blankets ; say I will see the ship taken by the Indians in one hour . My heart was sad for McKay . He good man . Indian like McKay heap . But my cousin and his people want plenty goods ; no like Cappen Thorn ; so Nittinat say nothing . " Bimeby there was big noise like a hundred guns , and the ship was all in pieces , flying through the air like leaves on the wind . My cousin 's people were all in pieces too ; one arm , one leg , one piece head . Ugh ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that the whole story , old mortality ? " But Nittinat was silent -- overcome , as it seemed by these sad reminiscences . He bowed his head upon his breast until the extinguisher pointed directly at Fanny 's nose , as her brother mischievously made her aware . When I thought that Nittinat had taken time to sufficiently regret his cousin 's misfortune in losing so many young men , I gently reminded him of Charlie 's question . " Kasiascall 's heart was very little when he saw the destruction of his warriors , and heard the wailing of the women and children . To comfort him the six white men were taken and bound for slaves . When the days of mourning were past , my cousin laid the six white slaves in a row , their throats resting on the sharp edge of a rock , and set his Indian slaves to saw off their heads with a cedar plank . It was a very fine sight ; our hearts were good ; we were comforted . " As no one uttered an opposing sentiment , Nittinat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons we feared the Bostons down on the Columbia would come to make war on us ; and we went no more to trade with any ships . But after a time Kasiascall 's heart grew big within him . He asked my advice . I said ' you are my brother . Go kill all the whites on the Columbia . ' Then we danced the medicine dance ; and Kasiascall went alone to the country of the Chinooks , to the fort of the Boston men . He told the chief of the Bostons how the Tonquin was destroyed , with all on board ; but he kept a dark place in his heart , and his tongue was crooked . He said Kasiascall knew not of the treachery of his relations , and people , and he said nothing of the six white slaves . Then the Boston chief gave him presents , and he staid many days at the fort , until he heard that some Indians from Sooke were coming there . Fearing the Sooke Indians might have straight tongues , Kasiascall left the fort that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up to take the fort and kill all the Bostons . But the chief discovered the plot , and my cousin fled back to Neweeta . Ugh ? " " These events occurred a long time ago , " I suggested . " Your hearts were dark then , but surely you have a better heart now . You would not kill the whites to-day if you could ? " A very expressive " Ugh ! " was the only rejoinder . " But the Indians I see about here look very comfortable and happy . They have good warm blankets , and enough to eat . " " Indian hunt furs to pay for blanket ; Indian catch fish for eat . Bime-by furs grow scarce ; white man catch fish , too . Bime-by Hudson Bay men go way ; Indian go naked . Then come black-gowns ( priests , or preachers ) . He say , ' Indian pray for what he want . ' But that all d --  -- d lie ; pray one moon -- two , three moons , nothing comes . White man say to Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fool -- know nothing . " " He is making out a case , " said Charlie ; " but he do n't look as if he need concern himself about the future . " " Ask him if he ever saw any white ladies , in that long ago time he has been telling us of , " whispered Fanny , who could not muster courage to address the manikin directly . I considered how best to put the desired question , but Nittinat was beforehand with me . " I have seen many things with my eyes . First came the big ships , with wings ; and only men came in them . By and by came a long , black ship , without sails , or oars , but with a great black and white smoke . I went on board this vessel with one of my wives , the youngest and prettiest ; and here I saw the first white woman that came to my country . I liked the white woman , and asked her to be my wife . She laughed , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cappen , but he would not hear . I offered him many skins , and my new wife . He swore at me . I am sworn at and laughed at for wanting wife with a white skin . White man take Indian wife when he please . Nittinat has many wrongs ; yet Nittinat has good heart , all same . Bime-by big medicine-man come and make all right . White man all melt away like snow on the mountain-side . Indian have plenty house , plenty blankets , plenty eat -- all , everything , all the time . Good ! " " White wives included , I presume . Well , " said Charlie , " I think this interview might be brought to a close . Hold fast to Pierre and I , Fanny , or the wizard may spirit you off to his wigwam , to inaugurate the good time coming that he speaks of . " So saying , Charlie rose to his feet , stretched his limbs lazily , and turned to disengage his sister 's veil from a vicious thorn-bush in our way . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate tissue being at last rescued with some care , turned to say farewell to the chief of all the Nittinats , when lo ! I addressed myself to space . " The old cove has taken himself off as mysteriously as he came . That is a confounded good trick ; could n't do it better myself . Does anybody miss anything ? " was Charlie 's running comment on the transaction . " Ca n't say that I do , unless it is my luncheon . I 'm ravenously hungry , and every sandwich gone . Could that dreadful old ghoul have eaten those you gave him , Charlie ? Do you know , I could n't help thinking he must be a ghost ? " " Well , the ghost of an Indian could eat , steal , and beg , I should think . I felt like rattling his dry bones , when he so coolly confessed to the most atrocious murders of white men . " " That is because you are not an Indian , I presume , " said I , with a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indian virtue is not white men 's virtue . If it won you rank , and riches , and power , to become a mighty slayer , a slayer you would undoubtedly become . A man , even an Indian , is what his circumstances make him . The only way I can conceive to make a first-class man , is to place him under first-class influences . I am generalizing now , of course ; the exceptions are rare enough to prove the rule . " " I wish I had those spoons , " said Fanny , " they would be such a curiosity at home . " " The spoon I wish for is one of the vessel 's forks , with a bit of roast beef on it . Here , Sis , jump in ; we shall be late for dinner , and the Captain will call us to account . " In a few moments we were out of the little cove , and in open water of the sound , pulling back toward the harbor , where the steamer was lying that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain inlet , Fanny cried out , " Look there ! " and turning our eyes in the direction of her glance , we saw the canoe with its bronzed crew just disappearing up the narrow entrance , half-hidden in shrubbery . Our adventure was related at dinner in the steamer 's cabin , and various were the conjectures regarding the identity of Chief Nittinat . The captain declared his ignorance of any such personage . Most of the party were inclined to regard the whole affair as a practical joke , though who could have been the authors of it no one ventured to say . It was proposed that another party should repeat the excursion on the following day , in order that another opportunity might be given the mysterious medicine man to put in an appearance . And this , I believe , really was carried into effect , but without result , so far as solving the mystery was concerned . A canoe , similar to the one we had seen , had been discovered up one of the numerous arms of the Sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been easily distanced , and the clue lost , so that all hope of clearing up the mystery was relinquished . One evening , shortly after , Fanny and I sat together in the soft , clear moonlight , listening to the dance-music in the cabin , and the gentle splash of the waters about the vessel 's keel . All at once , a canoe-load of Nootkans shot across the moon 's wake , not fifty yards from our anchorage , and as suddenly was lost again in shadow . " Fanny , " I said , " being the only invalid of this party , I feel a good deal nervous about these apparitions . They are usually regarded , I believe , as portentious . Without designing to take advantage of your too sympathizing disposition , I am tempted to remind you that if I am ever to have the happiness of calling your precious self truly my own , it ought to be before the third appearance of the ghostly presence ; will you condescend to name the day ? " " I should prefer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear on this occasion . Suppose we try a valse , which I think will tend to dissipate your melancholy forebodings . " I may as well own it here : the little witch could not be brought to make any final arrangements , although I did entreat her seriously . " You must talk about these things when I am at home with my papa and mamma , " she insisted ; and I was compelled to respect her decision . But we have been married almost a year , and we often refer to the strange interview we had with Chief Nittinat . Perhaps the Smoke-eller doctrine now popular among the northern Indians , and which corresponds to our spiritualism , may have some foundation in similar occurrences themselves . Who knows but Nittinat was talking to us through a medium ? MR . ELA 'S STORY . Three or four years ago , my husband and I were making a winter voyage up the Oregon coast . The weather was not peculiarly bad : it was the ordinary winter weather , with a quartering wind , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sick , thoroughly uncomfortable , with no refuge but the narrow and dimly-lighted state-room , I was reduced in the first twenty-four hours to a condition of ignominious helplessness , hardly willing to live , and not yet fully wishing or intending to die . In this unhappy frame of mind the close of the second weary day found me , when my husband opened our state-room door to say that Mr. Ela , of  - -   - -   , Oregon , was on board , and proposed to come and talk to me , in the hope of amusing me and making me forget my wretchedness . Submitting rather than agreeing to the proposal , chairs were brought and placed just inside the door-way , where the light of the saloon lamps shown athwart the countenance of my self-constituted physician . He was a young man , and looked younger than his years ; slightly built , though possessing a supple , well-knit frame , with hands of an elegant shape , fine texture , and great expression . You saw at a glance that he had a poet 's head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only after observation that you saw how much the face was capable of which it did not convey , for faces are apt to indicate not so much individual culture as the culture of those with whom we are habitually associated . Mr. Ela 's face clearly indicated to me the intellectual poverty , the want of aesthetic cultivation in his accustomed circle of society , at the same time that it suggested possible phases of great beauty , should it ever become possible for certain emotions to be habitually called to the surface by sympathy . Evidently a vein of drollery in his nature had been better appreciated , and oftener exhibited to admiring audiences , than any of the finer qualities of thought or sentiment of which you instinctively knew him to be capable ; and yet the face protested against it , too , by a gentle irony with a hint of self-scorn in it , as if its owner , in his own estimation , wrote himself a buffoon for his condescension . Altogether it was a good face ; but one to make you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was untrue to itself . I remember thinking all this , looking out with sluggish interest from my berth , while the two gentlemen did a little preliminary talking . Mr. Ela 's voice , I observed , like his face , was susceptible of great change and infinite modulations . Deep chest tones were followed by finely attenuated sounds ; droning nasal tones , by quick and clear ones . The quality of the voice was soft and musical ; the enunciation slow , often emphatic . His manner was illustrative , egotistic , and keenly watchful of effects . " You never heard the story of my adventure in the mountains ? " Ela began , turning to me with the air of a man who had made up his mind to tell his story . " No ; please tell it . " " Well "  - -  running his tapering fingers through his hair and pulling it over his forehead --  " I started out in life with a theory , and it was this : that no young man should ask a woman to marry him until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? I was about nineteen years old when I took up some land down in the Rogue River Valley , and worked away at it with this object . " " Had you really a wife selected at that age ? " " No ; but it was the fashion in early times in that country to marry early , and I was getting ready , according to my theory ; do n't you see ? I was pretty successful , too ; had considerable stock , built me a house , made a flower garden for my wife , even put up the pegs or nails she was to hang her dresses on . I intended that fall to get on my horse , ride through the Wallamet Valley , and find me my girl . " At the notion of courting in that off-hand , general style , both my husband and I laughed doubtingly . Ela laughed , too , but as if the recollection pleased him . " You think that is strange , do you ? ' Twas n't so very strange in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? There was not a girl within forty miles of me ; and just the thought of one now , as I was fixing those nails to hang her garments on ; why , it ran just through me like a shock of electricity ! " Well , as I said , I had about two hundred and fifty head of cattle , a house with a garden , a young orchard , and vegetables growing ; everything in readiness for the wife I had counted on getting to help me take care of it . And what do you think happened ? There came such a plague of grasshoppers upon the valley that they destroyed every green thing : crops , orchard , flowers , grass , everything ! My stock died , the greater portion of them , and I was ruined . " ( Deep bass . ) " I considered myself disappointed in love , too , because , though I had n't yet found my girl , I knew she was somewhere in the valley waiting for me ; and I felt somehow , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been jilted . Actually , it pierces me with a pang now to think of those useless pegs on which so often my imagination hung a pink calico dress and a girl 's sun-bonnet . " Knitting his brows , and sighing as he shifted his position , Ela once more pulled the hair over his forehead , in his peculiar fashion , and went on : " I became misanthropic ; felt myself badly used . Packing up my books and a few other traps , I started for the mountains with what stock I had left , built myself a fort , and played hermit . " " A regular fort ? " " A stockade eighteen feet high , with an embankment four feet high around it , a strong gate , a tent in the middle of the inclosure , all my property , such as books , feed , arms , etc. , inside . " " On account of Indians ? " " Indians and White Men . Yes , I 've seen a good many Indians through the bead of my rifle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mining camps down in the valley , and you know the hangers-on of those camps ? I sold beef to the miners ; had plenty of money by me sometimes . It was necessary to be strongly forted . " " What a strange life for a boy ! What did you do ? How spend your time ? " " I herded my cattle , drove them to market , cooked , studied , wrote , and indulged in misanthropy , with a little rifle practice . By the time I had been one summer in the mountains , I had got my hand in , and knew how to make money buying up cattle to sell again in the mines . " " So there was method in your madness -- misanthropy , I mean ? " " Well , a man can not resign life before he is twenty-one . I was doing well , and beginning to think again of visiting the Wallamet to hunt up my girl . One Sunday afternoon , I knew it was Sunday , because I kept a journal ; I was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the paper , and , looking up , lo ! a skeleton figure stood before me . " ( Sepulchral tones , and a pause . ) " Used as I was to lonely encounters with strange men , my hair stood on end as I gazed on the spectre before me . He was the merest boy in years ; pretty and delicate by nature , and then reduced by starvation to a shadow . His story was soon told . He had left Boston on a vessel coming out to the northwest coast , had been wrecked at the mouth of the Umpqua , and been wandering about in the mountains ever since , subsisting as best he could on roots and berries . But you are becoming tired ? " " No , I assure you ; on the contrary , growing deeply interested . " " The boy was not a young woman in disguise , or anything like that , you know " with an amused look at me . " I thought you 'd think so ; but as he comes into the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I fed him and nursed him until he was able to go to work , and then I got Sam Chong Lung to let him take up a claim alongside a Chinese camp , promising to favor the Chinaman in a beef contract if he was good to the boy . His claim proved a good one , and he was making money , when two Chinamen stole a lot of horses from Sam Chong Lung , and he offered four hundred dollars to Edwards if he would go after them and bring them back . Edwards asked my advice , and I encouraged him to go , telling him how to take and bring back his prisoners . " ( Reflective pause . ) " You ca n't imagine me living alone , now , can you ? Such an egotistical fellow as I am , and fond of ladies ' society . You ca n't believe it , can you ? " " Hermits and solitaires are always egotists , I believe . As to the ladies , your loneliness was the result of circumstances , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed Edwards a good deal , if it had not been for some singular incidents which happened during his absence . " Ela always accented the last syllable of any word ending in e-n-t , like " incident " or " commencement , " giving it besides a peculiar nasal sound , which was sure to secure the attention . The word incident , as he pronounced it , produced quite a different effect from the same word , spoken in the usual style . " A man came to my fort one day who was naked and starving . He was a bad-looking fellow ; but a man naturally does look bad when his clothes are in rags , and his bones protruding through his skin . I clothed him , fed him , cared for him kindly , until he was able to travel , and then he went away . The next Sunday , I was sitting outside the stockade , as customary , reading some translations of the Greek poets , when , on raising my eyes from the book to glance over the approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , I had not seen a woman for a year and half ! She was slowly advancing , riding with superb grace a horse of great beauty and value , richly caparisoned . She came slowly up the trail , as if to give me time for thought , and I needed it . That picture is still indelibly impressed upon my mind ; the very flicker of the sunlight and shadow across the road , and the glitter of her horse 's trappings , as he champed his bit and arched his neck with impatience at her restraining hand --  --  . Are you very tired ? " asked Ela , suddenly . " Never less so in my life ; pray go on . " " You see I had been alone so long , and I am very susceptible . That vision coming upon me suddenly as it did , in my solitude , gave me the strangest sensations I ever had . I was spell-bound . Not so she . Reining in her horse beside me , she squared around in her saddle , as if asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her down , and she accepted my invitation into the fort , signifying , at the same time , that she wished me to attend to stripping and feeding her horse . This gave us mutually an opportunity to prepare for the coming interview . " When I returned to my guest , she had laid aside her riding-habit and close sun-bonnet , and stood revealed a young , beautiful , elegantly-dressed woman . To my unaccustomed eyes , she looked a goddess . Her figure was noble ; her eyes large , black , and melting ; her hair long and curling ; her manner easy and attractive . She was hungry , she said ; would I give her something to eat ? And , while I was on hospitable cares intent , she read to me some of my Greek poems , especially an ode of one of the votaries of Diana , with comments by herself . She was a splendid reader . Well , " said Ela , slowly , with a furtive glance at me , and in his peculiar nasal tones , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , as I was , and who had been disappointed and jilted as I had been , enjoyed this sort of thing or not . It was n't in my line , you see , this entertaining goddesses ; though , doubtless , in this way , before now , men have entertained angels unawares . You shall judge whether I did . " What with reading , eating together , singing -- she sang ' Kate Kearney ' for me , and her voice was glorious -- our acquaintance ripened very fast . Finally , I conquered my embarrassment so far as to ask her some questions about herself , and she told me that she was of a good New England family , raised in affluence , well educated , accomplished , but by a freak of fortune , reduced to poverty : that she had come to California resolved to get money , and had got it . She went from camp to camp of the miners with stationery , and other trifling articles needed by them ; sold them these things , wrote letters for them , sang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express to San Francisco , to be mailed . For all these services , she received high prices , and had also had a good deal of gold given to her in specimens . I asked her if she liked that kind of a life , so contrary to her early training . She answered me : ' It 's not what we choose that we select to do in this world , but what chooses us to do it . I have made a competency , and gained a rich and varied experience . If life is not what I once dreamed it was , I am content . ' But she sighed as she said it , and I could n't believe in her content . " " You have not told us yet what motives brought her to you , " I remarked , in an interval of silence . " No ; she had n't told me herself , then . By and by , I asked her , in my green kind of way , what brought her to see me . I never shall forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were sitting quite close : it never was in my nature , when once acquainted with a woman , to keep away from her . Her garments brushed my knees ; occasionally , in the enthusiasm of talk , I leaned near her cheek . You know how it was . I was thinking of the useless pegs in my house down in the valley : ' You will be disappointed , ' she said , ' when you learn that I came to do you a real service . ' And then she went on to relate that , having occasion to pass the night at a certain place not many miles away , she had overheard through the thin partitions of the house , the description of my fort , an account of my wealth , real or supposed , and a plan for my murder and robbery . The would-be murderer was so described as to make it quite certain that it was he whom I had fed , clothed , and sent away rejoicing , only a few days previous . I was inclined to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into belief and humility at once by the majesty with which she reproved my unbelief : ' A woman does not trifle with subjects like this ; nor go out of her way to tell travelers tales . I warn you . Good bye . ' " After this she would not stay , though I awkwardly expressed my regret at her going . By her command I saddled her horse , and helped her mount him . Once in the saddle , her humor turned , and she reminded me that I had not invited her to return . She said she ' could fancy that a week of reading , talking , riding , trout-fishing , and romancing generally , up there in those splendid woods , might be very charming . Was I going to ask her to come ? ' " I did n't ask her . A young man with a reputation to sustain up there in the mountains , could n't invite a young lady to come and stop a week with him , could he ? I must have refused to invite her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which Ela put these questions , and the plaintive appeal against the hard requirements of social laws in the mountains , which was expressed in his voice and accent , were so indescribably ludicrous that both my husband and myself laughed convulsively . " I never tell my wife that part of the story , for fear she might not believe in my regard for appearances , knowing how fond I am of ladies ' society . And the struggle was great ; I assure you , it was great . " So she went away . As she rode slowly down the trail , she turned and kissed her hand to me , with a gesture of such grace and sweetness that I thrilled all over . I 've never been able to quite forgive myself for what happened afterward . She came back , and I drove her away ! Usually , when I tell that to women , they call me mean and ungrateful ; but a young man living alone in the mountains has his reputation to look after -- now , has n't he ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always say I did do . It was the right thing to do under the circumstances , was n't it ? " While we had our laugh out , Ela shifted position , shook himself , and thridded his soft , light hair with his slender fingers . He was satisfied with his success in conveying an impression of the sort of care he took of his reputation . " Now , then , I was left alone again , in no pleasant frame of mind . I could n't doubt what my beautiful visitant had told me , and the thought of my murder all planned out was depressing , to say the least of it . But , as sure as I am telling you , the departure of my unknown friend depressed me more than the thought of my possible murder . The gate barred for the night , I sat and looked into my fire for hours , thinking wild thoughts , and hugging to my lonely bosom an imaginary form . The solitude and the sense of loss were awful . " This was Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four mounted men , one of whom was my former naked and hungry protege . He did not now try to conceal his character from me , but said he was going down to clean out the Chinese camp , and proposed to me to join him , saying that when Edwards returned with the horses we would pay him the $400 , as agreed by Sam Chong Lung . I was on my guard ; but told him I would have nothing to do with robbing the Chinese ; that they were my friends and customers , and he had better let them alone ; after which answer he went off . That afternoon , Edwards came in with his prisoners and horses . He was very tired , on account of having traveled at night , to prevent the rescue of his prisoners by other vagabonds , and to avoid the Indians . " You will understand how the presence of the horses increased my peril , as there was no doubt the scoundrels meant to take them . It would n't do either to let Edwards go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait another day . We brought the prisoners , bound , inside the fort , and took care of the horses . I said nothing to Edwards of my suspicions . " About dusk , my expected visitor came . He appeared to have been drinking ; and , after some mumbling talk , laid down inside the fort , near the gate . I made the gate fast , driving the big wooden pins home with an axe ; built up a great fire , and sent Edwards to bed in the tent . The Chinese prisoners were already asleep on the ground . Then I sat down on the opposite side of the fire , facing the gate , placed my double-barreled rifle beside me , and mounted guard . " " Had you no arms but your rifle ? " asked my husband , anxiously . " I wanted none other , for we understood each other -- my rifle and I. " " What were you looking for ; what did you expect ? A hand-to-hand encounter with these men ? " was my next inquiry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fort . If so , his associates would be waiting outside for a signal . He had intended , when he laid down close to the gate , to open it to them ; but when I drove the pins in so tight , I caught a gleam from his eyes that was not a drunken one , and he knew that I suspected him . After that , it was a contest of skill and will between us . He was waiting his opportunity , and so was I. " You think I 've a quick ear , do n't you ? You see what my temperament is ; all sense , all consciousness . My hearing was cultivated , too , by listening for Indians . Well , by and by , I detected a very stealthy movement outside the fort , and then a faint chirrup , such as a young squirrel might make . In an instant the drunken man sprang up ; and I covered him with my rifle , cocked . He saw the movement and drew his pistol , but not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or DIE . " It is impossible to convey , by types , an idea of Ela 's manner or tone as he pronounced these last words . They sounded from the bottom of his chest , and conveyed in the utterance a distinct notion that death was what was meant . Hearing him repeat the command , it was easy to believe that the miscreant dared not do more than hesitate in his obedience . After a moment 's silence -- which was the climax to his rendering of the scene -- he continued : " I have n't told you , yet , how the man looked . He was a tall , swarthy , black-bearded fellow , who might have been handsome once , but who had lost the look which distinguishes men in sympathy with their kind ; so that then he resembled some cruel beast , in the shape of a man , yet whose disguise fitted him badly . His eyes burned like rubies , out of the gloomy caverns under his shaggy eyebrows . His lips were drawn apart , so that his teeth glistened . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , was Hate and Murder . " My eye never winked , while he hesitated . He saw that , and it made him quail . With my finger on the trigger , I kept my rifle leveled , while he threw down his arms -- pistols and knife -- with a horrible oath . With the knife in his hand , he made a movement , as if he would rush on me ; but changed his purpose in time to stop my fire . His cursing was awful ; the foam flew from his mouth . He demanded to be let out of the fort ; accused me of bad intentions toward him , and denounced me for a robber and murderer . To all his ravings I had but one answer : To be quiet , to obey me , and he might live ; dare to disobey me , and he should die . " I directed him to sit down on the opposite side of the fire -- not to move from that one spot -- not to make a doubtful motion . And then I told him I knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he became convinced of this , he broke down utterly , and wept like a child , declaring that now he knew my pluck , and I had been the first man ever to get the best of him , he loved me like a brother ! " There was a long night before us , and I had got to sit there , with my rifle across my knees , till morning . I could move a little , to stir up or add to the fire ; but he could have no liberty whatever . The restraint was horrible to him . One moment he laughed uneasily -- another cursed or cried . It was a strange scene , was n't it ? Finally , to pass the time , I asked him to relate the history of his life . He wanted first to shake hands , for the love he bore me . Touching my rifle , significantly , I pointed to a stick lying across the fire between us . ' That is our boundary line ; do n't go to reaching your hands over that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenness . " We must have remained thus silent until near midnight . Several times I observed him listening to slight sounds outside the fort . But his associates must have given up the game and gone off , for , as the morning hours approached , he ceased to listen , and everything remained quiet . His head was bent forward , his chin resting on his breast , the shaggy beard spreading over it like a mantle . " " How horrible it must have been to keep such company . Why not call on Edwards ? " " The boy was worn out , and there was no need . I was very much strung up , too ; so that the exhaustion of sleeplessness , fatigue , or excitement was not felt or noticed . But he suffered . He was like a hyena caged , though he showed it only by involuntary movements and furtive glances . Finally , he could bear it no longer , and entreated me piteously , abjectly , to give him his freedom or blow out his brains . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he knew how to get his brains blown out , if he desired it . Then followed more execration , ending in renewed protestations of regard for me . I reminded him that talking would relieve the irksomeness of his position , again inviting him to tell me his history . He replied that if he talked about himself , he would be sure to get excited and move about ; but I promised to remind him . " Once on the subject of himself , it seemed to have a fascination for him . What he told me was , in substance , this : He had been honestly raised , by good , affectionate parents , in the State of Missouri ; loved a young girl in the town where he lived ; and , wishing to marry her , had resolved to go to California , to make the necessary money , quickly . He was successful ; returned full of joyful anticipations , and arrived at an old neighbor 's , a few miles from his home , having hardly tasted food or taken any rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some breakfast and listened to the friendly gossip of his entertainers , one name , the name of her he loved , his promised wife , was mentioned . She was married . He staggered to his feet , asking the name of her husband ; and when he heard it , he knew he had been betrayed by that man . He could recall a strange sensation in his brain , as if molten lead had been poured into it ; that was the last of his recollections . Afterward , he learned that he had been weeks in a brain fever . " When he had recovered , some of his old friends , thinking to do him honor , made an evening party for him . To this party came his love , and her husband ; his betrayer . When she gave her hand to welcome him home , and looked in his eyes , he knew that she too had been betrayed . Again the molten lead seemed poured upon his brain . Turning to leave the room , fate placed in his path the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow of a knife , he laid him dead at his feet . A few hours later , in the desperation of trying to escape , he killed two other men . Then he eluded his pursuers , and got back to California . Since then he had reveled in murder , and every species of crime . Once he had seen , in the streets of Sacramento , the woman he loved . Up to that moment , it had never occurred to him that she was free . Following her to her home , he forced himself into her house , and reminded her of their former relations . She had denied all knowledge of him , finally calling upon her husband to satisfy him . The husband ordered him out of the house , and he shot him . Then the Vigilantes made it hazardous to remain in California . He fled to the mountains , where he was nearly starved out , when I took him in and fed and clothed him . " Such was his story . My blood curdled in my veins , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In God 's name , ' I said , ' who are you -- what is your name ? ' ' I am BOONE HELM . ' " " Who was Boone Helm ? " I asked . " One of the greatest desperadoes that ever was on this coast . He met his fate , afterward , up east of the mountains . " " What did you do with him ? What could you do with him ? " " You ought to have shot him while you had him , " my husband suggested . " I did n't want to shoot him . He said , if I had been a coward , I would have killed him . To confess the truth , the wretch appealed to my sympathies . I do n't think he had ever been sane since the time when he felt the ' molten lead poured into his brain . ' I knew somebody was sure to kill him , before long ; so , when morning came , I called Edwards to open the gate ; and , when it was unbarred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not room enough in that part of the country for both of us , and that the next time I pointed my rifle at him it would be to shoot . I never saw him again . " " Then he did not molest the Chinese camp ? " " No . Edwards got his four hundred dollars , and went home to Boston . " There fell a silence upon us , and , through my open door , I could see that the cabin was nearly deserted . Ela seemed wearied -- sighed , and made a movement , as if to go . " What about your Guardian Angel ? " my husband asked . " You have not told us about her second coming . " " I always say that she did n't come ; or else I say that she came , and I drove her away . That is proper ; is n't it , now ? " glancing at me . " But I want to know if you have seen her -- if you never met her anywhere in the world -- since that time . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I urged , laughingly . " How do you feel , now ? " with a light laugh and peculiar change of expression . " O , better ; a great deal better . To be perfectly cured , I only need to hear the sequel . " " I may as well tell it , I suppose . It has been running in my head all day . Would n't want my wife to know it . Did n't think of meeting her when I came down to ' Frisco . You see , I 've been in Oregon a long while -- never traveled on a railroad in my life -- wanted to see something of the great outside world -- and so , ran down to the great city to see the sights . The first thing I did , I went up to Colfax , on the cars ; and while I was up there , the engineer invited me to take a ride on the engine -- a special one . Now , I knew that he meant to astonish me , because he thought I was green ; and I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we came down the grade with a speed that was ter-rif-ic !  - -  more than a mile a minute , the engineer said . When we got to Lincoln , the fellow asked me , with his superior sort of smile , ' How I liked that rate of travel ? ' I told him I liked that pretty well ; ' but , I suppose , when you want to make time , you can travel at a considerably more accelerated rate of locomotion ? ' " How we laughed at the natural drollery of the man , the deliberate utterance , the unsophisticated air . While we laughed , he prepared himself to finish his story . " It was only day before yesterday , " he said , " that I met her . I happened to be in the parlor of the hotel when she came in . At first , I was n't certain of its being her ; but , as I watched her , I became certain of it . And she recognized me ; I felt certain of that , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had to wait until the people in the parlor would disperse . She saw what I was waiting for , and stayed , too ; she told me with her eyes that she remembered . After a while she went to the piano , and played and sang ' Kate Kearney . ' Then I was satisfied that she would not leave me before I had spoken to her . As soon as the opportunity came , we confessed ourselves . " " Was she married ? was she happy ? " " She was married , yes . Happy ? she told me , as she had once before , that she was ' content . ' She said it with a sigh , as she did the first time ; and I doubted her as I did then . But they are putting out the lights . There is always , in this world , somebody going around , putting out our lights . Good-night . " " Good-night . " ON THE SANDS . I was summering at our Oregon Newport , known to us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninstructed in the geography and topography of this portion of the Pacific coast , dropped down among us , his impression would have been that he had alighted in a military encampment , very happily chosen , as military encampments usually are . Given , one long , low , whitewashed house enclosed by whitewashed pickets ; a group of tents outside the enclosure and on the bank of a beautiful graveled-bottom , tree-shadowed stream , and you have the brief summing up of accommodations for summer visitors at Clatsop . The plentiful sprinkling of army buttons among the guests -- for there are two forts within a three hours ' ride of this beach -- tend to confirm the impression of military possession . Besides , our host of the whitewashed hotel is a half-breed ; and there is enough of the native element hanging about the place , picking berries and digging clams , to suggest an Indian family where a temporary station might be demanded . It would only be by peeping inside those tents where ladies and children are more numerous than bearded men , that one could be convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , one need not press inside to find them , for the gay campers are sauntering about in all directions , ladies with their escorts , children with their nurses , parties returning from boating or fishing , or riding or bathing : everybody living out in the open air the whole day through on one pretense or another , and only repairing to the hotel at meal times , when the exquisite dishes prepared by French half-breeds suffer the most instant demolition -- such hunger does open air inspire . I had come here just invalid enough to be benefited by our primitive style of living ; not too delicate to endure it , nor too robust to enjoy the utter vagabondism of it . There had been no necessity upon us to ape fashionable manners ; no obligation to dress three times a day ; no balls to weary ourselves with at night . Therefore this daily recurring picnic was just sufficient for our physical recreation , while our mental powers took absolute rest . For weeks I had arisen every morning to a breakfast of salmon-trout . French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh berries ; and afterwards to wander about in the cool sea-fog , well wrapped up in a water-proof cloak . Sometimes we made a boating party up the lovely Neah-can-a-cum , pulling our boat along under the overhanging alders and maples , frightening the trout into their hiding-places under the banks , instead of hooking them as was our ostensible design . The limpid clearness of the water seemed to reflect the trees from the very bottom , and truly made a medium almost as transparent as air , through which the pebbles at the greatest depth appeared within reach of our hands . A morning idled away in this manner , and an afternoon spent in seeing the bathers -- I never trust my easily curdled blood to the chill of the sea -- and in walking along the sands with a friend , or dreaming quietly by myself as I watched the surf rolling in all the way from Tilamook Head to Cape Disappointment , these were my daily labors and recreations . The arrival of a bundle of letters , or , still better , of a new visitor , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these excitements in one day . One of my correspondents had written : " I hope to see you soon , and to have the opportunity , long sought , of telling you some of the experiences of my early life . When I promised you this I had not anticipated the pleasure of talking over the recollections of my youth while listening with you to the monotone of the great Pacific , whose ' ever , forever ' is more significant to me than to most lovers of its music . I never gaze upon its restless waves , nor hear the sound of their ripple on the sands , or their thunder on the rocks without being reminded of one episode in my life peculiarly agitating to remember ; but perhaps when I have told it to you , you may have power to exercise the restless spirit which rises in me at the recollection . " So here was promise of the intellectual aliment I had begun to crave after all these weeks of physical , without mental , action . I folded my letter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of a newly arrived party for whom our half-breed host was spreading a tent , and placing in it rather an extra amount of furniture ; for , be it known to the uninitiated , we had platform floors under our tents , real bedsteads , dressing-bureaus , rugs , and other comforts to match . That our new arrival exceeded us in elegant conveniences was , of course , duly noted by such idlers as we . The party consisted of a lady , a little girl of ten , and a Kanaka servant . The lady 's name , we learned , was Mrs. Sancy , and she was from the Sandwich Islands . More than that no one was informed . We discussed her looks , her manners , her dress , and her probable circumstances , as we sat around the camp-fire that evening , after the way of idle people . It occurred to me , as I glanced toward her tent door , illuminated by our blazing fire , and saw her regarding the weird scene with evident admiration of its picturesqueness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us eat roast potatoes -- roasted as they cook pigs in the Islands , by covering up in the ground with hot stones . The fact that the potatoes , and the butter which went with them , were purloined from our host 's larder , gave a special flavor to the feast -- accompanied as it was , too , by instrumental and vocal music , and enlivened by sallies of wit . Mrs. Sancy seemed to enjoy the novelty of her surroundings , contributing her quota to the general fund of mirth and sparkling talk , and I congratulated myself on having acquired an interesting acquaintance , whose cheerfulness , notwithstanding the partial mourning of her dress , promised well for its continuance . Had she been sad or reserved she certainly would not have been sought as she was by our pleasure-loving summer idlers , consequently my chances of becoming intimate with her would have been greatly abridged . As she was , she soon became , without question , one of the chief social attractions ; easily falling into our vagabond ways , yet embellishing them with so much grace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new charm imparted to them . All the things any of us could do , Mrs. Sancy could do better ; and one thing she could do that none of the rest of us could , which was to swim out and float herself in on a surf-board , like a native island woman ; and seeing Mrs. Sancy do this became one of the daily sensations of Clatsop Beach . I had known Mrs. Sancy about one week , and came to like her extremely , not only for her brilliant , social qualities , but on account of her native originality of thought , and somewhat peculiar culture . I say peculiar , because her thinking and reading seemed to be in the byways rather than the highways of ordinary culture . If she made a figure of speech , it was something noticeably original ; if she quoted an author , it was one unfamiliar though forcible . And so she constantly supplied my mind with novelties which I craved , and became like a new education to me . One forenoon , a misty one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in water-proofs , pacing up and down the sands , and watching the grey sullen sea , or admiring the way in which the masses of fog roll in among the tops of the giant firs on Tilamook Head , and were torn into fragments , and tangled among them . " You never saw the like of this in the islands ? " I said , meaning the foggy sea , and the dark , fir-clad mountains . " I have seen this before ; " she answered , waving her hand to indicate the scene as we then beheld it . " You look surprised , but I am familiar with every foot of this ground . I have lived years in this neighborhood -- right over there , in fact , under the Head . This spot has , in truth , a strong fascination for me , and it was to see it once more that I made the voyage . " " You lived in this place , and liked it years ago ! How strange ! It is but a wilderness still , though a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playfully superior smile : " We are apt to think ourselves the discoverers of every country where we chance to be set down ; and so Adam thought he was the first man on the earth , though his sons went out and found cities where they learned the arts of civilization . So birth , and love , and death , never cease to be miracles to us , notwithstanding the millions who have been born , and loved , and died , before our experience began . " " But how did it happen , " I urged , unable to repress my curiosity , " that you lived here , in this place , years ago ? That seems so strange to me . " " My parents brought me here when a little child . It is a common enough history . My mother was an enthusiast with brain , who joined her fortunes to those of an enthusiast without brain , and emigrated to this coast , when it was an Indian country , in the vain hope of doing good to the savages . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harm to the savages also . The spirit of the man became embittered , and the mean traits of his nature asserted themselves , and wreaked their malice , as is customary with mean natures , on the nearest or most inoffensive object . My poor mother ! Maternity was marred for you by fear and pain and contempt ; and whatever errors your child has fallen into , were an evil inheritance that only years of suffering and discipline could eradicate . " As Mrs. Sancy pronounced the last sentence , she seemed for the moment to have forgotten my presence , and stood , looking off over the calm grey sea , with absent unrecognizing gaze . After a brief silence she turned to me with a smile : " Pardon my mental desertion . It is not good to talk of our own lives . We all become Adams again , and imagine ourselves sole in the universe . " On this hint I changed the conversation , and we returned to the hotel to lunch , after which , I saw no more of Mrs. Sancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kittredge arrived ; and as it was bright and sunny after the fog , we took a boat , and pulled along under the alders that shade the Neah-can-a-cum . It was there that I listened to this story : " While I was still a young man , nearly fifteen years ago , I floated on this stream , as we are doing to-day . My companion was a young girl whom I shall call Teresa . She was very young , I remember now with sorrow , and very beautiful ; though beautiful is not so much the word to describe her as charming -- magnetic , graceful , intelligent . A lithe , rather tall figure , a high-bred , sensitive , fine face , and pleasing manners . She seemed older than she really was , on account of her commanding physique and distinguished manner . " I will not go over the details of our acquaintance , which ripened rapidly into love ;  - -  so I thought . This was a new country then , even more emphatically that it is now ; new with the charm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the case . Scattered around here within a radius of a dozen miles were half-a-dozen other young men like myself , who had immigrated to the far west , in the spirit of romantic adventure ; and once here , were forced to do whatever came to our hands to gain a subsistence . I lived on a farm which I improved , keeping house quite by myself , and spending my leisure hours in study . Of course , the other young men , similarly situated , often visited me , and we usually talked over authors , or such questions of the day as we were familiar with or interested in . " But one evening love was the theme of our conversation , and incidently , Teresa 's name was mentioned among us . I do n't know who first uttered it , but I observed at once , that the faces of all three of my companions betrayed an interest too strong and too peculiar to be attributed to an ordinary acquaintanceship with the subject of our remarks . For myself , I felt my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my consciousness , becoming on the instant , conviction too painful to endure . " You being a woman , can not imagine the situation . I believed myself to be Teresa 's accepted lover ; and so I knew intuitively , did all my three companions ; their faces revealing their thoughts to me , as did mine to them . Whatever you women do in the presence of your rivals , I know not . Men rage . It is not often , either , that a man encounters more than one rival at a time . But three ! each of us poor rivals saw three rivals before him . Whatever of friendship had hitherto existed among us was forgotten in the extreme anguish of the moment , and we sat glaring at each other in silence , with heaving chests and burning brows . " All but Charlie Darling -- darling Charlie , we used to call him -- his face was deathly white , and his eyes glowed like a panther 's in the dark . Yet he was the first to recover himself . ' Boys , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's name into the discussion ; but since Teresa 's has been mentioned , we may as well have an understanding . I consider the young lady as engaged to me , and you will please remember that fact when you are talking of her . ' " He said it bravely , proudly , though his lip trembled a little , but he eyed us unflinchingly . No one replied for some moments . Then Tom Allen , a big clumsy , good-hearted , but conceited fellow , lifted his eyes slowly , and answered with a hysterical laugh : ' You may be her darling Charlie , but I 'll be d --  -- d if I am not to be her husband ! ' " This was the match to the powder . Charlie , myself , and Harry King , each sprang simultaneously forward , as if we meant to choke poor Tom for his words . Again Charlie was the first to use reason : " ' Hold , boys ; ' cried he hoarsely ; ' let us take a little time to reflect . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us hear if she contemplates marrying King and Kittredge , also . What do you say , King ? ' " ' I say yes ! ' thundered King , bending his black brows , and bringing down his fist on the table by which he stood . " ' And I say , I contemplate marrying her , ' was my answer to Charlie 's challenge . " Charlie flung himself into a chair , and covered his face with his hands . The action touched some spring in our ruder natures which responded in sympathy for our favorite , and had the effect to calm us , in manner at least . I motioned the others to sit down , and addressed myself to Charlie Darling . ' See here , Charlie ? ' I said , ' it seems that Teresa has been playing us false . A girl who could be engaged to four young men at once can not be worth the regards of any of us . Let us investigate the matter , and if she is truly guilty of such falsehood , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanation . What do you say ? do you agree to that ? ' " ' How are you going to investigate ? ' asked Tom Allen , roughly . ' Have not we each declared that she was committed to us individually , and what more can be said ? ' " ' It appears incredible to me that any girl , much less a girl like Teresa , could so compromise her self-respect as to encourage four suitors , each in such a manner as that he expected to marry her . It is so strange that I can not believe it , except each man swears to his statement . Can we all swear to it ? ' " I laid my little pocket-bible on the table , and set the example of taking an oath to the effect that Teresa had encouraged me to believe that she meant to marry me . King and Allen followed with a similar oath . Charlie Darling was the last to take the oath ; but as he did so , a gleam of gladness broke over his pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ours . ' I swear before these witnesses and Almighty God , ' said Charlie , ' that Teresa Bryant is my promised wife . ' " ' That takes the wind out of our sails , ' remarked Allen . " ' Do you allow other men to kiss your promised wife ? ' asked King , with a sneer . " Charlie sprang at King , and had his hand on his throat in an instant ; but Allen and I interfered to part them . It was no difficult matter , for Darling , excited as he was , felt the force of my observations on the quarrel . I said : ' Shall a trifling girl make us enemies , when she has so behaved that no one of us can trust her . You , Darling , do not , can not have confidence in her promise , after all you have this night learned . You had best accept my first suggestion , and join with the rest of us in renouncing her forever and at once . ' " ' That I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her word is no better than her acts , and I have as much right to her as Charlie Darling , or either of you , and I 'll not give up the right to a man of you . ' " ' We 'll have to fight a four-cornered duel , ' remarked Tom Allen , beginning to see the ludicrous side of the affair . ' Shall we choose up , two on a side ? ' " ' I will withdraw my pretensions , ' I reiterated , ' if the others will do so , or even if King and Allen will quit the field to Charlie , who feels himself bound by Teresa 's promise to him . ' " ' I have said I would not withdraw , ' replied King , sullenly . And thus we contended , hot-browed and angry-voiced , for more than an hour . Then rough but practical Tom proposed a scheme , which was no less than to compel Teresa to decide between us . After long deliberation , an agreement was entered into , and I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was . " Kittredge paused , and looked at me doubtingly . I glanced aside at the over-hanging trees , the glints of sunshine on the bank , a brown bird among the leaves , at anything , rather than him , for he was living over again the excitement of that time , and his face was not pleasant to study . After a little waiting , I answered : " I must know the remainder of the story , since I know so much ; what did you agree upon ? " " A plan was laid by which Teresa should be confronted with her four lovers , and forced to explain her conduct . To carry out our design it was necessary to use artifice , and I was chosen as the one who should conduct the affair . I invited her to accompany me to a neighboring farm-house to meet the young folks of the settlement . There was nothing unusual in this , as in those primitive times great latitude was granted to young people in their social intercourse . To mount her horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single escort , not to return until far into the night , was the common privilege of any young lady , and therefore there was no difficulty about obtaining either her consent or that of her parents to my proposition . " We set off just at sunset , riding along the beach some distance , admiring the gorgeous western sky , the peaceful sea , and watching the sand-pipers skating out on the wet sands after every receding wave . I had never seen Teresa more beautiful , more sparkling , or more fascinating in every way ; and my heart grew ' very little ' as the Indians say . It was impossible to accuse her even in my thoughts , while under that bewitching influence . She was so full of life and vivacity that she did not observe the forced demeanor I wore , or if she did , had too much tact to seem to do so . As for me , guarded both by my hidden suspicions and by my promise to my friends , I uttered no word of tenderness or admiration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The road we were going led past my house . When we were almost abreast of it I informed Teresa that there were some of our friends waiting for us there , and invited her to alight . Without suspicion she did so.  - -   - -  Do n't look at me that way , if you can help it . It was terribly mean of us fellows , as I see it now . It looked differently then ; and we had none of us seen much of the world and were rude in our notions of propriety . " When she came inside of the house and saw only three men in place of the girls of her acquaintance she expected to meet , she cast a rapid , surprised glance all round , blushed , asked , ' where are the girls ? '  - -  all in the most natural manner . There was positively nothing in her deportment to betray a guilty conscience . I recognized that , and so , I could see , did Darling . He made haste to hand her a chair , which she declined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was getting nervous already over my share in the business , and so plunged at once into explanation . " ' Teresa , ' I said , ' we four fellows have made a singular discovery , recently , to the effect that we each believed himself to be your accepted lover . We have met together to hear your explanation . Is there a man in the house you are engaged to ? " " She gave one quick , scrutinizing glance at our faces , and read in them that we were in earnest . Indeed , the scene would have given scope to the genius of a Hogarth . Alternate red and white chased each other in quick succession over her brow , cheeks , neck . Her eyes scintillated , and her chest heaved . " ' Please answer us , Teresa , ' said Darling , after a most painful silence of a minute , which seemed an hour . " She raised her flashing eyes to his , and her tones seemed to stab him as she uttered , ' You ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made haste to leave us , but found the door guarded by Tom Allen . When she saw that she was really a prisoner among us , alarm seized her , and woman-like , she began to cry , but not passionately or humbly . Her spirit was still equal to the occasion , and she faced us with the tears running over her cheeks . " ' If there is a man among you with a spark of honor , open this door ! Mr. Kittredge , this is your house . Allow me to ask if I am to be retained a prisoner in it , or what you expect to gain by my forcible detention ? " " Tom Allen whispered something unheard by any save her , and she struck at him with her riding-whip . This caused both Darling and myself to interpose , and I turned door-keeper while Allen retreated to the other side of the room with rather a higher color than usual on his lumpish face . All this while -- not a long while , at all -- King had remained in sullen silence , scowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke : " ' Boys , ' said he , ' this joke has gone far enough , and if you will permit us to take our leave , I will see Miss Bryant safe home . ' " Involuntarily she turned toward the only one who proffered help ; but Darling and I were too angry at the ruse to allow him to succeed , and stood our ground by the door . ' You see , Teresa , how it is , ' continued King , glancing at us defiantly : ' these fellows mean to keep you a prisoner in this house until they make you do and say as they please . ' " ' What is it you wish me to do and say ? " asked Teresa , with forced composure . " ' We wish you to state , ' said I , hoarsely , ' whether or not you are or have been engaged to either of us . We want you to say it because we are all candidates for your favor , and because there is a dispute among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put an end to our quarrel , and secure to you the instant return of your liberty , if you will declare the truth . ' " At that she sank down on a chair and covered her face with her hands . After a little time she gathered courage and looked up at Darling and me . I observed , even then , that she took no notice of the others . ' If I am promised to either of you , you know it . But this I say now : if I were a hundred times promised , I would break that promise after such insult as you have all offered me this evening . Let me go ! ' " What Charlie Darling suffered all through the interview had been patent to each of us . When she delivered his sentence in tones so determined , a cry that was a groan escaped his colorless lips . To say that I did not writhe under her just scorn would be false . Tears , few , but hot and bitter , blinded my eyes . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her release . " ' You knew by this time , ' I said , ' that you had been deceived . ' " I felt by this time that I had been a fool -- a poor , coarse fool ; there had been treachery somewhere , and that all together we were a villainous lot . I was only hesitating about how to get out of the scrape decently , when Darling spoke in a voice that was hardly recognizable : " ' Teresa , we were engaged ; I told these others so before ; but they would not believe me . On the contrary , each one claims to have received such encouragement from you as to entitle him to be considered your favored lover . Hard as it was for me to believe such falsehood possible to you , two of these claimants insisted upon their rights against mine , and they overruled my judgment and wishes to such a degree that I consented to this trial for you . It has resulted in nothing except shame to us and annoyance to you ! I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Then she rose up and faced us all again with burning cheeks and flashing eyes . ' If any other man says I have given him a promise , or anything amounting to a promise , he lies . To Tom Allen I have always been friendly , and have romped with him at our little parties ; but to-night he grossly insulted me , and I will never speak to him again . As to Harry King , I was friendly with him , too , until about a fortnight ago he presumed to kiss me rudely , in spite of resistance , since which time I have barely recognized him . If Mr. Kittredge says I have made him any promises , he is unworthy of the great respect I have always had for him ; ' and with that last word she broke down , and sobbed as if her heart would break . But it was only for a few minutes that she cried -- she was herself again before we had recovered our composure . " ' What was it Tom Allen said to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' He said he would have me , if the rest did cast me off . Thank you , ' with a mocking courtesy to Allen . ' It is fortunate for you -- and for you all , that I have no " big brother . " ' " ' I beg you will believe no " big brother " could add to my punishment , ' Charlie answered ; and I felt included in the confession . Then he offered to see her home without more delay , but she declined any escort whatever , only requesting us to remain where we were until she had been gone half an hour ; and rode off into the moonlight and solitude unattended , with what feelings in her heart God knows . We all watched her until she was hidden from sight by the shadows of a grove of pines , and I still remember the shudder with which I saw her plunge recklessly into the gloom -- manlike , careful about her beautiful body , and not regarding her tender girl heart . " " That must have been a pleasant half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pleasant ! yes ; we were like a lot of devils chained . That night dissolved all friendships between any two of us , except between Darling and me ; and that could never be quite the same again , for had I not shown him that I believed myself a favored rival ? though I afterwards pretended to impute my belief to vanity . " " How did you account to yourself for the delusion ? Had she not flirted , as it is called , with you ? " " She had certainly caused me to be deluded , innocently or otherwise , into a belief that she regarded me with peculiar favor ; and I had been accustomed to take certain little liberties with her , which probably seemed of far greater importance to me than they did to her ; for her passional nature was hardly yet awakened , and among our primitive society there was no great restraint upon any innocent familiarities . " " What became of her after that night ?  - -  did she marry Darling ? " The answer did not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I could not bring myself to intrude the present upon it , but busied myself with the leaves and vines and mosses that I had snatched from the banks in passing , while my friend was absorbed in his silent reminiscences . " You have not heard the saddest part of the story yet , " he said at last , slowly and reluctantly . " She kept her word with each of us ; ignoring Allen and King entirely ; and only vouchsafing a passing word to Charlie and me . Poor Charlie was broken-hearted . He had never been strong , and now he was weak , ill ; in short , fell into a decline , and died in the following year . " " Did the story never get out ? " " Not the true story . That scoundrel King spread a rumor abroad which caused much mischief , and was most cruel after what we had done to outrage her feelings in the first instance ; but that was his revenge for her slight -- I never knew whether she regretted Darling or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died herself sooner than betray a regret for any one who had offended her . Her mother died , and her father took her away with him to the Sandwich Islands . It was said he was not kind to her , especially after her ' disgrace , ' as he called it . " " She never forgave you ? What do you know about her subsequent history ? " " Nothing of it . But she had her revenge for what went before . After she went to the Islands I wrote her a very full and perfect confession of my fault , and the extenuating circumstances , and offered her my love , with the assurance that it had always been hers . What do you think she wrote me in return ? Only this : that once she had loved me ; that she had but just made the discovery that she loved me , and not Charlie Darling , when we mutually insulted her as we did , and forced her to discard both of us ; for which she was not now sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , laughing lightly , to his embarrassment . " But to think of using a girl of sixteen like that ! " " You are in a self-accusing mood to-day . Let us talk of our neighbors . Bad as that practice is , I believe it is better than talking about ourselves :  - -  Mrs . Sancy thinks so , I know ? " " Who is Mrs. Sancy ? " " I will introduce you to-morrow . " Next to being principal in a romantic affaire de coeur is the excitement of being an interested third party . In consonance with this belief I laid awake most of the night imagining the possible and probable " conclusion of the whole matter . " I never doubted that Mrs. Sancy was Teresa , nor that she was more fascinating at thirty-one than she had been at sixteen : but fifteen years work great changes in the intellectual and moral person , and much as I desired to play the part of Fate in bringing these two people together , I was very doubtful about the result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogative of Fate , which by choosing its own instruments saved me all responsibility in the matter . As Mr. Kittredge messed with a party of military officers , and was off on an early excursion to unknown localities , I saw nothing of him the following morning . We were to ride on the beach after lunch , returning on the turn of the tide to see the bathers . Therefore no opportunity seemed likely to present itself before evening for the promised introduction . The afternoon proved fine , and we were cantering gaily along in the fresh breeze and sunshine , when another party appeared , advancing from the opposite direction , whom I knew to be Mrs. Sancy , her little daughter Isabelle , and the Kanaka servant . The child and servant were galloping hard , and passed us with a rush . But the lady seemed in a quieter mood , riding easily and carelessly , with an air of pre-occupation . Suddenly she too gave her horse whip and rein , and as she dashed past I heard her exclaim , " The quicksands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and followed . We rode hard for a few minutes , without overtaking her ; then slackened our speed on seeing her come up with the child , and arrest the race which had so alarmed her . " There are no quicksands in this direction ; " was the first remark of Kittredge when we could speak . " What should make her think so ? " " There were quicksands there a number of years ago , and by her manner she must have known it then . " " And by the same token , " I replied , " she can not have been here since the change . " " Who is she ? " " My friend , Mrs. Sancy . " " Where is she from ? " " From the quicksands ; " I replied evasively , as I saw the lady approaching us . " I fear you have shared my fright , " she said , as soon as she came within speaking distance . " When I used to be familiar with these sands there was a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as he does so many things ; " smiling , and bowing to my escort . " There are some things time never effaces , even from the sands , " returned Kittredge , growing visibly pale . " That is contrary to the poets , " laughingly she rejoined ; " but I believe the poets have been superseded by the scientists , who prove everything for you by a fossil . " I could not help watching her to learn how much or how little recognition there was in her face . The color came and went , I could perceive ; but whether with doubt or certainty I could not determine . I felt I ought to introduce them , but shrunk from helping on the denouement in that way . In my embarrassment I said nothing . We were now approaching the vicinity of the bathing-houses , and seeing the visitors collecting for the bath , an excuse was furnished for quickening our paces . Mrs. Sancy bowed and left us . Mr. Kittredge seemed to have lost the power of speech . Fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranks of the gayest of the crowd as they " jumped the rollers , " when Mrs. Sancy came out of a dressing-room , followed by her Kanaka with a surf-board . Her bathing-dress was very jaunty and becoming , and her skill as a swimmer drew to her a great deal of attention . To swim out and float in on the rollers seemed to be to her no more of a feat than it would be to a sea-gull , she did it so easily and gracefully . But to-day something went wrong with her . Either she was too warm from riding , or her circulation was disturbed by the meeting with Kittredge , or both ; at all events the second time she swam out she failed to return . The board slipped away from her , and she sank out of sight . While I gazed horror-stricken , scarce understanding what had taken place , a man rushed past me in his bathing clothes , running out to where the water was deep enough to float him , and striking out rapidly from there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was Kittredge . Fate had sent him . The incoming tide kept her where she sank , and he soon brought her to the surface and through the surf to the beach . I spread my cloak on the sand , and , wrapping her in it , began rubbing and rolling her , with the assistance of other ladies , for resuscitation from drowning . In three minutes more Kittredge was kneeling by my side with a brandy-flask , administering its contents drop by drop , and giving orders . " It is congestion , " said he . " You must rub her chest , her back , her hands and feet ; so , so . She will die in your hands if you are not quick . For God 's sake , work fast ! " By his presence of mind she was saved as by a miracle . When she was removed to her lodgings , and able to converse , she asked me who it was that had rescued her . " Mr. Kittredge , " I said . " The same I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled in a faint , half-dreaming way , and turned away her face . She thought I did not know her secret . I am not going to let my hero take advantage of the first emotion of gratitude after a service , to mention his wishes in , as many story-tellers do . I consider it a mean advantage ; besides Mr. Kittredge did not do it . In fact , he absented himself for a week . When he returned , I introduced him formally to Mrs. Sancy , and we three walked together down to the beach , and seated ourselves on a white old cottonwood that had floated out of the Columbia river , and been cast by the high tides of winter above the shelving sands . We were rather a silent party for a few minutes . In his abstraction , Mr. Kittredge reached down and traced a name in the sand with the point of my parasol stick -- TERESA . Then , seeing the letters staring at him , he looked up at her , and said , " I could not brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " Her gaze wandered away , out to sea , up towards the Capes , down toward the Head ; and a delicate color grew upon her cheek . " It has scarcely changed in fifteen years , " she said . " I did not count on finding all things the same . " With that I made a pretense of leaving them , to seek shells along the beach ; for I knew that fate could no longer be averted . When I returned she was aware that I possessed the secret of both , and she smiled upon me a recognition of my right to be pleased with what I saw ; what I beheld seeming the prelude to a happy marriage . That night I wrote in my diary , after some comments on my relations with Mr. Kittredge : " It is best to be off with the old love , Before you are on with the new . " AN OLD FOOL . PART I. The annual rain-fall on the lower Columbia River is upward of eighty inches -- often almost ninety ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , from November to March , generally the least intermittent in December . I mention this climatic fact , the better to be understood in attempting to describe a certain December afternoon in the year 186- . It lacked but two days of Christmas , and the sun had not shone out brightly for a single hour in three weeks . On this afternoon the steady pour from the clouds was a strong reminder of the ancient deluge . Between the rain itself and the mist which always accompanies the rain-fall in Oregon , the world seemed nearly blotted out . Standing on the wharf at Astoria , the noble river looked like a great gray caldron of steaming water , evaporating freely at 42 deg .. The lofty highlands on the opposite shore had lost all shape , or certain altitude . The stately forest of firs along their summits were shrouded in ever-changing masses of whitish-gray fog . Nothing could be seen of the light-house on the headland at the mouth of the river ; nothing of Tongue Point , two miles above Astoria ; and only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of it . Even the old Astorians , used to this sort of weather and not disliking it , having little to do in the winter time , and being always braced up by sea-airs that even this fresh-water flood could not divest of their tonic flavor -- these old sea-dogs , pilots , fishermen , and other amphibia , were constrained at last to give utterance to mild growls at the persistent character of the storm . A crowd of these India-rubber clad , red-cheeked , and , alas ! too often red-nosed old men of the sea , had taken shelter in the Railroad Saloon -- called that , apparently , because there was no railroad then within hundreds of miles -- and were engaged in alternate wild railings at the weather , reminiscences of other storms , and whisky-drinking ; there being an opinion current among these men that water-proof garments alone did not suffice to keep out the all-prevailing wet . " If ' twant that we 're so near the sea , with a good wide sewage of river to carry off the water , we should all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rumway , a bar pilot , whose dripping hat-rim and general shiny appearance gave point to his remark . " You ca n't count on the sea to befriend you this time , Captain . Better git yer ark alongside the wharf ; fur we 're goin ' to hev the Columbia runnin ' up stream to-night , sure as you 're born . " " Hullo ! Is that you , Joe Chillis ? What brought you to town in this kind o ' weather ? And what do you know about the tides ?  - -  that 's my business , I calculate . " " Mebbe it is ; and mebbe a bar pilot knows more about the tides nor a mountain man . But there 'll be a rousin ' old tide to-night , and a sou'wester , to boot ; you bet yer life on that ! " " I 'll grant you thet a mountain man knows a heap thet other men do n't . But I 'll never agree thet he can tell me anything about my business . Take a drink , Joe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarns . " " Thankee ; do n't keer ef I do . I ca n't stop to spin yarns , tho ' , this evenin ' . I 've got to git home . It wo n't be easy work pullin ' agin the tide an hour or two from now . " " What 's your hurry ? " " A story -- a story ! " " Let 's make a night of it . " " O , come , Joe , you are not wanted at home . Cabin wo n't run away ; wife wo n't scold . " " Stop along ov us till mornin ' ; " were the various rather noisy and ejaculatory remarks upon Chillis 's avowed intention of abandoning good and appreciative company , without stopping to tell one of his ever-ready tales of Indian and bear fighting in the Rocky Mountains thirty years before . " Why , you ai n't goin ' out again till you 've shaken off the water , Joe . You 're dripping like a Newfoundland ; " said Captain Rumway , as Chillis put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had entered not five minutes before . This thoughtfulness for his comfort , however , only meant , " Stay till you 've taken another drink , and then maybe you will tell us a story ; " and Chillis knew the bait well enough to decline it . " Thankee , Captain . One bucketful more or less wo n't make no difference . I 'm wet to the skin now . Thank ye all , gentlemen ; I 've got business to attend to this evenin ' . Have any of you seen Eb Smiley this arternoon ? "  - -  looking back , with his hand on the door-knob . " I 'd like to speak to him afore I leave , ef you can tell me whar to find him . " " You 'll find him in there , " answered the bar-tender , crooking his thumb toward a room leading out of the saloon , containing a tumbled single-bed and a wooden settee , besides various masculine bijouterie in the shape of boots , old and new , clean and dirty ; candle and cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief ornament of which was a black-looking derringer ; coats , vests , fishing-tackle ; and cheap prints , adorning the walls in the wildest disregard of effect -- except , indeed , the effect aimed at were chaos . Into this apartment Chillis unceremoniously thrust himself through the half-open door , frowning as darkly as his fine and pleasant features would admit of , and muttering to himself , " Damme , I thought as much . " On the wooden settee reclined a man thirty years his junior -- Chillis was over sixty , though he did not look it -- sleeping the heavy , stupid sleep of intoxication . The old hunter did not stand upon ceremony , nor hesitate to invade the sleeper 's privacy , but marched up to the settee , his ragged old blanket-coat dripping tiny streams from every separate tatter , and proceeded at once roughly to arouse the drunken man by a prolonged and vigorous shaking . " Wha'er want ? Lemme ' lone , " grumbled Smiley , only dimly conscious of what was being said or done to him . " Get up , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along home . Your wife is needin ' ye . Go home and take care of her and the boy . Come along -- d'ye hear ? " But the sleeper 's brain was impervious to sound or sense . He only muttered , in a drowsy whisper , " Lemme ' lone , " a few times , and went off into a deeper stupor than before . " You miserable cuss , " snarled Chillis , in his wrath , " be d --  -- d to you , then ! Drink yerself to death , ef you want to -- the sooner the better ; " and , with this parting adjuration , and an extra shake , the old mountain man , who had drank barrels of alcohol himself with comparative immunity from harm , turned his back upon this younger degenerate victim of modern whisky , and strode out of the room and the house , without stopping to reply to the renewed entreaties of his friends to remain and " make a night of it . " Making directly for the wharf , where his boat was moored , half filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , dropping the oars into the row-locks , bent to the work before him ; for the tide was already beginning to run up , and the course he had to take brought him dead against it for the first two or three miles , after which the tide would be with him , and , if there should not be too much sea , the labor of impelling the boat would be materially lessened . The lookout from a small boat was an ugly one at three o'clock of this rainy December afternoon . A dense , cold fog had been rolling in from the sea for the last half hour , and the wind was rising with the tide . Under the shelter of the hills at the foot of which Astoria nestled , the wind did not make itself felt ; but once past " The Point , " and in the exposed waters of Young 's Bay , the south-westers had a fair sweep of the great river , of which the bay is only an inlet . One of these dreaded storms was preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he now saw by the way in which the mist was being blown off the face of the river , and the " white-caps " came instead . Before he arrived off the Point he laid down his oars , and , taking out of his coat-pocket a saturated yellow cotton handkerchief , proceeded to tie his old soft felt hat down over his ears , and otherwise make ready for a struggle with wind and water -- neither of them adversaries to be trifled with , as he knew . Not a minute too soon , either ; for , just when he had resumed the oars , the boat , having drifted out of her course , was caught by a wave and a blast on its broadside , and nearly upset . " Steady , little gal , " said Chillis , bringing his boat round , head to the wind . " None o ' your capers now . Thar is serious work on hand , an ' I want you to behave better'n ever you did afore . It 's you an ' me , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he pressed his lips together grimly , and peered out from under his bent old hat at the storm which was driving furiously against his broad breast , and into his white , anxious face , almost blinding and strangling him . His boat was a small one -- too small for the seas of the lower Columbia -- but it was trim and light , and steered easily . Besides , the old mountaineer was a skilled oarsman , albeit this accomplishment was not a part of the education of American hunters and trappers , as it was of the French voyageurs . Keeping his little craft head to the wind , he took each wave squarely on the prow , and with a powerful stroke of the oars cut through it , or sprang over it , and then made ready for the next . Meanwhile , the storm increased , the rain driving at an angle of 45 deg. , and in sheets that flapped smotheringly about him like wet blankets , and threatened to swamp his boat without assistance from the waves . It was growing colder , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect him from the chill that comes with a south-wester ; nor was the grip of the naked hands upon the oars stimulating to the circulation of his old blood through the swollen fingers . But old Joe Chillis had a distinct comprehension of the situation , and felt himself to be master of it . He had gone over to Astoria that day , not to drink whisky and tell stories , but to do a good turn for the " White Rose . " Failing in his purpose , he was going back again , at any cost , to make up for the miscarriage of that effort . Death itself could not frighten him ; for what was the Columbia in a storm to the dangers he had passed through in years of hunting and trapping in the Rocky Mountains ? He had seemed to bear a charmed life then ; he would believe that the charm had not deserted him . But , O , how his old arms ached ! and the storm freshening every minute , with two miles further to row , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the wind was against the tide , and made an ugly sea . If he only could reach the mouth of the creek before dark . If he could ? Why , he must . The tide would be up so that he could not find the entrance in the dark . He worked resolutely -- worked harder than ever -- but he did not accomplish so much , because his strength was giving out . When he first became aware of this , he heaved a great sigh , as if his heart were broken , then pressed his lips together as before , and peered through the thick gray twilight , looking for the creek 's mouth while yet there was a little light . He was now in the very worst part of the bay , where the current from Young 's River was strongest , setting out toward the Columbia , and where the wind had the fairest sweep , blowing from the coast across the low Clatsop plains . Only the tide and his failing strength were opposed to these ; would they enable him to hold his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was all in vain , and directly the catastrophe came . His strength wavered , the boat veered round , a sudden gust and roll of water took it broadside , and over she went , keel up , more than a mile from land . But this was not the last of Joe Chillis -- not by any manner of means . He had trapped beaver too many years to mind a ducking more or less , if he only had his strength . So , when he came up , he clutched an oar that was floating past him , and looked about for the boat . She was not far off -- the tide was holding her , bobbing up and down like a cork . In a few minutes she was righted , and Chillis had scrambled in , losing his oar while doing it , and regaining it while being nearly upset again . It had become a matter of life and death now to keep afloat , with only one oar to fight the sea with ; and , though hoping little from the expedient , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance in every lull of the tempest . To his own intense astonishment , as well as relief , his hail was answered . " Where away ? " came on the wind , the sound seeming to flap and flutter like a shred of torn sail . " Off the creek , about a mile ? " shouted Chillis , with those powerful lungs of his , that had gotten much of their bellows-like proportions during a dozen years of breathing the thin air of the mountains . " All right ! " was returned on the snapping , fluttering gale . After this answer , Chillis contented himself with keeping his boat right side up , and giving an occasional prolonged " Oh-whoo ! " to guide his rescuers through the thickening gloom . How long it seemed , with the growing darkness , and the effort to avoid another upset ! But the promised help came at last , in the shape of the mail-carrier 's plunger , her trim little mast catching his eyes , shining white and bare out of the dusk . Directly he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ye ? Who be ye ? " " Right here , under yer bow . Joe Chillis , you bet your life ! " " Waal , come aboard here , mighty quick . Make fast . Mind your boat ; do n't let her strike us . Pole off -- pole off , with yer oar ! " " Mind your oars , " returned Chillis ; " I 'll mind mine "  - -  every word spoken with a yell . " What was the row , out there ? " asks the mail-carrier , making a trumpet of his hand . " Boat flopped over ; lost an oar , " answered Chillis , keeping his little craft from flying on board by main force . " Guess I wo n't go over to-night , " says the carrier . " ' Taint safe for the mail "  - -  The wind snatching the word " mail " out of his mouth , and scattering it over the water as if it had been a broken bundle of letters . " I 'll go back to Skippanon "  - -  the letters flying every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shouts back Chillis , glad in his heart that he could not , and that the chance , or mischance , favored his previous designs . Then he said no more , but watched his boat , warding it off carefully until they reached the mouth of the creek and got inside , with nothing worse to contend against than the insolent wind and rain . " This is a purty stiff tide , for this time o ' day . It wo n't take long to pull up to Skippanon , with all this water pushin ' us along . Goin ' home to-night , Joe ? " " Yes , I 'm goin ' home , ef I can borrer an oar , " said Chillis . " My house ai n't altogether safe without me , in sech weather as this . " " Safer ' n most houses , ef she do n't break away from her moorin 's , " returned the mail-carrier , laughing . " Ef I can git somebody to take my place for a week , I 'm comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shootin ' . Nothin ' like such an establishment as yours to go huntin ' in -- house an ' boat all in one -- go where you please , an ' stay as long as you please . " " Find me an oar to git home with , an ' you can come an ' stay as long as the grub holds out . " " Waal , I can do that , I guess , when we git to the landin ' . I keep an extra pair or two for emergencies . But it 's gittin ' awful black , Chillis , an ' I do n't envy you the trip up the creek . It 's crooked as a string o ' S 's , an ' full o ' shoals , to boot . " " It wo n't be shoal to-night , " remarked Chillis , and relapsed into silence . In a few minutes the boat 's bow touched the bank . " Mind the tiller ! " called out both oarsmen , savagely . But as no one minded it , and it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped his oar , and stepped back to the stern to feel what it was . " He 's fast asleep , or drunk , or dead , I do n't know which , " he called to the other oarsman , as he got hold of the steering gear , and headed the boat up-stream again . His companion made no reply , and the party proceeded in silence to the landing . Here , by dint of much shouting and hallooing , the inmates of a house close by became informed of something unusual outside , and , after a suitable delay , a man appeared , carrying a lantern . " It 's you , is it ? " he said to the mail-carrier . " I reckoned you would n't cross to-night . Who ye got in there ? " " It 's Joe Chillis . We picked him up outside , about a mile off the land . His boat had been upset , an ' he 'd lost an oar ; an ' ef we had n't gone to his assistance it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hullo , Joe ! Why do n't you git up ? " asked the man , seeing that Chillis did not rise , or change his position . " By George ! I do n't know what 's the matter with him . Give me the lantern ; " and the mail-carrier took the light and flashed it over Chillis 's face . " I do n't know whether he 's asleep , or has fainted , or what . He 's awful white , an ' there 's an ugly cut in his shoulder , an ' his coat all torn away . Must have hurt himself tryin ' to right his boat , I guess . George ! the iron on the rowlock must have struck right into the flesh . " " He did n't say he was hurt , " rejoined the other oarsman . " It 's like enough he did n't know it , " said the man with the lantern . " When a man 's in danger he does n't feel a hurt . Poor old Joe ! he was n't drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in this weather . We must take him in , I s'pose . " Then the three men lifted him upon his feet , and , by shaking and talking , aroused him sufficiently to walk with their support to the house . There they laid him on a bench , and brought him a glass of hot whisky and water ; and the women of the house gathered about shyly , gazing compassionately upon the ugly wound in the old man 's delicate white flesh , white and delicate as the fairest woman 's . Presently , Chillis sat up and looked about him . " Have you got me the oars ? " he said to the mail-carrier . " You wo n't row any more to-night , Joe , I guess , " the carrier answered , smiling grimly . " Look at your shoulder , man . " " Shoulder be d --  -- d ! " retorted Chillis . " Beg pardon , ladies ; I did n't see you . Been asleep , have n't I ? Perhaps , sence you seem to think I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me the favor to help me put myself in order . Have you a piece of court-plaster , or a healing salve , ma'am ? " to the elder woman . " Ladies mostly keep sech trifles about them , I believe . " Then he straightened himself up to his magnificent height , and threw out his broad , round chest , as if the gash in his shoulder were an epaulet or a band of stars instead . " Of course , I can do something for you , " said the woman he had addressed , very cheerfully and quickly . " I have the best healing salve in all the country ; " and , running away , she quickly returned with a roll of linen , and the invaluable salve . " I must look at the wound , and see if it wants washing out . Ugh ! O , dear ! it is a dreadful cut , and ragged . You will have to go to the doctor with that , I 'm afraid . But I 'll just put this on to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will take cold , anyway , if you do not get a change of clothes ; " and the good woman looked round at her husband , asking him with her eyes to offer this very necessary kindness . " You 'll stop with us to-night , Joe , " said the man , in answer to this appeal , " an ' the sooner you git off them wet clothes the better . I 'll lend you some o ' mine . " " Yes , indeed , Mr. Chillis , you must get out of these wet things , and put on some of Ben 's . Then you will let me get you a bit of hot supper , and go right to bed . You do n't look as if you could sit up . There ! " she added , as the salve was pressed gently down over the torn flesh , and heaving a deep sigh , " if you feel half as sick as I do , just looking at it , you will do well to get ready to lie down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's while to git hurt a leetle , ef he has a lady to take care o ' him , " answered Chillis , gallantly . " But I ca n't accept your kindness any furder to-night . Ef I can git the loan of a lantern an ' a pair o ' oars , it is all I ask , for home I must go , as soon as possible . " " Ben will lend you a lantern , " said the mail-carrier , " an ' I will lend you the oars , as I promised ; but what on earth you want to go any further in this storm for , beats me . " " This storm has only jist begun , and its goin ' to last three days , " returned Chillis . " No use waitin ' for it to quit ; so , good-night to you all . I 've made a pretty mess o ' your floor , " he added , turning to glance at the little black puddles that had drained out of his great spongy blanket coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white-scoured boards of the kitchen ; then , glancing from them to the mistress of the house --  " I hope you 'll excuse me . " And with that he opened the door quickly , and shut himself out into the tempest once more , making his way by the lantern 's aid to the boat-house at the landing , where he helped himself to what he needed , and was soon pulling up the creek . Luckily there was no current against him , for it was sickening work making the oar-stroke with that hurt in his shoulder . He could see by the light of the lantern , which he occasionally held aloft , that the long grass of the tide-marsh was already completely submerged , the immense flats looking like a sea , with the wind driving the water before it in long rolls , or catching it up and flirting it through the air in spray and foam . His only guide to his course was the scattering line of low willows whose tops still bent and shook above the flood , indicating the slightly raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the profound darkness which brooded over and seemed a part of the storm . But even with these landmarks he wandered a good deal in his reckoning , and an hour or more had elapsed before his watchful eyes caught the gleam of what might have been a star reflected in the ocean . " Thank God ! " he whispered , and pulled a little faster toward that spark of light . In ten minutes more , he moored his boat to the hitching-post in front of a tiny cottage , from whose uncurtained window the light of a brisk wood-fire was shining . As the chain clanked in the ring , the door opened , and a woman and child looked out . " Is that you , Eben ? " asked the woman , in an eager voice , made husky by previous weeping . " I certainly feared you were drowned . " Then seeing , as her eyes became accustomed to the darkness , that the figure still lingering about the boat was not her husband 's she shrank back , fearing the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for , Mrs. Smiley , " answered Chillis , standing on the bit of portico , with its dripping honeysuckle vines swinging in the wind ; " but I 'm better than nobody , I reckon , an ' Smiley will hardly be home to-night . The bay 's awful rough , an ' ef I had n't started over early , I should n't have ventured , neither . No , you need n't look for your husband to-night , ma'am . " " Will you not come in by the fire , Mr. Chillis ? " asked the woman , hesitatingly , seeing that he seemed waiting to be invited . " Thankee . But I shall spile your floor , ef I do . I 'm a perfect sponge , not fit to come near a lady , nohow . I thought , " he added , as he closed the door and advanced to the hearth , " that I would jest stop an ' see ef I could do anything for you , seein ' as I guessed you 'd be alone , and mebbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ladies mostly is afeard to be alone at sech times "  - -  untying the yellow cotton handkerchief and throwing his sodden hat upon the stone hearth . " Do you think there is any danger ? " asked Mrs. Smiley , embarrassed , yet anxious . She stood in the middle of the room , behind him , with that irresolute air an inexperienced person has in unexpected circumstances . He turned around with his back to the blaze , while a faint mist of evaporation began to creep out all over him , and occasionally to dart out in slender streams and float up the wide chimney . " There 's no danger now , an ' mebbe there wo n't be any . But the tide will not turn much afore midnight , an ' it 's higher now than it generally is when it is full . " " What 's that ? " cried Willie , the boy , his senses sharpened by the mention of danger . " It 's the wind rattlin ' my boat-chains , " returned Chillis , smiling at the little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , not less startled . " Was it your boat that you were fastening to the hitching-post ? I thought it was your horse . Is the water up so high , then , already ? "  - -  her cheeks paling as she spoke . " I dragged it up a little way , " returned Chillis , slowly , and turning his face back to the fire . He was listening attentively , and thought he caught the sound of lapping water . " Have you just come from Astoria ? " asked Mrs. Smiley , approaching , and standing at one corner of the hearth . The fire-light shone full upon her now , and revealed a clear white face ; large , dark-gray eyes , full of sadness and perplexity ; a beautifully shaped head , coiled round and round with heavy twists of golden hair , that glittered in its high lights like burnished metal ; and a figure at once full and lithe in its proportions , clad in a neat-fitting dress of some soft , dark material , set off with a tiny white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she was the " White Rose " to the rough old mountain man . She was looking up at him with an eager , questioning gaze , that meant , O , ever so much more than her words . " Not quite direct . I stopped down at the landin ' , an ' I lost a little time gittin ' capsized in the bay . I left about three o'clock . " " Might not Eben have left a little later , " the gray eyes added , " and have been capsized , too ? " " He would n't try to cross half an hour later -- I 'll wager my head on that . He ca n't get away from town to-night ; an ' , what is worse , I do n't think he can cross for two or three days . We 've got our Christmas storm on hand , an ' a worse one than we 've had for twenty years , or I 'm mistaken . " " If you thought the storm was going to be severe , why did you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him steadily . " I did say , there would be a sou ' - wester uncommon severe ; but Rumway laughed at me for prophesyin ' in his company . Besides , I was in a hurry to get off , myself , and would n't argue with ' em . Smiley 's a man to take his own way pretty much , too . " " I wish you had warned him , " sighed Mrs. Smiley , and turned wearily away . She left her guest gazing into the fire and still steaming in a very unsavory manner , lighted a candle , set it in the window , and opened the door to look out . What she saw made her start back with a cry of affright , and hurriedly close the door . " Your boat is this side of the hitching-post , and the water is all around us ! " " An ' it is not yet eight o'clock . I guessed it would be so . " Just then , a fearful blast shook the house , and the boat 's chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shivered all over with terror . " O , mamma ! " he sobbed , " will the water drown our house ? " " I hope not , my boy . It may come up and wet our warm , dry floor ; but I trust it will not give us so much trouble . We do not like wet feet , do we , Willie ? " Then the mother , intent on soothing the child , sat down in the fire-light and held his curly head in her lap , whispering little cooing sentences into his ear whenever he grew restless ; while her strange , unbidden guest continued to evaporate in one corner of the hearth , sitting with his hands on his knees , staring at something in the coals . There was no attempt at conversation . There had never , until this evening , been a dozen words exchanged between these neighbors , who knew each other by sight and by reputation well enough . Joe Chillis was not a man whose personal appearance -- so far as clothes went -- nor whose reputation , would commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other smacking of recklessness and whisky . Not that any great harm was known of the man ; but that he was out of the pale of polite society even in this new and isolated corner of the earth . He had had an Indian wife in his youth ; being more accustomed to the ways of her people than of his own . For nearly twenty years he had lived a thriftless , bachelor existence , known among men , and by hearsay among women , as a noted story-teller , and genial , devil-may-care , old mountain man , whose heart was in the right place , but who never drew very heavily upon his brain resources , except to embellish a tale of his early exploits in Indian-fighting , bear-killing and beaver-trapping . It was with a curious feeling of wonder that Mrs. Smiley found herself tete-a-tete with him at her own fireside ; and , in spite of her anxiety about other matters , she could not help studying him a good deal , as he sat there , silent and almost as motionless as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the aristocratic cut of his features ; nor from imagining him as he must have been in his youth . She was absorbed for a little while , picturing this gallant young White among his Indian associates -- trying to fancy how he treated his squaw wife , and whether he really cared for her as he would for a White woman ; then , she wondered what kind of an experience his present life would be for any one else -- herself , for instance -- living most of the year on a flat-boat housed in , and hiding in sloughs , and all manner of watery , out-of-the-way places . She loved forest and stream , and sylvan shades , well enough ; but not well enough for that . So a human creature who could thus voluntarily exile himself must be peculiar . But Joe Chillis did not look peculiar ; he looked as alive and human as anybody -- in fact , particularly alive and human just now ; and it was not any eccentricity which had brought him to her this night , but a real human reason . What was the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing of her light hand over his hair , Willie had fallen asleep . Mrs. Smiley lifted him in her arms and laid him on the lounge , covering him carefully , and touching him tenderly , kissing his bright curls at the last . Chillis turned to watch her -- he could not help it . Perhaps he speculated about her way of living and acting , as she had speculated about his . Meantime , the tempest outside increased in fury , and the little cottage trembled with its fitful shocks . Now that Willie was asleep , Mrs. Chillis felt a growing nervousness and embarrassment . She could not bring herself to sit down again , alone with Joe Chillis . Not that she was afraid of him -- there was nothing in his appearance to inspire a dread of the man ; but she wanted to know what he was there for . The sensitive nerves of the man felt this mental inquiry of her , but he would not be the first to speak ; so he let her flutter about -- brightening the fire , putting to right things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense of being busied with household cares . At length , there was nothing more to do except to wind the clock , which stood on the mantel , over the hearth . Here was her opportunity . " The evening has seemed very long , " she said , " but it is nine o'clock , at last . " Chillis got up , went to the door , and opened it . The boat was bumping against the floor of the tiny portico . She saw it , too , and her heart gave a great bound . Chillis came back , and sat down by the fire , looking very grave and preoccupied . With a little shiver , she sat down opposite . It was clear that he had no intention of going ; and , strange as she felt the situation to be , she experienced a sort of relief that he was there . She was not a cowardly woman , nor was her guest one she would have been likely to appeal to in any peril ; but , since a possible peril had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she owned to herself she was not sorry . She was a woman , any way , and must needs require services of men , whoever they might be . Having disposed of this question , it occurred to her to be gracious to the man whose services she had made up her mind to accept . Glancing into his face , she noticed its pallor ; and then remembered what he had said about being capsized in the bay , and that he was an old man ; and then , that he might not have had any supper . All of which inspired her to say , " I beg pardon , Mr. Chillis . I presume you have eaten nothing this evening . I shall get you something , right away -- a cup of hot coffee , for instance . " And , without waiting to hear his faint denial , Mrs. Smiley made all haste to put her hospitable intentions into practice , and soon had spread a little table with a very appetizing array of cold meats , fruit , bread , and coffee . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted and disposed of the refreshments , Mrs. Smiley sat and gazed at the fire in her turn . The little cottage trembled , the windows rattled , the storm roared without , and -- yes , the water actually lapped against the house ! She started , turning to the door . The wind was driving the flood in under it . She felt a chill run through her flesh . " Mr. Chillis , the water is really coming into the house ! " " Yes , I reckoned that it would , " returned the old man , calmly , rising from the table and returning to the hearth . " That is the nicest supper I 've had for these dozen years ; and it has done me good , too . I was a little wore out with pullin ' over the bay , agin the wind . " Mrs. Smiley looked at him curiously , and then at the water splashing in under the door . He understood her perfectly . " A wettin ' would n't hurt you , though it would be disagreeable , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inconvenience . But the wind and the water may unsettle the foundation o ' your house , the chimney bein ' on the outside , an ' no support to it . Even that would not certainly put you in danger , as the frame would likely float . But I knew , ef sech a thing should happen , an ' you here alone , you would be very much frightened , an ' perhaps lose your life a-tryin ' to save it . " " And you came up from the landing in all this storm to take care of me ? " Mrs. Smiley exclaimed , with flushing cheeks . " I came all the way from Astoria to do it , " answered Chillis , looking at the new-blown roses of her face . " And Eben --  --  " She checked herself , and fixed her eyes upon the hearth . " He thought there was no danger , most likely . " " Mr. Chillis , I can never thank you ! " she cried , fervently , as she turned to glance at the sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his breath , " I do n't want any thanks but those I 've got . " Then , aloud to her : " You might have some blankets ready , in case we are turned out o ' the house . The fire will be ' most sure to be put out , any way , an ' you an ' the boy will be cold . " Mrs. Smiley was shivering with that tenseness of the nerves which the bravest women suffer from , when obliged to wait the slow but certain approach of danger . Her teeth chattered together , as she went about her band-box of a house , collecting things that would be needed , should she be forced to abandon the shelter of its lowly roof ; and , as she was thus engaged , she thought the place had never seemed so cosy as it did this wild and terrible night . She put on her rubber overshoes , tied snugly on a pretty woollen hood , got ready a pile of blankets and a warm shawl , lighted a large glass lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , last , proceeded to arouse Willie , and wrap him up in overcoat , little fur cap , and warm mittens ; when all was done , she turned and looked anxiously at the face of her guest . It might have been a mask , for all she could learn from it . He was silently watching her , not looking either depressed or hopeful . She went up to him , and touched his sleeve . " How wet you are , still , " she said , compassionately . " I had forgotten that you must have been uncomfortable after your capsize in the bay . Perhaps it is not too late to change your clothes . You will find some of Eben 's in the next room . Shall I lay them out for you ? " He smiled when she touched him , a bright , warm smile , that took away ten years of his age ; but he did not move . " No , " said he , " it 's no use now , to put on dry clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm used to it ; but I shall be sorry when this cheerful fire is out . " He had hardly spoken , when a blast struck the house , more terrific than any that had gone before it , and a narrow crack became visible between the hearth-stone and the floor , through which the water oozed in quite rapidly . Mrs. Smiley 's face blanched . " That started the house a leetle , " said Chillis , lighting his lantern by the fire . " Could we get to the landing , do you think ? " asked Mrs. Smiley , springing instinctively to the lounge , where the child lay in a half-slumber . " Not afore the tide begins to run out . Ef it was daylight , we might , by keepin ' out o ' the channel ; but the best we can do now is to stick to the place we 're in as long as it holds together , or keeps right side up . When we ca n't stay no longer , we 'll take to the boat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's frightful waiting for one 's house to float away from under one 's feet , or fall about one 's head . And the tide , too ! I have always feared and hated the tides , they have been a horror to me ever since I came here . It seems so dreadful to have the earth slowly sinking into the sea ; for that is the way it appears to do , you know . " " Yes , I remember hearin ' you say you were nervous about the tides , once , when I called here to see your husband . Curious , that I often thought o ' that chance sayin ' o ' yours , is n't it ? " Mrs. Smiley 's reply was a smothered cry of terror , as another blast -- sudden , strong , protracted -- pushed the house still further away from the fire-place , letting the storm in at the opening ; for it was from that direction that the wind came . " Now she floats ! " exclaimed Chillis . " We 'll soon know whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at my boat , I reckon ; for that 's our last resort , in case your ark is worthless , Mrs. Smiley . " He laughed softly , and stepped more vigorously than he had done , as the danger grew more certain . " All right yet -- cable not parted ; ready to do us a good turn , if we need it . " " We shall not be floated off to the bay , shall we ? " asked Mrs. Smiley , trying to smile too . " Not afore the tide turns , certain . " " It seems to me that I should feel safer anywhere than here . Unseen dangers always are harder to battle with , even in imagination . I do not wish to put you to any further trouble ; but I should not mind the storm and the open boat so much as seeing my house going to pieces , with me in it -- and Willie . " " I 've been a-thinkin ' , " replied Chillis , " that the house , after all , ai n't goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under foot , an ' the wind an ' rain drivin ' in on that side where the chimney is took away . It 's an awful pity such a neat , nice little place should come to grief , like this -- a real snug little home ! " " And what else were you thinking ? "  - -  bringing him back to the subject of expedients . " You mentioned goin ' to the landin ' . Well , we ca n't go there ; for I doubt ef I could find the way in the dark , with the water over the tops of the bushes on the creek bank . Besides , in broad daylight it would be tough work , pullin ' agin ' the flood ; an ' I had the misfortin to hurt my shoulder , tryin ' to right my boat in the bay , which partly disables me , I am sorry to say ; for I should like to put my whole strength to your service . " " O , Mr. Chillis !  - -  say no more , I beg . How selfish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your shoulder , and all ! Can not I do anything for you ? I have liquor in the closet , if you would like to bathe with it . " " See -- she moves again ! " cried he , as the house swayed yet further away from the smouldering fire . " I 've heard of ' abandonin ' one 's hearth-stone ; ' but I 'd no idea that was the way they done it . " " I had best get the brandy , any way , I think . We may need it , if we are forced to go into the boat . But do let me do something for you now , Mr. Chillis ? It seems cruel , that you have been in your wet clothes for hours , and tired and bruised besides . " " Thankee -- 'tai n't no use ! " as she offered him the brandy-flask . " The lady down at the landin ' put on a plaster , as you can see for yourself "  - -  throwing back the corner of a cloth cape the woman had placed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The doctor will have to fix it up , I reckon ; for it is cut up pretty bad with the iron . " Mrs. Smiley turned suddenly sick . She was just at that stage of excitement when " a rose-leaf on the beaker 's brim " causes the overflow of the cup . The undulations of the water , under the floor and over it , contributed still further to the feeling ; and she hurried to the lounge to save herself from falling . Here she threw herself beside Willie , and cried a little , quietly , under cover of her shawl . " There she goes ! Well , this is n't pleasant , noways , " said Chillis , as the house , freed with a final crash from impediments , swayed about unsteadily , impelled by wind and water . " I was sayin ' , a bit ago , that we could not git to the landin ' , at present . There are three ways o ' choosin ' , though , which are these : to stay where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the house take its chances ; or to try to git to my cabin , where we would be safe an ' could keep warm . " " How long would it take us to get to your house ? " asked Mrs. Smiley , from under her shawl . " An hour , mebbe . We should have to feel our way . " Mrs. Smiley reflected . Sitting out in an open boat , without trying to do anything , would be horrible ; staying where she was would be hardly less so . It would be six or seven hours still to daylight . There was no chance of the storm abating , though the water must recede after midnight . " Let us go , " she said , sitting up . " You will not desert me , I know ; and why should I keep you here all night , in anxiety and peril ? Once at home , you can rest and nurse yourself . " " So be it ; an ' God help us ! " " Amen ! " Chillis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in the window . Then coming back for a basin , he waded out , bailed his boat , and , unfastening the chain , hauled it alongside the doorway . Mrs. Smiley had hastily put some provisions into a tin bucket , with a cover , and some things for Willie into another , and stood holding them , ready to be stowed away . " You will have to take the tiller , " said Chillis , placing the buckets safely in the boat . " I meant to take an oar , " said she . " If you know how to steer , it will be better for me to pull alone . Now , let us have the boy , right in the bottom here , with plenty o ' blankets under and over him ; the same for yourself . The lanterns -- so . Now , jump in ! " " The fire is dead on the hearth , " she said , looking back through the empty house , and across the gap of water showing through the broken wall . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me live through it . " " I believe he did . Are you quite ready ? " " Quite ; only tell me what I must do . I wish I could help you . " " You do ? " he answered ; and then he bent himself to the work before him , with a sense of its responsibility which exalted it into a deed of the purest chivalry . * * * * * PART II . The widow Smiley did not live on Clatsop Plains . Ever since the great storm at Christmas , when her house was carried off its foundations by the high tide , she had refused to go back to it . When the neighbors heard of her husband 's death , they took her over to Astoria to see him buried , for there was no home to bring him to , and she had never returned . Smiley , they say , was drowned where he fell , in the streets of Astoria , that night of the high tide , being too intoxicated to get up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that he stumbled off the wharf , in the dark , and that the tide brought him ashore , and that was enough for her to know . She was staying with the family at the landing when the news came , two days after his death . Joe Chillis brought her things down to the landing , and had them sent over to Astoria , where she decided to stay ; and afterward she sold the farm and bought a small house in town , where , after two or three months , she opened a school for young children . And the women of the place had all taken to making much of Joe Chillis , in consideration of his conduct during that memorable time , and of his sufferings in consequence ; for he was laid up a long while afterward with that hurt in his shoulder , and the consequences of his exposure . Mrs. Smiley always treated him with the highest respect , and did not conceal that she had a great regard for him , if he was nothing but an old mountain man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the circumstances , was not to be wondered at . Widow Smiley was young , and pretty , and smart ; and Captain Rumway , the pilot , was dreadfully taken up with her , and nobody would blame her for taking a second husband , who was able and willing to provide well for her . If it was to be a match , nobody would speak a word against it . It was said that he had left off drinking on her account , and was building a fine house up on the hill , on one of the prettiest lots in town . Such was the gossip about Mrs. Smiley , a year and a half after the night of the high tide . It was the afternoon of a July day , in Astoria ; and , since we have given the reader so dismal a picture of December , let us , in justice , say a word about this July day . All day long the air had been as bright and clear as crystal , and the sun had sparkled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with glare , or sickening the senses with heat . Along either shore rose lofty highlands , crowned with cool-looking forests of dark-green firs . Far to the east , like a cloud on the horizon , the snowy cone of St. Helen 's mountain stood up above the wooded heights of the Cascade Range , with Mount Adams peeping over its shoulder . Quite near , and partly closing off the view up the river , was picturesque Tongue Point -- a lovely island of green -- connected with the shore only by a low and narrow isthmus . From this promontory to the point below the town , the bank of the river was curtained and garlanded with blossoming shrubs -- mock-orange , honeysuckle , spirea , aerifolia , crimson roses , and clusters of elder-berries , lavender , scarlet , and orange -- everywhere , except where men had torn them away to make room for their improvements . Looking seaward , there was the long line of white surf which marks where sea and river meet , miles away ; with the cape and light-house tower standing out in sharp relief against the expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar waiting for Rumway and his associates to come off and show them the entrance between the sand-spits . And nearer , all about on the surface of the sparkling river , snowy sails were glancing in the sun , like the wings of birds that skim beside them . It is hard , in July , to believe it has ever been December . Perhaps Mrs. Smiley was thinking so , as from her rose-embowered cottage-porch on the hill , not far from Captain Rumway 's new house , she watched the sun sinking in a golden glory behind the light-house and the cape . Her school dismissed for the week , and her household tasks completed , she was taking her repose in a great sleepy-hollow of a chair , near enough to the roses to catch their delicate fragrance . Her white dress looked fresh and dainty , with a rose-colored ribbon at the throat , and a bunch of spirea ; sea-foam , Willie called it , in her gleaming , braided hair . Her great gray eyes , neither sad nor bright , but sweetly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and her dress , leaving nothing to be desired , except , perhaps , a suggestion of color in the clear , white oval of her cheeks . And that an accident supplied . For , while the sun yet sent lances of gold up out of the sea , the garden gate clicked , and Captain Rumway came up the walk . He was a handsome man , of fine figure , with a bronzed complexion , dark eyes , and hair always becomingly tossed up , owing to a slight wave in it , and a springy quality it had of its own . The sun and sea-air , while they had bronzed his face , had imparted to his cheeks that rich glow which is often the only thing lacking to make a dark face beautiful . Looking at him , one could hardly help catching something of his glow , if only through admiration of it . Mrs. Smiley 's sudden color was possibly to be accounted for on this ground . " Good evening , Mrs. Smiley , " he said , lifting his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk over and look at my house . No , thank you ; I will not come in , if you are ready for the walk . I will stop here and smell these roses while you get your hat . " " Is your house so nearly completed , then ? " she asked , as they went down the walk together . " So nearly , that I require a woman 's opinion upon the inside arrangements ; and there is no one whose judgment upon such matters I value more than yours . " " I suppose you mean to imply that I am a good housekeeper ? But there is great diversity of taste among good housekeepers , Mr. Rumway . " " Your taste will suit me -- that I am sure of . I did not see Willie at home ; is he gone away ? " he asked , to cover a sudden embarrassing consciousness . " I let him go home with Mr. Chillis , last evening , but I expect him home to-night . " " Poor old Joe ! He takes a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  he is a charming child , worthy such parentage , "  - -  glancing at his companion 's face . " I am glad when anything of mine gives Mr. Chillis pleasure , " returned Mrs. Smiley , looking straight ahead . " I teach Willie to have a great respect and love for him . It is the least we can do . " Rumway noticed the inclusive we , and winced . " He is a strange man , " he said , by way of answer . " A hero ! " cried Mrs. Smiley firmly . " And never more so then when in whisky , " added Rumway , ungenerously . " Younger and more fortunate men have had that fault , " she returned , thinking of Eben . " And conquered it , " he added , thinking of himself . " Here we are . Just step in this door-way a bit and look at the view . Glorious , is n't it ? I have sent for a lot of very choice shrubs and trees for the grounds , and mean to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be very pretty , with this view , " replied Mrs. Smiley , drinking in the beauty of the scene with genuine delight . " Please to step inside . Now , it is about the arrangement of the doors , windows , closets , and all that , I wanted advice . I am told that ladies claim to understand these things better than men . " " They ought , I am sure , since the house is alone their realm . What a charming room ! So light , so airy , with such a view ! and the doors and windows in the right places , too . And this cunning little porch towards the west ! I 'm glad you have that porch , Mr. Rumway . I have always said every house should have a sunset porch . I enjoy mine so much these lovely summer evenings . " And so they went through the house : she delighted with it , in the main , but making little suggestions , here and there ; he palpitating with her praises , as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not this house a part of himself , having so many of his sweetest hopes built into it ? For what higher proof does a man give of a worthy love then in constructing a bright and cheerful shelter for the object of it -- than in making sure of a fitting home ? " It will lack nothing , " she said , as they stood together again on the " sunset porch , " talking of so grouping the shrubbery as not to intercept the view . " Except a mistress , " he added , turning his eyes upon her face , full of intense meaning . " With the right woman in it , it will seem perfect to me , without her , it is nothing but a monument of my folly . There is but one woman I ever want to see in it . Can you guess who it is ? Will you come ? " Mrs. Smiley looked up into the glowing face bent over her , searching the passionate dark eyes with her clear , cool gaze ; while slowly the delicate color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his ardent looks , and she drew in her breath quickly . " I , I do not know ; there are so many things to think of . " " What things ? Let me help you consider them . If you mean --  " " O , mamma , mamma ! " shouted Willie , from the street . " Here we are , and I 've had such a splendid time . We 've got some fish for you , too . Are you coming right home ? " And there , on the sidewalk , was Chillis , carrying a basket , with his hat stuck full of flowers , and as regardless as a child of the drollery of his appearance . Mrs. Smiley started a little as she caught the expression of his face , thinking it did not comport with the holiday appearance of his habiliments , and hastened at once to obey its silent appeal . Rumway walked beside her to the gate . " Have you no answer for me ? " he asked , hurriedly . " Give me a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the basket from Chillis , and ordering Willie to carry it , while she walked by the old man 's side . " You have been lookin ' at your new house ? " he remarked . " You need not try to hide your secret from me . I see it in your face ; " and he looked long and wistfully upon the rosy record . " If you see something in my face , I see something in yours . You have a trouble , a new pain of some kind . Yesterday you looked forty , and radiant ; this evening your face is white and drawn by suffering . " " You do observe the old man 's face sometimes , then ? That other has not quite blotted it out ? O , my lovely lady ! How sweet an ' dainty you look , in that white dress . It does my old eyes good to look at you . " " You are never too ill or sad to make me pretty compliments , Mr. Chillis . Do you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you to flatter me . We constitute a mutual admiration society , I 'm sure . " Then she led him into the rose-covered porch , and seated him in the " sleepy-hollow ; " brought him a dish of strawberries , and told him to rest while she got ready his supper . " Rest ! " he answered ; " I 'm not tired . Willie an ' I cooked our own supper , too . So you jest put Willie to bed -- he 's tired enough , I guess -- an ' then come an ' talk to me . That 's all I want to-night -- is jest to hear the White Rose talk . " While Mrs. Smiley was occupied with Willie -- his wants and his prattle -- her guest sat motionless , his head on his hand , his elbow resting on the arm of the chair . He had that rare repose of bearing which is understood to be a sign of high breeding , but in him was temperament , or a quietude caught from nature and solitude . It gave a positive charm to his manner , whether animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that suited with his powerfully built , symmetrical frame , and regular cast of features . Yet , self-contained as his usual expression was , his face was capable of vivid illuminations , and striking changes of aspect , under the influence of feelings either pleasant or painful . In the shadow of the rose-vines , and the gathering twilight , it would have been impossible to discern , by any change of feature , what his meditations might be now . " The moon is full to-night , " said Mrs. Smiley , bringing out her low rocker and placing it near her friend . " It will be glorious on the river , and all the ' young folks ' will be out , I suppose . " " Did not Rumway ask you to go ? Do n't let me keep you at home , ef he did . " " No ; I am not counted among young folks any longer , " returned she , with a little sigh , that might mean something or nothing . Then a silence fell between them for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the spirit to move them to converse , and not unfrequently a silence longer than that which was in heaven came between their sentences ; but to-night there was thunder in their spiritual atmosphere , and the stillness was oppressive . Mrs. Smiley beat a tattoo with her slipper . " Rumway asked you to marry him , did he ? " began Chillis , at last , in a low and measured tone . " Yes . " " An ' you accepted him ? " " Not yet "  - -  in a quavering adagio . " But you will ? " " Perhaps so . I do not know "  - -  in a firmer voice . " Rumway is doin ' well , an ' he is a pretty good fellow , as men go . But he is not half the man that I was at his age -- or , rather , that I might have been , ef I had had sech a motive for bein ' a man as he has . " " It is not difficult to believe that , Mr. Chillis . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none in Mr. Rumway . " She spoke naturally and cheerfully now , as if she had no sentiment too sacred to be revealed about the person in question . " But why was there no motive ? " " Why ? It was my fate ; there was none -- that 's all . I had gone off to the mountains when a lad , an ' could n't git back -- could n't even git letters from home . The fur companies did n't allow o ' correspondence -- it made their men homesick . When I came to be a man , I did as the other men did , took an Indian wife , an ' became the father o ' half-breed children . I never expected to live any other way than jest as we lived then -- roamin ' about the mountains , exposed to dangers continually , an ' reckless because it was no use to think . But , after I had been a savage for a dozen years -- long enough to ruin any man -- the fur companies began to break up . The beaver were all hunted out o ' the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were -- an ' so drifted off down here , where it was possible to git somethin ' to eat , an ' where there was quite a settlement o ' retired trappers , missionaries , deserted sailors , and such-like Whites . " " You brought your families with you ? " " Of course . We could not leave them in the mountains , with the children , to starve . Besides , we loved our children . They were not to blame for bein ' half-Indian ; an ' we could not separate them from their mothers , ef we had a-wished . We did the only thing we could do , under the circumstances -- married the mothers by White men 's laws , to make the children legitimate . Even the heads of the Hudson 's Bay Company were forced to comply with the sentiment of the White settlers ; an ' their descendants are among the first families of Oregon . But they had money an ' position ; the trappers had neither , though there were some splendid men among them -- so our families were looked down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have some bitter thoughts in those days ? for my blood was high blood , in the State where I was raised . " " I can imagine it , very easily , " said Mrs. Smiley , softly . " But I never let on . I was wild and devil-may-care . To hide my mortification , I faced it out , as well as I could ; but I was n't made , in the beginnin ' , for that kind o ' life , an ' it took away my manhood . After the country began to settle up , an ' families -- real White families -- began to move in , I used to be nearly crazy , sometimes . Many 's the day that I 've rode through the woods , or over the prairies , tryin ' to git away from myself ; but I never said a cross word to the squaw wife . Why should I ? it was not her fault . Sometimes she fretted at me ( the Indian women are great scolds ) ; but I did not answer her back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White husband , to whom she looked for better things . I could n't work ; I did n't take no interest in work , like other men . " " O , Mr. Chillis ! was not that a great mistake ? Would not some kind of ambition have helped to fill up the blank in your life ? " " I did n't have any -- I could n't have any , with that old Indian woman sittin ' there , in the corner o ' my hearth . When the crazy fit came on , I jest turned my back on home , an ' mounted my horse for a long , lonely ride , or went to town and drank whisky till I was past rememberin ' my trouble . But I never complained . The men I associated with expected me to amuse them , an ' I generally did , with all manner o ' wild freaks an ' incredible stories -- some o ' which were truer than they believed , for I had had plenty of adventures in the mountains . White Rose , do you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I remember asking myself such a question , that night of the storm , as you stood by the fire , so still and strange . I was speculating about your history , and starting these very queries you have answered to-night . " " But you have never asked me . " " No ; how could I ? But I am glad to know . Now I understand the great patience -- the tender , pathetic patience -- which I have often remarked in you . Only those who have suffered long and silently can ever attain to it . " " An ' so people say , ' Poor old Joe ! ' an ' they do n't know what they mean , when they say it . They think I am a man without the ambitions an ' passions of other men ; a simple , good fellow , without too much brain , an ' only the heart of a fool . But they do n't know me -- they do n't know me ! " " How could they , without hearing what you have just told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They never will know . I do n't want to be pitied for my mistakes . ' Poor old Joe ' is proud , as well as poor . " Mrs. Smiley sat silent , gazing at the river 's silver ripples . Her shapely hands were folded in her lap ; her whole attitude quiet , absorbed . Whether she was thinking of what she had heard , or whether she had forgotten it , no one could have guessed from her manner ; and Chillis could not wait to know . The fountains of the deep had been stirred until they would not rest . " Was there no other question you asked yourself about the old mountain man which he can answer ? Did you never wonder whether he ever had loved at all ? " " You have made me wonder , to-night , whether , at some period of your life , you have not loved some woman of your own race and color . You must have had some opportunities of knowing white women . " " Very few . An ' my pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; for the woman I fancied to myself was no common white woman . White Rose , I carried a young man 's heart in my bosom until I was near sixty , an ' then I lost it . " He put out a hand and touched one of hers , ever so lightly . " I need not tell you any more . " A silence that made their pulses seem audible followed this confession . A heavy shadow descended upon both hearts , and a sudden dreary sense of an unutterable and unalterable sorrow burdened their spirits . After a little , " Mr. Chillis ! Mr. Chillis ! " wailed the woman 's pathetic voice ; and " O , my lovely lady ! " sighed the man 's . " What shall I do ? what shall I do ? I am so sorry . What shall I do ? " " Tell me to go . I knew it would have to end so . I knew that Rumway would drive me to say what I ought not to say ; for he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ef I was as young as he , an ' had his chance , I would make myself worthy o ' you , or die . But it is too late . Old Joe Chillis may starve his heart , as he has many a time starved his body in the desert . But I did love you so ! O , my sweet White Rose , I did love you so ! always , from the first time I saw you . " " What is that you say ? " said Mrs. Smiley , in a shocked voice . " Always , I said , from the first time I saw you . My love was true ; it did not harm you . I said , ' There is such a woman as God designed for me . But it is too late to have her now . I will jest worship her humbly , a great ways off , an ' say " God bless her ! " when she passes ; an ' think o ' her sweet ways when I am ridin ' through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sloughs , among the willows an ' pond-lilies . She would hardly blame me , ef she knew I loved her that way . ' " But it grew harder afterwards , White Rose , when you were grateful to me , in your pretty , womanly way , an ' treated me so kindly before all the world , an ' let your little boy love me , an ' loved me yourself -- I knew it -- in a gentle , friendly fashion . O , but it was sweet !  - -  but not sweet enough , sometimes . Ef I have been crazed for the lack o ' love in my younger days , I have been crazed with love since then . There have been days when I could neither work nor eat , nights when I could not sleep , for thinkin ' o ' what might have been , but never could be ; times when I have been tempted to upset my boat in the bay , an ' never try to right it . But when I had almost conquered my madness , that you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine looks , an ' his fine house , an ' his fine professions , an ' blots me out entirely ; for what will old Joe be worth to Madame Rumway , or to Madame Rumway 's fine husband ? " Mrs. Smiley sat thoughtful and silent a long time after this declaration of love , that gave all and required so little . She was sorry for it ; but since it was so , and she must know it , she was glad that she had heard it that night . She could place it in the balance with that other declaration , and decide upon their relative value to her ; for she saw , as he did , that the two were incompatible -- one must be given up . " It is late , " she said , rising . " You will come up and take breakfast with Willie and me , before you go home ? My strawberries are in their prime . " " I thought you would a-told me to go , an ' never come back , " he said , stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped and looked back at her , with a beaming countenance , like a boy 's . She was standing on the step above him , looking down at him with a pleasant but serious expression . " I am going to trust you never to repeat to me what you have said to-night . I know I can trust you . " " So be it , White Rose , " he returned , with so rapid and involuntary a change of attitude , voice , and expression , that the pang of his hurt pierced her heart also . " But I know I can trust you , " she repeated , as if she had not seen that shrinking from the blow . " And I am going to try to make your life a little pleasanter , and more like other people 's . When you are dressed up , and ordered to behave properly , and made to look as handsome as you can , so that ladies shall take notice of you and flatter you with their eyes and tongues , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men have -- and why should n't you ?  - -  then your imagination will not be running away with you , or making angels out of common little persons like myself -- how dreadfully prosy and commonplace you have no idea ! And I forbid you to allow Willie to stick your hat full of flowers , when you go fishing together ; and order you to make that young impudence respectful to you on all occasions -- asserting your authority , if necessary . And , lastly , I prefer you should not call me Madame Rumway until I have a certified and legal claim to the title . Good-night . " He stood bareheaded , his face drooping and half-concealed , pulling the withered flowers out of his hat . Slowly he raised it , made a military salute , and placed it on his head . " It is for you to command and me to obey , " he said . " Breakfast at seven o'clock precisely , " called out the tuneful voice of Mrs. Smiley after him , as he went down the garden-path with bent head , walking more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she went into the house , closed it carefully , after the manner of lone women , and went up to her room . But deliciously cool and fragrant as was the tiny chamber , Mrs. Smiley could not sleep that night . Nor did Chillis come to breakfast next morning . A month passed away . Work was suspended on Mr. Rumway 's house , the doors and windows boarded up , and the gate locked . Everybody knew it could mean but one thing -- that Mrs. Smiley had refused the owner . But the handsome captain put a serene face upon it , and kept about his business industriously and like a gentleman . The fact that he did not return to his wild courses was remarked upon as something hardly to be credited , but greatly to his honor ; for it was universally conceded , that such a disappointment as his was enough to drive almost any man to drink who had indulged in it previously ; such is the generally admitted frailty of man 's moral constitution . Toward the last of August , Mrs. Smiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than his customary regard to appearances , and looked a little paler and thinner than usual . Otherwise , he was just the same as ever ; and , with no questions asked or answered on either side , their old relations were re-established , and Willie was rapturously excited with the prospect of more Saturday excursions . Yet there was this difference in their manner toward each other -- that he now seldom addressed her as " White Rose , " and never as " my lovely lady ; " while it was she who made graceful little compliments to him , and was always gay and bright in his company , and constantly watchful of his comfort or pleasure . She prevailed upon him , too , to make calls with her upon other ladies ; and gave him frequent commissions that would bring him in contact with a variety of persons . But she could not help seeing , that it was only in obedience to her wishes that he made calls , or mingled with the town-people ; and when , one evening , returning together from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remarked , with a shrug and smile of self-contempt , " It is no use , Mrs. Smiley -- oil an ' water wo n't mix , " she had given it up , and never more interfered with his old habits . So the summer passed , and winter came again , with its long rains , dark days , and sad associations . Although Mrs. Smiley was not at all a " weakly woman , " constant effort and care , and the absence of anything very flattering in her future , or inspiring in her present , wore upon her , exhausting her vitality too rapidly for perfect health , as the constantly increasing delicacy of her appearance testified . In truth , when the spring opened , she found herself so languid and depressed as to be hardly able to teach , in addition to her house-work . Then it was that the gossips took up her case once more , and declared , with considerable unanimity , that Mrs. Smiley was pining for the handsome Captain , after all , and , if ever she had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman audacious enough to refuse a man many others would have thought " good enough for them , " and " too good for " so unappreciative a person . With the first bright and warm weather , Willie went to spend a week with his friend , and Mrs. Smiley felt forced to take a vacation . A yachting-party were going over to the cape , and Captain Rumway was to take them out over the bar . Rumway himself sent an invitation to Mrs. Smiley -- this being the first offer of amity he had felt able to make since the previous July . She laughed a little , to herself , when the note came ( for she was not ignorant of the town-tattle -- what school-teacher ever is ? ) and sent an acceptance . If Captain Rumway were half as courageous as she , the chatterers would be confounded , she promised herself , as she made her toilet for the occasion -- not too nice for sea-water , but bright and pretty , and becoming , as her toilets always were . So she sailed over to the cape with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows who have gossip to avenge -- was more charming than any girl of them all , to others beside Captain Rumway . The officers of the garrison vied with each other in showing her attentions ; and the light-house keeper , in exhibiting the wonders and beauties of the place , always , if unconsciously , appealed to Mrs. Smiley for admiration and appreciation . Yet she wore her honors modestly , contriving to share this homage with some other , and never accepting it as all meant for herself . And toward Captain Rumway her manner was as absolutely free from either coquetry or awkwardness as that of the most indifferent acquaintance . Nobody , seeing her perfectly frank yet quiet and cool deportment with her former suitor , could say , without falsehood , that she in any way concerned herself about him ; and if he had heard that she was pining for him , he was probably undeceived during that excursion . Thus she came home feeling that she had vindicated herself , and with a pretty color in her face that made her look as girlish as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Rumway had reopened an acquaintance with Mrs. Smiley out of compassion for any woes she might be suffering on his account , or out of a design to show how completely he was master of himself , or , in short , for any motive whatever , he was taken in his own devices , and compelled to surrender unconditionally . Like the man in Scripture , out of whom the devils were cast only to return , his last estate was worse than the first , as he was soon compelled to acknowledge ; and one of the first signs of this relapse into fatuity was the resumption of work on the unfinished house , and the ornamentation of the neglected grounds . " I will make it such a place as she can not refuse , " he said to himself , more or less hopefully . " She will have to accept the house and grounds , with me thrown in . And whatever she is pining for , she is pining , that I can see . It may be for outdoor air and recreation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it be that she can take them along with me . " Thus it was , that when Chillis brought Willie home from his long visit to the woods and streams , he saw the workmen busy on the Captain 's house . He heard , too , about the excursion to the cape , and the inevitable comments upon Rumway 's proceedings . But he said nothing about it to Mrs. Smiley , though he spent the evening in the snug little parlor , and they talked together of many things personally interesting to both ; especially about Willie 's education and profession in life . " He ought to go to college , " said his mother . " I wish him to be a scholarly man , whatever profession he decides upon afterward . I could not bear that he should not have a liberal education . " " Yes , Willie must be a gentleman , " said Chillis ; " for his mother 's sake he must be that . " " But how to provide the means to furnish such an education as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continued Mrs. Smiley , pausing in her needle-work to study that problem more closely , and gazing absently at the face of her guest . " Will ten years more of school-teaching do it , I wonder ? " " Ten years o ' school-teachin ' , an ' house-work , an ' sewin ' ! " cried he . " Yes , long before that you will be under the sod o ' the grave-yard ! You can not send the boy to college . " " Who , then ? "  - -  smiling at his vehemence . " I will . " " You , Mr. Chillis ? I thought .... " She checked herself , fearing to hurt his pride . " You thought I was poor , an ' so I am , for I never tried to make money . I do n't want money . But there is land belongin ' to me out in the valley -- five or six hundred acres -- an ' land is growin ' more valuable every year . Ten years from now I reckon mine would pay a boy 's schoolin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Mrs. Smiley . " The tears sprang to the gray eyes which were turned upon him with such eloquent looks . " It is like you , " she said , in a broken voice , " and I have nothing to say . " " You are welcome to my land , White Rose , an ' there is nothin ' to be said . " Then she bent her head over her sewing , feeling , indeed , that there was little use for words . " Do you know , " he asked , breaking a protracted silence , " that you have got to give up teachin ' ? " " And do what ? I might take to gardening . That would be better , perhaps ; I have thought about it . " " Let me see your hands . They look like gardenin ' : two rose-leaves ! Do n't it make me wish to be back in my prime ? Work for you ! Would n't I love to work for you ? " " And do you not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride about accepting so much service ? What a poor creature you must take me for , Mr. Chillis . " " There is nothin ' else in the world that I think of ; nothin ' else that I live for ; an ' after all it is so little , that I can not save you from spoilin ' your pretty looks with care . An ' you have troubled yourself about me , too ; do n't think I have n't seen it . You fret your lovely soul about the old man 's trouble , when you ca n't help it -- you , nor nobody . An ' , after all , what does it matter about me ? I am nothin ' , and you are everything . I want you to remember that , and do everything for your own happiness without wastin ' a thought on me . I am content to keep my distance , ef I only see you happy and well off . Do you understand me ? " Mrs. Smiley looked up with a suffused face . " Mr. Chillis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and my selfishness . Let us never refer to this subject again . Work do n't hurt me ; and since you have offered to provide for Willie 's education , you have lifted half my burden . Why should you stand at a distance to see me happier than I am , when I am so happy as to have such a friend as you ? How am I to be happier by your being at a distance , who have been the kindest of friends ? You are out of spirits this evening , and you talk just a little -- nonsense . " And she smiled at him in a sweetly apologetic fashion for the word . " That is like enough , " he returned gravely ; " but I want you to remember my words , foolish or not . Do n't let me stand in your light -- not for one minute ; and do n't forgit this : that Joe Chillis is happy when he sees the White Rose bloomin ' and bright . " Contrary to his command , Mrs. Smiley did endeavor to forget these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came no more to her rose-embowered cottage , and when Captain Rumway invented many ingenious schemes for getting the pale school-teacher to take more recreation and fresh air . She endeavored to forget them , but she could not , though her resolve to ignore them was as strong as it ever had been when her burdens had seemed lighter ! But in spite of her resolve , and in spite of the fact that it could not be said that any encouragement had been given to repeat his addresses , Rumway continued to work at his house and grounds steadily , and , to all appearance , hopefully . And although he never consulted Mrs. Smiley now concerning the arrangement of either , he showed that he remembered her suggestions of the year before , by following them out without deviation . Thus quietly , without incident , the June days slipped away , and the perfect July weather returned once more , when there was always a chair or two out on the sunset porch at evening . At last Chillis re-appeared , and took a seat in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been away , he said , attending to some business . " An ' I have fixed that matter all right about the boy 's schoolin ' , " he added . " The papers are made out in the clerk 's office , an ' will be sent to you as soon as they are recorded . There are five hundred and forty acres , which you will know how to manage better than I can tell you . You can sell by and by , ef you ca n't yet the money out of it any other way . The taxes wo n't be much , the land being unimproved . " " You do not mean that you have deeded all your land to Willie ? " asked Mrs. Smiley . " I protest against it : he must not have it ! Would you let us rob you , " she asked wonderingly . " What are you to do , by and by , as you say ? " " Me ? I shall do well enough . Money is o ' no use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket that I could n't get , the boy would n't see me want them long . Ef he forgot old Joe Chillis , his mother would n't , I reckon . " " You pay too high a price for our remembrance , Mr. Chillis ; we are not worth it . But why do you talk of forgetting ? You are not going away from us ? " " Yes ; I am goin ' to start to-morrow for my old stampin ' ground , east o ' the mountains . My only livin ' son is over there , somewhar . He do n't amount to much -- the Indian in him is too strong ; but , like enough , he will be glad to see his father afore I die . An ' I want to git away from here . " " You will come back ? Promise me you will come back ? " For something in his voice , and his settled expression of melancholy and renunciation , made her fear he was taking this step for a reason that could not be named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; " but ef I come or no , do n't fret about me . Just remember this that I am tellin ' you now . The day I first saw you was the most fortunate day of my life . Ef I had n't a-met you , I should have died as I had lived -- like a creature without a soul . An ' now I have a soul , in you . An ' when I come to die , as I shall before many years , I shall die happy , thinkin ' how my old hands had served the sweetest woman under heaven , and how they had been touched by hers so kindly , many a time , when she condescended to serve me . " What could she say to a charge like this ? Yet say something she must , and so she answered , that he thought too highly of her , who was no better than other women ; but , that , since in his great singleness of heart , he did her this honor , to set her above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wish really to be what in his vivid imagination she seemed to him . Then she turned the talk upon less personal topics , and Willie was called and informed of the loss he was about to sustain ; upon which there was a great deal of childish questioning , and boyish regret for the good times no more to be that summer . " I should like to take care of your boat , " said he --  " your hunting-boat , I mean . If I had it over here , I would take mamma down to it every Saturday , and she could sew and do everything there , just as she does at home ; and it would be gay , now , would n't it ? " " The old boat is sold , my boy ; that an ' the row-boat , and the pony , too . You 'll have to wait till I come back for huntin ' , and fishin ' , and ridin ' . " Then Mrs. Smiley knew almost certainly that this visit was the last she would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to seem unaffected by the parting , and to talk of his return hopefully , the effort proved abortive , and conversation flagged . Still he sat there silent and nearly motionless through the whole evening , thinking what thoughts she guessed only too well . With a great sigh , at last he rose to go . " You will be sure to write at the end of your journey , and let us know how you find things there , and when you are coming back ? " " I will write , " said he ; " an ' I want you to write back and tell me that you remember what I advised you some time ago . " He took her hands , folded them in his own , kissed them reverently , and turned away . Mrs. Smiley watched him going down the garden-walk , as she had watched him a year before , and noted how slow and uncertain his steps had grown since then . At the gate he turned and waved his hand , and she in turn fluttered her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her head , and sobbed for full five minutes . " There are things in life one can not comprehend , " she muttered to herself , " things we can not dare to meddle with or try to alter ; Providences , I suppose , they are . If God had made a man like that for me , of my own age , and given him opportunities suited to his capacities , and he had loved me as this man loves , what a life ours would have been ! " The summer weather and bracing north-west breezes from the ocean renewed , in a measure , Mrs. Smiley 's health , and restored her cheerful spirits ; and , if she missed her old friend , she kept silent about it , as she did about most things that concerned herself . To Willie 's questioning she gave those evasive replies children are used to receive ; but she frequently told him , in talks about his future , that Mr. Chillis had promised to send him to college , and that as long as he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , Willie , " she never failed to add , " if ever you see an old man who is in need of anything ; food , or clothes , or shelter ; be very sure that you furnish them , as far as you are able . " She was teaching him to pay his debt : " for , inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these , " he had done it unto his benefactor . September came , and yet no news had arrived from beyond the mountains . Captain Rumway 's house was finished up to the last touch of varnish . The lawn , and the shrubbery , and fence were all just as they should be ; yet , so far as anybody knew , no mistress had been provided for them , when , one warm and hazy afternoon , Mrs. Smiley received an invitation to look at the completed mansion , and pass her judgment upon it . " I am going to furnish it in good style , " said its master , rather vauntingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so good as to give me your assistance in making out a list of the articles required to fit the house up perfectly , from parlor to kitchen . " " Any lady can furnish a list of articles for each room , Mr. Rumway , more or less costly , as you may order ; but only the lady who is to live in the house can tell you what will please her ; " and she smiled the very shadow of a superior smile . Mr. Rumway had foolishly thought to get his house furnished according to Mrs. Smiley 's taste , and now found he should have to consult Mrs. Rumway 's , present or prospective , and the discovery annoyed him . Yet , why should he be annoyed ? Was not the very opportunity presented that he had desired , of renewing his proposal to her to take the establishment in charge ? So , although it compelled him to change his programme , he accepted the situation , and seized the tide at flood . " It is that lady -- the one I entreat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more will you come ? " Mrs. Smiley , though persistently looking aside , had caught the eloquent glance of the Captain 's dark eyes , and something of the warmth of his face was reflected in her own . But she remained silent , looking at the distant highlands , without seeing them . " You must have seen , " he continued , " that notwithstanding your former answer , I have been bold enough to hope you might change your mind ; for , in everything I have done here , I have tried to follow your expressed wishes . I should in all else strive to make you as happy as by accepting this home you would make me . You do not answer ; shall I say it is ' yes ? ' " He bent so close that his dark , half-curling mop of hair just brushed her golden braids , and gave her a little shock like electricity , making her start away with a blush . " Will you give me time to decide upon my answer , Mr. Rumway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an agitated voice , " and , after making me suffer a week of suspense , refused me . " " I know it , " she said simply , " and I was sorry I had asked it ; but my reasons are even more imperative than they were then for wishing to delay . I want to decide right , at last , " she added , with a faint attempt at a smile . " That will be right which accords with your feelings , and certainly you can tell me now what they are -- whether you find me the least bit lovable or not . " The gray eyes flashed a look up into the dark eyes , half of mirth and half of real inquiry . " I think one might learn to endure you , Mr. Rumway , " she answered , demurely . " But "  - -  changing her manner --  " I can not tell you whether or not I can marry you , until -- until -- well , " she concluded desperately --  " it may be a day , or a week , or a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is decided , I can not give an answer . " Captain Rumway looked very rebellious . " I do not ask you to wait , Mr. Rumway , " said Mrs. Smiley , tormentingly . " Your house need not be long without a mistress . " " Of course , I must wait , if you give me the least ground of hope . This place was made for you , and no other woman shall ever come into it as my wife -- that I swear . If you will not have me , I will sell it , and live a bachelor . " Mrs. Smiley laughed softly and tunefully . " Perhaps you would prefer to limit your endurance , and tell me how long you will allow me to deliberate before you sell and retire to bachelorhood ? " " You know very well , " he returned , ruefully , " that I shall always be hoping against all reason that the wished-for answer was coming at last . " " Then we will say no more about it at present . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' has been decided ? " " Yes , if you have the patience for it . But , I warn you , there is a chance of my having to say ' No . ' " " If there is only a chance of your having to say ' No , ' I think I may incur the risk , " said Rumway , with a sudden accession of hopefulness ; and , as they walked home together once more , the gossips pronounced it an engagement . The Captain himself felt that it was , although , when he reviewed the conversation , he discovered that he founded his impression upon that one glance of the gray eyes , rather than upon anything that had been said . And Mrs. Smiley put the matter out of mind as much as possible , and waited . One day , about the last of the month , a letter came to her from over the mountains . It ran in this wise : " MY LOVELY LADY : I am once more among the familyar seanes of 40 year ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . I had rather be back at Clatsop , with the old bote ; but , owin ' to circumstances I ca n't controll , think it better to end my dais on this side ov the mountains . You need not look for me to come back , but I send you an ' the boy my best love , an ' hope you hav done as I advised . " Yours , faithfully , til deth , " JOE CHILLIS . " Soon after the receipt of this letter , Captain Rumway called to inquire concerning the settlement of the matter on which his marriage depended . That evening he stayed later than usual , and , in a long confidential talk which he had with Mrs. Smiley , learned that there was a condition attached to the consummation of his wishes , which required his recognition of the claims of " poor old Joe " to be considered a friend of the family . To do him justice , he yielded the point more gracefully than , from his consciousness of his own position , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " DEAR MR . CHILLIS : I shall move into the new house about the last of October , according to your advice . We -- that is , myself , and Willie , and the present owner of the house -- shall be delighted if you will come and stay with us . But if you decide to remain with your son , believe that we think of you very often and very affectionately , and wish you every possible happiness . R. agrees with me that the land ought to be deeded back to you ; and I think you had best return and get the benefit of it . It would make you very comfortable for life , properly managed , and about that we might help you . Please write and let us know what to do about it . " Yours affectionately , " ANNIE SMILEY . " No reply ever came to this letter ; and , as it was written ten years ago , Mrs. Rumway has ceased to expect any . Willie is about to enter College . HOW JACK HASTINGS SOLD HIS MINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the Humboldt Valley , just as morning brightened over the earth -- refreshing eyes wearied with yesterday 's mountains and canons , by a vision of green willows and ash trees , a stream that was not a torrent , and a stretch of grassy country . Among the faces oftenest turned to the flitting views was that of a young , gracefully-formed , neatly-dressed , delicate-looking woman . The large brown eyes often returned from gazing at the landscape , to scan with seriousness some memoranda she held in her hand . " Arrive at Elko at eight o'clock a.m. " said the memorandum . Consulting a tiny watch , whose hands pointed to ten minutes of eight , the lady began making those little preparations which betoken the journey 's end at hand . " What a strange looking place it is ! " she thought , as the motley collection of board shanties and canvas houses came in sight ; for the famous Chloride District had been discovered but a few months before , and the Pacific Railroad was only four weeks open . " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see how I am to find the stage agent to give him Jack 's letter . What a number of people ! " This mental ejaculation was called forth by the sight of the long platform in front of the eating-house , crowded with a surging mass of humanity just issuing from the dining-room . They were the passengers of the eastward-bound train , ready to rush headlong for the cars when the momently-expected " All aboard ! " should be shouted at them by the conductor . Into this crowd the freshly-arrived passengers of the westward-bound train were a moment after ejected -- each eyeing the other with a natural and pardonable interest . The brown-eyed , graceful young lady conducted herself in a very business-like manner -- presenting the checks for her baggage ; inquiring out the office of Wells , Fargo &; Co. , and handing in her letter , all in the briefest possible time . Having secured a seat in a coach to Chloride Hill , with the promise of the agent to call for her when the time for departure arrived , the lady repaired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train departing . Sitting down alone to a hastily-cooked and underdone repast , she was about finishing a cup of bitter black coffee with a little shudder of disgust , when a gentleman seated himself opposite her at table . The glance the stranger cast in her direction was rather a lingering one ; then he ordered his breakfast and ate it . Meanwhile the lady retired to the ladies ' sitting-room . After an hour of waiting , one , two , three , coaches rolled past the door , and the lady began to fear she had been forgotten , when the polite agent appeared to notify " Mrs. Hastings " that " the stage was ready . " This was Mrs. Alice Hastings , then -- wife of Mr. Jack Hastings , of Deep Canon , Chloride District . The agent thought Mr. Hastings had a very pretty wife , and expressed his opinion in his manner , as men will . When , just before starting , there entered three of the roughest-looking men she had ever encountered , Mrs. Hastings began to fear that in his zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in packing the first three coaches with first-comers , had left this one to catch up the fag end of travel . If the first impression , gained from sight , had made her shrink a little , what was her dismay when , at the end of ten minutes , one of her fellow-travelers -- the only American of the three -- produced a bottle of brandy , which , having offered it first to her , he passed to the bullet-headed Irishman and very shabby Jew : repeating the courtesy once in twenty minutes for several times . Mrs. Hastings was a brave sort of woman , where courage was needful ; and she now began to consider the case in hand with what coolness she could command . One hundred and thirty miles -- eighteen or twenty hours of such companionship -- with no chance of change or intermission ; a wilderness country to travel over , and all the other coaches a long way ahead . The dainty denizen of a city home , shuddering inwardly , showed outwardly a serene countenance . Her American friend , with wicked black eyes and a jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy at short intervals . " Best take some , Madame , " said he ; " this dust will choke you if you do n't . " " Thanks , " returned the lady , with her sweetest smile , " I could not drink brandy . I have wine in my traveling-basket , should I need it ; but much prefer water . " At the next station , although hardly four minutes were lost in changing horses , the men procured for her a cup of water . Mrs. Hastings ' thanks were frank and cordial . She even carefully opened a conversation about the country they were passing over , and contrived to get them to ask a question or two about herself . When they learned that she had come all the way from New York on the newly-opened railroad , their interest was at its height ; and when they heard that she was going to join her husband in the Chloride District , their sympathy was thoroughly enlisted . " Wonderful -- such a journey ! How she could be six days on the cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is astonishing . " Such were the American 's comments . The Jew thought of the waiting husband -- for your Israelite is a man of domestic and family affections . " Her husband looking for her , and she behind time ! How troubled he must be ! Did n't he know how it was ? Was n't his wife gone away on a visit once , and did n't write ; and he a running to the express office every morning and evening for a letter , and getting so anxious as to telegraph ? Such an expense and loss of time !  - -  and all because he felt so uneasy about his wife ! " The bullet-headed young Irishman said nothing . He was about half asleep from brandy and last night 's travel ; too stupid to know that his hat had flown out of the window , and was bowling along in the wind and dust half a mile behind -- all the better for his head , which looked at a red heat now . The lady had lifted the rude men up to her level , when directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to show instinctive traits of gentlemen . By the time they arrived at the dinner station , where half an hour was allowed for food and rest out of the eighteen or twenty , she had at least two humble servitors , who showed great concern for her comfort . The day began to wane . They had traveled continuously over a long stretch of plain between two mountain ranges , over a country entirely uninhabited except by the stage company 's employees , who kept the stations and tended the stock . This lone woman had seen but one other woman on the road . Plenty of teams -- great " prairie schooners , " loaded with every conceivable thing for supplying the wants of an isolated non-producing community , and drawn by ten or fourteen mules -- had been passed through the day . As night fell , Mrs. Hastings saw what she had never before seen or imagined -- the camps of these teamsters by the roadside ; horses and mules staked , or tied to the wagons ; the men lying prone upon the earth , wrapped in blankets , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did people really live in that way ?  - -  how many superfluous things were there in a city ! The night was moonless and clear , and cold as at that altitude they always are . Sleep , from the roughness of the road , was impossible . Her companions dozed , and woke with exclamations when the heavy lurchings of the coach disturbed them too roughly . Mrs. Hastings never closed her eyes . When morning dawned , they were on the top of a range of mountains , like those that had been in sight all the day before . Down these heights they rattled away , and at four in the morning entered the streets of Chloride Hill -- a city of board and canvas houses . Arrived at the stage office , the lady looked penetratingly into the crowd of men always waiting for the stages , but saw no face she recognized . Yes , one -- and that the face of the gentleman who sat down opposite her at table in Elko . " Permit me , " he said ; " I think you inquired for Mr. Hastings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected to find him here , " she replied , feeling that sense of injury and desire to cry which tired women feel , jostled about in a crowd of men . Leaving her a moment to say something to an employee of the office , the stranger returned immediately , saying to the man : " Take this lady to Mrs. Robb 's boarding-house . " Then to her : " I will inquire for your husband , and send him to you if he is in town . The hack does not go over to Deep Canon for several hours yet . Meanwhile you had better take some rest . You must be greatly fatigued . " Fatigued ! her head swam round and round ; and she really was too much exhausted to feel as disappointed as she might at Jack 's non-appearance . Much relieved by the prospect of a place to rest in , she followed the man summoned to escort her , and fifteen minutes after was sound asleep on a sofa of the boarding-house . Three hours of sleep and a partial bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although her head still felt absurdly light , Mrs. Hastings enjoyed the really excellent breakfast provided for her , wondering how such delicacies ever got to Chloride Hill . Breakfast over , and no news of Jack , the time began to drag wearily . She was more than half inclined to be angry -- only relenting when she remembered that she was two or three days behind time , and of course Jack could not know when to expect her . She had very full directions , and if she could not find her way to Deep Canon she was a goose , that was all ! So she sent for the driver of the hack , told him to get her baggage from the express office ; and started for Deep Canon . Who should she find in the hack but her friend of the morning ! " I could not hear of your husband , " said he ; " but you are sure to find him at home . " Mrs. Hastings smiled faintly , and hoped she should . Then she gave her thoughts to the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descent , as they whirled rapidly down the four miles of canon at the bottom of which was the town of that name -- another one of those places which had " come up as a flower " in a morning . She longed to ask about her husband and his " home " ; but as there were several persons in the stage , she restrained her anxiety , and said never a word until they stopped before the door of a saloon where all the other passengers alighted . Then she told the driver she wanted to be taken to Mr. Hastings ' house . He did n't know where that was , he said , but would inquire . Did he know Dr. Earle ? " That 's him , ma'am ; " pointing out her friend of the morning . " How can I serve you ? " he asked , raising his hat politely . Mrs. Hastings blushed rosily , between vexation at Jack 's invisibility and confusion at being so suddenly confronted with Dr. Earle . " Mr. Hastings instructed me to inquire of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , apologetically . " I will show you his place with pleasure , " returned the Doctor pleasantly ; and , jumping on the box , proceeded to direct the driver . Had ladies of Mrs. Hastings ' style been as plenty in Deep Canon as in New York , the driver would have grumbled at the no road he had to follow along the stony side of a hill and among the stumps of mahogany trees . But there were few like her in that mountain town , and his chivalry compelled him to go out of his way with every appearance of cheerfulness . Presently the stage stopped where the sloping ground made it very uncertain how long it could maintain its balance in that position ; and the voice of Dr. Earle was heard saying " This is the place . " Mrs. Hastings , who had been looking out for some sign of home , was seized with a doubt of the credibility of her senses . It was on the tip of her tongue to say " This must be the house of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said nothing . Getting out and going toward the house to inquire , the door opened , and a man in a rough mining suit came quickly forward to meet her . " Alice ! " " Jack ! " Dr. Earle and the driver studiously looked the other way while salutations were exchanged between Mr. and Mrs. Hastings . When they again ventured a look , the lady had disappeared within the cabin , the first glimpse of which had so dismayed her . That afternoon , Jack initiated Alice into the mysteries of cooking by an open fire , and expatiated largely on the merits of his outside kitchen . Alice hinted to him that she was accustomed to sleep on something softer than a board , and the two went together to a store to purchase materials out of which to make a mattress . After that , for two or three weeks , Mrs. Hastings was industriously engaged in wondering what her husband meant when he wrote that he had built a house , and was getting things ready to receive her . Reason or romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of rough boards , roofed with leaky canvas and unfurnished with a single comfort of life , into a house or home . At last , Jack seemed to guess her thoughts , for she never spoke them . " If I could sell my mine , " he then often said , " I could fix things up . " " If you sold your mine , Jack , you would go back to New York , and then there would be no need of fixing up this place . " Alice wanted to say " horrid " place , but refrained . At length , from uncongenial air , water , food , and circumstances in general , the transplanted flower began to droop . The great heat and rarified mountain air caused frantic headaches , aggravated by the glare which came through the white canvas roof . Then came the sudden mountain tempests , when the rain deluged everything , and it was hard to find a spot to stand in where the water did not drip through . She grew wild , looking forever at bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night over their tops up to the piercing stars . A constant anxious fever burnt in her blood , that the cold night air could not quench , though she often left her couch to let it blow chilly over her , in her loose night robes . Then she fell really ill . Sitting by her bedside , Jack said : " If I could sell my mine ! " And she had answered , " let the mine go , Jack , and let us go home . Nothing is gained by stopping in this dreadful place . " Then Mr. Hastings had replied to her , " I have no money , Alice , to go home with , not a cent . I borrowed ten dollars of Earle to-day to buy some fruit for you . " That was the last straw that broke the camel 's back . By night Mrs. Hastings was delirious , and Dr. Earle was called . " She has a nervous fever , " he said , " and needs the carefullest nursing . " " Which she can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profanely . " Why do n't you try to get something to do ? " asked Earle of the sad-visaged husband , a day or two after . " What is there to do ? Everything is flat ; there is neither business nor money in this cursed country . I 've stayed here trying to sell my mine , until I 'm dead broke ; nothing to live on here , and nothing to get out with . What I 'm to do with my wife there , I do n't know . Let her die , perhaps , and throw her bones up that ravine to bleach in the sun . God ! what a position to be in ! " " But you certainly must propose to do something , and that speedily . Could n't you see it was half that that brought this illness on your wife ; the inevitable which she saw closing down upon you ? " " If I can not sell my mine soon , I 'll blow out my brains , as that poor German did last week . Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think it hastened on her sickness . " " And so you propose to treat her to another such scene , and put an end to her ? " said Earle , savagely . " Better so than to let her starve , " Jack returned , growing pale with the burden of possibilities which oppressed him . " How the devil I am to save her from that last , I do n't know . There is neither business , money , nor credit in this infernal town . I 've been everywhere in this district , asking for a situation at something , and can not get anything better than digging ground on the new road . " " Even that might be better than starving , " said Dr. Earle . Jack was a faithful nurse ; Dr. Earle an attentive physician ; young people with elastic constitutions die hard : so Alice began to mend , and in a fortnight was convalescent . Jack got a situation in a quartz mill where the Doctor was part owner . Left all day alone in the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls inclosed her on every side . The bright scarlet and yellow flowers which grew out of their parched soil sometimes tempted her to a brief walk ; but the lightness of the air fatigued her , and she did not care to clamber after them . One day , being lonely , she thought to please Jack by dressing in something pretty and going to the mill to see him . So , laying aside the wrapper which she had worn almost constantly lately , she robed herself in a delicate linen lawn , donned a coquettish little hat and parasol , and set out for the mill , a mile away . Something in the thought of the pleasant surprise it would be to Jack gave her strength and animation ; and though she arrived somewhat out of breath , she looked as dainty and fresh as a rose , and Jack was immensely proud and flattered . He introduced her to the head of the firm , showed her over the mill , pointed out to her the mule-train packing wood for the engine fires , got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed his delight . After an hour or so she thought about going home ; but the walk home looked in prospect very much longer than the walk to the mill . In truth , it was harder by reason of being up-hill . But opportunely , as it seemed , just as Jack was seeing her off the door-stone of the office , Dr. Earle drove up , and , comprehending the situation , offered to take Mrs. Hastings to her own door in his carriage , if she would graciously allow him five minutes to see the head man in . When they were seated in the carriage , a rare luxury in Deep Canon ; and had driven a half mile in embarrassed silence -- for Mrs. Hastings somehow felt ashamed of her husband 's dependence upon this man ,  - -  the Doctor spoke , and what he said was this : " Your life is very uncongenial to you ; you wish to escape from it , do n't you ? " " Yes , I wish to escape ; that is the word which suits my feeling -- a very strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Doctor , almost eagerly . " Ever since I left the railroad , in the midst of a wilderness and was borne for so many hours away into the heart of a still more desert wilderness , my consciousness of things has been very much confused . I can only with difficulty realize that there is any such place as New York ; and San Francisco is a fable . The world seems a great bare mountain plane ; and I am hanging on to its edge by my fingertips , ready to drop away into space . Can you account for such impressions ? " " Easily , if I chose . May I tell you something ? " " What is it ? " " I 've half a mind to run away with you . " Now , as Dr. Earle was a rather young and a very handsome man , had been very kind , and was now looking at her with eyes actually moistened with tears , a sudden sense of being on the edge of a pitfall overcame Mrs. Hastings ; and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct of a pure woman , to avoid recognizing an ugly thought , she answered with a laugh as gay as she could make it . " If you were a witch , and offered me half of your broomstick to New York , I do n't know but I should take it ;  - -  that is , if there was room on it anywhere for Jack . " " There would n't be , " said the Doctor , and said no more . The old fever seemed to have returned that afternoon . The hills glared so that Mrs. Hastings closed the cabin door to shut out the burning vision . The ground-squirrels , thinking from the silence that no one was within , ran up the mahogany tree at the side , and scampered over the canvas roof in glee . One , more intent on gain than the rest , invaded Jack 's outside kitchen , knocking down the tin dishes with a clang , and scattering the dirt from the turf roof over the flour-sack and the two white plates . Every sound made her heart beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she reopened the door ; and then a rough-looking man came to the entrance , to inquire if there were any silver leads up the ravine . Leads ? she could not say : prospectors in plenty there were . Then he went his way , having satisfied his curiosity ; and the door was closed again . Some straggling donkeys wandered near , which were mistaken for " Diggers ; " and dreading their glittering eyes , the nervous prisoner drew the curtain over the one little sliding window . There was nothing to read , nothing to sew , no housekeeping duties , because no house to keep ; she was glad when the hour arrived for preparing the late afternoon meal . That night she dreamed that she was a skeleton lying up the canon -- the sunshine parching her naked bones ; that Dr. Earle came along with a pack-train going to the mill , and picking her up carefully , laid her on top of a bundle of wood ; that the Mexican driver covered her up with a blanket , which so smothered her that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of suffocation continuing , she stole softly to the door , and opening it , let the chilly night air blow over her . Most persons would have found Mr. Hastings ' house freely ventilated , but some way poor Alice found it hard to breathe in it . The summer was passing ; times grew , if possible , harder than before . The prospectors , who had found plenty of " leads , " had spent their " bottom dollar " in opening them up and in waiting for purchasers , and were going back to California any way they could . The capitalists were holding off , satisfied that in the end all the valuable mines would fall into their hands , and caring nothing how fared the brave but unlucky discoverers . In fact , they overshot themselves , and made hard times for their own mills , the miners having to stop getting out rock . Then Jack lost his situation . Very soon food began to be scarce in the cabin of Mr. Hastings . Scanty as it was , it was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she craved . If she ate for a day or two , for the next two or three days she suffered with nausea and aversion to anything which the outside kitchen afforded . Jack seldom mentioned his mine now , and looked haggard and hopeless . The conversation between her husband and Dr. Earle , recorded elsewhere , had been overheard by Alice , lying half conscious ; and she had never forgotten the threat about blowing out his brains in case he failed to sell his mine . Trifling as such an apprehension may appear to another , it is not unlikely that it had its effect to keep up her nervous condition . The summer was going -- was gone . Mrs. Hastings had not met Dr. Earle for several weeks ; and , despite herself , when the worst fears oppressed her , her first impulse was to turn to him . It had always seemed so easy for him to do what he liked ! Perhaps he was growing anxious to know if he could give the thumb-screw another turn . At all events , he directed his steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last day in August . Mrs. Hastings received him at the threshold and offered him the camp-stool -- the only chair she had -- in the shade outside the door ; at the same time seating herself upon the door-step with the same grace as if it had been a silken sofa . She was not daintily dressed this afternoon ; for that luxury , like others , calls for the expenditure of a certain amount of money , and money Alice had not -- not even enough to pay a Chinaman for " doing up " one of her pretty muslins . Neither had she the facilities for doing them herself , had she been skilled in that sort of labor ; for even to do your own washing and ironing pre-supposes the usual conveniences of a laundry , and these did not belong to the furniture of the outside kitchen . She had not worn her linen lawn since the visit to the mill . The dust which blew freely through every crack of the shrunken boards precluded such extravagance . Thus it happened that a soiled cashmere wrapper was her afternoon wear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canon ; but still looked pretty and graceful , and rather too spirituelle . The Doctor held in his hand , on the point of a knife , the flower of a cactus very common in the mountains , which he presented her , warning her at the same time against its needle-like thorns . " It makes me sick , " said Alice hastily , throwing it away . " It is the color of gold , which I want so much ; and of the sunshine , which I hate so . " " I brought it to you to show you the little emerald bee that is always to be found in one : it is wonderously beautiful ,  - -  a living gem , is it not ? " " Yes , I know , " Alice said , " I admired the first one I saw ; but I admire nothing any longer -- nothing at least which surrounds me here . " " I understand that , of course , " returned the Doctor . " It is because your health is failing you -- because the air disagrees with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he could only get away from here -- and I ! " The vanity of such a supposition , in their present circumstances , brought the tears to her eyes and a quiver about her mouth . " Why did you ever come here ! Why did he ever ask you to come ;  - -  how dared he ? " demanded the Doctor , setting his teeth together . " That is a strange question , Doctor ! " Mrs. Hastings answered with dignity , lifting her head like an antelope . " My husband was deceived by the same hopes which have ruined others . If I suffer , it is because we are both unfortunate . " " What will he do next ? " questioned the Doctor curtly . The cruel meaning caused the blood to forsake her cheeks . " I can not tell what he will do , "  - -  her brief answer rounded by an expressive silence . " You might help him : shall I point out the way to you ? "  - -  watching her intently . " Can you ? can I help him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Earle looked into her eager face with a passion of jealous inquiry that made her cast down her eyes : " Alice , do you love this Hastings ? " He called her Alice ; he used a tone and asked a question which could not be misunderstood . Mrs. Hastings dropped her face into her hands , her hands upon her knees . She felt like a wild creature which the dogs hold at bay . She knew now what the man meant , and the temptation he used . " Alice , " he said again , " this man , your husband , possesses a prize he does not value ; or does not know how to care for . Shall you stay here and starve with him ? Is he worth it ? " " He is my husband , " she answered simply , lifting up her face , calm , if mortally pale . " And I might be your husband , after a brief interval , " he said quickly . " There would have to be a divorce ; it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself to dishonor . I will shield you ; no care shall fall upon you , nor any reproach . Consider this well , dearest darling Alice ! and what will be your fate if you depend upon him . " " Will it help him then , to desert him ? " she asked faintly . " Yes , unless by remaining with him you can insure his support . Maintain you he can not . Suppose his mine were sold , he would waste that money as he wasted what he brought here . I do n't want his mine , yet I will buy it tomorrow if that will satisfy you , and I have your promise to go with me . I told you once that I wanted to run away with you , and now I mean to . Shall I tell you my plan ? " " No , not to-day , " Mrs. Hastings answered , struggling with her pain and embarrassment ; " I could not bear it to-day , I think . " " How cruel I am while meaning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in your weak state . Shall I see you to-morrow -- a professional visit , you know ? " " You will buy the mine ? "  - -  faintly , with something like a blush . " Certainly ; I swear I will -- on what conditions , you know . " " On none other ? " " Shall I rob myself , not of money only , but of what is far dearer ?  - -  On none other . " He rose , took her cold hand , clasped it fervently , and went away . When Jack came home to his very meagre dinner , he brought a can of peaches , which , being opened , looked so deliciously cool and tempting that Alice could not refrain from volubly exulting over them . " But how did you get them , Jack ? " she asked ; " not by going into debt , I hope . " " No . I was in Scott 's store , and Earle , happening to come in just as Scott was selling some , and praising them highly , paid for a can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your opinion . They are splendid , by Jove ! " " I do not fancy them , " said Alice , setting down her plate ; " but do n't tell the Doctor , " she added hastily . " You do n't fancy anything , lately , Alice , " Mr. Hastings replied , rather crossly . " Never mind , Jack ; my appetite will come when you have sold your mine ; " and upon that the unreasonably fastidious woman burst into tears . " As if my position is not trying enough without seeing you cry ! " said Jack , pausing from eating long enough to look injured . Plastic Jack ! your surroundings were having their effect on you . The Mining News of the second of September had a notice of the sale of Mr. Hastings ' mine , the " Sybil , " bearing chloride of silver , to Dr. Eustance Earle , all of Deep Canon . The papers to be handed over and cash paid down at Chloride Hill on the seventh ; at which time Dr. Earle would start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he belonged . Mr. Hastings , it was understood , would go east about the same time . All the parties were at Chloride Hill on the morning of the seventh , promptly . By eleven o'clock , the above-mentioned transaction was completed . Shortly after , one of the Opposition Line 's stages stopped at Mrs. Robb 's boarding-house , and a lady , dressed for traveling , stepped quickly into it . Having few acquaintances , and being closely veiled , the lady passed unrecognized at the stage-office , where the other passengers got in . Half an hour afterwards Mr. Jack Hastings received the following note : " DEAR JACK : I sold your mine for you . Dr. Earle is running away with me , per agreement ; but if you take the express this afternoon , you will reach Elko before the train leaves for San Francisco to-morrow . There is nothing worth going back for at Deep Canon . If you love me , save me . " Devotedly , " ALICE . " It is superfluous to state that Jack took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made him master of the situation . Not that he felt very masterful ; he did n't . He was thinking of many things that it hurt him to remember ; but he was meaning to do differently in future . He had at last sold his mine -- no , he 'd be d --  -- d if he had sold it ; but -- Hallo ! there 's a big dust out on the road there ! it must be the other stage . Think what you 'll do and say , Jack Hastings ! What he did say was : " Ah , Doctor ! you here ? It was lucky for my wife , was n't it , since I got left , to have you to look after her ? Thanks , old fellow ; you are just in time for the train . Alice and I will stop over a day to rest . A thousand times obliged : good-bye ! Alice , say good-bye to Doctor Earle ! you will not see him again . " Their hands and eyes met . He was pale as marble : she flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression in her eyes which the Doctor never forgot and never quite understood . It was enough to know that the game was up . He had another mine on his hands , and an ugly pain in his heart which he told himself bitterly would be obstinate of cure . If he only could be sure what that look in her eyes had meant ! WHAT THEY TOLD ME AT WILSON 'S BAR . The mining season was ended in the narrow valley of one of the Sacramento 's northern tributaries , as , in fact , it was throughout the whole region of " placer diggings ; " for it was October of a dry year , and water had failed early in all the camps . The afternoon of a long , idle day at Wilson 's Bar was drawing to a close . The medium through which the sun 's hot rays reached the parched earth was one of red dust , the effect of which was that of a mellow Indian summer haze , pleasing to the eye , if abhorred by the skin and lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human . In the landscape was an incongruous mingling of beauty and deformity ; the first , the work of nature ; the last , the marring of man . To the east and to the west rose hills , whose ruggedness was softened by distance to outlines of harmonious grandeur . Scattered over the valley between them , the stately " digger , " or nut-pines , grew at near intervals , singly or in groups of three or five , harmonizing by their pale gray-green with the other half-tints of earth , air , and sky . Following the course of the dried up river was a line , more or less continuous , of the evergreen oaks , whose round , spreading tops are such a grateful relief to the eye in the immense levels of the lower Sacramento and upper San Joaquin valleys . Depending from these , hung long , venerable-looking beards of gray moss , as devoid of color as everything else in the landscape ; everything else , except the California wild grape , which , so far from being devoid of color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreground of the picture . Growing in clumps upon the ground , it was gay as a bed of tulips . Clambering up occasional tall trees , it flaunted its crimson and party-colored foliage with true bacchanalian jollity , each leaf seeming drunk with its own red wine . There is truly nothing that grows in the Golden State more beautiful than the Vitus Californica in October . That was Nature 's side of the picture . The reverse was this : the earth everywhere torn and disfigured by prospectors , whose picks had produced the effect of some huge snout of swine , applied with the industry characteristic of that animal in forbidden grounds . Rude cabins were scattered about , chiefly in the neighborhood of the stream . Rockers , sluice-boxes , and sieves strewed its borders . Along the dusty road which led to Wilson 's Bar toiled heavily laden trains of freight-wagons , carrying supplies for the coming winter . At each little deviation from the general level , the eight-mule teams strained every muscle ; the dust-enswathed drivers swore frantically and whipped mercilessly ; the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however much the pained observer might wish to bring it to a stand-still . A rosy sunset beyond the western mountains was casting its soft glamour over the scene -- happily not without one appreciative beholder -- when Bob Matheny 's wagon drew up in front of the Traveler 's Rest , the principal hotel of Wilson 's Bar . From the commotion which ensued immediately thereupon , it would appear that Matheny was a person widely and also somewhat favorably known ; such ejaculations as " Hulloa ! thar 's Bob Matheny , " " How-dy , old feller ! " and many other similar expressions of welcome greeting him on all sides , as he turned from blocking the wheels of his wagon , which else might have backed down the slight incline that led to Traveler 's Rest . At the same moment that the hand-shaking was progressing , a young woman , mounted on a handsome filly , rode up to the rude steps of the hotel and prepared to dismount ; and Bob Matheny instantly broke away from his numerous friends , to lift her from the saddle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a whisper ran round it , half audible , to the effect that Bob had " bin gittin ' married , " " A dog-goned purty gal , " " The old cock 's puttin ' on frills , " and similar appropriate remarks , ad infinitum . In the meantime -- the young woman disappearing within the hotel , and Matheny occupying himself firstly with the wants of his team , and lastly with his own and those of his traveling companion -- gossip had busily circulated the report among the idlers of Wilson 's Bar that Bob Matheny had taken to himself a young wife , who was accompanying him on his monthly trip to the mountains . This report was published with the usual verbal commentaries , legends , and annotations ; as relevant and piquant as that sort of gossip usually is , and as elegant as , from the dialect of Wilson 's Bar , might be expected . Late that evening , a group of honest miners discussed the matter in the Star Empire Saloon . " He 's the last man I 'd a-suspected ov doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a manly grief upon his honest countenance , as he hid the ace and right-bower under the brim of his ragged old sombrero , and proceeded to play the left upon the remainder of that suit -- with emphasis , " the very last man ! " " It 's a powerful temptation to a feller in his shoes , " remarked the tall Kentuckian on his right . " A young gal is a mighty purty thing to look at , and takes a man 's mind off from his misfortin 's . You mind the verse , do n't ye : ' Sorrows I divide , and joys I double ? ' " " And give this world a world o ' trouble , " subjoined Davis 's partner , with a good natured laugh at his own wit . " It 's your deal , Huxly . Look and see if all the cards are in the pack . Deuced if I do n't suspect somebody 's hidin ' them . " " Every keerd 's thar thet I hed in my hands , ef you mean me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mean you . A feller may have his little joke , I suppose . " " Depends on the kind o ' jokes . Here 's the two missin ' keerds on the floor . Now , ef you say I put ' em thar , it 's a little joke I reckon I wo n't stand . Sabe ? " " Come , I 'll pay for the drinks , old fel ' , if you 'll allow me to apologize . Waiter , drinks all round . What 'll you take , gentlemen ? " " Now , that 's what I call blarsted ' an'some , " remarked Huxley , who was an Englishman from Australia : " ' Friend of me soul , this goblet sip , ' Twill dry the starting tear ; ' T is not so bright as woman 's lip , But oh , ' t is more sincere ! ' " Here 's to ye , me hearties . " " Which brings us back to our subject , " responded Davis 's partner , commonly called " Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Do you believe in curses , Kentuck ? " " B'lieve in cusses ? Do n't the Bible tell about cussin ' ? Was n't thar an old man in the Bible -- I disremember his name -- that cussed one of his sons , and blessed t' other one ? I reckon I do b'lieve in cussin ' . " His interlocutor laughed softly at the statement and argument . " Did you ever know any body to be cursed in such a manner that it was plain he was under a ban of unintermitting vengeance ? " " Ef you mean did I ever know a man as was cussed , I ken say I did , once . He was a powerful mean man -- a nigger-driver down in Tennessee . He was orful to swear , and cruel to the niggers , an ' his wife besides . One day she died an ' left a mite of a baby ; an ' he was so mad he swore he ' would n't bury her ; the neighbors might bury her , an ' the brat , too , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a-tearin ' with all his might , an ' a-callin ' on God to cuss him ef he did n't do so an ' so , all of a suddent , just as his mouth opened with a oath , he was struck speechless , an ' never has spoke a word till this day !  - -  leastways , not that I ever heard ov . " " That is what I should call a special example of Divine wrath , " said Gentleman Bill , deftly dealing the cards for a new game . " What I meant to ask was , whether any one , yourself especially , had ever known one man to curse another man so as to bring ruin upon him , in spite of his will to resist it . " " Waal , I 've heern tell of sech things ; ca n't say as I know such a man , without it 's Bob Matheny . He says he 's cussed ; an ' I reckon he is . Everybody in Wilson 's Bar has heern about that . " " Not everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that why Mr. Davis objected so strongly to his marriage ? I begin to be interested . Count me another game , partner . I should like to hear about Mr. Matheny . " " You may tell the story , Davis , " said Kentuck , magnanimously . " I want ter chaw terbacker fur awhile , an ' I ca n't talk an ' chaw . " Tom Davis gladly took up the theme , as it gave him an opportunity to display his oratorical and rhetorical abilities , of which he was almost as proud as he was of his skill in hiding cards in his sleeves , his hat , his hair , his boots . " Gentlemen , " he began , hesitating an instant -- while , attention being fixed on what he was about to say , he stocked the cards --  " gentlemen , it 's one of the curusest things you ever heerd in yer life . It seems thar was a woman at the bottom of it -- I believe thar allers is at the bottom of everything .

Ef it wor children , they should grow up , and turn agin ' him ; or , if they stuck to him , the same curse should be on them ; what they undertook should fail ; what they loved should die . " " Did the woman he loved die ? did his children desert him ? " asked the Englishman , eagerly .

But Bob says he do n't see what 's the use ; somethin 's sure to happen her ; somethin ' allers does happen to him an ' to his chillern . " " Is that why he thinks he 's cursed -- because ' something always happens ? ' " asked Gentleman Bill , indifferently . " Sart'in ; an ' it 's so , as sure as yer born . Nothin ' never pans out long with Bob Matheny . His beginnin 's is all good , an ' his endin 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's Bar has been cleaned eout , down to the bed-rock , as often as Matheny . " " Is he a good man ? " asked the Englishman , interested . " Never had a better man to Wilson 's Bar , " responded Kentuck , decidedly , as he cast his quid under the table . " He ai n't a lucky feller , an ' he 's mighty superstitious an ' the like ; but I make a heap o ' Bob Matheny . His luck an ' his cuss do n't hurt him none for me . It 's jest a notion , mebbe . " " Notion or no notion , " said Davis , with a knowing leer , " he 's not the man to marry a nice gal like that ' un he 's got up to the Rest . Better let her be for some lucky young feller as could make her happy . Do n't you say so , boys ? " While the laugh went round , the crowd that had been gradually collecting and listening to the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the man so much talked of forced his way toward the group of speakers . " Hold yer tongue , Tom Davis , " said Kentuck . " Hulloa , Bob ! take my hand , wo n't ye ? I 'll introduce ye to my friends . My pardner is Huxly -- a tip-top feller , as you 'll diskiver fur yerself . Davis ' pardner is Randolph -- Gentleman Bill , we call him fur short , he 's so nice and perlite . He 's from yer State , too , I reckon . " " Randolphs of Booneville , " said Gentleman Bill ; rising and extending his hand . Matheny , who was a mild-looking man of about fifty , with a hesitating manner and rather care-worn countenance , half concealed under a wide-brimmed , dusty black hat , instead of meeting half-way the extended hand of his friend 's friend , thrust his own into his pockets and gazed fixedly at young Randolph . " Be ye Boone Randolph , or be ye his spirit ? " he asked , hoarsely . " Neither , quite , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed . " I am son of Boone Randolph of Booneville , if you know who he was . " Matheny turned and hurried out of the crowd , followed by Kentuck , who wanted to have explained this singular conduct of Bob 's towards his friends . As there was no witness of their conversation , its meaning can only be guessed at by another which took place two hours later , after Matheny had turned in at the Traveler 's Rest . It was late , even for him , when Kentuck started for his lodgings at the other end of the long , densely crowded street -- crowded not only with buildings of wood and canvas , but choked up with monstrous freight wagons , and their numerous horse and mule-teams , for which there was not stable-room enough in all Wilson 's Bar . Stumbling along the uneven sidewalk , often touching with his feet some unhoused vagabond , Kentuck was about to mount the stairs which led to his bedroom , when some one touched him on the shoulder , and the voice of Gentleman Bill addressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been with Matheny , have n't you ? I want to know why he would n't shake hands . He told you , of course ? " " Waal , I 'm a friend of Bob 's , ye know , Bill ; an ' he is mighty rough on you , sure . Better not say nothin ' about it . " " That would n't suit me , Kentuck . I want to understand something about the matter which concerns me so evidently . Come , out with it , and I 'll leave you to go to bed . " " Waal , you heerd Tom Davis ' blab this evenin ' ; an ' you know that Bob 's got the idee into his intelleck that the cuss of a sart'in man as he once wronged is a-stickin ' to him yit , an ' never will let loose till he passes in his checks ? " " Who was the man ? " " Boone Randolph , of Booneville . " " My father ? " " Yaas , yer pap . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sez he to me : ' Loh ! that 's the ornary whelp ov the devil that cussed me . Old 's I am I 'd like to fight him , fur the sake o ' the man that I knowed once . I feel my young blood a-risin ' ; he looks so mighty like Boone Randolph . ' But I tole him he war a fool to talk ov fightin ' yer ; ye 'd whip him all ter flinders . " " I would n't fight him , of course : he 's too old for me . And then he 's just married , too , is n't he ? I have no wish to make that young woman a widow . " " A widow ! " said Kentuck , laughing . " That girl 's name is Anne Matheny ; but she ai n't Bob 's wife , not by a long shot . Why , she 's Bob 's darter , as has just come out to see her old pap . " " Well , I like that . I am less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . I must find a way to make friends with him , even if I have to quarrel with him to do it . Good-night , Kentuck . Pleasant dreams to you . " Gentleman Bill felt more than ordinarily wide-awake , whether it was from the novel excitement of the brief encounter with Matheny or not . When Kentuck had left him , he stood for some time irresolute , with no wish for rest , and no desire to go anywhere in particular . He looked up to the sky . It was murky with filmy fog-clouds and dust not yet settled to the earth . Not a star was visible in the whole arch of heaven . He looked down the street , and his eyes , accustomed to the darkness , could just faintly distinguish the outlines of the wagons that crowded it . Every sound was hushed , except the occasional movement of a restless animal , or the deep sighing of a sleeping one . Not a light was burning anywhere along the street . While gazing aimlessly into the gloom he saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky , a sudden illumination spring up , and a column of flame stand erect over the Traveler 's Rest . Now , Wilson 's Bar did not boast a fire company . At some seasons of the year , had a fire broken out , there would have been a chance of its extinguishment , inflammable as were the materials of which the place was built ; but just after the long , hot summer , when the river was all but dried up , and every plank in houses , fences , and sidewalks so much tinder , a fire that should get under headway would have everything its own way . Seeing the danger , Gentleman Bill started down the street on a run , shouting , in his clarion tones , that ever-thrilling cry of " Fire ! fire ! fire ! " till it seemed to him he must wake the dead . But it was that hour of the night , or rather morning , when sleep is heaviest , and the watchful senses off their guard . The teamsters , who slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they , seeing the peril which might come to their teams , and destruction to their property , kept by their own . The inhabitants of the dwellings awoke more slowly , and came pouring into the street only in time to see the roof of the Traveler 's Rest falling in , although the lower story was not yet consumed . Nobody knew much about the details of the scene that ensued . The current of heated air produced the usual rush of cold wind , which spread and fed the flames , until , in half an hour , all hope of saving any part of the principal street in the Bar was abandoned , and people were flying for safety to the outskirts of the town . On a little eminence , overlooking the burning buildings , together stood Gentleman Bill and a young woman he had rescued from smoke and flame just in time to save her from suffocation . Together they looked down upon the conflagration , and together listened to the horrible medley of sounds proceeding from it . " If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repeated moan of Anne Matheny , as she gazed intently upon the scene of distress . Seeing the fright and trouble in her eyes , her companion cunningly diverted her attention for one moment to the weird landscape stretching away toward the western mountains . It was the same scene she had beheld for the first time with such interest twelve hours before ; but in what a different aspect ! The murky heavens reflected the red glare of the flames upon every object for miles around , tinging each with a lurid gleam like nothing in nature . The dark neutrals of the far-off mountains , the gray-green of the pines , the sere colors of the parched valley , the dark dull-green of the oaks , garlanded with hoary moss , and the gay foliage of the wild grape ; all came out distinctly in this furnace-glow , but with quite new effects . In the strong and strange fascination of the scene , both these young people , so singularly situated , forgot for three minutes their mutual anxiety . Longer it would be impossible to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for my father now , Mr.  - -   - -   ? " " Randolph "  - -  supplied that gentleman . " Oh , thank you !  - -  Mr . Randolph ? " " I do not see how you could , really ; " and , without intending it in the least , but simply through his embarrassment , Randolph glanced hastily at her scanty dress , which thereby she blushingly understood to be his objection . " If I could get only a blanket from father 's wagon ! Do you think it would be possible ? Would you be running a risk to try for a blanket , do you think , Mr. Randolph ? If there is any risk , please do not go ; but I am so anxious -- so terribly anxious . " He knew she was , and knew the reason she had for her apprehensions ; so , although he mistrusted the result of his errand , he answered simply : " Certainly ; I will go , if you are not afraid to be left alone . I shall be in no danger . " " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from my father ? " " I hope so , indeed , since you desire it so much . I think you had better sit down on this newspaper , and let me cover your shoulders with my coat . " " No , indeed . If you are going near the fire , you will need it to protect you from cinders . " But Randolph quickly divested himself of his upper garment , and laid it lightly over her shivering form ; then quietly charging her to feel no alarm , and as little anxiety as possible , strode rapidly away toward the fire . Fifteen minutes afterward he returned more slowly , with a blanket , which Anne rose up to receive . " My father ? Did you see my father ? " " I did not see him . He must have taken his horses off a little distance for safety , and you may not see him for several hours . Do not indulge in apprehensions . In the morning we shall find him : it is almost daylight now . " He pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were blinded with tears . " It is not like my father to leave me so long -- at such a time , too ! He would not care for his horses , nor for anything but me . O , can he have perished ! " She spoke as though the awful significance of her loneliness had just dawned upon her . Randolph , from whom the thought had never been absent from the moment he saw the pillar of flame shooting up over the Traveler 's Rest , was startled by the suddenness of her anguish ; and an expression of profound grief came over his face , noticeable even to her inattentive eyes , and which comforted her by its sympathy , even in the midst of her alarm and distress . The day had dawned when Anne Matheny lifted her tear-swollen face from her knees , and looked upon the smoking ruins of Wilson 's Bar . It was but a blackened heap of rubbish ; yet somewhere in its midst , she felt assured , were buried the charred remains of her father . Each moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last her companion ceased his efforts to inspire hope , and accepted her belief as his own . Then , with the inconsistency of sorrow , she violently repudiated the suspicion of her father 's death , and besought him piteously to seek and bring him to her side . It was while obeying this last command that Gentleman Bill encountered Kentuck , who , after the confusion of the fire was over , was , like himself , looking for Matheny . When they had consulted together , the two returned to the place where Anne was awaiting them . " There is one request I have to make , Kentuck : which is , that you will not inform Miss Matheny of the enmity of her father toward my father and myself . It would only distress her . Besides , I should like to befriend her , poor girl ! and I could not , if she looked upon me with her father 's eyes . " " No , ' tai n't no use to tell her nothin ' about that , sure enough . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not another man got hurt , not a mite ; and Bob Matheny dead ! I 'll be hanged if it ai n't mighty curus . I hope ye wo n't hurt the gal , bein ' yer the son of yer father . " " Hurt her ! I'd --  --  " Gentleman Bill did not say what he would do : but Kentuck , glancing his way , caught a perfectly comprehensible expression , and muttered softly to himself : " Waal , if that ai n't the dog-gondest curusest sarcumstance I ever seed . Hit , the first pop ! Waal , I 'm not the feller to come atween ' em ef thet 's ther notion . Far play 's my rule . " To Bill , aloud , he said : " Reckon you 'll hev ' to let me be her uncle for awhile yet . Yer most too young a feller to offer to take car ' of a gal like that . Bob Matheny 's darter has a right to what leetle dust pans out o ' Kentuck 's claim . Thet 's my go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been watching for the return of her friend , seeing two figures approaching , uttered a cry of joy and ran forward to meet them . The shock of her disappointment at seeing a stranger in place of her father , caused her nearly to swoon away in Kentuck 's arms . " Neow , do n't ye , honey , " he said , soothingly , in his kind Kentucky dialect . " Sho ! do n't ye take on . We 's all got to die , sometime or ' nother . Do n't mind me : I 'm yer pap 's oldest friend on this coast -- hev ' prospected an ' dug an ' washed up with him sence ' 49 ; and a kinder comrade a man never hed . In course , I consider it my dooty an ' privilege to see that you 're took car ' ov . The Bar 's purty much cleared eout -- thet 's so ; but I 'll soon hev ' a cabin up somewhere ; an ' ye can jest run my shebang anyway ye like . Reckon I can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comp'ny . " This was just the kind of talk best calculated to engage the attention of one in Anne 's situation -- half soothing and half suggestive -- and by degrees her father 's old friend succeeded in arousing her to face her loss , and the prospects of her future . * * * * * They told me at Wilson 's Bar , only last October -- it must have been about the anniversary of the fire -- that in two or three months Anne had recovered her spirits and health so far as to essay teaching the little flock of children at the Bar , with flattering success ; and that in two or three more it began to be observed that Gentleman Bill -- now more commonly called Mr. Randolph , out of respect to Miss Matheny -- generally happened to be in the neighborhood of the school-house about the hour of closing , in order that he might walk home with the teacher . In truth , the young people had taken to looking and sighing after each other in a way that provoked remark , and augured a wedding . As Anne insisted on completing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time for preparation , the wedding did not come off until the first part of September . On this occasion -- the only one of the kind Kentuck had ever had anything to do with -- the rude , but generous-hearted Kentuckian made a point of displaying his hospitality on a scale commensurate with his ideas of its importance ; and the elite of Wilson 's Bar were invited to eat , drink , and dance from dusk till dawn of that memorable day . As for the bride , she looked as lovely as it is the right and duty of all brides to look -- even lovelier than the most ; and the groom was the very prince of bridegrooms -- so all the maiden guests declared . On the following morning , when the young couple were to go away , Annie kissed and cried over Kentuck , her second father , in a truly gratifying fashion ; and Randolph behaved very gentlemanly and kindly -- as , in fact , he always did ; and Kentuck put on paternal airs , blessing his children in all the honeyed epithets of a true Kentuckian . Alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader is of my mind , he will wish that it had . But if he is of that sanguinary sort who always insist upon seeing the grist the gods send to their slow-grinding mills , he will prefer to know the sequel . As I have already told you , it was in September they were married . On the morning they left Kentuck the weather was extremely hot , with queer little clouds hanging about the mountains . They took the road up the canon , toward McGibeney 's ranch -- laughing and chatting , as they rode along side by side , Anne replying to every lark singing by the roadside in a voice almost as musical . Well , if it must be told , there was a cloud-burst on the mountains about noon that day . Not four hours after they had taken leave of him , Kentuck received their poor bruised bodies at his very threshold , brought there without the interposition of human hands . Wilson 's Bar will long remember that day . The fire took chiefly that which could be replaced ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of men and brutes , carrying away with it the labors and hopes of years . MISS JORGENSEN . I am a plain , elderly , unmarried man , and I board at Mrs. Mason 's . A great deal of what I am about to relate came under my own observation ; and the remainder was confided to me from time to time by my landlady , with whom I am upon terms of friendship and intimacy , having had a home in her house for a period of seven years . Mrs. Mason lives in her own tenement , in a quiet part of the city ; and besides myself , has usually three or four other boarders , generally teachers , or poor young authors -- some person always of the class that , having few other pleasures , makes it a point to secure rooms with a fine view of the bay . When Miss Jorgensen came to us , we were a quiet , studious , yet harmonious and happy family ; so well satisfied with our little community that we did not take kindly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither did our landlady seem to desire any change ; but she explained to us that the young person applying had made a strong appeal ; that her classes ( she was a teacher of French ) were principally in our part of the city ; and that she would be satisfied with a mere closet for a room . The only privilege for which she stipulated was the use of the common parlor twice a week to receive her company in . " But I can not agree to give up the parlor any single evening , " Mrs. Mason replied , " because it is used by all the family , every evening . You will be entitled to the same privileges with the others . " After some hesitation this was agreed to , and our new boarder was installed in the upper hall bed-room , which , when it had received the necessary furniture and a saratoga trunk , with numerous boxes and baskets , would scarcely allow space enough to dress in . However , Mrs. Mason reported that the tenant professed real satisfaction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity to see the new inmate . " Miss Jorgensen , " said Mrs. Mason , that evening , as she escorted to the dinner-table a small , pale , dark-eyed young person , in deep mourning ; and we being severally and separately presented afterward , endeavored to place this little lonely scrap of humanity at ease with ourselves . But in this well-intentioned effort Miss Jorgensen did not seem to meet us half way . On the contrary , she repelled us . She was reserved without being diffident ; mercilessly critical , and fierily disputatious -- all of which we found out in less than a week . She never entered or left a room without somehow disturbing the mental atmosphere of it , and giving the inmates a little shock ; so that Mr. Quivey , our dramatic writer , soon took to calling her the " Electrical Eel , " substituting " E. E. " when the person indicated was within ear-shot possibly or probably . In return , as we afterward discovered , Miss Jorgensen told Miss Flower , our other young lady boarder , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incurable Idiot . " How the " E. E. " came to her knowledge was never made plain . Before three months were past , she had quarreled with every one in the house except Mrs. Mason and myself ; though , to her credit be it said , she always apologized for her temper when they were over , with a frankness that disarmed resentment . Nevertheless , she was so frequently in a hostile attitude toward one or another in the family , that the mere mention of Miss Jorgensen 's name was sure to arrest attention and excite expectations . Thus , when I only chanced to whisper to Mrs. Mason at breakfast one morning , " Miss Jorgensen keeps late hours , " every one at the table glanced our way inquiringly , as much as to ask , " What has the little woman done now ? " And when she appeared at the close of the meal with pale face and swollen eyes , explaining her tardiness by saying she had a headache , no one gave her sympathizing looks except the landlady . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her new boarder troubled and puzzled her very much . " She will sit up until one or two o'clock every night , writing something or other , and that makes her late to breakfast . She goes out teaching every morning , and comes back tired and late to luncheon ; and you see she is never in her place at dinner until the soup is removed , and every one at the table helped . When I once suggested that she ought not to sit up so long at night , and that her classes should be arranged not to fatigue her so much , with other bits of friendly advice , she gave me to understand , very promptly , that her ways were her own , and not to be interfered with by any one . And directly afterward the tears came into her eyes . I confess I did not understand her at all . " " What about the young man who calls here twice a week ? " I inquired . " She is engaged to him , she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " " He looks well enough , only rather shabby , is very quiet , very attentive to her , and what you might call obedient to her requirements . She often seems displeased with him , but what she says to him at such times is unknown to me , for she does her scolding all in French ; and he usually then invites her out to walk , by way of diversion , I suppose . " " Do you know that he comes every morning and carries her books for her ? He certainly can not be employed , or he would not have time for such gallantries . " " Perhaps he is engaged on one of the morning papers , and so is off duty in the forenoon . I can not think so industrious a person as she would take up with a man both poor and idle . But you never know what a woman will do , " sighed Mrs. Mason , who had known something of heart-troubles in her youth , and could sympathize with other unlucky women . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the good lady went about her house affairs . A few moments later I was hurrying down town to my office , when I overtook Miss Jorgensen and Mr. Hurst . As usual , she was leaning upon his arm , and he was carrying her books . She was talking excitedly , in French , and I thought her to be crying , though her face was covered with a black veil . The few words I caught before she recognized me reminded me of my conversation with Mrs. Mason . " You must get something to do , Harry , " she was saying . " You know that I work every instant of the time , yet how little I can save if I have to supply you with money . It is a shame to be so idle and helpless , when there is so much to be done before --  --  " She perceived me and stopped short . " So , " I thought , " this precious scamp is living off the earnings of the little French teacher , is he ? A pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I have to make love to her myself . " Which latter conceit so amused me , that I had forgotten to be indignant with Mr. Hurst before I reached my office and plunged into the business of the day . But I never made love to Miss Jorgensen . She was not the kind of person even a flirtish man would choose to talk sentiment with , and I was always far enough from being a gallant . So our affairs went on in just the usual way at Mrs. Mason 's for three or four months . Miss Jorgensen and Mr. Quivey let fly their arrows of satire at each other ; Miss Flower , the assistant high-school teacher , enacted the amiable go-between ; our " promising young artist " was wisely neutral ; Mrs. Mason and myself were presumed to be old enough to be out of the reach of boarding-house tiffs , and preserved a prudent unconsciousness . Mr. Hurst continued to call twice a week in the evening , and Miss Jorgensen kept on giving French lessons by day , and writing out translations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , very pale , and cried a good deal , as I had reason to know , for her room adjoined mine , and more than a few times I had listened to her sobbing , until I felt almost forced to interfere ; but interfered I never had yet . One foggy July evening , on coming home to dinner , I encountered Miss Jorgensen in the hall . She appeared to be just going out , a circumstance which surprised me somewhat , on account of the hour . I however opened the door for her without comment , when by the fading daylight I perceived that her face was deathly pale , and her black eyes burning . She passed me without remark , and hurried off into the foggy twilight . Nor did she appear at dinner ; but came in about eight o'clock and went directly to her own room . When Mrs. Mason knocked at her door to inquire if she was not going to take some refreshments , the only reply that could be elicited was , that she had a headache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closed door . " She 's been having a row with that sunflower of hers , " was Mr. Quivey 's comment , when he overheard Mrs. Mason 's report to me , made in an undertone . Truth to tell , Mr. Quivey , from associating so much with theatrical people in the capacity of playwright , had come to be rather stagy in his style at times . " By the way , he was not on escort duty this morning . I saw her proceeding along Powell street alone , and anxiously peering up and down all the cross streets , evidently on the lookout , but he failed to put in an appearance . " " Which was very unkind of him , if she expected that he would , " put in Miss Flower , glancing from under her long lashes at the speaker . " That is so , " returned Quivey ; " for the fellow does nothing else , I do believe , but play lackey to Miss Jorgensen ; and if that is his sole occupation , he ought to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part , how he pays his way . " " Perhaps it pays him to be a lackey , " I suggested , remembering what I had once overheard between them . Mrs. Mason gave me a cautioning glance , which she need not have done , for I had no intention of making known Miss Jorgensen 's secrets . " Well , " said Miss Flower , as if she had been debating the question in her mind for some time previous , " I doubt if a woman can love a man who submits to her will as subserviently as Mr. Hurst seems to , to Miss Jorgensen . I know some women could not . " " By which you mean you could not , " Mrs. Mason returned , smiling . " I do not see that the case need be very different with men . Subserviency never won anybody 's respect or love either . Neither does willful opposition , any more . Proper self-respect and a fair share of self-love is more sure of winning admiration , from men or women , than too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-assertion is all on one side , and the self-abasement all on the other -- as in the case of Miss Jorgensen and Mr. Hurst -- then how would you establish an equilibrium , Mrs. Mason ? " " It establishes itself in that case , I should say , " clipped in Mr. Quivey . " Oil and water do not mix , but each keeps its own place perfectly , and without disturbance . " I do not know how long this conversation might have gone on in this half-earnest , half-facetious style , with Miss Jorgensen for its object , had not something happened just here to bring it abruptly to a close ; and that something was the report of a pistol over our very heads . " Great heaven ! " ejaculated Miss Flower , losing all her color and self-possession together . " E. E. , as I live -- she has shot herself ! " cried Quivey , half doubting , half convinced . I caught these words as I made a rapid movement toward the staircase . They struck me as so undeniably true that I never hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked on the inside , and I could hear nothing except a faint moaning sound within . Fearing the worst , I threw my whole weight and strength against it , and it flew open with a crash . There lay Miss Jorgensen upon the floor , in the middle of her little room , uttering low moaning sobs , though apparently not unconscious . I stooped over and lifted her in my arms to lay her upon the bed , and as I did so , a small pocket-pistol fell at my feet , and I discovered blood upon the carpet . " Yes , Miss Jorgensen had certainly shot herself , I told Mrs. Mason , and the rest who crowded after us into the little woman 's room ; but whether dangerously or not , I could not say , nor whether purposely or accidentally . Probably not dangerously , as she was already making signs to me to exclude people from the apartment . " You had better bring a surgeon , " I said to Quivey , who turned away muttering , followed by Miss Flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the location of the wound , which was in the flesh of the upper part of the left arm , and consequently not so alarming as it would be painful during treatment . " Could she have meant to shoot herself through the heart , and failed through agitation ? " whispered Mrs. Mason to me , aside . " No , no ; it was an accident , " murmured the victim , whose quick ear had caught the words . " I did not mean to shoot myself . " " Poor child , I am very sorry for you , " returned Mrs. Mason gently , whose kind heart had always leaned toward the little French teacher , in spite of her singular ways . " It is very unfortunate ; but you shall receive careful nursing until you recover . You need not worry about yourself , but try to bear it the best you can . " " O , I can not bear it -- I must be well to-morrow . O , what shall I do ! " moaned Miss Jorgensen . " O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after this thought occurred to her , her restlessness seemed to increase , until the surgeon came and began an examination of the wound . While this was going on , notwithstanding the sickening pain , the sufferer seemed anxious only about the opinion to be given upon the importance of the wound as interfering with her usual pursuits . When , in answer to a direct appeal , she was told that it must be some weeks before she could resume going out , a fainting fit immediately followed , which gave us no little trouble and alarm . Before taking leave , the doctor accompanied me to my own apartment and proceeded to question me . " What is the history of the case ? " said he . " Is there anything peculiar in the life or habits of Miss Jorgensen , to account for her great anxiety to get well immediately ? " " She fears to lose her classes , I presume ; and there may be other engagements which are unknown to us . " I still had a great reluctance to saying what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which accounts for all that I observe in her case , " returned the doctor . " What are her connections ?  - -  has she any family ties -- any lover , even ? " " I believe she told Mrs. Mason she was engaged to a young man who calls here twice a week . " " Ah ! Do you know where this young man is to be found ? It might be best to communicate with him , in the morning . Possibly he may be able to dispel this anxious fear of hers , from whatever cause it arises . " I promised the Doctor to speak to Mrs. Mason about it , and he soon after took leave , having first satisfied himself that the unlucky pistol was incapable of doing further mischief , and safely hidden from Miss Jorgensen . Naturally , the next morning , the table-talk turned upon the incident of the evening previous . " She need not tell me that it was an accident , " Mr. Quivey was saying , very decidedly . " She is just the sort of woman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that vampire friend of hers draining her life-blood ! " I confess I felt startled by the correspondence of Quivey 's opinion with my own ; for I had heretofore believed that myself and Mrs. Mason were the only persons who suspected that Hurst was dependent upon Miss Jorgensen for the means of living . In my surprise I said : " You know that he does this ? " " I know that Craycroft paid him yesterday for a long translation done by Miss Jorgensen , and I do not believe he had an order for it , other than verbal . Craycroft seeing them so much together , paid the money , and took a receipt . " " Perhaps he paid the money to Mr. Hurst by her instructions , for her own use , " suggested Miss Flower . " But then he did not see her last evening , did he ? I hope he does not rob Miss Jorgensen . Such a delicate little woman has enough to do to look out for herself , I should think . " " One thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does what she does , and permits what she permits , intelligently ; and our speculations concerning her affairs will not produce a remedy for what we fancy we see wrong in them . " Which hint had the effect of silencing the discussion for that time . Before I left the house that morning , I had a consultation with Mrs. Mason , who had passed the night in attendance upon Miss Jorgensen , and who had informed me that she had been very restless , in spite of the quieting prescription left by the doctor . " I wish you would go up and speak to her , " Mrs. Mason said . " Perhaps you can do something for her which I could not ; and I am sure she needs some such service . " Thus urged , I obeyed an impulse of my own , which had been to do this very thing . When I tapped softly at her door , she said , " Come in ! " in a pained and petulant tone , as if any interruption was wearisome to her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed an eager and animated expression , which rewarded me at once for the effort I was making . " Thank you for coming to see me , " said she quickly . " I was almost on the point of sending for you . " Pausing for a moment , while her eyes searched my face , she continued : " I am in trouble , which can not be all explained , and which will force you , if you do a service for me , to take me very much upon trust ; but I will first assure you that what you may do for me will not involve you in any difficulty . More than this I can not now say . Will you do this service for me , and keep your agency in the matter secret ? The service is slight , the importance of secrecy great . " I expressed my willingness to do anything which would not compromise me with myself , and that , I told her , I did not fear her requiring . She then proceeded , with some embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hurst ; upon which I smiled , and answered , " I had conjectured as much . " " But you must not conjecture anything , " she replied , with some asperity ; " for you are sure to go wide of the truth . You think I have only to send for Mr. Hurst to bring him here ; but you are mistaken . He can not come , because he dare not . He is in hiding , but I can not tell you why . Only do not betray him ; I ask no more . You are not called upon to do any more -- to do anything against him , I mean . " Seeing me hesitate , she continued : " I need not tell you that I believe my life is in your hands . I have been living a long time with all my faculties upon a severe strain , so severe that I feel I shall go mad if the pressure is increased . I entreat you not to refuse me . " " Very well , " I answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only to take this " she pulled a note from beneath her pillow , addressed to " Mr. Harry Hurst , " and handed it to me --  " to the address , which you will have no difficulty in finding , though I am sorry to have to send you on a walk so out of your way . And please take this also "  - -  handing me a roll of coin , marked $100 . " No answer is expected . Of course , you will not give these things to any one but Mr. Hurst . That is all . " And she sunk back wearily upon her pillow , with closed eyes , as if she had no further interest in the affair . I know as well as if she had told me that this note was a warning to fly , and this money the means to make flight good . I had promised to deliver them on her simple entreaty and assurance that I should not dishonor myself . But might I not wrong society ? Might not she be herself deceived about Hurst ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her employers the day before occurred to me . Did she know it or not ? I questioned , while regarding the thin , pale , weary face on the pillow before me . While I hesitated she opened her eyes with a wondering , impatient gaze . " Do you repent ? " she asked . " I deliberate , rather , " I replied . " I chanced to learn yesterday , that Mr. Hurst had drawn money from Craycroft &; Co. , and was thinking that if you knew it , you might not wish to send this also . " For an instant her black eyes blazed with anger , but whether at me or at Mr. Hurst I could not tell , and she seemed to hesitate , as I had done . " Yes , take it , " she said , with hopeless sadness in her tone , " He may need it ; and for myself , what does it matter now ? " " I shall do as you bid me , " I replied , " but it is under protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself an injury , and Mr. Hurst no good . " " You do n't understand , " she returned , sharply . " Now go , please . " " Very well ; I am gone . But I promise you that if you exact services of me , I shall insist on your taking care of your health , by way of return . You are in a fever at this moment , which I warn you will be serious if not checked . Here comes the doctor . Good-morning . " I pass over the trifling incidents of my visit to the residence of Mr. Hurst . Suffice to say that Mr. Hurst had departed to parts unknown , and that I had to carry about all day Miss Jorgensen 's letter and money . On returning home to dinner that afternoon , I found a stranger occupying Miss Jorgensen 's place at table . He was a shrewd-looking man of about forty years , talkative , versatile , and what you might call " jolly . " Nothing escaped his observation ; nothing was uttered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not intended for him -- a practice that would have been annoying but for a certain tact and good humor which disarmed criticism . The whole family , while admitting that our new day-boarder was not exactly congenial , confessed to liking his amusing talk immensely . " He quite brightens us up ; do n't you think so , Mr. Quivey ? " was Miss Flower 's method of indorsing him . " He does very well just now , " replied Quivey , " though I 'd lots rather see E. E. back in that place . When one gets used to pickles or pepper , one wants pickles or pepper ; honey palls on the appetite . " " I thought you had almost too much pepper sometimes , " said Miss Flower , remembering the " I. I. " " It 's a healthful stimulant , " returned Quivey , ignoring the covert reminder . " But not always an agreeable one . " I suspected that Miss Flower , who had an intense admiration for dramatic talent , entertained her own reasons for jogging Mr. Quivey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote her own views , I took this occasion to make my report to Miss Jorgensen . As might have been expected , she had been feverishly anticipating my visit . I had no sooner entered the room than she uttered her brief interrogation : " Well ? " I laid the note and the money upon the bed . " You see how it is ? " I said . " He is gone ? " " Yes . " " I am so very glad ! " she said , with emphasis , while something like a smile lighted up her countenance . " This gives me a respite , at least . If he is prudent " she checked herself , and giving me a grateful glance , exclaimed , " I am so much obliged to you . " " Nobody could be more welcome , I am sure , to so slight a service . I shall hope now to see you getting well . " " O , yes , " she answered , " I must get well ; there is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dropped for a while , I presume , unless the doctor will let me take in some of my scholars , for , of course , I can not go out . " " Your arm must begin to heal before you can think of teaching , ever so little . I have an idea , Miss Jorgensen , from what you have said of yourself , that this necessity for repose , which is forced upon you , will prove to be an excellent thing . Certainly , you were wearing out very fast with your incessant labor . " " Perhaps so -- I mean , perhaps inforced rest will not be bad for me ; but , O , there is such need to work ! I can so poorly afford to be idle . " " What you say relieves my mind of a suspicion , which at first I harbored , that the firing of that mischievous pistol was not wholly accidental . I now see you wish to live and work . But why had you such a weapon about you ? Are you accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that I am not ; and my having it about me came from a fear I had of its doing worse mischief in the hands of Mr. Hurst . " " Are affairs so desperate with him ? " " Please do n't question me . I can not answer you satisfactorily . Mr. Hurst is in trouble , and the least that is said or known about him is the best . And yet you wonder , no doubt , that I should interest myself about a man who is compelled to act the part of a culprit . Well , I can not tell you why at present ; and it would be a great relief to know that you thought nothing more about it . " This last she uttered rather petulantly , which warned me that this conversation was doing her no good . " Believe , then , " I said , " that I have no interest in your affairs , except the wish to promote your welfare . And I think I may venture to affirm that everybody in the house is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Thank you all ; but I do not deserve your kindness ; I have been so ill-tempered . The truth is I can not afford to have friends ; friends pry into one 's affairs so mercilessly . Mrs. Mason tells me there is a new boarder , " she said , suddenly changing the subject . I assented , and gave what I intended to be an amusing account of the new-comers ' conversation and manners . " Was there anything said about me at dinner ? " she asked , with a painful consciousness of the opinion I might have of such a question . " I do not think there was . We were all so taken up with the latest acquisition that we forgot you for the time . " " May I ask this favor of you , to keep the conversation away from me as much as possible ? I am morbidly sensitive , I presume , " she said , with a poor attempt at a smile , " and I can not keep from fancying , while I lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room or parlor . " Of course , I hastened to disavow any disposition on the part of the family to make her a subject of conversation , and even promised to discountenance any reference to her whatever , if thereby she would be made more comfortable ; after which I bade her good-night , having received the assurance that my visit had relieved her mind of several torturing apprehensions . The more I saw and thought of Miss Jorgensen , the more she interested and puzzled me . I should have inclined to the opinion that she was a little disturbed at times in her intellect , had it not been that there was apparent so much " method in her madness ; " this reflection always bringing me back at last to the conclusion that her peculiarities could all be accounted for upon the hypothesis she herself presented ; too much work and some great anxiety . The spectacle of this human mite fighting the battle of life , not only for herself but for the strong man who should have been her protector , worked so upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the little woman out of my thoughts . I kept my word to her , discountenancing , as far as I could , the discussion of her affairs , and in this effort Mrs. Mason co-operated with me ; but it was practically impossible to prevent the inquiries and remarks of those of the family who were not so well informed concerning her as we were . The new boarder , also , with that quick apprehension he had of every subject , had caught enough to become interested in the patient up-stairs , and daily made some inquiries concerning her condition , and , as it appeared to me -- grown a little morbid , like Miss Jorgensen -- was peculiarly adroit in extracting information . Three weeks slipped away , and Miss Jorgensen had passed the most painful period of suppuration and healing in her arm , and had promised to come down-stairs next day to dine with the family . Mrs. Mason had just communicated the news to us in her cheeriest tones , as if each individual was interested in it , and was proceeding to turn out our coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and laid them beside the tray , directly under the eye of the new boarder , who sat on the landlady 's left . " ' Miss Jorgensen , " said he , reading the address of the topmost one . " A very peculiar handwriting . " Then taking up the letter , as if to further examine the writing , I observed that he was studying the postmark as well , which , being offended at his unmannerly curiosity , I sincerely hoped was illegible . But that it was only too fatally plain will soon appear . With an air of hauteur I seldom assumed , I recalled the servant , and ordered the letter to be taken at once to Miss Jorgensen . Before leaving the house I was informed that Miss Jorgensen wished to speak to me . " Mr. Hurst has done a most imprudent thing ! " she exclaimed , the moment I was inside the door . " I ought to have published a ' personal , ' or done something to let him know I could not go to the post-office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He has returned to the city ? " " Yes ! " She fairly ground her teeth with rage at this " stupidity , " as she termed it . " He always does the very thing he ought never to have done , and leaves undone the things most important to do . Of course he can not come here , and I can not go to him without incurring the greatest risk . I really do not know what to do next . " Tears were now coursing down her pale cheeks -- tears , it seemed , as much of anger as of sorrow . " Let him take care of himself , " I said , rather hotly . " It is not your province to care for him as you do . " She gave me an indescribable look . " What can you , what can any one know about it ? He may want money ; how can he take care of himself in such circumstances without money ? I sent for you to contrive some plan by which he can be communicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How can I tell you , when , as you say , I do not know what is required . You wish to see him , I presume ? " " How can I -- O , I dislike so much to ask this of you -- but will you take a message to him ? " She asked this desperately , half expecting me to decline , as decline I did . " Miss Jorgensen , you are now able to ride . Shall I send a carriage for you ? " " There may be those on the lookout who would instantly suspect my purpose in going out in that way . On the contrary , nobody would suspect you . " " Still , I might be observed , which would not be pleasant , I can imagine , from what you leave me to surmise . No , Miss Jorgensen , much as I should like to serve you personally , you must excuse me from connecting myself in any way with Mr. Hurst ; and if I might be allowed to offer advice , I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut loose from him at once . " Miss Jorgensen covered her face with one little emaciated hand , and sat silent a few seconds . " Send me the carriage , " she said , " and I will go . " " You forgive me ? " " You have been very good , " she said . " I ought not have required more of you . I will go at once ; the sooner the better . " When I had reached the head of the stairs , I turned back again to her door . " Once more let me counsel you to free yourself from all connection with Mr. Hurst . Why should you ruin your chances of happiness for one so undeserving , as I must think he is ? Keep away from him ; let him shift for himself . " " You do n't know what you are talking about , " she replied , with a touch of the old fierceness . " I have no chances of happiness to lose . Please go . " On my way down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned from Mrs. Mason and the evening papers . Miss Jorgensen , dressed in deep black , with her face veiled , entered the carriage , directing the driver to take her to the houses of some of her pupils . At the corner of the street , a gentleman , who proved to be our day-boarder , got upon the box with the driver , and remained there while Miss Jorgensen made her calls . Finding him constantly there , and becoming suspicious , she ordered the carriage home , and gave directions to have it return an hour later to take her down town for some shopping . At the time set , the carriage was in attendance , and conveyed her to one of the principal stores in the city . After re-entering the carriage , and giving her directions , our day-boarder once more mounted the box , though unobserved by her , and was conveyed with herself to the hiding-place of Mr. Hurst , contriving , by getting down before the door was opened , to elude her observation . Another carriage , containing officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , and drew up when Miss Jorgensen had entered the house where Hurst was concealed . After waiting long enough to make it certain that the person sought was within , the officers entered to search and capture . At the moment they entered Hurst 's apartment , he was saying , with much emotion , " If I can only reach China in safety , a way will be opened for me --  " " Hush ! " cried Miss Jorgensen , seeing the door opened , and by whom . " All is over ! " exclaimed Hurst . " I will never be taken to prison ! " And , drawing a revolver , he deliberately shot himself through the head . Miss Jorgensen was brought back to Mrs. Mason 's in a fainting condition , and was ill for weeks afterward . That same evening our day-boarder called , and while settling his board with Mrs. Mason , acknowledged that he belonged to the detective police , and had for months been " working up " the case of a bank-robber and forger who had escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observation for a year and a half . And we further learned in the same way , and ultimately from the lady herself , that Miss Jorgensen was a myth , and that the little French teacher was Madame  - -   - -   , who had suffered , and toiled , and risked everything for her unworthy husband , and who deserved rather to be congratulated than condoled with upon his loss . It is now a year since all this happened , and it is the common gossip of our boarding-house that Mr. Quivey is devoted to the little dark-eyed widow ; and although Miss Flower still refers to " E. E. " and " I. I. , " nobody seems to be in the least disturbed by the allusion . When I say to Quivey , " Make haste slowly , my dear fellow ; " he returns : " Never fear , my friend ; I shall know when the time comes to speak . " SAM RICE 'S ROMANCE . The coach of Wells , Fargo &; Co. stood before the door of Piney-woods Station , and Sam Rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air , for Sam was the pink of stage-drivers , from his high white hat to his faultless French boots . Sad will it be when his profession shall have been altogether superseded ; and the coach-and-six , with its gracious and graceful " whip , " shall have been supplanted , on all the principal lines of travel , by the iron-horse with its grimy " driver " and train of thundering carriages . The passengers had taken their seats -- the one lady on the box -- and Sam Rice stood , chronometer held daintily between thumb and finger , waiting for the second hand to come round the quarter of a minute , while the grooms slipped the last strap of the harness into its buckle . At the expiration of the quarter of a minute , as Sam stuck an unlighted cigar between his lips and took hold of the box to pull himself up to his seat , the good-natured landlady of Piney-woods Station called out , with some officiousness : " Mr. Rice , do n't you want a match ? " " That 's just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded Sam ; and at that instant his eyes were on a level with the lady 's on the box , so that he could not help seeing the roguish glint of them , which so far disconcerted the usually self-possessed professor of the whip that he heard not the landlady 's laugh , but gathered up the reins in such a hasty and careless manner as to cause Demon , the nigh-leader , to go off with a bound that nearly threw the owner of the eyes out of her place . The little flurry gave opportunity for Mrs. Dolly Page -- that was the lady 's name -- to drop her veil over her face , and for Sam Rice to show his genteel handling of the ribbons , and conquer the unaccountable disturbance of his pulses . Sam had looked at the way-bill , not ten minutes before , to ascertain the name of the pretty black-eyed woman seated at his left hand ; and the consciousness of so great a curiosity gratified , may have augmented his unaccustomed embarrassment . Certain it is , Sam Rice had driven six horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without missing a trip ; and had more than once encountered the " road-agents , " without ever yet delivering them an express box ; had had old and young ladies , plain and beautiful ones , to sit beside him , hundreds of times : yet this was the first time he had consulted the way-bill , on his own account , to find a lady 's name . This one time , too , it had a Mrs. before it , which prefix gave him a pang he was very unwilling to own . On the other hand , Mrs. Dolly Page was clad in extremely deep black . Could she be in mourning for Mr. Page ? If Demon had an unusual number of starting fits that afternoon , his driver was not altogether guiltless in the matter ; for what horse , so sensitive as he , would not have felt the magnetism of something wrong behind him ? But as the mocking eyes kept hidden behind a veil , and the rich , musical voice uttered not a word through a whole half-hour , which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to say he believed he would not smoke , after all ; and thereupon returned the cigar , still unlighted , to his pocket . " I hope you do not deprive yourself of a luxury on my account , " murmured the soft voice . " I guess this dust and sunshine is enough for a lady to stand , without my smokin ' in her face , " returned Sam , politely , and glancing at the veil . " Still , I beg you will smoke , if you are accustomed , " persisted the cooing voice behind it . But Sam , to his praise be it spoken , refused to add anything to the discomforts of a summer day 's ride across the mountains . His chivalry had its reward ; for the lady thus favored , feeling constrained to make some return for such consideration , began to talk , in a vein that delighted her auditor , about horses -- their points and their traits -- and , lastly , about their drivers . " I have always fancied , " said Mrs. Dolly Page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stage-driving as a profession . It seems to me a free and manly calling , one that develops some of the best qualities of a man . Of course , it has its drawbacks . One can not always choose one 's society on a stage , and there are temptations to bad habits . Besides , there are storms , and upsets , and all that sort of thing . I 've often thought , " continued Mrs. Dolly , " that we do not consider enough the hardships of drivers , nor what we owe them . You 've read that poem -- the Post-boy 's Song : " ' Like a shuttle thrown by the hand of Fate , Forward and back I go . ' " Well , it is just so . They do bring us our letters , full of good and ill news , helping to weave the web of Fate for us ; yet not to blame for what tidings they bring , and always faithful to their duties , in storm or shine . " " I shall like my profession better after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving his whip a curl to make it touch the off-leader 's right ear . " I 've done my duty mostly , and not complained of the hardships , though once or twice I 've been too beat out to get off the box at the end of my drive ; but that was in a long spell of bad weather , when the roads was just awful , and the rain as cold as snow . " " Would you mind letting me hold the lines awhile ? " asked the cooing voice , at last . " I 've driven a six-in-hand before . " Though decidedly startled , and averse to trusting his team to such a pair of hands , Sam was compelled , by the psychic force of the little woman , to yield up the reins . It was with fear and trembling that he watched her handling of them for the first mile ; but , as she really seemed to know what she was about , his confidence increased , and he watched her with admiration . Her veil was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not speak often , but , when she did , it was always something piquant and graceful that she uttered . At last , just as the station was in sight , she yielded up the lines , with a deep-drawn sigh of satisfaction , apologizing for it by saying that her hands , not being used to it , were tired . " I 'm not sure , " she added , " but I shall take to the box , at last , as a steady thing . " " If you do , " responded Sam , gallantly , " I hope you will drive on my line . " " Thanks . I shall ask you for a reference , when I apply for the situation . " There was then a halt , a supply of fresh horses , and a prompt , lively start . But the afternoon was intensely hot , and the team soon sobered down . Mrs. Page did not offer again to take the lines . She was overwarm and weary , perhaps , quiet and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and thoughtful . The passengers inside were asleep . The coach rattled along at a steady pace , with the dust so deep under the wheels as to still their rumble . At intervals , a freight-wagon was passed , drawn to one side , at a " turn-out , " or a rabbit skipped across the road , or a solitary horseman suggested alternately a " road-agent , " or one of James 's heroes . Grand views presented themselves of wooded cliffs and wild ravines . Tall pines threw lengthening shadows across the open spaces on the mountain-sides . And so the afternoon wore away ; and , when the sun was setting , the passengers alighted for their supper at the principal hotel of Lucky-dog -- a mining-camp , pretty well up in the Sierras . " We both stop here , " said Sam , as he helped the lady down from her high position ; letting her know by this remark that her destination was known to him . " I 'm rather glad of that , " she answered , frankly , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that long drive , Sam was certainly pardonable if he felt almost sure that her reason for being glad was identical with his own . Lucky-dog was one of those shambling , new camps , where one street serves for a string on which two or three dozen ill-assorted tenements are strung , every fifth one being a place intended for the relief of the universal American thirst , though the liquids dispensed at these beneficent institutions were observed rather to provoke than to abate the dryness of their patrons . Eating-houses were even more frequent than those which dispensed moisture to parched throats ; so that , taking a cursory view of the windows fronting on the street , the impression was inevitably conveyed of the expected rush of famished armies , whose wants this charitable community were only too willing to supply for a sufficient consideration . The houses that were not eating and drinking-houses were hotels , if we except occasional grocery and general merchandise establishments . Into what out-of-the-way corners the inhabitants were stowed , it was impossible to conjecture , until it was discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women abode not at all in Lucky-dog -- or if there were any , not more than a half a dozen of them , and they lived in unaccustomed places . The advent of Mrs. Page at the Silver Brick Hotel naturally made a sensation . As assemblage of not less than fifty gentlemen of leisure crowded about the entrance , each more intent than the other on getting a look at the arrivals , and especially at this one arrival -- whose age , looks , name , business , and intentions in coming to Lucky-dog , were discussed with great freedom . Sam Rice was closely questioned , but proved reticent and non-committal . The landlord was besieged with inquiries -- the landlady , too -- and all without anybody being made much the wiser . There was the waybill , and there was the lady herself ; put that and that together , and make what you could of it . Mrs. Dolly Page did not seem discomposed in the least by the evident interest she inspired . With her black curls smoothly brushed , her black robes immaculately neat , with a pretty color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her whole bearing , she endured the concentrated gaze of fifty pairs of eyes during the whole of dinner , without so much as one awkward movement , or the dropping of a fork or teaspoon . So it was plain that the curious would be compelled to await Mrs. Page 's own time for developments . But developments did not seem likely to come overwhelmingly . Mrs. Page made a fast friend of the landlady of the Silver Brick , by means of little household arts peculiarly her own , and , before a fortnight was gone , had become as indispensable to all the boarders as she was to Mrs. Shaughnessy herself . If she had a history , she kept it carefully from curious ears . Mrs. Shaughnessy was evidently satisfied , and quite challenged criticism of her favorite . Indeed , there was nothing to criticise . It was generally understood that she was a widow , who had to get on in the world as best she could , and thus the public sympathy was secured , and an embargo laid upon gossip . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a class which has its representatives everywhere , who regarded all unappropriated women , especially pretty women , very much as the hunter regards game , and the more difficult the approach , the more exciting the chase . But these moral Nimrods had not half the chance with self-possessed Mrs. Dolly Page that they would have had with a different style of woman . The grosser sort got a sudden conge ; and with the more refined sportsmen she coquetted just enough to show them that two could play at a game of " make-believe , " and then sent them off with a lofty scorn edifying to behold -- to the mingled admiration and amusement of Mrs. Shaughnessy . The only affair which seemed to have a kernel of seriousness in it , was that of Mr. Samuel Rice . Regularly , when the stage was in , on Sam 's night , he paid his respects to Mrs. Page . And Mrs. Page always received him with a graceful friendliness , asking after the horses , and even sometimes going so far as to accompany him to their stables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumps of sugar in her pocket , which she fed to the handsome brutes off her own pink palm , until there was not one of them she could not handle at her will . Thus passed many weeks , until summer was drawing to a close . Two or three times she had gone down to Piney-woods Station and back , on Sam 's coach , and always sat on the box , and drove a part of the way , but never where her driving would excite remark . It is superfluous to state , that on these occasions there was a happy heart beneath Sam 's linen-duster , or that the bantering remarks of his brother-drivers were borne with smiling equanimity , not to say pride ; for Sam was well aware that Mrs. Dolly Page 's brunette beauty , and his blonde-bearded style , together furnished a not unpleasing tableau of personal charms . Besides , Sam 's motto was , " Let those laugh who win ; " and he seemed to himself to be on the road to heights of happiness beyond the ken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive stage more than a year or two longer , " Sam said to Mrs. Page , confidentially , on the return from their last trip together to Piney-woods Station . " I 've got a little place down in Amador , and an interest in the Nip-and-tuck gold-mine , besides a few hundreds in bank . I 've a notion to settle down some day , in a cottage with vines over the porch , with a little woman to tend the flowers in the front-garden . " As if Sam 's heightened color and shining eyes had not sufficiently pointed this confession of his desires , it chanced that at this moment the eyes of both were attracted to a way-side picture : a cottage , a flower-bordered walk , a fair young woman standing at the gate , with a crowing babe in her arms lifting its little white hands to the sun-browned face of a stalwart young farmer who was smiling proudly on the two . At this sudden apparition of his inmost thoughts , Sam 's heart gave a great bound , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act was to crack his whip so fiercely as to set the leaders off prancing ; and when , by this diversion , he had partly recovered self-possession to glance at the face of his companion , a new embarrassment seized him when he discovered two little rivers of tears running over the crimsoned cheeks . But a coach-box is not a convenient place for sentiment to display itself ; and , though the temptation was great to inquire into the cause of the tears , with a view of offering consolation , Sam prudently looked the other way , and maintained silence . The reader , however , knows that those tears sank into the beholder 's soul , and caused to germinate countless tender thoughts and emotions , which were , on some future occasion , to be laid upon the alter of his devotion to Mrs. Dolly Page . And none the less , that , in a few minutes , the eyes which shed them resumed their roguish brightness , and the lady was totally unconscious of having heard , seen , or felt any embarrassment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance was concerned , for that time . And so Sam found , somewhat to his disappointment , it continued to fall out , that whenever he got upon delicate ground , the lady was off like a humming-bird , darting hither and yon , so that it was impossible to put a finger upon her , or get so much as a look at her brilliant and restless wings . But nobody ever tired of trying to find a humming-bird at rest ; and so Sam never gave up looking for the opportune moment of speaking his mind . Meanwhile , Lucky-dog Camp was having a fresh sensation . An organized band of gamblers , robbers , and " road-agents " had made a swoop upon its property , of various kinds , and had succeeded in making off with it . The very night after the ride just mentioned , the best horses in Sam Rice 's team were stolen , making it necessary to substitute what Sam called " a pa'r of ornery cayuses . " To put the climax to his misfortunes , the " road-agents " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cayuses " becoming unmanageable , Sam was forced to surrender the treasure-box , and the passengers their bullion . The excitement in Lucky-dog was intense . A vigilance committee , secretly organized , lay in waiting for the offenders , and , after a week or two , made a capture of a well-known sporting-man , whose presence in camp had for some time been regarded with suspicion . Short shrift was afforded him . That same afternoon his gentlemanly person swung dangling from a gnarled pine-tree limb , and his frightened soul had fled into outer darkness . When this event became known to Mrs. Dolly Page , she turned ghostly white , and then fainted dead away . Mrs. Shanghnessy was very much concerned for her friend ; berating in round terms , the brutishness of people who could talk of such things before a tender-hearted lady like that . To Mr. Rice , particularly , she expatiated upon the coarseness of certain people , and the refined sensitiveness of others ; and Sam was much inclined to agree with her , so far as her remarks applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible . Indeed , Mrs. Page was not visible for so many days , that Sam 's soul began to long for her with a mighty longing . At length , she made her appearance , considerably paler and thinner than was her wont ; but doubly interesting and lovely to the eyes of so partial an observer as Sam , who would willingly have sheltered her weakness in his strong , manly arms . Sam , naturally enough , would never have hinted at the event which had so distressed her ; but she relieved him of all embarrassment on that subject , by saying to him almost at once : " Mr. Rice , I am told they have not buried the man they hung , so shockingly , the other day . They certainly will not leave him there ? " she added , with a shudder . " I do n't know -- I suppose , " stammered Sam , " it is their way , with them fellows . " " But you will not allow it ? You can not allow it ! "  - -  excitedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite humbly . " Mr. Rice , " and her voice was at once a command and an entreaty , " you can and must prevent it . You are not afraid ? I will go with you -- this very night -- and will help you . Do n't say you will not ; for I can not sleep until it is done . I have not slept for a week . " She looked so white and so wild , as she uttered this confession , that Sam would have been the wretch he was not , to refuse her . So he said : " Do n't you fret . I 'll bury him , if it troubles you so . But you need n't go along . You could n't ; it 's too far , and you 're too weak , "  - -  seeing how she trembled . " I am not weak -- only nervous . I prefer to go along . But we must be secret , I suppose ? Oh ! " with a start that was indeed " nervous . " " Yes , we must be secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not half like the business , but would not refuse . " You are a good man , Mr. Rice , and I thank you . " And with that , Mrs. Dolly Page caught up one of his hands , and kissing it hastily , began to cry , as she walked quickly away . " Do n't cry , and do n't go until I have promised to do whatever you ask , if it will make you well again , " Sam said , following her to the door . " Then call for me to take a walk with you to-night . The moon is full , but no one will observe us . They would not think of our going there , " with another shudder -- and she slipped away from his detaining hand . That evening Mr. Samuel Rice and Mrs. Page took a walk by moonlight . Laughing gossips commented on it after their fashion ; and disagreeable gossips remarked that they came home very late , after their fashion . But nobody , they believed , saw where they went , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of Christian charity , each with a sense of guilt and unworthiness very irritating to endure , albeit from very different causes . One , because an unwelcome suspicion had thrust itself into his mind ; and the other --  --  The ground of Sam 's suspicion was a photograph , which , in handling the gambler 's body somewhat awkwardly , by reason of its weight -- Mrs . Page had found , at the last , she could not render any assistance -- had slipped from some receptacle in its clothing . A hasty glance , under the full light of the moon , had shown him the features of the lady who sat twelve paces away , with her hands over her face . It is not always those that sin who suffer most from the consciousness of sin ; and Sam , perhaps , with that hint of possible -- nay , almost certain -- wickedness in his breast-pocket , was more burdened by the weight of it than many a criminal about to suffer all the terrors of the law ; for the woman that he loved stood accused , if not convicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not condemn , because his heart refused to judge her . When the two stood together under the light of the lamp in the deserted parlor of the Silver Brick Hotel , the long silence which , by her quick perceptions , had been recognized as accusing her , upon what evidence she did not yet know , was at length broken by Sam 's voice , husky with agitation . " Mrs. Page , " he said , assuming an unconscious dignity of mien and sternness of countenance , " I shall ask you some questions , sometime , which you may not think quite polite . And you must answer me : you understand . I 'm bound to know the truth about this man . " " About this man ! " Then he suspected her of connection with the wretched criminal whose body had only just now been hidden from mocking eyes ? How much did he suspect ? how much did he know ? Her pale face and frightened eyes seemed to ask these questions of him ; but not a sound escaped her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , touched all that was tender in Sam 's romantic nature . In another moment he would have recalled his demand , and trusted her infinitely ; but in that critical moment she fainted quite away , to his mingled sorrow and alarm ; and Mrs. Shaughnessy being summoned , Sam received a wordy reprimand for having no more sense than to keep a sick woman up half of the night ; smarting under which undeserved censure , he retired , to think over the events of the evening . The hour of departure from Luckydog , for Sam 's coach , was four o'clock in the morning ; and its driver was not a little surprised , when about to mount the box , to discover Mrs. Page waiting to take a seat beside him . After the adventure of the previous night , it was with some restraint that he addressed her ; and there was wanting , also , something of his cheerful alacrity of manner , when he requested the stranger who had taken the box-seat , to yield it to a lady . The stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intimating that there was room for the lady between himself and the driver , if she insisted upon an outside seat . But Mrs. Page did not insist . She whispered Sam to open the coach-door , and quietly took a seat inside ; and Sam , with a sense of irritation very unusual with him , climbed reluctantly to his place , giving the " cayuses " the lash in a way that set them off on a keen run . By the time he had gotten his team cooled down , the unusual mood had passed , and the longing returned to hear the sweet voice , and watch the bright eyes that had made his happiness on former occasions . Puzzled as he was , and pained by the evidence he possessed of her connection , in some way , with the victim of lynch-law , that seemed like a dream in the clear , sunny air of morning , while the more blissful past asserted its claim to be considered reality . Not a lark , warbling its flute-notes by the way-side , not a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that leaped sparkling down the mountain , but recalled some charming utterance of Mrs. Dolly Page , as he first knew her ; as he could not now recognize her in the pale , nervous , and evidently suffering woman , sitting , closely veiled , inside the coach . Occupied with these thoughts , Sam felt a disagreeable shock when the outside passenger -- in a voice that contrasted roughly with that other voice which was murmuring in his ear -- began a remark about the mining prospects of Lucky-dog . " Some rich discoveries made in the neighborhood , eh ? Did you ever try your luck at mining ? " " Waal , no . I own a little stock , though , " answered Sam , carelessly . " In what mine ? " " In the Nip-and-tuck . " " Good mine , from all I hear about it . Never did any prospecting ? " asked the stranger , in that tone which denotes only a desire to make talk , with a view to kill time . " No , " in the same tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco into his mouth . " I 'd have sworn ' t was you I saw swinging a pick in the canon east of camp last night . " " I 'm not much on picks , " Sam returned , with a slowness that well counterfeited indifference . " I was visiting a lady last evening , which is a kind of prospecting more in my line . " " Yes , I understand ; that lady inside the coach . She 's a game one . " " It strikes me you 're devilish free in your remarks , " said Sam , becoming irritated again . " No offense meant , I 'm sure . Take a cigar ? We may as well talk this matter over calmly , Mr. Rice . You see it 's ten to one that you are implicated in this business . Been very attentive to Mrs. Page . Made several trips together . Let her handle your horses , so she could take them out of the stable for them thieves . Buried her thieving , gambling husband for her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm inclined to think you 've just been made a tool of . I know she 's a smart one . Tai n't often you find one smarter . " Sam 's eyes scintillated . He was strangely minded to pitch the outside passenger off the coach . The struggle in his breast between conviction and resistance to conviction amounted to agony . He could not , in that supreme moment , discriminate between the anger he felt at being falsely accused , and the grief and rage of being so horrible disillusioned . Their combined anguish paled his cheeks , and set his teeth on edge : of all of which the outside passenger was coolly cognizant . As they were , at that moment , in sight of the first station , he resumed . " Let her get up here , if she wants to ; I can ride inside . I do n't want to be hard on her ; but mind , if you breathe a word to her about my being an officer , I 'll arrest you on suspicion . Let every tub stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't help her , and do n't want to , either ; if she 's innocent , she 'll come out all right , never fear . Are you on the square , now ? " " Have you got a warrant ? " asked Sam , in a low tone , as he wound the lines around the break , previous to getting down . " You bet ! but I 'm in no hurry to serve it . Piney-woods station ' ill do just as well . Telegraph office there . " Mr. Rice was not in any haste this morning , being , as he said , ahead of time . He invited Mrs. Page to take her usual place on the box , telling her the gentleman had concluded to go inside ; and brought her a glass of water from the bar . While he was returning the glass , the passengers , including him of the outside , being busied assuaging their thirst with something stronger than water , a rattle of wheels and a clatter of hoofs was heard , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite accomplishment of driving six-in-hand ! When the " outside " recovered from his momentary surprise , he clapped his hand on the shoulder of Mr. Rice , and said , in a voice savage with spite and disappointment : " I arrest you , sir . " " Arrest and be d --  -- d ! " returned Sam . " If you had done your duty , you 'd have arrested her while you had the chance . " " That 's so -- your head is level ; and if you 'll assist me in getting on to Piney-woods station in time to catch the run-away -- for she ca n't very well drive beyond that station -- I 'll let you off . " " You 'll wait till I 'm on , I reckon . My horses ca n't go on that errand , and you dars n't take the up-driver 's team . Put that it your pipe and smoke it , old smarty ! "  - -  and Sam 's eyes emitted steel-blue lightnings , though his face wore a fixed expression of smiling . Upon inquiry , it was ascertained that horses might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the baffled officer , and such of the passengers as could not wait until next day , went in pursuit of them , Sam mounted one of the " cayuses , " and made what haste he could after the coach and Wells , Fargo &; Company 's express-box . Within a mile or less of Piney-woods Station , he met the keeper , the grooms , and an odd man or two , that chanced to have been about the place , all armed to the teeth , who , when they saw him , halted in surprise . " Why , we reckoned you was dead , " said the head man , with an air of disappointment . " Dead ? " repeated Sam . " Have you seen my coach ? " " That 's all right , down to the station ; and the plucky gal that druv it told us all about the raid the ' road-agents ' made on you . Whar 's the passengers ? any of ' em killed ? " " Passengers are all right . Where is Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on awful about ye ; an ' borrered a hoss to ride right on down the road to meet the other stage , an ' let ' em know what 's up . " " She did , did she ? " said Sam , very thoughtfully . " Waal , that is odd . Why , she ran away with my team -- that 's what she did ; and it 's all a hoax about the ' road-agents . ' The passengers are back at the other station . " Sam had suddenly become " all things to all men , " to a degree that surprised himself . He was wrong about the horse , too , as was proven by its return to its owner four days after . By the same hand came the following letter to Mr. Samuel Rice : " DEAR MR . RICE : It was so good of you ! I thank you more than I can say . I wish I could set myself right in your eyes , for I prize your friendship dearly -- dearly ; but I know that I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married to a bad , bad man , when I was only fifteen . He has ruined my life ; but now he is dead , and I need not fear him . I will hereafter live as a good woman should live .

Heaven send you such a wife . Good-bye , dear Mr. Rice , good-bye . " DOLLY PAGE ! " There are some men , as well as women , in this world , who could figure in the role of Evangeline , who have tender , loyal , and constant hearts . Such a one was the driver of the Lucky-dog stage . But , though he sat on that box for two years longer , and scrutinized every dark-eyed , sweet-voiced lady-passenger who rode in his coach during that time , often with an intense longing for a sight of the face he craved -- it never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished forever , and nothing was left him but a soiled photograph , and a tear-stained letter , worn with frequent folding and unfolding . EL TESORO . " Wimmen nater is cur'us nater , that I 'll allow . But a feller kind o ' hankers after ' em , fur all that . They 're a mighty handy thing to hev about a house . " The above oracular statement proceeded from the parched and puckered lips of Sandy-haired Jim -- one of the many " hands " employed on the immense Tesoro Rancho , which covered miles of valley , besides extending up on to the eastern flank of the Coast Range , and taking in considerable tracts of woodland and mountain pasture . Long before , when it acquired its name , under Spanish occupancy , there had been a rumor of the existence of the precious metals in the mountains which formed a portion of the grant ; hence , its name , Tesoro , signifying treasure . All search for , or belief in , gold mines , had been abandoned , even before the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only spoken of in the light of a Spanish legend ; but the name was retained , partly as a geographical distinction of a large tract of country , though it was sometimes called the Edwards Ranch , after its present proprietor , and after the American fashion of pronunciation . John Edwards had more than once said , in hearing of his men , that he would give half the proceeds of the mine and an interest in the ranch , to any one who would discover it and prove it to be of value ; a remark which was not without weight , especially with the herders and shepherds , whose calling took them into the mountains a considerable portion of the year . But as the offer of the proprietor never seemed to assume the air of a business proposition , the men who might have been inflamed by it with a prospecting fever , held in check their desire to acquire sudden riches , and never looked very sharp at the " indications , " which it was easy sometimes to imagine they had found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was not a cattle-herder , nor yet a shepherd , but farmer or teamster , as the requirement was , at different seasons of the year . He was expressing himself concerning John Edwards ' sister , who , just one year ago , had come to set up domesticity in the house of her brother ; whereas , previous to her advent , John had " bach 'd it " on the ranch , with his men , for four or five years . Jim , and the chum to whom his remarks were addressed , were roosting on a fence , after the manner of a certain class of agriculturists , hailing usually from Missouri , and most frequently from the county of Pike . The pale December sunshine colored with a soft gold the light morning haze which hung over the valley in which lay the Tesoro Rancho . In spite of the year of drought which had scorched up the grain-fields , and given a character of aridity to the landscape , it had a distinctive soft beauty of tint and outline , seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating pictures we remember to have seen , the most remarkable was one of a desert scene , with nothing but the stretches of yellow sand and the golden atmosphere for middle distance and background , and , for a foreground , a white tent , with camels and picturesquely costumed Arabs grouped before it . There was the sense of infinite distance in it which is so satisfying to the mind , which the few figures and broken lines intensified ; and there was that witching warmth and mellowness of coloring which does not belong to landscapes where green and gray hues predominate . Having said thus much about a picture , we have explained why Californian views , even in our great , almost treeless valleys , grow so into our hearts and imaginations , after the first dash of disappointment at not finding them like the vernal vales of New England or central New York . But Tesoro Rancho was not treeless . Great spreading oaks furnished just the necessary dark-green tones in the valley landscape ; and the mountain-sides had multifarious shades of color , furnished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere itself . It was no wonder , then , that sandy-haired Jim , sitting on a rail-fence , in an attitude more curious than graceful , cast his glance often unconsciously over the far valley-reaches , and up the mountain-sides , with a dim perception of something pleasant in the view which his thought took no cognizance of . In fact , for the last minute or two , his gaze had been a silent one ; and any observer might have pondered , considering the sharpness of the perch beneath him , whether he might not be making up his mind to descend from it as soon as his slow-working mentality had had time to convey the decision of his brain to his muscles . At all events , that was what he did in answer to our mental query , taking up the thread of his discourse where it was broken off , as follows : " Miss Edwards , neow ( thar she is , a-comin down from the mount'in , with her arms full of them ' zalias she 's so fond of ) , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wuth a heap more to keep a man 's house in good shape than one o ' them soft-lookin ' Chinee . Them 's my sentiments . " " That 's so , " responded his chum , seeming constitutionally disinclined to a longer sentence . " John Edwards has tuk to dressin ' hisself nicer , and fixin ' up the place as he did n't used to when he bach 'd it , I can tell ye ! When I see her bringin ' her pianny , and her picturs , and books , and sich like traps , I just told myself , ' Neow , John Edwards has got a pretty passel of trash on his hands , I veow . ' And I ment her as well as the other fol-de-rols . But , you bet your life , she 's got more sense , two to one , than ary one of us ! It was a lucky day for Edwards when she came onto this ranch , sure 's you 're born . " What further this equally philosophical and devoted admirer of Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently interesting topic , had he not been interrupted , will never be known . For the lady herself appeared upon the scene , putting an end to her own praises , and discovering to us , upon nearer view , that she added youth and grace , if not absolute beauty , to her other qualities . Checking the rapid lope of her horse , as she came near where the men were standing , in attitudes of frank , if awkward , deference , she saluted them with a cheerful " Good-morning , " and drew rein beside them . " Take Brownie by the head , and walk a little way with me , if you please , James . I have something I wish to say to you , " was the lady 's low-voiced command . A certain flush and pleased expression on honest Jim 's ruddy countenance reminded her instantly of the inherent vanity of man , and when she next addressed her attendant it was as " Mr. Harris , " for such , indeed , was the surname of our lank Missourian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How long have you been on this place , Mr. Harris ? " " Near onto six year , Miss Edwards , " replied Jim . " Did you know Mr. Charles Erskine , my brother 's former partner ? " " Just as well as I know your brother , Miss . " " What became of him , after he left this place ? " " I could n't rightly say , miss . Some said he went to the mines , up in Idaho , and other folks said they 'd seen him in ' Frisco : but I do n't know nary thing about him . " " He must be found , Mr. Harris . Do you think you could find him , if I were to send you on such a mission ? It is a very important one , and it is not every one I would intrust it to . " The flush and the pleased look returned to Jim 's face . " I 'd do the best I could , miss ; and , mebbe , I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking , Mr. Harris . You have been a long time here , and you are prompt and capable about your own business ; so I concluded I could trust you with mine . I am sure I was quite right . " Jim was going on to " swar she was , " when Miss Edwards interrupted him , to enlighten him further as to the requirements of " her business : " " I do not wish my brother to know what errand I send you on . They had a dreadful quarrel once , I believe ; and he might not agree with me as to the wisdom of what I am about to do . It will , therefore , be necessary for you to ask John 's permission to go on a visit to San Francisco , as if it was for yourself you were going . The drought has left so little to do that you can be spared , without embarrassment , until the rains begin . I am going to have a grand festival at Christmas , and I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain further when you have got John 's consent to your absence . Come to the house after , and ask if I have any commission for you . " When Miss Edwards cantered off , leaving him alone in the road , Jim was in a state of pleased bewilderment , not unmixed with an instinctive jealousy . " I do wonder , neow , what she wants with Charlie Erskine . He was a powerful nice feller , and smart as lightnin ' ; but , somehow , he an ' Edwards never could hitch hosses . Erskine always went too fast for steady John , an ' I doubt ef he did n't git him into some money troubles . I 'd like to know , though , what that girl 's got to do about it . Wonder ef she knowed him back in the States . Wimmen is cur'us , sure enough . " Jim 's suggestion was the true one . Miss Edwards had known Charles Erskine " back in the States , " and when they parted last , it had been as engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join her brother , a speedy marriage with him had been in contemplation . But how often did it happen , in old " steamer times , " that wives left New York to join husbands in San Francisco , only to find , on arrival at the end of a long voyage , the dear ones hidden from sight in the grave , or the false ones gone astray ! And so it happened to Mary Edwards , that , when she set foot on California soil , no lover appeared to welcome her , and her trembling and blushing were turned to painful suspense and secret bitter tears . Her brother had vouchsafed very little explanation ; only declaring Charles Erskine a scoundrel , who had nearly ruined him , and swearing he should never set foot on Tesoro Rancho until every dollar of indebtedness was paid . Poor Mary found it hard settling into a place so new , and duties so unaccustomed ; but her good sense and good spirits conquered difficulties as they arose , until now she was quite inclined to like the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gathered about her every comfort and many luxuries ; though , owing to embarrassments into which Erskine had drawn him , and to the losses of a year of drought , his purse was not overflowing . Such was the situation of affairs on the December morning when our story opens . Miss Edwards mentioned to her brother , during the day , that James Harris had spoken of going to the city , and that she had some commissions for him to perform . She had made up her mind to discountenance the heathen habits into which everybody on the ranch had fallen . She had done all she could to keep the men from going to bull-fights on the Sabbath , and had offered to read the morning service , if the men would attend ; and now she was going to celebrate Christmas , though she realty did believe that the people who never saw snow forgot that Christ was ever born ! Yet was he not born in a country very strongly resembling this very one which ignored him ? John smiled , and offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her commissions to the city very expensive ones , and suggesting , that , since she meant to be gay , she had better send some invitations to certain of their friends . " By the way John , do you know where Charles Erskine is ? " Miss Edwards asked , with much forced composure . " The last I heard of him he was in San Francisco , lying dangerously ill , " answered John coldly . " Oh , John ! " " Mary , you must hope nothing from that man . Do n't waste your sympathies on him , either ; he 'll never repay you the outgo . " " Tell me just one thing , John : Was Charles ever false to me ? Tell me the truth . " " I think he kept good faith with you . It is not that I complain of in his conduct . The quarrel is strictly between us . He can never come here , with my consent . " " But I can go to him , " said Miss Edwards , very quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her brother 's frowning face haunted her . " If all is right , " she said to him , at the very last , " I will be back to keep Christmas with you . Think as well as you can of me , John , and -- good-by . " It will be seen , that , whatever Miss Edwards ' little , womanly plan of reconciliation had been , it was , as to details , all changed by the information John had given her . What next she would do depended on circumstances . It was , perhaps , a question of life and death . The long , wearying , dusty stage-ride to San Francisco , passed like a disagreeable dream ; neither incident of heat by day , nor cold by night , or influence of grand or lovely scenes , seemed to touch her consciousness . James Harris , in his best clothes and best manners -- the latter having a certain gentle dignity about them that was born of the occasion -- sat beside her , and ministered assiduously to those personal wants which she had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself thought , if his mental processes could be called thinking , it would be difficult to state . He was dimly conscious that in his companion 's mind there was a heavy trouble brooding ; and conscious , also , of a desire to alleviate it , as far as possible , though in what way that might be done , he had not the remotest idea . There seemed an immense gulf between her and him , over which he never could reach to proffer consolation ; and while he blindly groped in his own mind for some hint of his duty , he was fain to be content with such personal attentions as defending her from heat and cold , dust and fatigue , and reminding her that eating and drinking were among the necessary inconveniences of this life . After a couple of days spent in revolving the case hopelessly in his brain , his thoughts at length shaped themselves thus : " Waal , neow , ' taint no concern of mine , to be sure ; but I 'm beound to see this gal threough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only got ter give her orders . I 'll obey ' em , ef they take me to thunder . That 's so , I veow ! " After which conclusion of the whole matter , Jim appeared more at his ease in all respects . In truth , the most enlightened of us go to school to just such mental struggles , with profit to our minds and manners . Arrived at San Francisco , Miss Edwards took quarters at a hotel , determined before reporting herself to any of her acquaintance to first find whether Charles Erskine was alive , and , if so , where he could be found . What a wearisome search was that before traces of him were discovered , in a cheap boarding-house , in a narrow , dirty street . And what bitter disappointment it was to learn that he had gone away some weeks before , as soon as he was able to be moved . To renew the search in the city , to send telegrams in every direction , was the next effort , which , like the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Miss Edwards made a few formal calls on her friends , concluded some necessary purchases , and set out on her return to Tesoro Rancho , exhausted in mind and body . If Jim was careful of her comfort before , he was tender toward her now ; and the lady accepted the protecting care of the serving-man with a dull sense of gratitude . She even smiled on him faintly , in a languid way , but in a way that seemed to him to lessen the distance between them . Jim 's education had been going on rapidly during the last ten days . He seemed to himself to be quite another man than the one who sat on the fence with Missouri Joe , less than two weeks agone . Perhaps Miss Edwards noticed the change , and innocently encouraged him to aspire . We must not blame her if she did . This is what woman 's education makes of her . The most cultured women must be grateful and flattering toward the rudest men , if circumstances throw them together . Born to depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiors are not at hand ; must , in fact , assume an inferiority to those inferiors . If they sometimes turn their heads with the dangerous deference , what wonder ! Secure in the distance between them , Miss Edwards assumed that she could safely defer to Sandy-haired Jim , if , as it seemed , he enjoyed the sense of being her protector . Even had he been her equal , she would have said to herself , " He knows my heart is breaking for another , and will respect my grief . " In this double security , she paid no heed to the devotion of her companion , only thinking him the kindest and most awkward of good and simple-minded men . That is just what any of us would have thought about Sandy-haired Jim , gentle readers . John Edwards received his sister with a grave kindliness , which aggravated her grief . He would not ask her a question , nor give her the smallest opportunity of appealing to his sympathies . She had undertaken this business without his sanction , and without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally , he should ever feel and act brotherly ; but toward her foolish weakness for Erskine , he felt no charity . He was surprised and pleased to see that his sister 's spirit was nearly equal to his own ; for , though visibly " pale and pining , " after the absurd fashion of women , she went about her duties and recreations as usual , and prosecuted the threatened preparations for Christmas with enthusiasm . In some of these , it was necessary to employ the services of one of the men , and Miss Edwards , without much thought of why , except that she was used to him , singled out Jim as her assistant . To her surprise , he excused himself , and begged to substitute Missouri Joe . " You see , Miss Edwards , I 've been a long time meanin ' to take a trip into the mount'ins . I allow it 'll rain in less nor a week , an ' then it 'll be too late ; so ef you 'll excuse me this once , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , certainly , Mr. Harris ; Joe will do very well , no doubt ; and there is no need for you to make excuses . I thought you would like to assist about these preparations , and I am sure you would , too ; but go , by all means , for , as you say , it must rain very soon , when it will be too late . " " Thar 's nothing I 'd like better nor stayin ' to work for you , Miss Edwards , " answered Jim , with some appearance of confusion ; " but this time I 'm obleeged to go -- I am , sure . " " Well , good-by , and good luck to you , Mr. Harris , " Miss Edwards said , pleasantly . " Ef she only knowed what I 'm a goin ' fur ! " muttered Jim to himself , as he went to " catch up " his horse , and pack up two or three days ' rations of bread and meat . " But I ai n't goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's best to keep this business to myself , I reckon . ' Peared like ' t was a hint of that kind she give me , the other day , when she said , ' The gods help them that help themselves , Mr. Harris . ' Such a heap o ' sense as that gal 's got ! She 's smarter'n John Edwards and me , and Missouri Joe , to boot : but I 'm a-gainin ' on it a leetle -- I 'm a-gainin ' on it a leetle , " concluded Jim , slowly , puckering his parched and sunburnt lips into a significant expression of mystery . What it was he was " gainin ' on , " did not appear , for the weight of his thoughts had brought him to a dead-stand , a few feet from the fence , on the hither side of which was the animal he contemplated riding . At this juncture of entire absence of mind , the voice of John Edwards , hailing him from the road , a little way off , dissolved the spell : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you discover that mine , I will give you half of it , and an interest in the ranch . " The words seemed to electrify the usually slow mind to which the idea was addressed . Turning short about , Jim , in a score of long strides , reached the fence separating him from Edwards . " Will you put that in writin ' ? " " To be sure , I will , " answered John , nodding his head , with a puzzled and ironical smile . " I 'll go to the house with ye , an ' hev it done to once , " said Jim , sententiously . " I hev about an hour to spar , I reckon . " John Edwards was struck by the unusual manner of the proverbially deliberate man , who had served him with the same unvarying " slow and sure " faithfulness for years ; but he refrained from comments . Jim , in his awkward way , proved to be more of a man of business than could have been expected . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the best way to settle it , I reckon . " " That is as good a way as any ; the discovery to be made within a certain time . " " An ' what interest in the ranch , Mr. Edwards ? " " Well , about the ranch , " said John , thoughtfully , " I do n't want to run any risk of trading it off for nothing , and there will have to be conditions attached to the transfer of any portion of that more than the one of discovery of the mine . Let it be this way : that on the mine proving by actual results to be worth a certain sum -- say $50,000 -- the deed shall be given to half the mine and one-third interest in the ranch ; the supposition being , that , if it is proved to be worth $50,000 , it is probably worth four times or ten times that amount . " " That 's about it , I should say , " returned Jim . " It 's lib'ral in you , any way , Mr. Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Edwards , looking him steadily in the eye , " I am in a devil of a pinch , that 's the truth of it ; and I am taking gambling chances on this thing . I only hope you may earn your third of the ranch . I 'll not grudge it to you , if you do . " " Thank ye , sir . An ' when them papers is made eout , I 'll be off . " John handed him his papers half an hour afterward , which Jim prudently took care to have witnessed . Miss Edwards being called in , signed her name . " So , this is what takes you to the mountains , Mr. Harris ? I 'm sure I wish you good luck . " " You did that afore , miss ; an ' it came , right on the spot . " " I must be your ' wishing fairy , ' " said she , laughing . " I 'll bring you a Christmas present , Miss Edwards , like as not , " Jim answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you may . Thank you for the intention , any way . " " Are you going all alone , Harris ? " asked Edwards , as he accompanied him a short distance from the house . " It is not quite safe going alone , is it ? Have you any heirs , supposing you lose yourself or break your neck ? " Once more Jim was electrified with an idea . His light , gray eyes turned on his questioner with a sudden flash of intelligence : " I mought choose my heir , I reckon . " " Certainly . " " Mought we go back to the house , an ' make a will ? " " Are n't you afraid turning back so often may spoil your luck ? " asked Edwards , laughing . " Ef you think so , I 'll never do it , " answered Jim , soberly . " But I 'll tell you , once fur all , who it is shall be my heir if any thing chance me , an ' I 'll expect you 'll act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your own sister , an ' you 'll not go fur to dispute my will ? " " I 've no right to dispute your will , whether I approve of it or not . There will be no proof of it , however , and I could not make over your property to my sister , should there be other heirs with a natural and rightful claim to it . But you are not going to make your will just yet , Harris ; so , good-by . You 'll be home on Christmas ? " " I reckon I will . " John Edwards turned back to the house , and to banter his sister on Jim Harris 's will , while that individual went about the business of his journey . His spirits were in a strange state of half-elation , half-depression . The depression was a natural consequence of the talk about a will , and the elation was the result of a strong and sudden faith which had sprung up in him in the success of his undertaking , and of the achievements of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wishin ' fairy , ' she said , an ' she wished me luck twice . I got the first stroke of it when John Edwards called to me across the field . I 've got him strong on that ; an ' I war a leetle surprised , too . He wanted to make me look sharp , that 's clar as mud . I 'll look sharp , you bet , John Edwards ! Did n't her hand look purty when she wrote her name ? I 've got her name to look at , any way . " And at this stage of his reverie , Jim drew from an inner breast-pocket the bond which Miss Edwards had witnessed , and , after gazing at the signature for a moment with moveless features , gave a shy , hasty glance all round him , and pressed his parched and puckered lips on the paper . The sentiment which caused this ebullition of emotion in Sandy-haired Jim was one so dimly defined , so little understood , and so absolutely pure in its nature , that had Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen in it the touching tribute which it was to abstract womanliness -- to the " wimmen nater , " of which Jim was so frank an admirer . The gulf which was between them had never yet been crossed , even in imagination , though it is presumable ; that , unknown to himself , Jim was trembling on the verge of it at this moment , dragged thither by the excitement of prospective wealth and the possibilities involved in it , and by the recollection of the pleasant words and smiles of this , to him , queen of women . After this gush of romance -- the first and only one Jim had ever been guilty of -- he returned the document to his pocket , and , with his customary deliberation , proceeded to catch and mount his horse , and before noon was on his way across the valley , toward that particular gorge in the mountain where el tesoro was supposed to be located . John Edwards stood in the house door watching him ambling over the waste , yellow plain , until Jim and his horse together appeared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk over with his sister the late transaction , and make some jesting remarks on the probability of the desired discovery . The days sped by , and there remained but two before Christmas . John and his sister were consulting together over the arrangement of some evergreen arches and wreaths of bay-leaves . Miss Edwards was explaining where the floral ornaments should come in , where she would have this picture , and where that , and how it would be best to light the rooms . " I confess , John , " she said , sitting down to braid the scarlet berries of the native arbutus into a wreath with the leaves of the California nutmeg , " that I can not make it seem like winter or like Christmas , with these open doors , these flowers , and this warm sunlight streaming in at the windows . I do wish we could have a flurry of snow , to make it seem like the holidays . " " Snow is out of the question ; but I should be thankful for a good rain-storm . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of crops next year in all this part of the country . " " And then we should have to ' go down into Egypt for corn , ' as the Israelites used to . Do you feel very apprehensive , John ? " Before John could reply , his attention was diverted by a strange arrival . Dismounting from Jim 's horse was a man whom he did not at once recognize , so shabby were his clothes , so worn and haggard his appearance . With a feeling of vague uneasiness and curiosity , he sauntered toward the gate , to give such greeting as seemed fit to the stranger who came in this guise , yet riding a well-conditioned horse belonging to one of his own men . Miss Edwards , who had also recognized the animal , ran , impulsively , to the door . She saw her brother advance to within a few feet of the stranger , then turn abruptly on his heel and return toward the house . The man thus contemptuously received , reeled , as if he would have fallen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning , as if unable to walk . " Who is it , John ? " asked Miss Edwards , anxiously regarding her brother 's stern countenance ; but he passed her , without a word . A sudden pallor swept over her face , and she looked , for one moment , as if she might have fainted ; then , with a cry of , " Oh , John , John , be merciful ! " she ran after him , and threw her arms about him . " Let me go , Mary , " said he , hoarsely . " If you wish to see Charles Erskine , you can do as you please . I wash my hands of him . " " But , John , he is ill ; he is suffering ; he may die -- and at your gate ! " " Let him die ! " It was then that the soul of Miss Edwards " stood up in her eyes , and looked at " her brother . She withdrew her arms and turned mutely toward the door , out of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid tread . Without hesitation she did that which is so hard for a woman to do -- make advances toward the man with whom she had once been in tender relations , but whose position has , for any reason , been made to appear doubtful . She went to him , took him by the hand , and inquired , more tremulously than she meant , what she could do for him . " Mary ! " answered the sick man , and then fainted quite away . Miss Edwards had him conveyed to her own room , by the hands of Missouri Joe and the Chinese cook , where she dispensed such restoratives as finally brought back consciousness ; and some slight nourishment being administered , revealed the fact that exhaustion and famine , more than disease , had reduced the invalid to his present condition ; on becoming aware of which fact , Miss Edwards grew suddenly embarrassed , and , arranging everything for his comfort , was about to withdraw from the apartment , when Erskine beckoned to her , and , fumbling in his pockets , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow metal , but of the value of which she had little conception . " Take these to John , " he said , " and tell him they are a peace-offering . They came from el tesoro . " " You have seen James Harris ; and he has discovered the mine ! " " I have seen no one . I discovered the mine myself . " " But the horse ? It was Harris ' horse you were riding . " " I did not know it ; I found him , fortunately , when I could no longer walk . " " Poor Charlie , " whispered Miss Edwards , moved by that womanly weakness which is always betraying the sex . She never knew how it was , but her head sank on the pillow ; and , when she remembered it afterward , she was certain that , in the confusion of her ideas , he kissed her . Then she fled from the room , and sought her brother everywhere , saying , over and over , to herself , " Poor Jim ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears streaming from her eyes , which she piously attributed to apprehensions for James Harris . When John was found , and the " specimens " placed in his hands , he was first incredulous , and then indignant ; for it hurts a proud man to be forced to change an opinion , or forgive an injury . The pressure of circumstances being too strong for him , he relented so far as to see Erskine , and talk over the discovery with him . What more the two men talked of , never transpired ; but Miss Edwards concluded that everything was settled , as her brother gave orders concerning the entertainment of his former partner , and looked and spoke with unusual vivacity for the remainder of the day . Many conjectures were formed concerning the fate of Sandy-haired Jim , by the men on the ranch , who generally agreed that his horse would not leave him , and that , if he were alive , he would be found not far from the spot where Charles Erskine picked up the animal . From Erskine 's account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , prospecting , before he discovered the mine ; by which time he was so reduced in strength , through hardship and insufficient food , that it was with difficulty he made his way down to the valley . Just at a time when to proceed further seemed impossible , and when he had been absent two days from the mine , he fell in with a riding-horse , quietly grazing , at the foot of the mountain . Catching and mounting him , he rode , first along the edge of the valley for some distance , to find , if possibly a party were encamped there ; but finding no one , started for his old home , riding as long as his strength allowed , and dismounting quite often to rest . In this way , three days and a half had passed , since the discovery of the mine . Judging from where the horse was found , Harris must have gone up on the other side of the ridge or spur , in which el tesoro was located . At all events , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as , whether or not any accident had befallen him , he was now without the means of reaching home ; and , to provide for any emergencies , John ordered the light wagon to be taken along , with certain other articles , so suggestive of possible pain and calamity , that Miss Edwards felt her blood chilled by the sight of them . " He will be so disappointed , " she said , " not to have been the discoverer of the mine . John , you must make him a handsome present , and I will see what I can do , to show my gratitude for his many kindnesses . " And then , happy in the presence of her lover , and the returning cheerfulness of her brother , Miss Edwards forgot to give more than a passing thought to James Harris , while she busied herself in the preparations for a holiday , which , to her , would be doubly an anniversary , ever afterward . The clouds , which had been gathering for a storm , during the past week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it necessary to light fires in the long-empty fire-places , and giving a truly festive glow to the holiday adornments of the Edwards Rancho . The ranch hands were dancing to the music of the " Arkansas Traveler , " in their separate quarters . John Edwards 's half-dozen friends from the city , with two or three of his sister 's , and the now convalescent Charles Erskine , clothed in a suit of borrowed broadcloth , were making mirth and music , after their more refined fashion , in Miss Edwards 's parlor . At the hour when , according to tradition , the Bethlehem Babe was born , Missouri Joe appeared at the door , and made a sign to the master of the house . " It 's a pity , like , " said Joe , softly , " to leave him out thar in the storm . " " ' Him ! ' Do you mean Harris ? How is he ? " " The storm ca n't hurt him none , " continued Joe ; " an ' it do not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tother house , no more . " " What is it , John ? " Miss Edwards asked anxiously , looking over his shoulder into the darkness . " Has Harris returned ? " " They have brought him , " answered John ; " and we must have him in here . " She shrank away , frightened and distressed , while the men brought what remained of Sandy-haired Jim , and deposited it carefully on a wooden bench in the hall . There was little to be told . The men had found him at the foot of a precipice where he had fallen . Beside him was a heavy nugget of pure gold , which he was evidently carrying when he fell . He had not died immediately , for in his breast-pocket was found the bond , with this indorsement , in pencil : " I hev lit onto the mine foller mi trail up the kenyon miss Mary edwards is mi air so help me God goodby . " JAMES HARRIS . " They buried him on Christmas Day ; and Miss Edwards , smiling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . " I am glad to do this for him , " she whispered to her lover , " for if ever there was a heart into which Christ was born at its birth , it was poor Jim 's . " POEMS . A PAGAN REVERIE .

O , joy-empurpled height , Down whose enchanted sides The rosy mist now glides , How can I loose thy sight ? How can my eyes turn where my feet must go , Trailing their way in woe ? Gone is my strength of heart ; The roses that I brought From thy dear bowers , and thought To keep , since we must part --  Thy thornless roses , sweeter until now , Than round Hymettus ' brow . The golden-vested bees Find sweetest sweetness in --  Such odors dwelt within The moist red hearts of these --  Alas , no longer give out blissful breath , But odors rank with death . Their dewiness is dank ; It chills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And their green stems hang lank , Stricken with leprosy , and fair no more , But withered to the core .

No more within thy vales , Beside thy plashing wells , Where sweet Euterpe dwells With songs of nightingales , And sounds of flutes that make pale Silence glow , Shall I their rapture know . Farewell , ye stately palms ! Clashing your cymbal tones , In thro ' the mystic moans Of pines at solemn psalms : Ye myrtles , singing Love 's inspired song , We part , and part for long !

" Come out into the garden , Maud ; " In whispered tones young Percy said : He but repeated what he 'd read That afternoon , with soft applaud : A snatch , which for my same name 's sake , He caught , out of the sweet , soft song , A lover for his love did make , In half despite of some fond wrong :  --  And more he quoted , just to show How still the rhymes ran in his head , With visions of the roses red That on the poet 's pen did grow . The poet 's spell was on our blood ; The spell of June was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charm of being young and fair . Where everything is fair and young --  As on June eves doth fitly seem : The Earth herself lies in among The misty , azure fields of space , A bride , whose startled blushes glow Less flame-like through the shrouds of lace That sweeter all her beauties show . We walked and talked beneath the trees --  Bird-haunted , flowering trees of June --  The roses purpled in the moon : We breathed their fragrance on the breeze --  Young Percy 's voice is tuned to clear Deep tones , as if his heart were deep : This night it fluttered on my ear As young birds flutter in their sleep . My own voice faltered when I said How very sweet such hours must be With one we love . At that word he Shook like the aspen overhead : " Must be ! " he drew me from the shade , To read my face to show his own : " Say are , dear Maud ! "  - -  my tongue was stayed ; My pliant limbs seemed turned to stone . He held my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And clasped them tightly to his breast ; While in my heart the question strove . The fire-flies flashed like wandering stars --  I thought some sprang from out his eyes : Surely some spirit makes or mars At will our earthly destinies ! " Speak , Maud ! "  - -  at length I turned away : He must have thought it woman 's fear ; For , whispering softly in my ear Such gentle thanks as might allay Love 's tender shame ; left on my brow , And on each hand , a warm light kiss --  I feel them burn there even now --  But all my fetters fell at this . I spoke like an injured queen : It 's our own defence when we 're surprised --  The way our weakness is disguised ; I said things that I could not mean , Or ought not -- since it was a lie That love had not been in my mind : ' T was in the air I breathed ; the sky Shone love , and murmured it the wind .

O , the poor mean vice We women have been taught to call By virtue 's name ! the holy scorn We feel for lovers left love-lorn By our own coldness , or by the wall Of other love ' twixt them and us ! The tempest past , I paused . He stood Silent ,  - -  and yet " Ungenerous !

" Here he smiled , To cover one low , quick-drawn sigh : " June eves disturb us differently , " He said , at length ; " and I , beguiled By something in the air , did do My Lady Maud unmeant offence ; And , what is stranger far , she too , Under the baleful influence of this fair heaven "  - -  he raised his eyes , And gestured proudly toward the stars --  " Has done me wrong . Wrong , lady , mars God 's purpose , written on these skies , Painted and uttered in this scene : Acknowledged in each secret heart ; We both are wrong , you say ; ' t would mean That we too should be wide apart --  And so , adieu !

Was this the same enchanted air I breathed one little hour ago ? Did all these purple roses blow But yestermorn , so sweet , so fair ? Was it this eve that some one said " Come out into the garden , Maud ? " And while the sleepy birds o'erhead Chirped out to know who walked abroad , Did we admire the plumey flowers On the wide-branched catalpa trees , And locusts , scenting all the breeze ; And call the balm-trees our bird-towers ? Did we recall the " black bat Night , " That flew before young Maud walked forth --  And say this Night 's wings were too bright For bats ' being feathered , from its birth , Like butterflies ' with powdered gold : Still talking on , from gay to grave , And trembling lest some sudden wave Of the soul 's deep , grown over-bold , Should sweep the barriers of reserve , And whelm us in tumultuous floods Of unknown power ?

Alas , I only knew that late I 'd seemed in an enchanted sphere ; That now I felt the web of fate Close round me , with a mortal fear . If only once the gods invite To banquets that are crowned with roses ; After which the celestial closes Are barred to us ; if in despite Of such high favor , arrogant We blindly choose to bide our time , Rejecting Heaven's -- and ignorant What we have spurned , attempt to climb To heavenly places at our will --  Finding no path thereto but one , Nemesis-guarded , where atone To heaven , all such as hopeful still , Press toward the mount ,  - -  yet find it strewn With corses , perished by the way , Of those who Fate did importune Too rashly , or her will gainsay .

These did defy , With contrary fate-compelling power , The intended bliss ;  --  ' t was June , not I. LINES TO A LUMP OF VIRGIN GOLD .

On yonder hillside sleep in nameless graves , To which they went untended , the poor slaves Of fruitless toil ; the victims of a fever Called home-sickness -- no remedy found ever ; Or slain by vices that grow rankly where Men madly do and dare , In alternations of high hope and deep abysses Of recklessnesses . Painfully , and by violence : Even as heaven is taken , thou wert dragged whence Nature had hidden thee -- whose face is worn With anxious furrows , and her bosom torn In the hard strife -- and ever yet there lingers Upon these hills work for the " effacing fingers " Of time , the healer , who makes all things seem A half forgotten dream ; Who smooths deep furrows and lone graves together , By touch of wind and weather . Thou heavy , lustreless , dull clod ! Digged from the earth like a base common sod ; I wonder at thee , and thy power to hold The world in bond to thee , thou yellow gold ! Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly show my estimation By giving house-room to thee , if thou'lt come And cumber up my home ;  --  I 'd even promise not to call attention To these things that I mention ! " The King can do no wrong , " and thou Art King indeed to most of us , I trow . Thou'rt an enchanter , at whose sovereign will All that there is of progress , learning , skill , Of beauty , culture , grace -- and I might even Include religion , though that flouts at heaven --  Comes at thy bidding , flies before thy loss ;  --  And yet men call thee dross ! If thou art dross then I mistaken be Of thy identity . Ah , solid , weighty , beautiful ! How could I first have said that thou wert dull ? How could have wondered that men willingly Gave up their homes , and toiled and died for thee ? Theirs was the martyrdom in which was planted A glorious State , by precious memories haunted : Ours is the comfort , ease , the power , the fame Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud ambition --  Ours is the full fruition . Thou , yellow nugget , wert the star That drew these willing votaries from afar , ' T were wrong to call thee lustreless or base That lightest onward all the human race , Emblem art thou , in every song or story , Of highest excellence and brightest glory : Thou crown'st the angels , and enthronest Him Who made the cherubim : My reverend thought indeed is not withholden , O nugget golden ! MAGDALENA . You say there 's a Being all-loving , Whose nature is justice and pity ; Could you say where you think he is roving ? We have sought him from city to city , But he never is where we can find him , When outrage and sorrow beset us ; It is strange we are always behind him , Or that He should forever forget us . But being a god , he is thinking Of the masculine side of the Human ; And though just , it would surely be sinking The God to be thoughtful for woman . For him and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its treasures ; An after-thought , woman -- the handmaid , Not of God , but of man and his pleasures . Should you say that man 's God would reprove us , If we found him and showed him our bruises ? It is dreary with no one to love us , Or to hold back the hand that abuses : Man 's hand , that first led and caressed us , Man 's lips , that first kissed and betrayed ;  --  If his God could know how he 's oppressed us , Do you think that we need be afraid ? For we loved him -- and he who stood nearest To God , who could doubt or disdain ? When he swore by that God , and the dearest Of boons that he hoped to obtain Of that God , that he truly would keep us In his heart of hearts precious and only : Say , how could we think he would steep us In sorrow , and leave us thus lonely ? But you see how it is : he has left us , This demi-god , heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , And mocked at our mad desolation : Says that we knew that such oaths would be broken --  Says we lured him to lie and betray ; Quotes the word of his God as a token Of the law that makes woman his prey . And now what shall we do ? We have given To this master our handmaiden 's dower : Our beauty and youth , aye , and even Our souls have we left in his power . Though we thought when we loved him , that loving Made of woman an angel , not demon ; We have found , to our fond faith 's disproving , That love makes of woman a leman ! Yes , we gave , and he took : took not merely What we gave , for his lying pretences : But our whole woman world , that so dearly We held by till then : our defences Of home , of fair fame ; the affection Of parents and kindred ; the human Delight of child-love ; the protection That is everywhere owed to a woman . You say there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity : Could you say where you think he is roving ? We have sought him from city to city . We have called unto him , our eyes streaming With the tears of our pain and despair : We have shouted unto him blaspheming , And whispered unto him in prayer . But he sleeps , or is absent , or lending His ear to man 's prouder petition : And the black silence over us bending Scorches hot with the breath of perdition . For this fair world of man 's , in which woman Pays for all that she gets with her beauty , Is a desert that starves out the human , When her charms charm not squarely with duty . For man were we made , says the preacher , To love him and serve him in meekness , Of man 's God is man solely the teacher Interpreting unto our weakness : He the teacher , the master , dispenser Not only of law , but of living , Breaks his own law with us , then turns censor , Accusing , but never forgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resentment for wrong and betrayal ? From our hearts , filled with gall , rises cursing , To our own and our masters ' dismayal . ' T is for this that we seek the all-loving , Whose nature is justice and pity ; And we 'll find Him , wherever he 's roving , In country , in town , or in city . He must show us his justice , who made us ; He must place sin where sin was conceived ; We must know if man 's God will upbraid us Because we both loved and believed . We must know if man 's riches and power , His titles , crowns , sceptres and ermine , Weigh with God against womanhood 's dower , Or whether man 's guilt they determine . It would seem that man 's God should restrain him , Or else should avenge our dishonor : Shall the cries of the hopeless not pain him , Or shall woman take all guilt upon her ? Let us challenge the maker that made us ; Let us cry to Christ , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has betrayed us , Heaven 's justice accords with the human . We must know if because we were lowly , And kept in the place man assigned us , He could seek us with passions unholy And be free , while his penalties bind us . We would ask if his gold buys exemption , Or whether his manhood acquits him ; How it is that we scarce find redemption For sins less than his self-law permits him . Do we dare the Almighty to question ? Shall the clay to the potter appeal ? To whom else shall we go with suggestion ? Shall the vase not complain to the wheel ? God answered Job out of the groaning Of thunder and whirlwind and hailing ; Will he turn a deaf ear to our moaning , Or reply to our prayers with railing ? Did you speak of a Christ who is tender --  A deity born of a woman ? Of the sorrowful , God and defender , And brother and friend of the human ? Long ago He ascended to heaven , Long ago was His teaching forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heavy , unwholesome and rotten . The gods are all man 's , whom he praises For laws that make woman his creature ; For the rest , theological mazes Furnish work for the salaried preacher . In the youth of the world it was better , We had deities then of our choosing ; We could pray , though we wore then a fetter , To a GODDESS of binding and loosing . We could kneel in a grove or a temple , No man 's heavy hand on our shoulder : Had in Pallas Athene example To make womanhood stronger and bolder . But the temples are broken and plundered , Sacred altars profanely o'erthrown ; Where the oracle trembled and thundered , Are a cavern , a fount , and a stone . Yet we would of the Christ hear the story , ' T was familiar in days that are ended ; His humility , purity , glory , Are they not into heaven ascended ? We see naught but scorning and hating ; We hear naught but threats and contemning : For your Christian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning . Should you say that the Christ would reprove us , If we found him and told him our trouble ? It is fearful with no one to love us , And our pain and despair growing double . It is mad'ning to feel we 're excluded From the homes of the mothers that bore us ; And that man , by no false arts deluded , May enter unchallenged before us . It is hard to be humble when trodden ; We can not be meek when oppressed ; Nor pure while our souls are made sodden With loathing that ca n't be confessed ; Or true , while our bread and our shelter By a lying pretence is obtained --  Deceived , in deception we welter ; By a touch are we evermore stained . O hard lot of woman ! the creature Of a creature whose God is asleep , Or gone on a journey . You teach her She was made to sin , suffer , and weep ; We wait for a new revelation , We cry for a God of our own ; O God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar of stone ! REPOSE . I lay me down straight , with closed eyes , And pale hands folded across my breast , Thinking , unpained , of the sad surprise Of those who shall find me thus fall'n to rest ; And the grief in their looks when they learn no endeavor , Can disturb my repose -- for my sleep is forever . I know that a smile will lie hid in my eyes , Even a soft throb of joy stir the pulse in my breast , When they sit down to mourning , with tears and with sighs , And shudder at death , which to me is but rest . So sweet to be parted at once from our pain ; To put off our care as a robe that is worn ; To drop like a link broken out of a chain , And be lost in the sands by Time 's tide overborne : And to know at my loss all the wildest regretting , Will be as a foot-print , washed out in forgetting . To be certain of this -- that my faults perish first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can but forgive me my errors at worst , And speak of my praises alone as they weep . " Whom the gods love die young , " they will say ; Though they should think it , they will not say so : " Whom the world pierces with thorns pass away , Grieving , yet asking and longing to go ! " No , when they see how divine my repose is , They 'll forget that my-life-path is not over roses ; And they 'll whisper together , with hands full of flowers , How always I loved them to wear on my breast ; And strewing them over my bosom in showers , With hands shaken by sobs , leave me softly to rest . There is one who will come when the rest are away ; One bud of a rose will he bring for my hair ; He knows how I liked it , worn always that way , And his fingers will tremble while placing it there . Yes , he 'll remember those soft June-day closes , When the sky was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flush on the sky and the flowers , And the red on my cheek where his lips had been prest ; But the throes of his heart in the long , silent hours , Will disturb not my dreams , so profoundly I 'll rest . So , all will forget , what to think of mere pain , That the heart now asleep in this solemn repose , Had contended with tempests of sorrow in vain , And gone down in the strife at the feet of its foes : They will choose to be mute when a deed I have done , Or a word I have spoke I can no more atone ; They 'll remember I loved them , was faithful and true ; They 'll not say what a wild will abode in my breast ; But repeat to each other , as if they were new , Old stories of what did the loved one at rest . Ah ! while I lie soothing my soul with this dream , The terror of waking comes back to my heart ; Why is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the world , ere we part ? Deep was the swoon of my spirit -- why break it ? Why bring me back to the struggles that shake it ? Alas , there is room on my feet for fresh bruises --  The flowers are not dead on my brow or my breast --  When shall I learn " sweet adversity 's uses , " And my tantalized spirit be truly at rest ! ASPASIA . O , ye Athenians , drunken with self-praise , What dreams I had of you , beside the sea , In far Miletus ! while the golden days Slid into silver nights , so sweet to me ; For then I dreamed my day-dreams sweetly o'er , Fancying the touch of Pallas on my brow --  Libations of both heart and wine did pour , And offered up my being with my vow . ' T was thus to Athens my heart drew at last My life , my soul , myself . Ah , well , I learn To love and loathe the bonds that hold me fast , Your captive and your conquerer in turn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of fair boy-beauties ? gentled for your love To match the freshness of the morning rose , And lisp in murmurs like the cooing dove . O , men of Athens ! by the purple sea In far Miletus , when I dreamed of you , Watching the winged ships that invited me To follow their white track upon the blue ; ' T was the desire to mate my lofty soul That drew me ever like a viewless chain Toward Homer 's land of heroes , ' til I stole Away from home and dreams , to you and pain . I brought you beauty -- but your boys invade My woman 's realm of love with girlish airs . I brought high gifts , and powers to persuade , To charm , to teach , with your philosophers . But knowledge is man 's realm alone , you hold ; And I who am your equal am cast down Level with those who sell themselves for gold --  A crownless queen -- a woman of the town ! Ye vain Athenians , know this , that I By your hard laws am only made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cry , But , being unwed , I meet you openly , A foreigner , you can not wed with me ; But I can win your hearts and sway your will , And make your free wives envious to see What power Aspasia wields , Milesian still . Who would not be beloved of Pericles ? I could have had all Athens at my feet ; And have them for my flatterers , when I please ; Yet , one great man 's great love is far more sweet ! He is my proper mate as I am his --  You see my young dreams were not all in vain --  And I have tasted of ineffable bliss , If I am stung at times with fiery pain . It is not that I long to be a wife By your Athenian laws , and sit at home Behind a lattice , prisoner for life , With my lord left at liberty to roam ; Nor is it that I crave the right to be At the symposium or the Agora known ; My grievance is , that your proud dames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . They fear ; what do they fear ? is't me or you ? Am I not pure as any of them all ? But your laws are against me ; and ' t is true , If fame is lowering , I have had a fall ! O , selfish men of Athens , shall the world Remember you , and pass my glory by ? Nay , ' til from their proud heights your names are hurled , Mine shall blaze with them on your Grecian sky . Am I then boastful ? It is half in scorn Of caring for your love , or for your praise , As women do , and must . Had I been born In this proud Athens , I had spent my days In jealousy of boys , and stolen hours With some Milesian , of a questioned place , Learning of her the use of woman 's powers Usurped by men of this patrician race . Alas ! I would I were a child again , Steeped in dream langours by the purple sea ; And Athens but the vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble women free : That I in some winged ship should strive to fly To reach this goal , and founder and go down ! O impious thought , how could I wish to die , With all that I have felt and learned unknown ? Nay , I am glad to be to future times As much Athenian as is Pericles ; Proud to be named by men of other climes The friend and pupil of great Socrates . What is the gossip of the city dames Behind their lattices to one like me ? More glorious than their high patrician names I hold my privilege of being free ! And yet I would that they were free as I ; It angers me that women are so weak , Looking askance when ere they pass me by Lest on a chance their lords should see us speak ; And coming next day to an audience In hope of learning to resemble me : They wish , they tell me , to learn eloquence --  The lesson they should learn is liberty . O Athens , city of the beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Whose orators and poets sway the soul As the winds move the sea 's unstable face ; O wonderous city , nurse and home of mind , This is my oracle to you this day --  No generous growth from starved roots will you find , But fruitless blossoms weakening to decay . You take my meaning ? Sappho is no more , And no more Sapphos will be , in your time ; The tree is dead on one side that before Ran with such burning sap of love and rhyme . Your glorious city is the utmost flower Of a one-sided culture , that will spend Itself upon itself , ' till , hour by hour , It runs its sources dry , and so must end . That race is doomed , behind whose lattices Its once free women are constrained to peer Upon the world of men with vacant eyes ; It was not so in Homer 's time , I hear . But Eastern slaves have eaten of your store , Till in your homes all eating bread are slaves ; They 're built into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty architraves . A woman of the race that looks upon The sculptured emblems of captivity , Shall bear a slave or tyrant for a son ; And none shall know the worth of liberty . Am I seditious ?  - -  Nay , then , I will keep My lesson for your dames when next they steal On tip-toe to an audience . Pray sleep Securely , and dream well : we wish your weal ! Why , what vain prattle : but my heart is sore With thinking on the emptiness of things , And these Athenians , treacherous to the core , Who hung on Pericles with flatterings . I would indeed I were a little child , Resting my tired limbs on the sunny sands In far Miletus , where the airs blow mild , And countless looms throb under busy hands . The busy hand must calm the busy thought , And labor cool the passions of the hour ; To the tired weaver , when his web is wrought , What signifies the party last in power ? But here in Athens , ' twixt philosophers Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vain array of orators , Who strove to hold the people in control . Between the poets , artists , critics , all , Who form a faction or who found a school , We weave Penelope 's web with hearts of gall , And my poor brain is oft the weary tool . Yet do I choose this life . What is to me Peace or good fame , away from all of these , But living death ? I do choose liberty , And leave to Athens ' dames their soulless ease . The time shall come , when Athens is no more , And you and all your gods have passed away ; That other men , upon another shore , Shall from your errors learn a better way . To them eternal justice will reveal Eternal truth , and in its better light All that your legal falsehoods now conceal , Will stand forth clearly in the whole world 's sight . A REPRIMAND . Behold my soul ? She sits so far above you Your wildest dream has never glanced so high ; Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How fairly we were mated , eye to eye How long we dallied on in flowery meadows , By languid lakes of purely sensuous dreams , Steeped in enchanted mists , beguiled by shadows , Casting sweet flowers upon loitering streams , My memory owns , and yours ; mine with deep shame , Yours with a sigh that life is not the same . What parted us , to leave you in the valley And send me struggling to the mountain-top ? Too weak for duty , even love failed to rally The manhood that should float your pinions up . On my spent feet are many half-healed bruises , My limbs are wasted with their heavy toil , But I have learned adversity 's " sweet uses , " And brought my soul up pure through every soil ; Have I no right to scorn the man 's dead power That leaves you far below me at this hour ? Scorn you I do , while pitying even more The ignoble weakness of a strength debased . Do I yet mourn the faith that died of yore --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over all , my soul mounts free To heights of peace you can not hope to gain , Sings to the stars its mountain minstrelsy , And smiles down proudly on your murky plain ; ' T is vain to invite you -- yet come up , come up , Conquer your way toward the mountain-top ! TO MRS.  - -   - -   . I can not find the meaning out That lies in wrong and pain and strife ; I know not why we grope through grief , Tear-blind , to touch the higher life . I see the world so subtly fair , My heart with beauty often aches ; But ere I quiet this sweet pain , Some cross so presses , the heart breaks . To-day , this lovely golden day , When heaven and earth are steeped in calm ; When every lightest air that blows , Sheds its delicious freight of balm . If I but ope my lips , I sob ; If but an eyelid lift , I weep ; I deprecate all good or ill , And only wish for endless sleep . For who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and troubled ways ? And who denies my soul 's desire , When with its might it cries and prays ? In my unconscious veins there runs Perchance , some old ancestral taint ; In Eve I sinned : poor Eve and I ! We each may utter one complaint :  --  One and the same -- for knowledge came Too late to save her paradise ; And I my paradise have lost ; Forsooth because I am not wise . O vain traditions ! small the aid We women gather from your lore : Why , when the world was lost , did death Not come our children 's birth before ? It had been better to have died , Sole prey of death , and ended so ; Than to have dragged through endless time , One long , unbroken trail of woe . To suffer , yet not expiate ; To die at last , yet not atone ; To mourn our heirship to a guilt , Erased by innocent blood alone ! You lift your hands in shocked surprise ; You say enough I have not prayed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web of fate one braid ? Nay , own the truth , and say that we Are but the bonded slaves of doom ; Unconscious to the cradle came , Unwilling must go to the tomb . Your woman 's hands are void of help , Though my soul should be stung to death ; Could I avert one pang from you , Imploring with my latest breath ? And men !  - -  we suffer any wrong That men , or mad , or blind , may do ;  --  Let me alone in my despair ! There is no help for me or you . I wait to find the meaning out That lies beyond the bitter end ; Comfort yourself with ' wearying heaven , I ask no comfort , oh my friend ! MOONLIGHT MEMORIES . Do thy chamber windows open east , Beloved , as did ours of old ? And do you stand when day has ceased , Withdrawn thro ' evening 's porch of gold , And watch the pink flush fade above The hills on which the wan moon leans , Remembering the sweet girlish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your hand upon your heart --  I see you dash away the tears --  It is the same undying smart , That touched us in the long-gone years ; And can not pass away . You stand Your forehead to the window crest , And stifle sobs that no command Can keep from rising in your breast . Dear , balm is not for griefs like ours , Nor resurrection for dead hope : In vain we cover wounds with flowers , That grow upon life 's western slope . Their leaves tho ' bright , are hard , and dry , They have no soft and healing dew ; The pansies of past spring-times lie Dead in the shadow of the yew . You feel this in your heart , and turn To pace the dimness of your room ; But lo , like fire within an urn , The moonlight glows through all the gloom . It sooths you like a living touch , And spite of the slow-falling tears , Sweet memories crowd with oh , so much , Of all that girlhood 's time endears . On nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wintry sky ; Or on the softer nights of June , When fleecy clouds fled thought-like by , Within our chamber opening east , With curtains from the window parted , With hands and cheeks together prest , We dreamed youth 's glowing dreams , light-hearted . Or talked of that mysterious love That comes like fate to every soul : And vowed to hold our lives above , Perchance its sorrowful control . Alas , the very vow we made , To keep our lives from passion free , To wiser hearts well had betrayed Some future love 's intensity . How well that youthful vow was kept , Is written on a deathless page --  Vain all regrets , vain tears we 've wept , The record lives from age to age . But one who " doeth all things well , " Who made us differ from the throng , Has it within his heart to quell This torturing pain of thirst , ere long . And you , whose soul is all aglow With fire Prometheus brought from heaven , Shall in some future surely know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a restless pain Shall beat your heart , or throb your brow ; Not always shall you sigh in vain For hope 's fruition , hidden now . Beloved , are your tear-drops dried ? The moon is riding high above :  --  Though each from other 's parted wide , We have not parted early love . And tho ' you never are forgot , The moonrise in the east shall be The token that my evening thought Returns to home , and love and thee ! VERSES FOR M --  --  . The river on the east Ripples its azure flood within my sight ; And , darting from the west , Are " sunset arrows , " feathered with red light . The northern breeze has hung His wintry harp upon some giant pine ; And the pale stars among , I see the star I love to name as mine : But toward the south I turn my eager eyes --  Beyond its flushed horizon my heart lies . The snow-clad isles of ice , Launched by wild Boreas from a northern shore , Journey the way my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky Its own pink blush , and , floating out of sight , Bear south the softest dye Of northern heavens , to fade in southern night :  --  My eyes but look the way my joys are gone , And the ice-islands travel not alone . The untrod fields of snow , Glow with the rosy blush of parting day ; And fancy asks if so The snow is stained with sunset far away ; And if some face , like mine , Its forehead pressed against the window-pane , Peers northward , with the shine Of the pole-star reflected in eyes ' rain : " Ah yes , " my heart says , " it is surely so ; " And , like a bound bird , flutters hard to go . Sad eyes , that , blurred with tears , Gaze into darkness , gaze no more in vain Whence no loved face appears , And no voice comes to lull the heart 's fond pain !

AUTUMNALIA . The crimson color lays As bright as beauty 's blush along the West ; And a warm golden haze , Promising sheafs of ripe Autumnal days To crown the old year 's crest . Hangs in mid air , a half-pellucid maze , Through which the sun at set , Grown round and rosy , looks with Bacchian blush , For an old wine-god meet --  Whose brows are dripping with the grape-blood sweet , As if his southern flush Rejoiced him , in his northern-zone retreat . The amber-colored air Musical is with hum of tiny things Held idly , struggling there , As if the golden mist entangled were About the viewless wings , That beat out music on their gilded snare . If but a leaf , all gay With Autumn 's gorgeous coloring , doth fall , Along its fluttering way A shrill alarum wakes a sharp dismay , And , answering to the call , The insect chorus swells and dies away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing notes cried out , As do mischievous boys --  Startling their playmates with a pained voice , Or sudden thrilling shout , Followed by laughters , full of little joys . Perchance a lurking breeze Springs , just awakened to its wayward play , Tossing the sober trees Into a frolic maze of ecstasies , And snatching at the gay Banners of Autumn , strews them where it please . The sunset colors glow A second time in flame from out the wood , As bright and warm as though The vanished clouds had fallen , and lodged below Among the tree-tops , hued With all the colors of heaven 's signal-bow . The fitful breezes die Into a gentle whisper , and then sleep ; And sweetly , mournfully , Starting to sight , in the transparent sky , Lone in the upper deep , Sad Hesper pours its beams upon the eye ; And for one little hour , Holds audience with the lesser lights of heaven ; Then to its western bower Descends in sudden darkness , as the flower That at the fall of Even Shuts its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon , with a dusky face , Pensive and proud as an East Indian queen , And with a solemn grace , The moon ascends , and takes her royal place In the fair evening scene ; While all the reverential stars , apace , Take up their march through the cool fields of space , And dead is the sweet Autumn day whose close we 've seen . PALO SANTO . In the deep woods of Mexico , Where screams the " painted paraquet , " And mocking-birds flit to and fro , With borrowed notes they half forget ; Where brilliant flowers and poisonous vines Are mingled in a firm embrace , And the same gaudy plant entwines Some reptile of a poisonous race ; Where spreads the Itos ' icy shade , Benumbing , even in summer 's heat , The thoughtless traveler who hath laid Himself to noonday slumbers sweet ;  --  Where skulks unseen the beast of prey --  The native robber glares and hides ,  --  And treacherous death keeps watch alway On him who flies , or he who bides . In these deep tropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bole Above the dusky forest shows , As shining as a saintly soul Among the souls of sinful men ;  --  Lifting its milk-white flowers to heaven , And breathing incense out , as when The passing saints of earth are shriven . The skulking robber drops his eyes , And signs himself with holy cross , If , far between him and the skies , He sees its pearly blossoms toss . The wanderer halts to gaze upon The lovely vision , far or near , And smiles and sighs to think of one He wishes for the moment here . The Mexic native fears not fang Of poisonous serpent , vine , nor bee , If he may soothe the baleful pang With juices of this " holy tree . " How do we all , in life 's wild ways , Which oft we traverse lost and lone , Need that which heavenward draws the gaze , Some Palo Santo of our own ! A SUMMER DAY . Fade not , sweet day !

Lost , lone , and sad ; And troubled more and more , By the dark ways , and sore , In which my feet are led ;  --  Alas , my heart , it was not always so ! Therefore , O happy day , Haste not to fade away , Nor let pale night chill all thy tender glow --  Thy rosy mists , that steep The violet hills in sleep --  Thy airs of gold , That over all the plain , And fields of ripened grain , A shimmering glory hold ,  --  The soft fatigue-dress of the drowsy sun ; Dreaming , as one who goes To peace , and sweet repose , After a battle hardly fought , and won : Even so , my heart , to-day , Dream all thy fears away . O happy tears , That everywhere I gaze , Jewel the golden maze , Flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scene : Beat , heart , more soft and low , Creep , hurrying blood , more slow : Waste not one throb , to lose me the serene , Deep , satisfying bliss Of such an hour as this ! How like our dream , Of that delightful rest God keepeth for the blest , This lovely peace doth seem ;  --  Perchance , my heart , He sent this gracious day , That when the dark and cold , Thy doubtful steps enfold , Thou , may'st remember , and press on thy way , Nor faint midway the gloom That lies this side the tomb . All , all in vain , Sweet day , do I entreat To stay thy winged feet ; The gloom , the cold , the pain , Gather me back as thou dost pale and fade ; Yet in my heart I make A chamber for thy sake , And keep thy picture in warm color laid :  --  Thy memory , happy day , Thou can'st not take away . HE AND SHE . Under the pines sat a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " life is sweet , think'st thou not so ? " Sweet were her eyes , full of pictures of Aidenn ,  --  " Life ? " said she ; " love is sweet ; no more I know . " Into the wide world the maid and her lover Wandered by pathways that sundered them far ; From pine-groves to palm-groves , he flitted a rover , She tended his roses , and watched for his star . Oft he said softly , while melting eyes glistened , " Sweet is my life , love , with you ever near : " Morning and evening she waited and listened For a voice and a foot-step that never came near . Fainting at last , on her threshold she found him : " Life is but ashes , and bitter , " he sighed . She , with her tender arms folded around him , Whispered --  " But love is still sweet ; " and so died . O WILD NOVEMBER WIND . O wild November wind , blow back to me The withered leaves , that drift adown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , On which youth 's fairy fleet of dreams was cast ; Return to me the beautiful No More --  O wild November wind , restore , restore ! November wind , in what dim , loathsome cave , Languish the tender-plumed gales of spring ? No more their dances dimple o'er the wave , Nor freighted pinions song and perfume bring : Those gales are dead -- that dimpling sea is dark ; And cloudy ghosts clutch at each mist-like bark . O wild , wild wind , where are the summer airs That kissed the roses of the long-ago ? Taking them captive -- swooned in blissful snares --  To let them perish . Now no roses blow In the waste gardens thou art laying bare : Where are my heart 's bright roses , where , oh where ? Thou hast no answer , thou unpitying gale ? No gentle whisper from the past to me ! No snatches of sweet song -- no tender tale --  No happy ripple of that summer sea ; Are all my dreams wrecked on the nevermore ? O wild November wind , restore , restore ! BY THE SEA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog on the sea ; Ruby and gold is the sunset ,  --  And Bertha is waiting for me . Down on the loathsome sand-beach , Her eyes as blue as the mist ; Her brows as white as the sea-fog ,  --  Bertha , whose lips I have kissed . Bertha , whose lips are like rubies , Whose hair is like coiled gold ; Whose sweet , rare smile is tenderer Than any legend of old . One morn , one noon , one sunset , Must pass before we meet ; O wind and sail bear steady on , And bring me to her feet . The morn rose pale and sullen , The noon was still and dun ; Across the storm at sunset , Came the boom of a signal-gun . Who treads the loathsome sand-beach , With wet , disordered hair ; With garments tangled with sea-weed , And cheeks more pale than fair ? O blue-eyed , white-browed maiden , He will keep love 's tryst no more ; His ship sailed safely into port --  But on the heavenward shore . POLK COUNTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was gray With delicate mists , blown down From hill-tops by the south wind 's balmy breath ; And all the oaks were brown As Egypt 's kings in death ; The maple 's crown of gold Laid tarnished on the wold ; The alder and the ash , the aspen and the willow , Wore tattered suits of yellow . The soft October rains Had left some scarlet stains Of color on the landscape 's neutral ground ; Those fine ephemeral things , The winged motes of sound , That sing the " Harvest Home " Of ripe Autumn in the gloam Of the deep and bosky woods , in the field and by the river , Sang that day their best endeavor . I said : " In what sweet place Shall we meet face to face , Her loveliest self to see --  Meet Nature at her sad autumnal rites , And learn the mystery Of her unnamed delights ? " Then you said : " Let us go Where the late violets blow In hollows of the hills , under dead oak leaves hiding ;  --  We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall that day ? Has its grace passed away ? Its tenderest , dream-like tone , Like one of Turner 's landscapes limned on air --  Has its fine perfume flown And left the memory bare ? Not so ; its charm is still Over wood , vale and hill --  The ferny odor sweet , the humming insect chorus , The spirit that before us Enticed us with delights To the blue , breezy hights . O , beautiful hills that stand Serene ' twixt earth and heaven , with the grace Of both to make you grand ,  --  Your loveliness leaves place For nothing fairer ; fair And complete beyond compare . O , lovely purple hills , O , first day of November , Be sure that I remember ! WAITING . I can not wean my wayward heart from waiting , Though the steps watched for never come anear ; The wearying want clings to it unabating --  The fruitless wish for presences once dear . No fairer eve e'er blessed a poet 's vision ; No softer airs e'er kissed a fevered brow ; No scene more truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze enchanted now . And yet I pine ;  - -  this beautiful completeness Is incomplete , to my desiring heart ; ' T is Beauty 's form , without her soul of sweetness --  The pure , but chiseled loveliness of art . There is no longer pleasure in emotion . I envy those dead souls no touch can thrill ; Who --  " painted ships upon a painted ocean , "  --  Seem to be moved , yet are forever still . Where are they fled ?  - -  they whose delightful voices , Whose very footsteps had a charmed fall : No more , no more their sound my heart rejoices : Change , death , and distance part me now from all . And this fair evening , with remembrance teeming , Pierces my soul with every sharp regret ; The sweetest beauty saddens to my seeming , Since all that 's fair forbids me to forget . Eyes that have gazed upon yon silver crescent , ' Till filled with light , then turned to gaze in mine , Lips that could clothe a fancy evanescent , In words whose magic thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's roses in my tresses , And gathered violets to deck my breast , Where are ye now ? I miss your dear caresses --  I miss the lips , the eyes , that made me blest . Lonely I sit and watch the fitful burning Of prairie fires , far off , through gathering gloom ; While the young moon , and one bright star returning Down the blue solitude , leave Night their room . Gone is the glimmer of the silent river ; Hushed is the wind that sped the leaves to-day ; Alone through silence falls the crystal shiver Of the sweet starlight , on its earthward way . And yet I wait , how vainly ! for a token --  A sigh , a touch , a whisper from the past ; Alas , I listen for a word unspoken , And wail for arms that have embraced their last . I wish no more , as once I wished , each feeling To grow immortal in my happy breast ; Since not to feel will leave no wounds for healing --  The pulse that thrills not has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit That my quick heart is doomed to death in life ; Or that these pangs must pierce and never sear it , I am abandoned to despairing strife . To the lost life , alas ! no more returning --  In this to come no semblance of the past --  Only to wait !  - -  hoping this ceaseless yearning May , ' ere long , end -- and rest may come at last . PALMA . What tellest thou to heaven , Thou royal tropic tree ? At morn or noon or even , Proud dweller by the sea , What is thy song to heaven ? The homesick heart that fainted In torrid sun and air , With peace becomes acquainted Beholding thee so fair --  With joy becomes acquainted : And charms itself with fancies About thy kingly race --  With gay and wild romances That mimic thee in grace --  Of supple , glorious fancies . I feel thou art not tender , Scion of sun and sea --  The wild-bird does not render To thee its minstrelsy --  Fearing thou art not tender : But calm , serene and saintly , As highborn things should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us love reverently , Because they are so saintly . To be loved without loving , O proud and princely palm ! Is to fancy our ship moving With the ocean at dead calm --  The joy of love is loving . Because the Sun did sire thee , The Ocean nurse thy youth , Because the Stars desire thee , The warm winds whisper truth , Shall nothing ever fire thee ? What is thy tale to heaven In the sultry tropic noon ? What whisperest thou at even To the dusky Indian Moon --  Has she sins to be forgiven ? Keep all her secrets ; loyal As only great souls are --  As only souls most royal , To the flower or to the star Alike are purely loyal . O Palma , if thou hearest , Thou proud and princely tree ! Thou knowest that my Dearest Is emblemed forth in thee --  My kingly Palm , my Dearest . I am his Moon admiring , His wooing Wind , his Star ; And I glory in desiring My Palm-tree from afar --  Glad as happier lovers are , Am happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Life 's most precious things may be.  - -  Landon . O , Christ , to-night I bring A sad , weak heart , to lay before thy feet ; Too sad , almost , to cling Even to Thee ; too suffering , If Thou shouldst pierce me , to regard the sting ; Too stunned to feel the pity I entreat Closing around me its embraces sweet . Shepherd , who gatherest up The weary ones from all the world 's highways ; And bringest them to sup Of Thy bread , and Thy blessed cup ; If so Thou will , lay me within the scope Only of Thy great tenderness , that rays Too melting may not reach me from Thy face . Here let me lie , and press My forehead 's pain out on Thy mantle 's hem ; And chide not my distress , For this , that I have loved thee less , In loving so much some , whose sordidness Has left me outcast , at the last , from them And their poor love , which I can not contemn . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in my broken heart . But , gentle Shepherd , Thou Dost even such as I allow The healing of Thy presence . Let my brow Be covered from thy sight , while I , apart , Brood over in dull pain my mortal hurt . CHILDHOOD . A child of scarcely seven years , Light haired , and fair as any lily ; With pure eyes ready in their tears At chiding words , or glances chilly ; And sudden smiles , as inly bright As lamps through alabaster shining , With ready mirth , and fancies light , Dashed with strange dreams of child-divining : A child in all infantile grace , Yet with the angel lingering in her face . A curious , eager , questioning child , Whose logic leads to naive conclusions ; Her little knowledge reconciled To truth amid some odd confusions ; Yet credulous , and loving much The problems hardest for her reason , Placing her lovely faith on such , And deeming disbelief a treason ; Doubting that which she can disprove , And wisely trusting all the rest to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in a priceless pleasure , Leaving no sweeter spot on earth Than that which holds your household treasure . No entertainment ever yet Had half the exquisite completeness --  The gladness without one regret , You gather from your darling 's sweetness : An angel sits beside the hearth Where e 're an innocent child is found on earth . A LITTLE BIRD THAT EVERY ONE KNOWS . There 's a little bird with a wondrous song --  A little bird that every one knows --  ( Though it sings for the most part under the rose ) , That is petted and pampered wherever it goes , And nourished in bosoms gentle and strong . This petted bird has a crooked beak And eyes like live coals set in its head , A gray breast dappled with glowing red --  DABBLED -- not dappled , I should have said , From a fancy it has of which I shall speak . This eccentricity that I name Is , that whenever the bird would sing It darts its black head under its wing , And moistens its beak in -- darling thing !  --  A human heart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song begins --  Always begins its song one way --  With two little dulcet words , THEY SAY , Carolled in such a charming way That the listener 's heart it surely wins . This sweetest of songsters sits beside Every hearth in this Christian land , Ever so humble or never so grand , Gloating o'er crumbs which many a hand Gathers to nourish it , far and wide . Over each crumb that it gathers up It winningly carols those two soft words In the dulcet notes of the sweetest of birds , Darting its sharp beak under its wing As it might in a ruby drinking-cup . A delicate thing is our bird withal And owns but a fickle appetite , So that old and young take a keen delight In serving it ever , day and night , With the last gay heart now turned to gall . Thus , though a dainty dear , it sings In a very well-conditioned way A truly wonderful sort of lay , Whose burden is ever the same -- THEY SAY --  Darting its dabbled beak under its wings . WAYWARD LOVE . I leant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and again , I pressed a kiss as still and light As I would have your bosom 's pain . You did not feel the gentle touch , It gave you neither grief nor pleasure , Though that caress held , oh , so much , Of love and blessing without measure . Thus ever when I see you sad , My heart toward you overflows ; But when again you 're gay and glad , I shrink back into cold repose , I know not why I like you best , O'erclouded by a passing sorrow --  Unless because it gives a zest To the insouciance of to-morrow . You 're welcome to my light caress , And all the love that with it went ; To live , and love you any less , Would rob me of my soul 's content . Continue sometimes to be sad , That I may feel that pity tender , Which grieves for you , and yet is glad Of an excuse for love 's surrender . A LYRIC OF LIFE . Said one to me : " I seem to be --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane 's wild track --  Lost , wing-weary , beating back Vainly toward a fading shore , It shall rest on nevermore . " Said I : " Betide , some good ships ride , Over all the waters wide ; Spread your wings upon the blast , Let it bear you far and fast : In some sea , serene and blue , Succor-ships are waiting you . " This soul then said : " Would I were dead --  Billows rolling o'er my head ! Those that sail the ships will cast Storm-waifs back into the blast ; Omens evil will they call What the hurricane lets fall . " For my reply : " Beneath the sky Countless isles of beauty lie : Waifs upon the ocean thrown , After tossings long and lone , To those blessed shores have come , Finding there love , heaven , and home . " This soul to me : " The seething sea , Tossing hungry under me , I fear to trust ; the ships I fear ; I see no isle of beauty near ; The sun is blotted out -- no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once more I said : " Be not afraid ; Yield to the storm without a dread ; For the tree , by tempests torn From its native soil , is borne Green , to where its ripened fruit Gives a sturdy forest-root . " That which we lose , we think we choose , Oft , from slavery to use . Shocks that break our chains , tho ' rude , Open paths to highest good : Wise , my sister soul , is she Who takes of life the proffered key . " FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM . " Nay , Hylas , I have come To where life 's landscape takes a western slope , And breezes from the occidental shores Sigh thro ' the thinning locks around my brow , And on my cheeks fan flickering summer fires . Oh , winged feet of Time , forget your flight , And let me dream of those rose-scented bowers That lapped my soul in youth 's enchanted East ! It needs no demon-essence of Hasheesh To flash that sunrise glory in my eyes !  --  It needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound liquid reeds --  No muse to consecrate the hills and streams --  No God or oracle within those groves To render sacred all the emerald glooms : For here dwelt such bright angels as attend The innocent ways of youth 's unsullied feet ; And all the beautiful band of sinless hopes , Twining their crowns of pearl-white amaranth ; And rosy , dream-draped , sapphire-eyed desires Whose twin-born deities were Truth and Faith Having their altars over all the land . Beauty held court within its vales by day , And Love made concert with the nightingales In singing ' mong the myrtles , starry eves . " " You are inspired , Zobedia , your eyes Look not upon the present summer world , But see some mystery beyond the close Of this pale blue horizon . " " Erewhile I wandered from this happy land . Crowned with its roses , wearing in my eyes Reflections of its shining glorious heaven , And bearing on my breast and in my hands Its violets , and lilies white and sweet ,  --  Following the music floating in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams And murmur of the winds among the trees , I strayed in reveries of soft delight Beyond the bounds of this delicious East . " But oh , the splendors of that newer clime ! It was as if those oriental dreams In which my soul was steeped to fervidness , Were here transmuted to their golden real With added glories for each shape or hue . The stately trees wore coronals of flowers That swung their censers in the mid-day sun : The pines and palms of my delightful east Chaunted their wild songs nearer to the stars ; Even the roses had more exquisite hues , And for one blossom I had left behind I found a bower in this fragrant land . Bright birds , no larger than the costly gems The river bedded in their golden sands , Sparkle like prismal rain-drops ' mong the leaves ; And others sang , or flashed their plumage gay Like rainbow fragments on my dazzled eyes . The sky had warmer teints : I could not tell Whether the heavens lent color to the flowers , Or but reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from off the cloud-lost hills , Struck from the clambering vines Eolian songs , That mingled with the splashing noise of founts , In music such as stirs to passionate thought : This peerless land was thronged with souls like mine , Straying from East to South , impelled unseen , And lost , like mine , in its enchanted vales :  --  Souls that conversed apart in pairs , or sang Low breeze-like airs , more tender than sweet words ; Save here and there a wanderer like myself , Dreaming alone , and dropping silent tears , Scarce knowing why , upon the little group Of Eastern flowers we had not yet resigned :  --  ' Till one came softly smiling in my eyes , And dried their tears with radiance from his own . " At last it came -- I knew not how it came --  But a tornado swept this sunny South , And when I woke once more , I stood alone . My senses sickened at the dismal waste , And caring not , now all things bright were dead , That a volcano rolled its burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned my feet to aimless wanderings . The equatorial sun poured scorching beams , On my defenceless head . The burning winds Seemed drying up the blood within my veins . The straggling flowers that had outlived the storm Won but a feeble , half-contemptuous smile ; And if a bird attempted a brief song , I closed my ears lest it should burst my brain . After much wandering I came at last To cooler skies and a less stifling air ; And finally to this more temperate clime . Where every beauty is of milder type --  Where the simoon nor tempest ever come , And I can soothe the fever of my soul In the bland breezes blowing from the West . " NEVADA . Sphinx , down whose rugged face The sliding centuries their furrows cleave By sun and frost and cloud-burst ; scarce to leave Perceptible a trace Of age or sorrow ; Faint hints of yesterdays with no to-morrow ;  --  My mind regards thee with a questioning eye , To know thy secret , high . If Theban mystery , With head of woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trunk , were things Puzzling in history ; And men invented For it an origin which represented Chimera and a monster double-headed , By myths Phenician wedded --  Their issue being this --  This most chimerical and wonderous thing From whose dumb mouth not even the gods could wring Truth , nor antithesis : Then , what I think is , This creature -- being chief among men 's sphinxes --  Is eloquent , and overflows with story , Beside thy silence hoary ! Nevada !  - -  desert waste ! Mighty , and inhospitable , and stern ; Hiding a meaning over which we yearn In eager , panting haste --  Grasping and losing , Still being deluded ever by our choosing --  Answer us Sphinx : What is thy meaning double But endless toil and trouble ? Inscrutable , men strive To rend thy secret from thy rocky breast ; Breaking their hearts , and periling heaven 's rest For hopes that can not thrive ; Whilst unrelenting , Upon thy mountain throne , and unrepenting , Thou sittest , basking in a fervid sun , Seeing or hearing none . I sit beneath thy stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And see thy mountains wrapped in shadowed shrouds , Glad that the darkness bars The day 's suggestion --  The endless repetition of one question ; Glad that thy stony face I can not see , Nevada -- Mystery ! THE VINE . " Too many clusters weaken the vine "  --  And that is why , on this morn in May , She who should walk doth weakly recline By the window whose view overlooks the Bay ; While I and the " clusters " dance in the sun , Defying the breeze coming in from the sea , Mocking the bird-song and chasing the bee , Letting our fullness of mirth over-run , While the " Vine " at the window smiles down on our glee . If I should vow that these " clusters " are fair , So , you would say , are a million more ; Ah , even jewels a rank must share --  Not every diamond 's a Koh-i-noor ! Thus when our LILLIAN , needing but wings , Plays us the queen of the fairies , we deem Grace such as hers a bewildering dream --  Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our worshiping fondness a theme . Or when our ALICE , scarcely less tall , And none the less fair , tries her slim baby feet , Or a new has lisped , to the pride of us all , Smiling , we cry , " was aught ever so sweet ? " Even wee BERTHA , turning her eyes , Searching and slow from one face to another --  Wrinkling her brow in a comic surprise , And winking so soberly at her pale mother , For a baby , is wondrously pretty and wise ! Well , let the " vine " recline in the sun --  Three such rare " clusters " in three short years , Have sapped the red wine in her veins that should run --  For the choicest of species the gardener fears ! LILLIAN , queen of the lilies shall be , Fair , tall and graceful -- queenly in will ; ALICE a Provence rose -- rarely sweet she ; BERTHA NARCISSA -- white daffodil --  And the " vine , " once more strong , shall entwine around the three ! WHAT THE SEA SAID TO ME . One evening as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole up to me , And whispered softly , yet impressively , The word Eternity : I smiled , that anything so small should utter , A word the ocean in its wrath might mutter ; And with a mirthful fancy , vainly strove , To suit its cadence to some word of love --  But all the little wave would say to me , Was , over and again , Eternity ! After a time , the winds , from their dark caves , Arose , and wrestled with the swelling waves , Shrieking as doth a madman when he raves ; Yet still Eternity Was spoken audibly unto my hearing ; While foaming billows , their huge crests up-rearing , Rushed with a furious force upon the shore , That only answered with a sullen roar ; As if it hoarsely echoed what the sea Said with such emphasis -- Eternity ! And by and by , the sky grew dun and dim ; Soon all was darkness , save the foam 's white gleam ; And all was silence save the sea 's deep hymn --  That hymn Eternity : While some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , its healthy pulses chilling ; Making the night , so awful unto me , More fearful with that word Eternity . So that my spirit , trembling and afraid , Bowed down itself before its God , and prayed For His strong arm of terror to be stayed ; And sighed Eternity From its white lips , as the dark sea , subsiding , Sank into broken murmurs ; and the gliding Of the soothed waters seemed once more to me The whisper I first heard , Eternity . But now I mocked not what the ripple said : I only reverently bent my head , While the pure stars , unveiled , their lustre shed Upon the peaceful sea --  And the mild moon , with a majestic motion , Uprose , and shed upon the murmuring ocean , Her calm and radiant glory , as if she Knew it the symbol of Eternity . HYMN . Down through the dark , my God , Reach me Thy hand ; Guide me along the road I fail to understand . Blindly I grope my way , In doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near . O , God , renew my trust , Hear when I cry ; Out of the cloud and dust Lift me to thee on high . The crooked paths make plain , The burden light ; Touch me and heal my pain , And clear my sight . O , take my hand in Thine , And lead me so That all my steps incline In Thy right way to go . Out of this awful night Some whisper send , That I may feel my God , My loving friend . O , let me feel and see Thy hand and face ; And let me learn of Thee My true right place . For I am Thine , and Thou Art also mine . Unto Thy will I bow , Helper divine ! DO YOU HEAR THE WOMEN PRAYING ? Read before the Women 's Prayer League of Portland , Oregon , May 27 , 1874 . Do you hear the women praying , oh my brothers ? Do you hear what words they say ? These , this free-born nation 's wives and mothers , Bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you coldly look upon their faces , Pale , sad faces , seamed with frequent tears ; See their hands uplifted in their places --  Hands that toiled for all your boyhood 's years ? Can you see your wives and daughters pleading In the dust you spurn beneath your feet , Baring hearts for years in secret bleeding , To the scoffs and jestings of the street ? Can you hear , and yet not heed the crying Of the children perishing for bread ? Born in fear , not love , and daily dying , Cursed of God , they think , but cursed of you instead ? Do you hear the women praying , oh my brothers ? Hear the oft-repeated burden of their prayer --  Hear them asking for one boon above all others --  Not for vengeance on the wrongs they have to bear ; But imploring , as their Lord did , " God forgive them , For they know not what they do ; Strike the sin , but spare the sinners -- save them "  --  Meaning , oh ye men and brothers , you ! For your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined their blood and tears for gold ; Have betrayed their kisses and embraces --  Returned their love with curses twentyfold ; Made the wife 's crown one of thorns and not of honor , Made her motherhood a pain and dread ; Heaped life 's toil unrecompensed upon her ; Laid her sons upon her bosom , dead ! Do you hear the women praying , oh my brothers ? Have you not one word to say ? Will a just God be as gentle as these mothers , If you dare to say them nay ? Oh , ye men , God waits for you to answer The prayers that to him rise , He waits to know if you are just ere He is --  There your deliverance lies ! Rise and assert the manhood of this nation , Its courage , honor , might --  Wipe off the dust of our humiliation --  Dare nobly to do right ! Shall women plead from out the dust forever ? Will you not work , men , if you can not pray ? Hold up the suppliant hands with your endeavor , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the eastern to the western ocean , The sound of prayer is heard ; And in our hearts great billows of emotion At every breath are stirred . From mountain tops of prayer down to sin 's valley The voice of women sounds the cry , " Come up ! " O , men and brothers , heed that cry , and rally --  Help us to dash to earth the deadly cup ! " OUR LIFE IS TWOFOLD . " Sweet , kiss my eyelids close , and let me lie , On this old-fashioned sofa , in the dim And purple twilight , shut out from the sky , Which is too garish for my softer whim . And while I , looking inward on my thought , Tell thee what phantoms thicken in its air . Twine thou thy gentle fingers , slumber-fraught , With the loose shreds of my disheveled hair : I shall see inly better if thou keep My outer senses in a charmed sleep . Sweet friend !  - -  I love that pleasant name of friend --  We walk not ever singly , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in the sunshine , and is furled About us in the darkness -- so that shade Which haunts our other self , is faintly seen Beside us in our gladness , and is made To wrap us coldly life 's bright hours between . Unconsciously we court it . In our youth , While yet our morning sky is pink with joy , We , curious if our happiness be truth , Try to discern the shadow of alloy . O , I remember well the earliest time A sorrow touched me , and I nursed it then ; Tho ' but few summers of our northern clime Had sunned my growth among the souls of men . In an old wood , reputed for its age , And for its beauty wild and picturesque ; The bound and goal of each day 's pilgrimage , Where were all forms of graceful and grotesque ; And countless hues , from the dark stately pine That whispered its wild mysteries to my ear , To the smooth silver of the birch-trees shine , Showing between the aspens straight and fair ; With forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil far up among the trees , Seeking that light their boughs did intercept , And dalliance and caresses of the breeze . In midst of these , sheltered from sun and wind Glimmered a lake , in long and shining curves , Like a bright fillet that should serve to bind That scene to earth -- if she the gem deserves ! For gem it was , as proud upon her brow As jewels on the forehead of a queen ; And one thought as one turned from it , of how Eve exiled , must have missed some just such scene . O , there I type my life ! I used to sigh Sitting on this side , with my lap piled up With violets of the real sapphire dye , For the gay gold of the bright buttercup Spangling the green sod on the other side --  For the lake 's breadth was but an arrow 's flight , And the brief distance did not serve to hide What yet could not be reached except by sight . Day after day I dreamed there , while my heart Gathered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious art , And learning beauty more and more each day . Ever and ever haunted I that spot --  Sitting in dells scooped out between the hills , That rising close around me , formed a grot Fragrant with ferns , and musical with rills . Far up above me grew the long-armed beech , Dropping its branches down in graceful bent ; While farther up , beyond my utmost reach , Stood dusky hemlocks , crowning the ascent . And all about were sweeter sights and sounds Than elsewhere , but in poet 's dream , abounds . Thus , and because my life was all too fair , I sought to color it with thoughts I nursed In sylvan solitudes : and in the air Of these soft , silent influences , I first Saw , or felt , rather , that the shadow fell Upon my pathway from the light behind --  The light of youth 's first joyousness . Ah , well , If it had stayed there , nor been more unkind ! My earliest sorrow was a flower 's death --  At which I wept until my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One morn in autumn lacked its choicest dyes . So , knowing what it was to have a loss , I went on losing , and the shadow grew Darker and longer , ' till it lies across My pathway to the measure of my view . We all remember sorrow 's first impress --  No matter whether we had cause to grieve , Or whether sad in very willfulness --  The lesson is the same that we receive . And afterwards , when the great shadow falls --  The tempest -- when the lightning 's flash reveals The darkness brooding o'er us , and appals Hope by the terror of the stroke it deals --  Then , how the shadow hugs us in its fold ! We see no light behind , and none to come ; But dumbly shiver in the gloom and cold , Or with despair lie down , and wait our doom . Sweet , press thy cheek upon my own again --  Even now my life 's dark ghost is haunting nigh : Sing me to sleep with some old favorite strain --  Some gentle poet 's loving lullaby ; For I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of shadows set . SOUVENIR . You ask me , " Do you think of me ? " Dear , thoughts of thee are like this river , Which pours itself into the sea , Yet empties its own channel never . All other thoughts are like these sail Drifting the river 's surface over ; They veer about with every gale --  The river keeps its course forever . So deep and still , so strong and true , The current of my soul sets thee-ward , Thy river I , my ocean you , And all myself am running seaward . I ONLY WISH TO KNOW . Pray do not take the kiss again I risked so much in getting , Nor let my blushes make you vain To your and my regretting . I 'm sure I 've heard your sex repeat A thousand times or so , That stolen kisses are most sweet --  I only wished to know ! I own ' t was not so neatly done As you know how to do it , And that the fright out-did the fun , But still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra beat My heart took at your " Oh ! " Which plainly said that kiss was sweet --  When I so wished to know ! Nay , I will not give back the kiss , Nor will I take a second ; Creme de la creme of pain and bliss This one shall e'er be reckoned . The pain was mine , the bliss was -- ours , You smile to hear it so ; But the same thought was surely yours , As I have cause to know . LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM . The highest use of happy love is this ; To make us loving to the loveless ones ; Willing indeed to halve our meed of bliss , If our sweet plenty others ' want atones : Of love 's abundance may God give thee store , To spend in love 's sweet charities , LENORE . LOVE 'S FOOTSTEPS . I sang a song of olden times , Sitting upon our sacred hill --  Sang it to feel my bosom thrill To the sweet pathos of its rhymes . I trilled the music o'er and o'er , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been So blue a sea , so fair a shore . A vague half dream was in my mind ; I hardly saw how sat the sun ; I noted not the day was gone The rosy western hills behind . ' Till , soft as if Apollo blew For me the sweet Thessalian flute , I heard a sound which made me mute , And more than singing thrilled me through . THY STEP -- well known and well beloved ! No more I dreamed on shore or sea ; I thought of , saw but only thee , Nor spoke , but blushed to be so moved . THE POET 'S MINISTERS . POET . Oh , my soul ! the draught is bitter Yet it must be sweetly drunken : Heart and soul ! the grinding fetter Galls , yet have ye never shrunken : Heart and soul , and pining spirit , Fail me not ! no coward weakness Such as ye are should inherit --  Be ye strong even in your meekness . Born were ye to these strange uses , To brief joy and crushing ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yield not , till they kill . The stag wounded runneth steady With his blood in streams a-gushing ; Soul and spirit , be ye ready For the arrows toward ye rushing . SPIRIT OF THE FLOWERS . Now what ails our gentle friend ? In his eye a meaning double , Sorrow and defiance blend --  Let us soothe him of his trouble . Poet ! do not pass us by : See how we are robed to meet you ; Heed you not our perfumed sigh ? Heed you not how sweet we greet you ? Ever since the breath of morn We have waited for your coming , Fearing when the bee 's dull horn Round our quiet bower was humming : We have kept our sweets for thee --  Poet , do not pass us by : Place us on thy breast , for see ! By the sunset we must die . SPIRIT OF THE MOUNTAIN STREAM . Bathe thy pale face in the flood Which overflows this crystal fountain , Then to rouse thy sluggish blood , Seek its source far up the mountain . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and light , To the jagged rocks that fling Mildew shadows , black and blight . Learn a lesson from the stream , Poet ! though thy path may lie Hid forever from the gleam Of the blue and sunny sky ,  --  Though thy way be steep and long , Sing thou still a cheerful song ! SPIRIT OF BEAUTY . Come sister spirits , touch his eyelids newly , With that rare juice whose magic power it is , To give the rose-hue to those things which truly Wear the sad livery of ugliness . Oh , dignify the office of the meanest Of all God 's manifold created things ; And sprinkle his heart 's wounds with the serenest Waters of sweetness , from our fabled springs . Oh , close him round with visions of all rareness , Make him see everything with smiling eye ; Let all his dreams be unsurpassed for fairness , And what we feign out-charm reality . Come , sister spirits , up and do your duty ; When the Poet pines , feast his soul with beauty . SPIRIT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murmur low and loving ; He will say we sang him quaintly Some old ballad , sweetly moving . ' T is of all the ways the surest To awake a poet 's fancies , For he loves these things the purest --  Sigh of leaves , and scent of pansies . He has loved us , we will love him , And will cheer his hour of sadness , Spirits , wave your boughs above him To a measure of soft gladness . SPIRIT OF LOVE . Ye gentle ministers , ye have done well , But ' t is for love that most the poet pineth , And till I spell him with my magic spell , In vain for him earth smiles or heaven shineth . Behold I touch his heart , and there upspring Blooms to his cheeks , and flashes to his eyes ; His scornful lips upon the instant sing , And all his pulses leap with ecstasies . ' T is love the poet wants ; he can not live Without caressing and without caress , Which all to charity his fellows give ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightway from his lips will burst a song All loving hearts shall echo and prolong . POET . O Earth , and Sky , and Flowers , and Streams agushing , God made ye beautiful to make us blest : O bright-winged Songsters through the blue air rushing ; O murmuring Tree-tops , by the winds carest ; O Waves of Ocean , Ripples of the River , O Dew and Fragrance , Sunlight , and Starbeam , O blessed summer-sounds that round me quiver , Delights impassable that round me teem --  Oh all things beautiful ! God made ye so That the glad hearts of men might overflow ! O Soul within me , whose wings sweep a lyre --  God gave thee song that thou might'st give him praise ; O Heart that glows with the Promethean fire , O Spirit whose fine chords some influence plays : O all sweet thoughts and beautiful emotions , O smiles and tears , and trembling and delight , Have ye not all part in the soul 's devotions , To help it swell its anthem 's happy height ? Spirit of Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad heart bursts in acclamation ! CHORUS OF SPIRITS . Ring every flower-bell on the wind , And let each insect louder sing ; Let elfin " joy be unconfined ; " And let the laughing fairies bring A wreath enchanted , and to bind Upon the Poet 's worthy brow Heartsease and laurel , and a kind Of valley lily , white as snow ; And fresh May-roses , branching long --  Braid all these in a garland gay , To crown the Poet for his song , Sung in our haunts this summer day ! SUNSET AT THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA . There sinks the sun ; like cavalier of old , Servant of crafty Spain , He flaunts his banner , barred with blood and gold , Wide o'er the western main , A thousand spear heads glint beyond the trees In columns bright and long : While kindling fancy hears upon the breeze The swell and shout of song . And yet , not here Spain 's gay , adventurous host , Dipped sword or planted cross ; The treasures guarded by this rock-bound coast , Counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the eternal hills , And wedded with the sea ; O'er golden sands , tithes from a thousand rills , Rolled in lone majesty --  Through deep ravine , through burning , barren plain , Through wild and rocky strait , Through forest dark , and mountain rent in twain , Toward the sunset gate . While curious eyes , keen with the lust of gold , Caught not the informing gleam ; These mighty breakers age on age have rolled To meet this mighty stream . Age after age these noble hills have kept , The same majestic lines : Age after age the horizon 's edge been swept By fringe of pointed pines . Summers and Winters circling came and went , Bringing no change of scene ; Unresting , and unhasting , and unspent , Dwelt nature here serene . Till God 's own time to plant of Freedom 's seed , In this selected soil ; Denied forever unto blood and greed ; But blest to honest toil . There sinks the sun . Gay Cavalier ! no more His banners trail the sea , And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The swelling tide laps on the shingly beach , Like any starving thing ; And hungry breakers , white with wrath , upreach , In vain clamoring . The shadows fall ; just level with mine eye Sweet Hesper stands and shines , And shines beneath an arc of golden sky , Pinked round with pointed pines . A noble scene ! all breadth , deep tone and power , Suggesting glorious themes ; Shaming the idler who would fill the hour With unsubstantial dreams . Be mine the dreams prophetic , shadowing forth The things that yet shall be , When through this gate the treasures of the North Flow outward to the sea . THE PASSING OF THE YEAR . Worn and poor , The Old Year came to Eternity 's door . Once , when his limbs were young and strong , From that shining portal came he forth , Led by the sound of shout and song , To the festive halls of jubilant earth ;  --  Now , his allotted cycle o'er , He waited , spent , by the Golden Door . Faint and far -- faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strains of revelry smote his ear ; Musical murmurs from lyre and lute --  Rising in choruses grand and clear , Sinking in cadences almost mute --  Vexing the ear of him who sate Wearied beside the Shining Gate . Sad and low , Flowed in an undertone of woe : Wailing among the moons it came , Sobbing in echoes against the stars ; Smothered behind some comet 's flame , Lost in the wind of the war-like Mars ,  - -  Mingling , ever and anon , With the music 's swell a sigh or moan . " As in a glass , Let the earth once before me pass , " The Old Year said ; and space untold Vanished , till nothing came between ; Folded away , crystal and gold , Nor azure air did intervene ; " As in a glass " he saw the earth Decking a bier and waiting a birth . " You crown me dead , " the Old Year said , " Before my parting hour is sped : O fickle , false , and reckless world ! Time to Eternity may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furled Within the gate my reign is past ! O Earth ! O World ! fair , false and vain , I grieve not at my closing reign . " Yet spirit-sore The dead king noted a palace door ; He saw the gay crowd gather in ; He scanned the face of each passer by ; Snowiest soul , and heart of sin ; Tried and untried humanity : Age and Youth , Pleasure and Pain , Braided at chance in a motley skein . " Ill betide Ye thankless ones ! " the Old Year cried ; " Have I not given you night and day , Over and over , score upon score , Wherein to live , and love , and pray , And suck the ripe world to its rotten core ? Yet do you reek if my reign be done ? E 're I pass ye crown the newer one ! At ball and rout ye dance and shout , Shutting men 's cries of suffering out , That startle the white-tressed silences Musing beside the fount of light , In the eternal space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More close to their lips serene , While ye wear this unconscious mein ! " " Even so . " The revelers said : " We 'll have naught of woe . Why should we mourn , who have our fill ? Enough that the hungry wretches cry : We from our plenty cast at will Some crumbs to make their wet eyelids dry ; But to the rich the world is fair --  Why should we grovel in tears and prayer ? " In her innocent bliss , A fair bride said with sweet earnestness , " For the dead Year am I truly sad ; Since in its happy and hopeful days , Every brief hour my heart was glad , And blessings were strewn in all my ways : Will it be so forevermore ? Will the New Years bring of love new store ? " Youth and maid . Of their conscious blushes half afraid , Shunning each other 's tell-tale eyes , Yet cherishing hopes too fond to own ; Speed the Old Year with secret sighs ; And smile that his time is overflown ; Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ere the New Year 's passed away ? " O , haste on ! The year or the pleasure is dead that is gone ! " Boasted the man of pomp and power ; " That which we hold is alone the good ; Give me new pleasures for every hour , And grieve over past joys ye who would --  Joys that are fled are poor , I wis --  Give me forever the newest bliss ! " " Wish me joy , " Girl-Beauty cried , with glances coy : " In the New Year a woman I ; I 'll then have jewels in my hair , And such rare webs as Princes buy Be none too choice for me to wear : I 'll queen it as a beauty should , And not be won before I 'm wooed ! " " Poor and proud -- poor and proud ! " Sighed a student in the motley crowd --  " I heard her whisper that aside : O fatal fairness , aping heaven When earthly most !  - -  I 'll not deride --  God knows that were all good gifts given To me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet again . " " Here are the fools we use for tools ; Bending their passion , ere it cools , To any need , " the cynic said : " Lo , I will give him gold , and he Shall sell me brain as it were bread ! His very soul I 'll hold in fee For baubles that shall buy the hand Of the coldest woman in the land ! " Spirit sore , The Old Year cared to see no more ; While , as he turned , he heard a moan --  Frosty and keen was the wintry night --  Prone on the marble paving-stone , Unwatched , unwept , a piteous sight , Starved and dying a poor wretch lay ; Through the blast he heard him gasping say : " O , Old Year ! From sightless eyes you force this tear ; Sorrows you 've heaped upon my head , Losses you 've gathered to drive me wild , All that I lived for , loved , are dead ,  --  Brother and sister , wife and child , I , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your passing bell ! " Grieved , and sad , For the sins and woes the Human had , The Old Year strove to avert his eyes ; But fly or turn wherever he would , On his vexed ear smote the mingled cries Of revel and new-made widowhood --  Of grief that would not be comforted With the loved and beautiful lying dead . Evermore , every hour , Rising from hovel , hall and tower , Swelling the strain of discontent ; Gurgled the hopeless prayer for alms , Rung out the wild oath impotent ; Echoed by some brief walls of calms , Straining the listener 's shrinking ears , Like silence when thunderbolts are near . Across that calm , like gales of balm , Some low , sweet household voices came ; Thrilling , like flute-notes straying out From land to sea , some stormy night , The ear that listens for the shout Of drowning boatmen lost to sight --  And died away , again so soon The pulseless air seemed fallen in a swoon . Once pure and clear , Clarion strains fell on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced men 's hearts with arrowy words , Yet failed to stir them to good deeds : Their new-fledged thoughts , like July birds , Soared on the air and glanced away , Before the eloquent voice could stay . " ' T is very sad the man is mad , " The men and women gaily said ; As they , laughing , thread their homeward road , Talking of other holidays ; Of last year , how it rained or snowed ; Who went abroad , who wed a blaze Of diamonds with his shoddy bride , On certain days -- and who had died . " Would I were dead , And vexed no more , " the Old Year said : " In vain may the preacher pray and warn ; The tinkling cymbals in your ears Turn every gracious word to scorn ; Ye care not for the orphan 's tears ; Your sides are fed , and your bodies clad Is there anything heaven itself could add ? " And then he sighed , as one who died , With a great wish unsatisfied ; Around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged the world , Stormy , unstable , constantly Upheaved to be again down-hurled ; Here struggled some for freedom ; here Oppression rode in the high career . In hot debate Men struggled , while the hours waxed late ; Contending with the watchful zeal Of gladiators , trained to die ; Yet not for life , nor country 's weal , But that their names might hang on high As men who loved themselves , indeed , And robbed the State to satisfy their need ! Heads of snow , and eyes aglow With fires that youth might blush to know ; And brows whose youthful fairness shamed The desperate thoughts that strove within ; While each his cause exulting named As purest that the world had seen : All names they had to tickle honest ears , Reform , and Rights , and sweet Philanthropy 's cares . " Well-a-day ! Well-a-day ! " The Old Year strove to put away Sight and sound of the reckless earth ; But soft ! from out a cottage door , Sweet strains of neither grief nor mirth , Upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " the singers said , " As good a year as this one dead ! " Pealing loud from sod to cloud , Earth 's bell 's rang out in a chorus proud ; Great waves of music shook the air From organs pulsing with the sound ; Hushed was the voice of sob and prayer , As time touched the eternal bound : To the dead monarch earth was dimmed , But the golden portals brighter beamed . Sad no more , The Old Year reached the golden door , Just as the hours with crystal clang Aside the shining portals bent And murmuring ' mong the spheres there rang The chorus of earth 's acknowledgment : One had passed out at the golden door , And one had gone in forevermore ! THE END .
