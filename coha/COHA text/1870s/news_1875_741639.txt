txt Our London correspondent , in the letter which we published on Wednesday , states that the visit of the Prince of WALES to India is an event definitely determined on . As regards the wisdom of the experiment there is , as Sir Roger de ' Coverley said of the picture , " a good deal to bo said on both sides . " But in favor of the plan it may fairly ho urged that the affairs of India are at this moment controlled by a statesman of broad mind and sound judgment , in the person of the lineal descendant of Enizansmes profound BuillEmll , the Marquis of SALISBURY , who may be presumed to sanction , if not advise , the visit ; and that it will be strictly in accordance with that policy of making the royal family personally familiar with the British dominions , which throughout the present reign has been steadily , and , on the whole , we believe wisely , pursued . It is remarkable that although England has always been in the abstract proud of her Empire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known very little about it , and the upper class , more especially , cared less . This may be traced to several causes , but particularly to the origin of the British Empire in the East . That Empire had emphatically a bourgeois origin . It was the creation of a company of middle-class traders , and owed little of its success to the governing class . Toward the close of the sixteenth century , England perceived the advantages which accrued both to Portugal and Holland by their trade with Asia round the Cape , and became anxious to participate in it . There was consequently formed , under a deed of incorporation granted by Queen ELIZABETH , what was called the London Company , which continued to enjoy a monopoly until 1698 , when another company was formed under the name of the English Company . The old company protested and petitioned against a grant to the new , pointing out that their enterprise and the vast expenses they had incurred , entitled them to a continuance of their special privileges . Notwithstanding this , the English East India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of the King , WILLIAM III. , the companies agreed to amalgamate under the style of " The United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies , " with a capital stock of ? 2,000,000 . Stockholders of both sexes were , if possessing ? 500 of stock , entitled to vote , and were termed , when assembled , a " General Court of Proprietors , " and elected every year twenty-four Directors . Here , then , was the machinery which , in the words of Macaunav , " sea forth armies and pulled down Princes . " As the oak comes from the acorn , so did the factories and commercial settlements of some English shopkeepers gradually grow into the vast Empire which British India is to-day . The rapid increase of the company 's business and power , of course resulted in the employment of more and more agents . In 1708 their several denominations were writers , factors , junior merchants , and senior merchants . The business of the writers was that of acting as clerks . In the capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rank of factor , the next to that of junior merchant , in each of which the period of service was three years . After this they became senior merchants , and thence became by seniority members of the Council of the Presidency , and when no particular appointment interfered , Presidents themselves . In after years both an Army and a civil service grew up on a colossal scale , and the company had its own colleges for the education of both  --  for the first at Addiscombo . in Surrey , for the second at Haleybury in Hertfordshire . The patronage of all appointment was vested in the Directors , who were , without exception , what are called in London " city men , " and thus the East India Company 's service continued essentially a middle-class service , largely linked together by ties of family and friendship , and with an aristocratic name sprinkled hero and there at sparse intervals in its lists . The men who entered it bad , like CLIVE and WARREN HASTINGS , everything to gain and nothing to lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition , and terrible temptation to the unscrupulous . The " Rein " was there , and too often in the absence of rigid official supervision or of a scrutinizing press it was procured " quovogue mode . " But it is impossible to deny that this company of merchants showed a discrimination in the selection of their chief agents which rivaled that of the great Queen who first gave them their charter , and a feature of their sagacity , though not of hers , was liberality . To get+ the best man , and to pay him the best price , was their policy . When the charter expired a few years ago the Government declined to renew it , and took the mighty Empire into its own hands , throwing open the appointments in the civil service to public competition , and making the company 's Army a part of the Queen 's . The Indian civil service is to-day an arduous business , in which a man earns higher pay than in the same employment in England , but scarcely enough to do more than barely compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of nabobs are quite gone by . No snug sums are now to be made by side paths ; no sudden leaps by happy chance to fame and fortune . It has been found that the ablest class of university young men have not come forward as candidates for this service , and it remains to be proved whether those who have entered tinder the new system will have the vigor , the ability , and the esprit de corps which characterized their predecessors . At present the important posts are still in the hands of those who entered under the old system . Hitherto the change of the control of India from company to crown has failed perceptibly to increase the interest felt in India by the English , and now , as then , nothing empties the House of Commons more effectually than an Indian debate . It is not unlikely that the visit of the Prince of WALES will have the good effect of stimulating England 's interest about her magnificent dependency , and possibly may thus produce a highly thsirable feeling of gratification on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
