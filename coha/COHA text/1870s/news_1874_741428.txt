txt The general state of the City government is not satisfactory , but fortunately there - will be an opportunity of correcting the most of the prevailing ' evils within the space of a few weeks . The present maladministration is to be traced chiefly to the Mayor , and the Mayor can not possibly be re-elected , although he thinks he can be . Whether the Democrats or the Republicans carry the day , it is scarcely possible that the newly-elected Mayor will not be a great improvement upon HAVEMEYER . We can not do worse , and we ought to do a great deal better . With HAVErifEYER 's retirement we shall doubtless secure an efficient head of the City government , and that will necessarily involve a reform in most branches of the administration . Mr. HAVEMETER is at present supported exclusively by the men whom he has placed in office , and by " politicians " of the lobbyist order , who are anxious to find places for their relations and dependents . It is not to be doubted that he now holds office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bitterly attacked in almost all directions , but these attacks generally proceed . from quarters which have no claims upon public consideration . We are not prepared to express unqualified approval of everything that the Controller has done ? but he has unquestionably kept thieves out of the Treasury , and that has brought upon him the bitter denunciations of the thieves . He will not pay the salaries of men who have not earned them  --  sometimes be will not pay salaries even when they have been earned . But in the main his " obstructiveness " in this direction has been of a kind of which the public has no reason to complain . He has found . men in the public offices who claimed salaries while doing absolutely nothing for the money . Li some cases these men were found to be engaged in other occupations , and never went near their nominal offices from week 's end . to week 's end . Mr. GREEN will not recognize their alleged right to receive any share of the public money . For this he is assailed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have no effect whatever upon public opinion , Mr. GREEN can afford to disregard them . How far he has been involved in the political intrigues ascribed . to him we have no means of knowing . If he has identified himself with any clique or faction , he will live to find out that he has made a great mistake . If he is innocent of any such work , that fact will be established in good . season , and . the public will do him justice . Certainly the howl of lobbyists whom he has refused . to employ , and of the friends of sinecurists whom be has discharged , ought not to be allowed to excite any prejudice against him . The Police Commissioners have not done well , and . can not do well , as they are at present constituted . The cure for this is not very easy , and the Legislature may be required to interfere before we have a good Police Board again . Special legislation is to be deprecated , but sometimes it becomes an unfortunate necessity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the present muddle iu its worst phases . We hope our Republican friends will bestir themselves in time , and not concentrate all their efforts on State affairs . We ought to be able to elect a good . Mayor , or , at the very least , to compel the Democrats to do so . If they give us a first-rate man , able and willing to study the interests of the public , and to insist on good work being done in all the departments , we shall have no reason to complain of the result . We have not had . an honest and a competent Mayor here for many Sears past , and it is well worth while to make a strong effort to secure one now . The Governor of the State is pretty sure to be elected by the Republicans ; for although our antagonists take great pains to convince themselves that the Republican Party is dead , it will be found to be the only really living party of the day . There has been no time in its history when the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunder has sometimes increased the magnitude of its victories . We shall make a good record for ourselves next Fall if we deal honestly with the public , and we shall not deserve to do so on any other terms .
