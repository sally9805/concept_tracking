txt The Weather Bureau has recently planted a station at Fort Garry . Manitoba , from which , doubtless , many observations of great value in climatology will be made . This scientific observatory is on the fiftieth parallel of latitude . and is almost precisely in the centre of the continent , at the junction of the Assiniboine and Red River of the North . The early explorations of the French and English , and the later travels of RICHARDSON and Sir GEORGE SIMPSON , have furnished invaluable data of the climate and physical geography of the great belt stretching from Lake Winnepeg to British Columbia . But the oft-proposed construction of a Canadian Pacific Railway , and the rapid progress of our own Northern Pacific line , invest the central latitudes of the continent with the interest of an accurate study . The valleys of the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine lie on the extreme eastern margin of the mild Pacific climate , and in that remarkable zone where ( so contrary to our experience on the Atlantic side of the country ) the westerly winds , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial weather . Fort Garry is the eastern terminus of the proposed iron road to British Columbia , and is also of commercial importance as the centre of the Hudson 's Bay fur trade . There was a time when it was contended that a railroad to the Pacific was impossible . The construction of the Union Pacific Road , and the early and assured completion of the Northern Pacific , render it highly probable that at no distant day the Canadian interoceanic road will be seriously undertaken . For low altitude , the Northern Pacific line from Lake Superior to Puget Sound has the advantage over all routes , either projected or possible . ( not excepting the Texan or extreme southern ; ) and , following the course of the Upper Missouri , the Yellowstone and Columbia River beds , will prove , as a rival , the greatest obstacle to the success of the Canadian Pacific , if it is ever built . But nature has interposed no barrier to such a work from Fort Garry to Vancouver 's Island that may not be ( Ain : ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadians laying such a road is whether the agricultural conditions of the country and its material development would reward the investment of their large capitalists . All the reports of travelers in the high North American parallels agree that as far north as Fort Liard , 600 north latitude , the cereal &; especially wheat , are cultivated with a profitable yield . The isothermal of New-York , drawn across the continent , passes through Lake Winnepeg and Fort Simpson nearly a thousand miles north of the commercial centre of the United States , while the Valley of the Saskatchewan has very nearly the Summer and grainripening temperatures of Paris and Brussels . The extension of the Signal Service observations to the centre of the continent , in Manitoba , will insure the collection of systematic and accurate data for clearing up the climatology of these inland territories to the masses of all countries , and not only settle the railroadproblem , but open the way for their early and populous settlement .                  @ @ @
