txt It is a temptation to which newspaper writers often fall 6 , prey , to undertake to assign to the course of a , great statesman sonic simple and clearly consistent motive . Nothing is more captivating to the mind than to conceive of a leader in public affairs setting himself some single goal and pursuing it through all the devious currents of events , over all intervening obstacles , with fidelity that increases with difficulty and energy that ceases only with accomplishment or complete failure . But , as a matter of fact , history affords as few examples as does private life of remarkable singleness of purpose , and the writer who undertakes to offer eycn a plausible explanation of the shifting plans which statesmen are compelled to adopt , is generally obliged to draw largely On his imagination , and to put to one side many obvious facts . No public maul has been the , subject of more of this attractive but fallacious theorizing than Prince Ilissisuca . From the French journalist ; who finds the Chancellor actuated by a blind lust for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a sort of Heaven-given leader to the enemies of the Pope , there are innumerable theorists who are ready to give to us a solution in a tim- pages of the great German 's checkered career . But it is not unreasonable to suppose that where there are so many conflicting solutkons , no one is entirely adequate . That Blsahaltels has labored with remarkable steadfastness for German unity is a fact that lies on the surface ; but German unity is only a convenient name for a very complex fact , which leaves room for a great variety of motives in the mind of any statesman who makes it the object of his efforts . There is no doubt that the Chancellor wishes to see the Empire strong enough to defend itself against all its enemies , to make war upon them when it seems best , and to overcome them when the moment of con ' filet shall have been . determined . lint does he , therefore , desire simply the consolidation of the Empire as it exists , or its extension ? Is ho willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by intimate ties of language , sympathies , pride of race , and military ardor , or does he wish to add it to the political system over which he now presides ? Would even this be the limit of his ambition , or does he dream of an Empire powerful for aggression as well ea defense , and adding to its laurels not only these of complete Germanic unity , but those of the conquering ruler of other peoples as well ? Returning to the field of his immediate purposes , and contemplating the methods by which he is pursuing the accomplishment of a compact German national existence , does ho seek in this the domination of the imperial government for the gratification of the ambition of those who guide it , or the fulfillment of an imperative condition to the largest and freest progress of the people Is the Empire to him a means or an end Y It is easy to see that a man of the wonderful genius , the unrivaled personal power , of ** has found in the steady concentration and extension of the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a continual enlargement of the field of his own influence , a constantly grander and more commanding scene of action . But he must have seen , also , as the limit of his influence has been made wider and . wider , how tremendous were the public and individual interests with which he was dealing , and how intimately the happiness and progress of a great people were bound up with the policy he was pursuing . Is he indifferent to those facts , except as elements in the calculation of a plan for his own aggrandizement , or does he feel a genuine desire to advance the welfare of his people and . his kind ? Circumstances have brought him into conflict with the great representative institution  --  the Papacy  --  which , in this latest period of the world 's history , clings to narrow and degrading views of the destiny of the human family , and seeks , with all its might , to check the advance in intelligence , in individual responsibility , and in those forms of political and religious life to which freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free and enlightened progress , and in the struggle ho is using with great energy every weapon that ho can lay his hands on . Some of these aid and some oppose the principles of liberty , in behalf of which the contest has up to this time been carried on . Does he , then , fight the Papal party because it is the inveterate foe of religious liberty and of civilization and of progress , or because it happens to be the most conspicuous opponent of the political power he has erected ? Ho appeals to the Imperial Legislature to put down with the most rigid severity the pretensions that conflict with the supremacy of law in the German Empire . Does he himself recognize the source from which all law derives its authority , or is he seeking to clear the field for the exercise of an authority which he can make arbitrary and oppressive It would not be difficult to find in the story of BISMARCK 'S life many facts which sustain the affirmative and many which sustain the negative answer to these inquiries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the most weight . But we may be sure that whatever may be his personal aims , he has called into activity forces which ho can not easily check . If his purposes are radically in conflict with these forces as now directed , lie must fail . The spirit of nationality which he has aroused , the intense pride of Germans in the political system of which they are a part , the zealous and resolute devotion to the supremacy of law as determined by the representatives of the people  --  these are not the fruit of transient enthusiasm ; they do not have their root in jealousy of France or religious prejudice against the Papists ; they are manifestations of those impulses which have guided the human race , for more than three centuries toward continually greater and better freedom . If BISMARCK should undertake to balk these impulses of their natural and healthful satisfaction , he is strong enough to cause much confusion and Wary , but hi is not strong enough to succeed .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
