txt The Democrats pretend to desire " an ionest count . " The sense in which they ise the phrase is , however , peculiar . It moans a count that shall sustain the claims ind satisfy the requirements of their case . rhus , the Democratic " honest count " is only another term for a count that elects TILDEN . Any other count , as applied to the three disputed States , is " fraudulent " " despotic , " " revolutionary , " and " not to be endured . " To carry out this view , Democratic politicians and lawyers , great and small , have gone to Columbia , Tallahassee , and New-Orleans , to watch the proceedings of the Returning Boards . Their guiding purpose is to prevent any scrutiny by the State ** of the returns received from the County Canvassers . This has been made plain enough at Columbia , where the lawyers retained in behalf of TILDEN and Ilseirroet contest the right of the State Board to act in any other than a clerical capacity . Its authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule has been obtained from the Supreme Court of the State requiring the board to show why it should not be restrained from the exercise of judicial functions . It is to be compelled to count votes returned to it , whether they be honest or fraudulent . We have , therefore . the spectacle of the Democratic Party , shouting itself hoarse at the North in favor of " an honest count , " threatening to rise in rebellion on the ground that " an honest count " is endangered , and sending its emissaries to the South to frustrate the essential conditions of honesty and to secure the success of frauds that would render the ? lee-. tion worthless as an expression of popular opinion . What was at first partially disguised is now openly avowed . The principal Democratic journal in this city , defining " the meaning of an honest count , " so interprets the duties of the Returning Boards as to render them agencies for registering returns transmitted from the counties , irrespective of the character of the returns themselves . " By what possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tried 7 " asks the Sits . " Is there any rule that can be applied , excepting that which assumes the actual verity of the certificates sent up in the form of law by the local officers 7 " Our contemporary answers its own queries . " Au honest count , " it says , " means simply an enumeration of the votes that are certified in the mannor in which the law requires them to be certified ; and if our Democratic friends who have gone to New-Orleans consent to any other meaning , or lend their countenance to any investigations going behind the local certificates , they might better have stayed at home . " Mr. Timm 's Albany mouthpiece , the Argus , propounds the same doctrine , though in more frantic fashion . " Popular government perishes from the earth , " it exclaims , " if the Returning Boards or State Canvassers undertake to set aside the verdict of the ballotbox . " As if this were not sufficiently explicit , the Argus further declares that if State Boards disregard " the certificates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A more preposterous assumption , or one more fatal to " an honest count " in South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida , we can not imagine . The law enacted in each of these States clearly implies the possession by the Returning Board of more than ordinary ministerial functions . The South Carolina law provides that the members of the State Board " shall have power , and it is made their duty , to decide all cases under protest or contest , that may arise , when the power to do so does not , by the Constitution , reside in some other body . " The jurisdiction of the board over the election of Governor is certainly doubtful . Article III of the Constitution , section 4 , vests control over returns relating to the Governor in the House of Representatives . Beyond this , there seems to be no exception to the jurisdiction of the board , whose power and duty , as defined in the passage we have cited from the Revised Statutes of the State , would be meaningless on any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Florida law leaves no room for doubt as to its intent upon this point . It provides , among other things , that if any of the returns brought before the hoard " shall be shown , or shall appear , to be so irregular , false , or fraudulent that the board shall be unable to determine the true vote , " " they shall so certify , and shall not include such return in their determination and deelaration . " What does this . mean , if not the discharge of duties which the Sun and Argus unite . in saying do not and can not pertain to a State Board of Canvassers The members of the board are required 0 entertain any protestor complaint affecting the validity of a return , aud , , to subject such return to all possible scrutiny . They may , and must , " go behind it " in any manner that may bo necessary to determine whether the votes counted were honestly cast , whether any irregularity impaired their Jegality , and generally , whether the return is vitiated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , again , invests the Returning Board of that State with authority which fully meets the present emergency . The board is bound to receive the statements of competent parties respecting " any riot , timult , acts of violence , intimidation , armed disturbance , bribery , or corrupt influences , which prevented , or tended to prevent , a fair , free , and peaceable vote of all qualified electors entitled to vote . " The board must then investigate these statements , audit ' satisfied that they are true , it is bound to exclude from the canvass the specific returns which .. have been thus invalidated . Clearly , then , in each of these States , the law governing the action of the Returning Board exacts from its members much more than the mere " enumeration of the votes that are certified , " as prescribed . by the San . The whole question comes up before the board , which may inquire into all the facts purporting to be covered by the county certificates , and may set those certificates aside if , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , or if ? from causes'we need not enumerate , the vote in the county he nullified . sby fraud , intimidation , or violence in connection with the election . In no other way can justice be done . We of the North give to the proceedings of Returning Boards narrower scope . Suppose , however , that by fraud and force the legitimate votes of certain counties in this State were overcome . Suppose that certain of our counties , with registered Republicans numbering many thousands ; were returned by local officers without a single Republican vote . Or suppose that the ballot-boxes in certain counties were seized by Demo , cratic ruffians , and the ballots destroyed . How long would it be before some means were found of frustrating these tactics 7 And would the Sun insist that the returns must be counted though the whole country knew that they were false and fraudulent 7 Yet this condition of things is precisely what the Democrats are now upholding in Louisiana . The difference in the two cases is this : The people of Louisiana , familiarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown in rural New-York , gave to their Returning Board . authority sufficient to cheek the wrong .. The board can not , indeed , give to , the disfranchised Republican majority in the five disputed parishes the influence in the result which they ought to have exercised , but it can so far counteract fraud and violence as to reject returns obtained by these means . The Democratic outcry that injustice will thereby be done to the four or five thousand Democrats , who are returead as hsrv.ina voted in these parishes is nonsense . The real outrage i in the virtual disfranchisement of the elevei thousand colored ivoters who were not al lowed to cast Republican ballots . The case illustrates the necessity for judicial Rine tions on the part of the Returning Board and the imperfection which after all attend its administration . of justice . At the best it will fail to secure to the Republican ma jority in the State the full vote to which i was entitled . What it may be expectel to do is to prevent the success of tit frauds on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the anger which this prospect has aroused , we have a sug gestive commentary on the sincerity of th Democratic professions in regard to " an honest count .
