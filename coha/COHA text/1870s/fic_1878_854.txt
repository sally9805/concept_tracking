HOW SPRING CAME IN NEW ENGLAND *** Produced by David Widger HOW SPRING CAME IN NEW ENGLAND By Charles Dudley Warner New England is the battle-ground of the seasons . It is La Vendee . To conquer it is only to begin the fight . When it is completely subdued , what kind of weather have you ? None whatever . What is this New England ? A country ? No : a camp . It is alternately invaded by the hyperborean legions and by the wilting sirens of the tropics . Icicles hang always on its northern heights ; its seacoasts are fringed with mosquitoes . There is for a third of the year a contest between the icy air of the pole and the warm wind of the gulf . The result of this is a compromise : the compromise is called Thaw . It is the normal condition in New England . The New-Englander is a person who is always just about to be warm and comfortable . This is the stuff of which heroes and martyrs are made . A person thoroughly heated or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Examine ( on the map ) the Dog-Rib nation . The New-Englander , by incessant activity , hopes to get warm . Edwards made his theology . Thank God , New England is not in Paris ! Hudson 's Bay , Labrador , Grinnell 's Land , a whole zone of ice and walruses , make it unpleasant for New England . This icy cover , like the lid of a pot , is always suspended over it : when it shuts down , that is winter . This would be intolerable , were it not for the Gulf Stream . The Gulf Stream is a benign , liquid force , flowing from under the ribs of the equator ,  --  a white knight of the South going up to battle the giant of the North . The two meet in New England , and have it out there . This is the theory ; but , in fact , the Gulf Stream is mostly a delusion as to New England . For Ireland it is quite another thing . Potatoes ripen in Ireland before they are planted in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they desire two crops the same year . The Gulf Stream gets shunted off from New England by the formation of the coast below : besides , it is too shallow to be of any service . Icebergs float down against its surface-current , and fill all the New-England air with the chill of death till June : after that the fogs drift down from Newfoundland . There never was such a mockery as this Gulf Stream . It is like the English influence on France , on Europe . Pitt was an iceberg . Still New England survives . To what purpose ? I say , as an example : the politician says , to produce " Poor Boys . " Bah ! The poor boy is an anachronism in civilization . He is no longer poor , and he is not a boy . In Tartary they would hang him for sucking all the asses ' milk that belongs to the children : in New England he has all the cream from the Public Cow . What can you expect in a country where one knows not today what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose he , too , dwells on the Channel Islands , where he has all climates , and is superior to all . Perhaps he will become the prophet , the seer , of his age , as he is its Poet . The New-Englander is the man without a climate . Why is his country recognized ? You wo n't find it on any map of Paris . And yet Paris is the universe . Strange anomaly ! The greater must include the less ; but how if the less leaks out ? This sometimes happens . And yet there are phenomena in that country worth observing . One of them is the conduct of Nature from the 1st of March to the 1st of June , or , as some say , from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice . As Tourmalain remarked , " You 'd better observe the unpleasant than to be blind . " This was in 802 . Tourmalain is dead ; so is Gross Alain ; so is little Pee-Wee : we shall all be dead before things get any better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is revolution ? It is turning society over , and putting the best underground for a fertilizer . Thus only will things grow . What has this to do with New England ? In the language of that flash of social lightning , Beranger , " May the Devil fly away with me if I can see ! " Let us speak of the period in the year in New England when winter appears to hesitate . Except in the calendar , the action is ironical ; but it is still deceptive . The sun mounts high : it is above the horizon twelve hours at a time . The snow gradually sneaks away in liquid repentance . One morning it is gone , except in shaded spots and close by the fences . From about the trunks of the trees it has long departed : the tree is a living thing , and its growth repels it . The fence is dead , driven into the earth in a rigid line by man : the fence , in short , is dogma : icy prejudice lingers near it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghastly sight ,  --  bleached , dead . The trees are stakes ; the grass is of no color ; and the bare soil is not brown with a healthful brown ; life has gone out of it . Take up a piece of turf : it is a clod , without warmth , inanimate . Pull it in pieces : there is no hope in it : it is a part of the past ; it is the refuse of last year . This is the condition to which winter has reduced the landscape . When the snow , which was a pall , is removed , you see how ghastly it is . The face of the country is sodden . It needs now only the south wind to sweep over it , full of the damp breath of death ; and that begins to blow . No prospect would be more dreary . And yet the south wind fills credulous man with joy . He opens the window . He goes out , and catches cold . He is stirred by the mysterious coming of something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect it in the newspaper . In sheltered corners of that truculent instrument for the diffusion of the prejudices of the few among the many begin to grow the violets of tender sentiment , the early greens of yearning . The poet feels the sap of the new year before the marsh-willow . He blossoms in advance of the catkins . Man is greater than Nature . The poet is greater than man : he is nature on two legs ,  --  ambulatory . At first there is no appearance of conflict . The winter garrison seems to have withdrawn . The invading hosts of the South are entering without opposition . The hard ground softens ; the sun lies warm upon the southern bank , and water oozes from its base . If you examine the buds of the lilac and the flowering shrubs , you can not say that they are swelling ; but the varnish with which they were coated in the fall to keep out the frost seems to be cracking . If the sugar-maple is hacked , it will bleed ,  --  the pure white blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western sky has a softened aspect : its color , we say , has warmth in it On such a day you may meet a caterpillar on the footpath , and turn out for him . The house-fly thaws out ; a company of cheerful wasps take possession of a chamber-window . It is oppressive indoors at night , and the window is raised . A flock of millers , born out of time , flutter in . It is most unusual weather for the season : it is so every year . The delusion is complete , when , on a mild evening , the tree-toads open their brittle-brattle chorus on the edge of the pond . The citizen asks his neighbor , " Did you hear the frogs last night ? " That seems to open the new world . One thinks of his childhood and its innocence , and of his first loves . It fills one with sentiment and a tender longing , this voice of the tree-toad . Man is a strange being . Deaf to the prayers of friends , to the sermons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the pleadings of his better nature , he is touched by the tree-toad . The signs of the spring multiply . The passer in the street in the evening sees the maid-servant leaning on the area-gate in sweet converse with some one leaning on the other side ; or in the park , which is still too damp for anything but true affection , he sees her seated by the side of one who is able to protect her from the policeman , and hears her sigh , " How sweet it is to be with those we love to be with ! " All this is very well ; but next morning the newspaper nips these early buds of sentiment . The telegraph announces , " Twenty feet of snow at Ogden , on the Pacific Road ; winds blowing a gale at Omaha , and snow still falling ; mercury frozen at Duluth ; storm-signals at Port Huron . " Where now are your tree-toads , your young love , your early season ? Before noon it rains , by three o'clock it hails ; before night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gale is raging , whirling about a tempest of snow . By morning the snow is drifted in banks , and two feet deep on a level . Early in the seventeenth century , Drebbel of Holland invented the weather-glass . Before that , men had suffered without knowing the degree of their suffering . A century later , Romer hit upon the idea of using mercury in a thermometer ; and Fahrenheit constructed the instrument which adds a new because distinct terror to the weather . Science names and registers the ills of life ; and yet it is a gain to know the names and habits of our enemies . It is with some satisfaction in our knowledge that we say the thermometer marks zero . In fact , the wild beast called Winter , untamed , has returned , and taken possession of New England . Nature , giving up her melting mood , has retired into dumbness and white stagnation . But we are wise . We say it is better to have it now than later . We have a conceit of understanding things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two the snow is uncomfortable . Compelled to go , it decides to go suddenly . The first day there is slush with rain ; the second day , mud with hail ; the third day a flood with sunshine . The thermometer declares that the temperature is delightful . Man shivers and sneezes . His neighbor dies of some disease newly named by science ; but he dies all the same as if it had n't been newly named . Science has not discovered any name that is not fatal . This is called the breaking-up of winter . Nature seems for some days to be in doubt , not exactly able to stand still , not daring to put forth anything tender . Man says that the worst is over . If he should live a thousand years , he would be deceived every year . And this is called an age of skepticism . Man never believed in so many things as now : he never believed so much in himself . As to Nature , he knows her secrets : he can predict what she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an alphabet which he has invented . He talks with souls at the other end of the spirit-wire . To be sure , neither of them says anything ; but they talk . Is not that something ? He suspends the law of gravitation as to his own body  --  he has learned how to evade it  --  as tyrants suspend the legal writs of habeas corpus . When Gravitation asks for his body , she can not have it . He says of himself , " I am infallible ; I am sublime . " He believes all these things . He is master of the elements . Shakespeare sends him a poem just made , and as good a poem as the man could write himself . And yet this man  --  he goes out of doors without his overcoat , catches cold , and is buried in three days . " On the 21st of January , " exclaimed Mercier , " all kings felt for the backs of their necks . " This might be said of all men in New England in the spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us suppose that once , in Thessaly , there was a genial spring , and there was a poet who sang of it . All later poets have sung the same song . " Voila tout ! " That is the root of poetry . Another delusion . We hear toward evening , high in air , the " conk " of the wild-geese . Looking up , you see the black specks of that adventurous triangle , winging along in rapid flight northward . Perhaps it takes a wide returning sweep , in doubt ; but it disappears in the north . There is no mistaking that sign . This unmusical " conk " is sweeter than the " kerchunk " of the bull-frog . Probably these birds are not idiots , and probably they turned back south again after spying out the nakedness of the land ; but they have made their sign . Next day there is a rumor that somebody has seen a bluebird . This rumor , unhappily for the bird ( which will freeze to death ) , is confirmed . In less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have heard a robin or rather the yellow-breasted thrush , misnamed a robin in America . This is no doubt true : for angle-worms have been seen on the surface of the ground ; and , wherever there is anything to eat , the robin is promptly on hand . About this time you notice , in protected , sunny spots , that the grass has a little color . But you say that it is the grass of last fall . It is very difficult to tell when the grass of last fall became the grass of this spring . It looks " warmed over . " The green is rusty . The lilac-buds have certainly swollen a little , and so have those of the soft maple . In the rain the grass does not brighten as you think it ought to , and it is only when the rain turns to snow that you see any decided green color by contrast with the white . The snow gradually covers everything very quietly , however . Winter comes back without the least noise or bustle , tireless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes much fuss over it ; and you might think that Nature had surrendered altogether , if you did not find about this time , in the Woods , on the edge of a snow-bank , the modest blossoms of the trailing arbutus , shedding their delicious perfume . The bravest are always the tenderest , says the poet . The season , in its blind way , is trying to express itself . And it is assisted . There is a cheerful chatter in the trees . The blackbirds have come , and in numbers , households of them , villages of them ,  --  communes , rather . They do not believe in God , these black-birds . They think they can take care of themselves . We shall see . But they are well informed . They arrived just as the last snow-bank melted . One can not say now that there is not greenness in the grass ; not in the wide fields , to be sure , but on lawns and banks sloping south . The dark-spotted leaves of the dog-tooth violet begin to show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercury has suddenly gone up from thirty degrees to sixty-five degrees . It is time for the ice-man . Ice has no sooner disappeared than we desire it . There is a smile , if one may say so , in the blue sky , and there is softness in the south wind . The song-sparrow is singing in the apple-tree . Another bird-note is heard ,  --  two long , musical whistles , liquid but metallic . A brown bird this one , darker than the song-sparrow , and without the latter 's light stripes , and smaller , yet bigger than the queer little chipping-bird . He wants a familiar name , this sweet singer , who appears to be a sort of sparrow . He is such a contrast to the blue-jays , who have arrived in a passion , as usual , screaming and scolding , the elegant , spoiled beauties ! They wrangle from morning till night , these beautiful , high-tempered aristocrats . Encouraged by the birds , by the bursting of the lilac-buds , by the peeping-up of the crocuses , by tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sign appears . This is the Easter bonnets , most delightful flowers of the year , emblems of innocence , hope , devotion . Alas that they have to be worn under umbrellas , so much thought , freshness , feeling , tenderness have gone into them ! And a northeast storm of rain , accompanied with hail , comes to crown all these virtues with that of self-sacrifice . The frail hat is offered up to the implacable season . In fact , Nature is not to be forestalled nor hurried in this way . Things can not be pushed . Nature hesitates . The woman who does not hesitate in April is lost . The appearance of the bonnets is premature . The blackbirds see it . They assemble . For two days they hold a noisy convention , with high debate , in the tree-tops . Something is going to happen . Say , rather , the usual thing is about to occur . There is a wind called Auster , another called Eurus , another called Septentrio , another Meridies , besides Aquilo , Vulturnus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical dictionary ,  --  arsenal of mystery and terror and of the unknown ,  --  besides the wind Euroaquilo of St. Luke . This is the wind that drives an apostle wishing to gain Crete upon the African Syrtis . If St. Luke had been tacking to get to Hyannis , this wind would have forced him into Holmes 's Hole . The Euroaquilo is no respecter of persons . These winds , and others unnamed and more terrible , circle about New England . They form a ring about it : they lie in wait on its borders , but only to spring upon it and harry it . They follow each other in contracting circles , in whirlwinds , in maelstroms of the atmosphere : they meet and cross each other , all at a moment . This New England is set apart : it is the exercise-ground of the weather . Storms bred elsewhere come here full-grown : they come in couples , in quartets , in choruses . If New England were not mostly rock , these winds would carry it off ; but they would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions . What sharp Eurus carries to Jersey , Africus brings back . When the air is not full of snow , it is full of dust . This is called one of the compensations of Nature . This is what happened after the convention of the blackbirds : A moaning south wind brought rain ; a southwest wind turned the rain to snow ; what is called a zephyr , out of the west , drifted the snow ; a north wind sent the mercury far below freezing . Salt added to snow increases the evaporation and the cold . This was the office of the northeast wind : it made the snow damp , and increased its bulk ; but then it rained a little , and froze , thawing at the same time . The air was full of fog and snow and rain . And then the wind changed , went back round the circle , reversing everything , like dragging a cat by its tail . The mercury approached zero . This was nothing uncommon . We know all these winds . We are familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only the prologue , the overture . If one might be permitted to speak scientifically , it was only the tuning of the instruments . The opera was to come ,  --  the Flying Dutchman of the air . There is a wind called Euroclydon : it would be one of the Eumenides ; only they are women . It is half-brother to the gigantic storm-wind of the equinox . The Euroclydon is not a wind : it is a monster . Its breath is frost . It has snow in its hair . It is something terrible . It peddles rheumatism , and plants consumption . The Euroclydon knew just the moment to strike into the discord of the weather in New England . From its lair about Point Desolation , from the glaciers of the Greenland continent , sweeping round the coast , leaving wrecks in its track , it marched right athwart the other conflicting winds , churning them into a fury , and inaugurating chaos . It was the Marat of the elements . It was the revolution marching into the " dreaded wood of La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word : it was something for which there is no name . Its track was destruction . On the sea it leaves wrecks . What does it leave on land ? Funerals . When it subsides , New England is prostrate . It has left its legacy : this legacy is coughs and patent medicines . This is an epic ; this is destiny . You think Providence is expelled out of New England ? Listen ! Two days after Euroclydon , I found in the woods the hepatica  --  earliest of wildwood flowers , evidently not intimidated by the wild work of the armies trampling over New England  --  daring to hold up its tender blossom . One could not but admire the quiet pertinacity of Nature . She had been painting the grass under the snow . In spots it was vivid green . There was a mild rain ,  --  mild , but chilly . The clouds gathered , and broke away in light , fleecy masses . There was a softness on the hills . The birds suddenly were on every tree , glancing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their wings . The cat brings in one in his mouth . He thinks the season has begun , and the game-laws are off . He is fond of Nature , this cat , as we all are : he wants to possess it . At four o'clock in the morning there is a grand dress-rehearsal of the birds . Not all the pieces of the orchestra have arrived ; but there are enough . The grass-sparrow has come . This is certainly charming . The gardener comes to talk about seeds : he uncovers the straw-berries and the grape-vines , salts the asparagus-bed , and plants the peas . You ask if he planted them with a shot-gun . In the shade there is still frost in the ground . Nature , in fact , still hesitates ; puts forth one hepatica at a time , and waits to see the result ; pushes up the grass slowly , perhaps draws it in at night . This indecision we call Spring . It becomes painful . It is like being on the rack for ninety days , expecting every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . This is the order with man ,  --  hope , surprise , bewilderment , disgust , facetiousness . The people in New England finally become facetious about spring . This is the last stage : it is the most dangerous . When a man has come to make a jest of misfortune , he is lost . " It bores me to die , " said the journalist Carra to the headsman at the foot of the guillotine : " I would like to have seen the continuation . " One is also interested to see how spring is going to turn out . A day of sun , of delusive bird-singing , sight of the mellow earth ,  --  all these begin to beget confidence . The night , even , has been warm . But what is this in the morning journal , at breakfast ?  --  " An area of low pressure is moving from the Tortugas north . " You shudder . What is this Low Pressure itself ,  --  it ? It is something frightful , low , crouching , creeping , advancing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is the " ' 93 " of the atmosphere . This low pressure is a creation of Old Prob . What is that ? Old Prob . is the new deity of the Americans , greater than AEolus , more despotic than Sans-Culotte . The wind is his servitor , the lightning his messenger . He is a mystery made of six parts electricity , and one part " guess . " This deity is worshiped by the Americans ; his name is on every man 's lips first in the morning ; he is the Frankenstein of modern science . Housed at Washington , his business is to direct the storms of the whole country upon New England , and to give notice in advance . This he does . Sometimes he sends the storm , and then gives notice . This is mere playfulness on his part : it is all one to him . His great power is in the low pressure . On the Bexar plains of Texas , among the hills of the Presidio , along the Rio Grande , low pressure is bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana ; it moves by the way of Thibodeaux and Bonnet Carre . The southwest is a magazine of atmospheric disasters . Low pressure may be no worse than the others : it is better known , and is most used to inspire terror . It can be summoned any time also from the everglades of Florida , from the morasses of the Okeechobee . When the New-Englander sees this in his news paper , he knows what it means . He has twenty-four hours ' warning ; but what can he do ? Nothing but watch its certain advance by telegraph . He suffers in anticipation . That is what Old Prob . has brought about , suffering by anticipation . This low pressure advances against the wind . The wind is from the northeast . Nothing could be more unpleasant than a northeast wind ? Wait till low pressure joins it . Together they make spring in New England . A northeast storm from the southwest !  --  there is no bitterer satire than this . It lasts three days . After that the weather changes into something winter-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hops along the snow to the dining-room window , and , turning his little head aside , looks up . He is hungry and cold . Little Minnette , clasping her hands behind her back , stands and looks at him , and says , " Po ' birdie ! " They appear to understand each other . The sparrow gets his crumb ; but he knows too much to let Minnette get hold of him . Neither of these little things could take care of itself in a New-England spring not in the depths of it . This is what the father of Minnette , looking out of the window upon the wide waste of snow , and the evergreens bent to the ground with the weight of it , says , " It looks like the depths of spring . " To this has man come : to his facetiousness has succeeded sarcasm . It is the first of May . Then follows a day of bright sun and blue sky . The birds open the morning with a lively chorus . In spite of Auster , Euroclydon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone forward . By the roadside , where the snow has just melted , the grass is of the color of emerald . The heart leaps to see it . On the lawn there are twenty robins , lively , noisy , worm-seeking . Their yellow breasts contrast with the tender green of the newly-springing clover and herd's-grass . If they would only stand still , we might think the dandelions had blossomed . On an evergreen-bough , looking at them , sits a graceful bird , whose back is bluer than the sky . There is a red tint on the tips of the boughs of the hard maple . With Nature , color is life . See , already , green , yellow , blue , red ! In a few days  --  is it not so ?  --  through the green masses of the trees will flash the orange of the oriole , the scarlet of the tanager ; perhaps tomorrow . But , in fact , the next day opens a little sourly . It is almost clear overhead : but the clouds thicken on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It certainly will rain : the air feels like rain , or snow . By noon it begins to snow , and you hear the desolate cry of the phoebe-bird . It is a fine snow , gentle at first ; but it soon drives in swerving lines , for the wind is from the southwest , from the west , from the northeast , from the zenith ( one of the ordinary winds of New England ) , from all points of the compass . The fine snow becomes rain ; it becomes large snow ; it melts as it falls ; it freezes as it falls . At last a storm sets in , and night shuts down upon the bleak scene . During the night there is a change . It thunders and lightens . Toward morning there is a brilliant display of aurora borealis . This is a sign of colder weather . The gardener is in despair ; so is the sportsman . The trout take no pleasure in biting in such weather . Paragraphs appear in the newspapers , copied from the paper of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirty years . Every one , in fact , believes that it is , and also that next year the spring will be early . Man is the most gullible of creatures . And with reason : he trusts his eyes , and not his instinct . During this most sour weather of the year , the anemone blossoms ; and , almost immediately after , the fairy pencil , the spring beauty , the dog-tooth violet , and the true violet . In clouds and fog , and rain and snow , and all discouragement , Nature pushes on her forces with progressive haste and rapidity . Before one is aware , all the lawns and meadows are deeply green , the trees are opening their tender leaves . In a burst of sunshine the cherry-trees are white , the Judas-tree is pink , the hawthorns give a sweet smell . The air is full of sweetness ; the world , of color . In the midst of a chilling northeast storm the ground is strewed with the white-and-pink blossoms from the apple-trees . The next day the mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no Spring . The winter is over . You think so ? Robespierre thought the Revolution was over in the beginning of his last Thermidor . He lost his head after that . When the first buds are set , and the corn is up , and the cucumbers have four leaves , a malicious frost steals down from the north and kills them in a night . That is the last effort of spring . The mercury then mounts to ninety degrees . The season has been long , but , on the whole , successful . Many people survive it .
