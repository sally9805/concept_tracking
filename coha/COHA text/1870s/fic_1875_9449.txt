INTRODUCTION The creative activities of Steele MacKaye as dramatist covered twenty-two years ( 1872-1894 ) , and comprised twenty-two first-night productions in America , all directed by himself , in which he enacted seventeen rles in his own plays . Of these plays only two , Hazel Kirke and Paul Kauvar  --  both phenomenal successes  --  have hitherto been published . The four plays here now first published , were written within a period of fourteen years ( 1875-1889 ) . An exhaustive detailed history of each , with photographs , is given in my biography of Steele MacKaye , Epoch . ROSE MICHEL In the summer of 1875 , A. M. Palmer , manager of the Union Square Theatre , New York , was living near Lester Wallack in Stamford , Conn. , where MacKaye then moved with his family from New York into a large , square , Colonial residence , with great shade trees  --  the Clark place , near Washington Street . There Rose Michel was written under hectic circumstances , thus recorded for me by my mother : " Palmer was so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to make an adaptation of Rose Michel , a French play by Ernest Blum , imported from Paris . Your father said he would not undertake it unless he had a perfectly free hand . He would take only the central idea and work out his own characters and plot . Palmer agreed . So , during our Stamford moving , he would come over from his home nearby , sit on boxes before we were unpacked , and listen to your father read aloud portions of Rose Michel as he finished them . Palmer was delighted , and that same autumn it was produced in New York with great success . " Rose Michel opened at the Union Square Theatre , November 23 , 1875 , and ran all winter to crowded houses , closing March 18 , 1876 , after 112 performances there . The cast was as follows : Note : 1kb Count de Vernay Mr. Chas . R. Thorne , Jr . Baron de Marsan Mr. John Parselle Baron de Bellevie Mr. Frederick Robinson Pierre Michel Mr. J. H. Stoddart Moulinet Mr. Stuart Robson Master Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guard Mr. W. H. Wilder Turnkey Mr. Lysander Thompson Ruffian Mr. W. S. Quigley Servant Mr. C. M. Collins ROSE MICHEL MISS ROSE EYTINGE Countess de Vernay Miss Fanny Morant Louise Miss Nina Varian Baroness de Bellevie Miss Augusta Raymond One of the many reviews commented : " A failure in Paris and London , the credit of its great success in New York is supposed to be due in about equal parts to the merit of Mr. MacKaye 's adaptation and his stage direction of the play , the liberality of the manager in mounting it , and the skill of the actors in the Union Square Theatre . " Of those actors , Stuart Robson , in the part of a servant , Moulinet , called " Sneezer , " because every time he was startled , he sneezed ( a droll character written in for him by my father ) made a hit with a song at the opening of Act II ( words and music by my mother ) , sung to his dog , a little mongrel , named Pollywog . A photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Volume I , opposite page 234 . Later , at the Boston Museum , Moulinet was acted by William Warren . Robson wrote to Steele MacKaye , May 3 , 1881 : " When Rose Michel was produced at the Union Square Theatre , J. H. Stoddart , as Pierre Michel , achieved the success of the play , aided in no very small degree by your humble servant . We endeavored to carry out your instructions fully , for each felt that we were in the presence of a great master in our own art , and our heads took advantage of your knowledge . " The play was acted widely in stock during many years . Concerning its successful productions , the following are some data : At Newark , N.J. ( during its first New York run ) , in two Thanksgiving performances , Steele MacKaye acted Pierre Michel , Alfred Ayers , Baron de Bellevie , William Seymour , Moulinet . In May 1876 , it was performed at the Arch Street Theatre , Philadelphia , by the Union Square Company , and revived there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Seymour . In 1876 , it was acted in German at the Stadt Theater , New York , directed there also by Seymour , and in 1877 at the old California Theatre , San Francisco . In 1876 , Sydney Rosenfeld wrote a burlesque of the play , produced at the Standard Theatre , New York . In 1889 , on December 13th , Rose Eytinge revived it , at the Murray Hill Theatre , New York . In 1904 , on September 5th , it was revived at the Castle Square Theatre , Boston , under stage direction of W. C. Masson .

One of the Rabble To De Bellevie Here , my lord , is the palace of the Count de Vernay . Baron . Baron de Marsan Good . Now , lads , go back and hide below the quay until I signal for ye . Rabble descend out of sight . The Baron advances and surveys the Count 's Palace So , there 's where she dwells , snugly housed beneath the roof of the Count de Vernay , her paramour . At least , I call him so for reasons of my own , though I know she 's far too cold and proud to play the wanton , even though it were to Jove himself . The Countess de Vernay , mother of the count , has been made her guardian by the King . Well , what of that ? I will still pretend that with her noble name , she shields the amours of her son . And I will threaten to tear off the gilded veil that hides the base corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good sound plot . Looking around Well , here I am again in Paris . I , Gaston de Bellevie , or as I 'm called , the Baron de Bauchery . Laughing I confess I love gay living . So does all the world . But I am open in my pleasures , while those who cast me off are secret in their vice . Hypocrites in saintly masks . Well , this wife of mine , whom I have not seen for four long years , shall bleed her noble friend for me . His pride shall fill my pockets or his haughty name be degraded to the dust . Ah , here comes a pauper . Enter Moulinet with something in his apron , which he is busy with I will get the latest gossip from him : it may be useful . Moul . Moulinet Shss-s-sh ! There . There , thou faithless beast , be quiet . I would have thee a surprise for her . A cat mews Be quiet , cat , or I will eat thee for a spoil-all . Peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet come . The Baron touches him suddenly on the shoulder ; he starts and sneezes violently Saints ! What lord is this , here at such an hour ? ' T is not yet seven in the morning , and our masters lie abed till twelve . Baron . Baron de Marsan Tell me , fellow , do you live hereabouts ? Moul . Moulinet Aye , my lord . I live here , but eat and sleep and spend my time in other parts . Baron . Baron de Marsan And how is that ? Moul . Moulinet Why , sir , if love is life , as wise men say , then all my life is here , for here is all my love . Baron . Baron de Marsan Laughing How can such as you love ? Moul . Moulinet Saving your honor , that 's all we 're good for , to love . Not as lords do for their delight , but as the poor must , to their sorrow . Will you have the truth , sir ? Baron .

Well , sir , I love her . Baron laughs Nay , not as you would understand that word do I love her , my lord , but with true simplicity , purely as my dogs and cats and rats love me . Baron . Baron de Marsan You 're a strange fellow . What 's your name ? Moul . Moulinet Moulinet 's my name , but that 's not what I 'm called . Baron . Baron de Marsan Well , what are you called then ? Moul . Moulinet Alas , the world has dubbed me Sneezer , the Catchall . Baron . Baron de Marsan Laughing And why Sneezer , the Catchall ? Moul . Moulinet Sneezer , because of my infirmity . Whenever I 'm embarrassed or surprised I sneeze , I know not why . Baron . Baron de Marsan And why Catchall ? Moul . Moulinet Because I catch all the strolling beasts I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geese , aye , and if I dared , even skunks should find a friend in me . Baron . Baron de Marsan Of course , birds of a feather flock together . Moul . Moulinet Oh , that I were a bird with a feather , that I might fly from man ! Baron . Baron de Marsan From man perhaps , but not from woman , eh ? Come , good philanthropic beggar , who is she you love ? You said that she was fair ; now I 'm fond of fair women  --  tell me all , I may serve her and you . Who is she ? Moul . Moulinet An angel , lost in this dark dream called life . She is the daughter of my patron , Pierre Michel . Baron . Baron de Marsan Starting Pierre Michel ? Ah , indeed . Moul . Moulinet Aye , Pierre Michel . ' T is well Louise is apprenticed here , for if she lived at home she 'd starve , and when she died her father 'd sell her holy bones to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd even sell her soul to add a denier to his store of gold . Baron . Baron de Marsan Where lives her father now ? Moul . Moulinet Farther up the river , near the Bastille 's water gate . Baron . Baron de Marsan But does he know you come to visit her ? Moul . Moulinet ' T is he that sends me , or I 'd never have the chance to come . He sends me here to get the money that his daughter saves , and if she failed to send it , he would make her leave this house , where she is very , very happy . Baron . Baron de Marsan And why so happy ? Moul . Moulinet Because she loves and is beloved . Indeed they say that Andr , the goldsmith 's son , will marry her . A noble match , Heaven knows . For both are young and good and comely . Suddenly starting and striking an attitude Stay . I am inspired . Listen to my muse . A seraph falls from Heaven in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise .

Baron de Marsan What , would you couple Louise with a breeze ? Pah ! Your muse is flimsy . Be substantial . Couple her with " tease " or " squeeze " and I 'm your man . Laughing , taps Moulinet on shoulder But you 're a rare rogue . Poet , philosopher , and  --  Moul . Moulinet Quickly A fool  --  yes , by nature philosopher , by circumstances a fool . The Baron looks off R. mysteriously , then approaches Moulinet and suddenly nudges him on the side . He sneezes and exclaims What , now , my lord ? Baron . Baron de Marsan Looking R. , pointing off Who is that young girl that comes this way ? Moul . Moulinet Why , that is she , the one she of this world to this poor clod . Gentle Louise , my patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saints ! She 's beautiful  --  aye , divine enough to tempt an angel out of Heaven . And is this the daughter of that old rascal , Pierre Michel ? Thank Fate , I know her father , for she just suits my fancy . This fellow says his master would sell his daughter 's soul for money . She 's worth possessing at any cost . I 'll see old Pierre this very day and make a bid for this young beauty . Crossing to L.C. Moul . Moulinet See , my lord , how meekly sweet she comes from early mass . She and the Baroness de Bellevie are faithful to their prayers . Baron . Baron de Marsan What is that you say of the Baroness de Bellevie ? Moul . Moulinet That she is faithful to her prayers , for she , like Louise , attends early mass . There she always lingers for saintly converse with the cardinal . Baron . Baron de Marsan And will she return here soon ? Moul . Moulinet She should be here at any moment . Baron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will assail her here . Moul . Moulinet Up L.

I have not seen her for six months . Moul . Moulinet Aye . Joy be to ye both . Would I could stay to witness it . But before I go , I pray you accept a gift . ' T is poor like me , but then , like me , it lives and it can love . Takes a wretched looking kitten from his apron Behold . ' T is the finest of all my litter in my garret .

Louise Farewell , good Moulinet . Kissing kitten And there , I give him that for you . Moul . Moulinet And I 'll take good care he gives it back to me again . Once more farewell .

She sighs and falls into a pensive attitude , as Andr enters , R.U.E. , and watches her Andr . Andr R. Aside Ah ! There she is . I will chide her for deserting me . As Louise is about entering the house , he turns and speaks to her . She starts and turns Louise ! Louise , stay awhile . Why did you leave the mass so early ? Why did you not bide for me ? Louise .

" Take her , Master Bernard , " cried that woman , " take her and save her from her father . " Rose . Rose Michel Bowing her head Yes , ' t is true , alas . He would have killed my poor Louise . The doctors said she was so delicate she could not live , and yet her father would have starved her . Ah , his real child , the one he cherishes with constant care , is gold . Bern . Master Bernard Why did you not desert the monster ? Rose . Rose Michel Because in revenge he would have torn my child away from me . Bern . Master Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with that wild beast , who enslaves and beats you . Come , Rose , be frank . You must tell me the whole truth . The moment has come for that . Rose . Rose Michel The moment , what moment ? Bern . Master Bernard Among all the griefs that Pierre has caused you , tell me frankly , have you ever known him to be dishonest ? Rose . Rose Michel Why do you ask that ? Bern . Master Bernard Because we can pardon everything but that . Honesty for us . My father 's stainless honor won for him the badge of syndic to his corporation . His honor and his title have passed intact to me . Rose . Rose Michel All the world knows this . Why do you speak of it now ? Bern . Master Bernard Because we ca n't have on any of our family the smallest taint or stain . Rose . Rose Michel On any of your family  --  but I and mine are none of yours .

Master Bernard Gently , Rose , gently . Answer first my question . Have you ever known dishonor in your husband ? Rose . Rose Michel No , Master Bernard . Pierre is a miser , brutal if you will , but dishonest , no , thank Heaven , no . Bern . Master Bernard And can you swear this ? Rose . Rose Michel Yes , I can swear it on my honor . Bern . Master Bernard Thank Heaven . For let me tell you if there were a shadow of dishonor on Louise 's parents she could never be allied to any child of mine . In this respect you 'd find me firm , aye , heartless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend . Bern . Master Bernard And yet , Rose , ' t is for Louise that I should tremble .

Rose Michel Oh , my friend , you fill me full of terror . Bern . Master Bernard Nay . That 's foolish now . ' T is not fear but joy that you should feel . Come , we 'll make a holiday of this .

Count de Vernay My dear baron , permit me  --  words like yours should never be spoken anywhere but in your closet , and there only in a whisper . Vernay . Count de Vernay Precisely . For you know , baron , the King , who is fond of you , does not profess any profound affection for the new theories of the would-be philosopher . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Ah ! There you 're mistaken . The King does not approve these theories , but he begins , like me , to see why they are cropping out so plentifully , and therefore , sharing my fears for the future , he has charged me with a special mission . Count . Count de Vernay I congratulate you , baron . May we know what this mission is ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan Certainly , my dear countess . Not a day passes that we do not discover on the highway , at the corners of the streets or in the river , the remains of people murdered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say by our nobility ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan Because , alas , our young noblesse , in the careless expansiveness of their genial natures , boast of their executions  --  in fact , a night attack upon some poor wretch , whose nose perhaps has offended our delicate sensibilities , is quite the fashion . A lackey steps upon our toes , his awkwardness excites our compassion , we long to undo his disease , and , like all doctors , we must kill or cure . Nothing but surgery suits us . We must prescribe three feet of cold steel , let chance decide where it shall be applied , and nine times out of ten our cure kills . Count laughs . De Marsan , pointedly And then we laugh at the comical perversity of human nature , which , strange to say , does not appreciate the benevolence of our peculiar school of medical practice . Vernay . Count de Vernay Oh , pardon . It was not our peculiar practice  --  but your cynical wit I was laughing at  --  Count . Count de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What may that be ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan My mission , dear countess , is to visit upon these young surgeons of the street a little of their own practice  --  in other words , I am commissioned by the King to cure these gentlemen by killing them . Count . Count de Vernay Killing them ? And where ? In the streets ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan No . Upon the scaffold . Count . Count de Vernay What ! Our noblesse upon the scaffold ! Marsan . Baron de Marsan And why not , countess ? If titles shield assassins today , believe me , the time will come when titles will be abolished . Vernay . Count de Vernay And by what means , pray ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan Solemnly By the providential madness of the poor , my friend . Therefore , in order to preserve the future to our noblesse , the King has determined to punish with an iron hand all assassins , be they plebeian or noble . Henceforth , anyone guilty of murder must pay the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall go to trial , aye , even to the torture if need be  --  be he jack or gentleman . The duty of enforcing these commands has devolved upon me . Count . Count de Vernay I condole with you , dear baron . Your new duties must be very painful . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Doubtless ; but duties in this world , are not a matter of choice , but of destiny , madame , and however terrible they may be , honor bids us face and accept them with courage . Goes upstage and takes his hat Count . Count de Vernay Rising and taking C. Well , my dear cousin , pray Heaven that none of us may fall into your resolute hands , for I fear that where honor commanded , you would obey without mercy , even to your own blood . Marsan .

Rising Count . Count de Vernay L.C. Alas ! Poor thing . She still keeps her room  --  ill . She is slow to recover from the effects of that scandalous scene we had , day before yesterday , with her husband . Vernay . Count de Vernay R.C. , between his teeth Ah !

Nothing but flight will save me from folly . Count . Count de Vernay What do you mean ? Vernay . Count de Vernay Turning and looking at Countess earnestly You are a woman and a mother ; you know well what I mean . You know that if I wish the Baron de Bellevie 's death , it is because I love his wife and would make her mine . Count . Count de Vernay Sternly What ! Such words as these from you , my son ? Nay . If you will forget yourself , sir , pray remember me . I am the Countess de Vernay . Vernay . Count de Vernay My mother ! Count . Count de Vernay And Blanche de Bellevie 's guardian . Sits , L.C.

Oh , then let me pour out my heart to you ; ' twill help me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years I have fought with my love , but day by day my love has grown stronger and my will weaker to withstand it ; and now to know that she , Blanche , so noble , pure and patient , is lying there , suffering from the insults of that man . Ha ! The very thought is torture . It sets fire to my blood . For the sake of her good name I 've controlled the passion in my breast , and mastered this arm that aches to send her husband 's soul where it rightfully belongs  --  to its Maker . Crosses , R. Count . Count de Vernay L.C. , with stern hauteur Nay , sir , this is too much . I can not stay to listen longer . May you remember , by the time we meet again , that you and I were born of gentle blood . Vernay . Count de Vernay Mastering his emotion Thanks , madame , for that loyal word . Forgive me .

Count de Vernay Go , my child , and bear the burden of your suffering with the patient dignity that becomes your race . Remember  --  " Noblesse oblige . " He kisses her hand and exit , R. Countess alone Ah ! It is hard to be stern when one 's own heart is breaking with sympathy for sorrow ; but I must be stern . If I were to listen patiently , patience would soon turn to tenderness , and breed weakness in us both . No , love like his can only be mastered by pride like mine , and the more he loves , the prouder I must be for his own honor 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L.2.E . Madame la Comtesse , Rose Michel .

Countess takes it , rises and places it on table Count . Count de Vernay L.C. I am glad you have come , Rose , for I have a little wedding present for you . Rose turns in surprise Oh , I know all ; your child is soon to marry Bernard 's son . Rose bows her head Well , no answer . Have I been deceived ? Rose .

But I must go and get the little present I spoke of . Wait for me , here , in the chamber of my son . Exit L.3.E . Rose . Rose Michel Starting at the words of the Countess This the chamber of her son ! Ah ! Then I can do the duty I came to perform . Takes wallet out of her breast , looks at it a moment , and then with a suppressed scream hides it again Ha ! What was that ? Nothing ! She hides her face with a shudder , then with a sudden resolution crosses to other side of the room I must not fear . I must not think . I must act , act , act . Pausing and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? As the accomplice of my husband 's crime ? But can I denounce the father of my child and dedicate her to shame and death ? No , no , no ! And that assassin . He knows it , he counts on the strength of my love to weaken the voice of my conscience . And alas ! He is right . He is right . Justice , honor , all dwindle into nothing before my passion for my child . But I have done my best to make my husband 's crime a little less hideous . I have wrung from him the baron 's money . He sha n't be thief as well as assassin . I am here to return this money to the man it came from . I dare not put it in his hand , he would ask me where it came from and how I came by it ; that would reveal all . But there is his secretary .

Countess enters with a package in her hand Count . Count de Vernay Here , Rose , take this for your daughter . Rose . Rose Michel L.C. Oh , madame , a jewel . Ah ! You are too good , too good . Count . Count de Vernay R.C. No , Rose , we all have a great affection for you and your child , for we all know that you are an honest woman .

Your passion for your child amounts to madness , for you abuse your own brave self in speaking of her . Rose . Rose Michel Yes , madame , you are right , my love for Louise is a kind of madness . Aside May God pity me the more for that . Aloud Ah , madame , can my child come ? Count . Count de Vernay Yes , indeed . I shall be charmed to see her sweet face . Go and bring her to me .

It is impossible for me to dine with you . Count . Count de Vernay Laughing Indeed ! Flatterer ! I thought my dinner was like your duty  --  sacred . Marsan . Baron de Marsan And so it is , madame .

He is stabbed three times in the back . He did not die in a fair fight ; he was murdered in cold blood . Vernay . Count de Vernay Good Heaven ! And by whom ? Marsan .

You are accused of this murder . Vernay . Count de Vernay And who dares to accuse me ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan Those who found De Bellevie 's body . Those who stood by , two days ago , and heard you make a threat to take his life . Vernay . Count de Vernay Merciful Heaven ! Do you mean to say that this is serious ? Marsan . Baron de Marsan Solemnly More than serious , for you are formally accused before me , and I am here not as a friend of the family but as an officer of the law . Vernay . Count de Vernay Holding his head Pardon me , you stagger me . My head swims with the suddenness of this blow , my brain begins to burn . Grant me one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see .

Marsan . Baron de Marsan Do you remember your threat ? Vernay . Count de Vernay Yes . He swore he 'd tear his wife from this house by force . I swore that if he made the attempt I 'd kill him as a viper in my path . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Well ? Vernay . Count de Vernay He came here , but not to outrage his wife . He came at my request to seal a bargain . Marsan . Baron de Marsan True . A note was found on his body in your hand , asking him to be here at ten o'clock , the night before last .

Marsan . Baron de Marsan Explain at once the presence of De Bellevie here that night . Vernay . Count de Vernay Well , if I must I will . But it will cost me dearly . He came to sign an agreement with me to leave France forever . Marsan . Baron de Marsan On what terms ? Vernay . Count de Vernay I was to pay him down  --  cash in hand , one hundred thousand livres . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Have you that agreement ? Vernay . Count de Vernay Yes . It is here , in the drawer of that secretary . Marsan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank Heaven ! This explains all . The money which De Bellevie had upon him , and of which we knew nothing , was the bait of his assassin . The money is gone . He was killed by some robber . Ah ! My dear Henri , the evidence against you was terribly strong . He was supposed to be too poor to tempt a bandit . You were known to have a strong motive for putting him out of the way . But now , show me this agreement . That will clear you , and then we need only trace the money to secure the real culprit . Vernay . Count de Vernay Crosses , R.C. , going to secretary The agreement is here . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Stop  --  one moment  --  I must find it with my own hand .

Count de Vernay Nay , say I am a mother . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Madame , I believe the Count de Vernay innocent . To find the real culprit I shall stop at nothing . That is why I bring you here . The conduct of Rose Michel upon the arrest of your son , was very suspicious . Besides this , the Baron de Bellevie was the one to whom her husband was said to be about to sell her child . There is something wrong here , and I am resolved to ferret it out , even if it necessitates the use of the rack . Count . Count de Vernay Thanks , my friend .

Baron de Marsan I have information showing that the Baron de Bellevie was here at this house on the day of his disappearance , previous to his visit to the Count de Vernay . Is my information correct ? Pierre . Pierre Michel It is , my lord . The baron came here to tell me that he was about to receive a large sum of money , and to see if he could persuade me to sell my girl to him . Marsan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talk of such a thing between you . Pierre .

Pierre Michel We quarrelled . Marsan . Baron de Marsan Ah ! You quarrelled  --  what about ? Pierre . Pierre Michel The baron grew angry at my refusal , and began insulting me about my child . Said it was none of mine  --  that even Rose did not regard me as its father . This angered me . I asked for proof of what he said . He told me then that my wife had betrothed Louise to Andr , Bernard 's son , that very day . Enraged at this neglect of me and my consent , I hurried off this boy to bring my daughter here  --  and his distorted tale brought Master Bernard and yourself at midnight to this house . Marsan . Baron de Marsan To Countess This is a plausible story . It explains much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baron was here , did he say where he was to get his money ? Pierre . Pierre Michel He did , my lord .

Pierre . Pierre Michel No , my lord . He said it was part of his agreement with the count that he should leave Paris that very night . Marsan . Baron de Marsan To Countess That is true . The agreement expressly binds him to do that . I find this fellow 's reputation for honesty is excellent . Perhaps I 'm on the wrong track . However , we 'll go on . I 'll examine the servant .
