Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : NOVEMBER . from November 1879 1 The flowers have with the swallows fled , 2 And silent is the cricket ; 3 The red leaf rustles overhead , 4 The brown leaves fill the thicket . 5 The mild October days are gone , 6 Sweet nutting-time , and kite-time ; 7 With frost and storm comes slowly on 8 The year 's long wintry night-time . 9 But while the mellow light departs , 10 The household draws together , 11 And ever warmer grow our hearts 12 As colder grows the weather .
