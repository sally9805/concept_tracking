txt There are very few members of the Republican National Committee in the city this evening , except those from the West , most of whom are in favor of holding the convention in Chicago . That city has spared no effort to secure a majority of the committee 's votes . Members from the Northwest , South-west , and South were intercepted there on their way to Washington , entertained at the Chicago Club rooms , and placed on a special car in charge of a Chicago journalist , who won their thanks by his careful regard for their wants on the road , and has not yet entirely ceased to act as their commissary . The Chicago men and their guests occupy a large suite of rooms at the Arlington , and their parlors are the head-quarters of other members who have arrived , and of all persons interested in the action to be taken by the meeting on Wednesday . Indianapolis has sent a small delegation to urge the choice of that city , but it is acknowledged that the convention will not be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with several men from his city , arrived here to-night , but their efforts will be in vain . Concerning the choice of place , a member of the committee , whose experience in national politics has been extensive , and whose observations are always of value , said to a representative of THE TIMES to-night : " There are probably 20 members of the committee now in Washington , but most of them have hurried on front the West in the interest of Chicago . That city does not content itself with inviting the committee to hold the convention within its limits , and with promising to treat the delegates in a satisfactory manner , but it sends its representatives here , and they plainly show the members just ' what Chicago will do . Effective work like this , in addition to the advantages of location and accommodation , which are well known , can not fail to secure the convention . unless a division in the West becomes serious enough to interfere . This is true because there seems to be no effort to induce the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and the claims of Cincinnati and Indianapolis are not strong enough to prevent the success of Chicago . I believe that an organized and earnest effort to secure the convention for some Eastern city could have been Successful , for it should have been said that the convention this time belongs to the East . But there has been no such effort , and the effective work of Chicago will probably have its reward . " The movement for the election of Senator Cameron to tho position of Chairman has awakened determined opposition in some quarters . It is said that those who would bring in an outside man and place him over the heads of members who have been doing the work must have an important object in view . Prominent members of the committee assert that the movement is wholly in the interest of ox-President Grant . " He openly avows that he is a Grant man , " said one of these gentlemen to-night , " and ho asserts that Grant 's nomination is a foregone conclusion ; that there will he no opposition to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his family relation to Secretary Sherman , some persons have supposed that the movement to make Cameron Chairman was one in Sherman 's interest , but it is not . Tho truth is that Secretary Sherman does not want to see a Blaine man in the place , and to avoid that he will aid Cameron and take the risk , But without the votes which Sherman may secure for him , Cameron will be beaten , and William P. Frye , of Maine , will be elected if he runs against him . It is apparent that the movement in favor of Cameron is the only organized effort in the direction of the Chairmanship . Some members say that Cameron represents Blaine and Sherman as much as he does Grant , but his own assertions plainly define his position . " A representative of THE TIMES called upon several members of the committee tonight , and none of them mentioned the name of Mr. Platt , of New-York , as a candidate . It is evident that the feeling in Cameron 's case against the selection of an outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no important duties to perform , while there are many members of ability and experience to choose from , would be as strong against Mr. Platt . Mr. Frye , of Maine , was asked if any candidate had been suggested by the friends of Mr. Blaine . He replied that none had been suggested so far as he knew . " Mr. Blaine , " said he , " did not suggest any one to me , and I presume he did not consider the office an important one , inasmuch as the holder of it has only to call the convention to order , 1 would not oppose the election of any member of the old committee , but it seems hardly complimentary to the old members to import a man for the place . " Mr. Frye thinks that Mr. Blaine will not come to Washington until after the holidays . Mr. William E. Chandler has been mentioned as a candidate , but he will not be an opponent of Mr. Frye . A canvass of nearly all the members now in this city does not warrant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western men will not indicate their preferences . Several Eastern men have stopped in Philadelphia on their way , in order to witness the reception of ex-President Grant in that city . Some of the members who axe hero are willing to-night to express an opinion as to the feeling in their States concerning the candidates for the Presidency . " Maine , of course , " said Mr. Frye , " is for Blaine , but the Republicans of the State would support Grant if ho were nominated . They respect Sherman , for the Republicans of Blaine are hard-money men . " Mr , Martin , of Kansas , said that Sherman would get hardly any support in that State . The feeling for Blaine was strong , but the party would vote for Grant if he should be nominated . Mr. Heath , of Michigan , said that ho thought Blaine was the favorito candidate in his State . Grant , if nominated , would be supported , and there was a strong feeling in some sections in favor of Sherman . " The masses in my State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for Grant . It may be that the politicians favor Elaine , but many would oppose him because of his opposition to the Force bill in the Forty-third Congress . " Mr. Chandler said that New-Hampshire would probably continue to support Blaine . A. prominent resident of Wisconsin said that that State was undoubtedly for Blaine . " He represents , " said he , " the sentiments of stalwart Republicans , and there is a deep anti earnest feeling in his favor throughout many States of Me West . Illinois , Iowa , Wisconsin , Kansas , Nebraska , and the country between these States and the Pacific coast , are at heart for Blaine , and the votes of this section , I think , will he cast for him . Sherman has no following in Wisconsin . " " The Indiana people are favorable to Grant if Grant should be a candidate , but next to Grant Blaine is the favorite , " said ex-Treasum , - New . " Indiana will vote for Grant if he is presented , but after him we are for Blaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . ? The Hon. William H. Kemblo stated to-night that he had resigned from the National Republican Committee , and that Senator J. Donald Cameron would probably be selected to fill the vacancy .
