txt In spite of " Robinson Crusoe " and those charming experiences of his that we have all , at some time , slonged to share , life on a desolate island . however lovely that island may be , must be rather more stupid than life on any other island . After the first novelty has worn off , the first enjoyment of beautiful scenery , and the first sense of absolute independence , it is plain that any man of wholesome mind must become extremely wretched . Loneliness is terribly hard to bear , as those know best who have tried it . Truly there are people in fiction , like Cooper 's Leatherstocking , who go roaming about a continent , speechless and solitary , and sometimes there are such cases in real life  --  as witness the man who walked , last year , all alone , from the Mississippi to California . We doubt , however , if this pedestrian has repeated his experiment ; or that , anywhere out of the pages of a novel , COOPEli 'S hero would have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether from choice or necessity , are found ready to isolate themselves from society at large , provided they can have some companionship , and also , it would seed ; provided they can see their way to end their comparative solitude when they desire it . Some such people live in light-houses , and a small party of them have lately had a remarkable experience . The light-house , or rather light-ship , for such it is , to which we refer , is known as the " Seven Stones . " and is off . Land 's End . During the Winter there has been an almost continuous heavy sea running in the neighborhood , and for weeks it has been found absolutely impossible to communicate with the light-ship from the shore . During December , four resolute efforts were made to put fresh supplies and men on board , but in each case the attempt had to be abandoned . In one instance the relioviug schooner got within hailing distance , when she Wag knocked on her beam ends , and , after being righted with infinite difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the unfortunate prisoners , who had been forced to come down to very uncomfortable diet , were reached in safety and taken into Penzance . They were much reduced , and some wore clangorously ill ; all , however , are expected to recover , and , if less partial hereafter to the life of salt-water hermits than before , they have enjoyed one singular privilege they are unlikely ever to forget . Our readers will remember that the expeeted " shooting stars " of November disappointed dwellers in high latitudes this year . although splendid displays were witnessed in Egypt . Arabia , and Greece . The vie inity of Land 's End appears to have been an exception . For , on the night of the 1.3th of November , au immense meteor exploded directly over the " Seven Stones " light-ship , filling the air , " aceordiug to the concurrent testimony of the crow , " with innumerable balls of tire . " Two men wore made insensible by the force of the explosion , and one of them remained ill for several days . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the air was : wavily charged with a sulphurous smell . Fortunately , the phenomenon was not repeat9t1 ; and indeed , from the account , we infer that there was no other display , either before or after the advent of the unruly visitor that wrought such consternation . The circumstance suggests that possibly the phenomenon may have been of an electrical nature , and disconnected from the customary exhibition of shooting stars  --  the date , on the other hand , favors a contrary hypothesis . In either case , it is muca to be desired that such bodies should hereafter abstain from interference with light-ships . There can certainly be no conflict of function or jurisdiction here , and jealousy on the part of the meteor is not reasonably to be thought of . A lime light would not be jealous of a glow-worm , and the relation of brilliancy , as between a meteor and a lightship. is surely no less divergent . For a meteor to complain that it has not space to move about in , and thus seek to justify its unwarrantable behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange event is only the realization . in miniature ; of what was last year predicted on a very large scale . Can it be that the prophecy imputed to Prof. PLANTAMOUR has shrunk to these dimensions , and , like the celebrated journey of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane , come true without ceasing to be false ? If so , we have abundant reason for cowl atulating ourselves ; for if the dreaded comet which was to smash up the earth , and " all that it inhabit , " has kindly consented . to officiate b.y proxy through the little meteor of " Seven Stones , " we have certainly got oft much cheaper than some , at least , expected . In auv case , the only ones who have a right to grumble are the poor , terrified hermits of the light-ship , and even they were let oft so easily that they may well be content to balance their fright and stupor against the advantage of a very uncommon experience .                @ @ @ @ @
