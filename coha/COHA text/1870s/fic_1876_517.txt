MAE MADDEN *** Produced by Donald Lainson MAE MADDEN By Mary Murdoch Mason With an introductory poem , by Joaquin Miller . The wheel of fortune guide you , The boy with the bow beside you Run aye in the way , till the dawn of day And a luckier lot betide you . Ben Jonson . A DREAM OF ITALY . AN ALLEGORY INTRODUCING " MAE MADDEN . " I. We two had been parted , God pity us , when The stars were unnamed and when heaven was dim ; We two had been parted far back on the rim And the outermost border of heaven 's red bars : We two had been parted ere the meeting of men Or God had set compass on spaces as yet . We two had been parted ere God had set His finger to spinning the spaces with stars ,  --  And now , at the last in the gold and set Of the sun of Venice , we two had met . II . Where the lion of Venice , with brows afrown , With tossed mane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch o'er the watery town , With a paw half lifted , with his claws half bare , By the blue Adriatic , in the edge of the sea , I saw her . I knew her , but she knew not me . I had found her at last ! Why , I had sailed The antipodes through , had sought , had hailed All flags , had climbed where the storm clouds curled , And called from the awful arched dome of the world . III . I saw her one moment , then fell back abashed And filled full to the throat . . . . Then I turned me once more So glad to the sea , while the level sun flashed On the far , snowy Alps . . . . Her breast ! Why , her breast Was white as twin pillows that allure you to rest ; Her sloping limbs moved like to melodies , told As she rose from the sea , and she threw back the gold Of her glory of hair , and set face to the shore . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we had not met Since the far stars sang to the sun 's first set . IV . How long I had sought her ! I had hungered , nor ate Of any sweet fruits . I had tasted not one Of all the fair glories grown under the sun . I had sought only her . Yea , I knew that she Had come upon earth and stood waiting for me Somewhere by my way . But the path ways of fate They had led otherwhere . The round world round , The far North seas and the near profound Had failed me for aye . Now I stood by that sea While a ship drove by , and all dreamily . V. I had turned from the lion a time , and when I looked tow'rd the tide and out on the lea Of the town where the warm sea tumbled and teemed With beauty , I saw her . I knew her then , The tallest , the fairest fair daughter of men . O , Venice stood full in her glory . She gleamed In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my bride , my affinity , While the doves hurried home to the dome of Saint Mark And the brass horses plunged their high manes in the dark , VI . Was it well with my love ? Was she true ? Was she brave With virtue 's own valor ? Was she waiting for me ? O , how fared my love ! Had she home ? Had she bread ? Had she known but the touch of the warm-tempered wave ? Was she born upon earth with a crown on her head ; Or born like myself , but a dreamer , instead ? So long it had been ! So long ! Why the sea , That wrinkled and surly old time-tempered slave , Had been born , had his revels , grown wrinkled and hoar Since I last saw my love on that uttermost shore . VII . O , how fared my love ? Once I lifted my face And I shook back my hair and looked out on the sea ; I pressed my hot palms as I stood in my place And cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your side Though all hell intervene . " . . . " Hist ! she may be a bride ! A mother at peace , with sweet babes on her knee ! A babe at her breast and a spouse at her side ! . . . Have I wandered too long , and has destiny Set mortal between us ? " I buried my face In my hands , and I moaned as I stood in my place . VIII . ' T was her year to be young . She was tall , she was fair Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there ? ' T was her year to be young . She was fair , she was tall And I knew she was true as I lifted my face And saw her press down her rich robe to its place With a hand white and small as a babe 's with a doll , And her feet  --  why , her feet , in the white shining sand , Were so small they might nest in my one brawny hand . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And flashed in the light with a white starry stone . IX . Then , my love she was rich . My love she was fair . Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there ? She was gorgeous with wealth , " Thank God , she has bread , " I said to myself . Then I humbled my head In gratitude . Then I questioned me where Was her palace ? her parents ? What name did she bear ? What mortal on earth came nearest her heart ? Who touched the small hand till it thrilled to a smart ? ' T was her day to be young . She was proud , she was fair . Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there ? X. Now she turned , reached a hand ; then a tall gondolier That had leaned on his oar , like a long lifted spear , Shot sudden and swift and all silently And drew to her side as she turned from the tide . . . It was odd , such a thing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether virgin or bride , Should abide thus apart , and should bathe in that sea ; And I shook back my hair , and so unsatisfied . Then I fluttered the doves that were perched close about , As I strode up and down in dismay and in doubt . XI . Then she stood in the boat on the borders of night As a goddess might stand on that far wonder land Of eternal sweet life , which men have named Death . I turned to the sea and I caught at my breath , As she drew from the boat through her white baby hand Her vestment of purple imperial , and white . Then the gondola shot ! swift , sharp from the shore . There was never the sound of a song or of oar But the doves hurried home in white clouds to Saint Mark , And the lion loomed high o'er the sea in the dark . XII . Then I cried , " Quick ! Follow her . Follow her . Fast ! Come ! Thrice double fare if you follow her true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oar And rattle of rowlock . . . . I sat leaning low Looking far in the dark , looking out as we sped With my soul all alert , bending down , leaning low . But only the oaths of the men as we passed When we jostled them sharp as we sudden shot thro ' The watery town . Then a deep , distant roar  --  The rattle of rowlock , the rush of the oar . XIII . Then an oath . Then a prayer ! Then a gust that made rents Through the yellow sailed fishers . Then suddenly Came sharp forked fire ! Then far thunder fell Like the great first gun ! Ah , then there was route Of ships like the breaking of regiments And shouts as if hurled from an upper hell . Then tempest ! It lifted , it spun us about , Then shot us ahead through the hills of the sea As if a great arrow shot shoreward in wars  --  Then heaven split open till we saw the blown stars . XIV . On ! On ! Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She was gone . She was lost in the wilderness Of palaces lifting their marbles of snow . I stood in my gondola . Up and all down I pushed through the surge of the salt-flood street Above me , below . . . T was only the beat Of the sea 's sad heart . . . Then I heard below The water-rat building , but nothing but that ; Not even the sea bird screaming distress , As she lost her way in that wilderness . XV . I listened all night . I caught at each sound ; I clutched and I caught as a man that drown 'd . . . . Only the sullen low growl of the sea Far out the flood street at the edge of the ships . Only the billow slow licking his lips , Like a dog that lay crouching there watching for me ; Growling and showing white teeth all the night , Reaching his neck and as ready to bite  --  Only the waves with their salt flood tears Fawning white stones of a thousand years . XVI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome and of glittering spire That thrust to heaven and held the fire Of the thunder still : The bird 's distress As he struck his wings in that wilderness , On marbles that speak and thrill and inspire . . . The night below and the night above ; The water-rat building , the startled white dove , The wide-winged , dolorous sea bird 's call The water-rat building , but that was all . XVII . Lo ! pushing the darkness from pillar to post , The morning came silent and gray like a ghost Slow up the canal . I leaned from the prow And listened . Not even the bird in distress Screaming above through the wilderness ; Not even the stealthy old water-rat now . Only the bell in the fisherman 's tower Slow tolling a-sea and telling the hour To kneel to their sweet Santa Barbara For tawny fishers a-sea and pray . * * * * * * XVIII . My dream it is ended , the curtain withdrawn . The night that lay hard on the breast of earth , Deep and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the rosy dawn . . . . . I shall leave you here , with a leader fair ; One gentle , with faith and fear of her worth . She shall lead you on through that Italy That the gods have loved ; and may it be A light-hearted hour that , hand in hand , You wander the warm and the careless love-land . XIX . By the windy waters of the Michigan She invokes the gods . . . . Be it bright or dim , Who does his endeavor as best he can Does bravely , indeed . The rest is with Him . Let a new star dance in the Occident Till it shakes through the gossamer floors of God And shines , o'er Chicago . . . The Orient Is hoar with glories . Let Illini sod Bear glory as well as the gleaming grain , And engines smoking along her plain . JOAQUIN MILLER . CHICAGO , NOV. , 1875 . MAE MADDEN . CHAPTER I. SCENE . Deck of an ocean steamer . Characters : Mrs. Jerrold , matron and chaperon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madden , a young man on study intent . Eric , his brother , on pleasure bent . Norman Mann , cousin of the Jerrolds , old classmate of the Maddens . Mae Madden , sister of the brothers and leading lady . " It 's something like dying , I do declare , " said Mae , and as she spoke a suspicious-looking drop slid softly across her cheek , down over the deck-railing , to join its original briny fellows in the deep below . " What is like dying ? " asked Eric . " Why , leaving the only world you know . There , you see , papa and mamma are fast fading away , and here we are traveling off at the rate of ever so many miles an hour . " " Knots , Mae ; do be nautical at sea . " " Away from everything and everybody we know . I do really think it is like dying ,  --  do n't you , Mr. Mann ? " Mae turned abruptly and faced the young man by her side . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen , " he replied , coolly . " If you were all by yourself , it would be more like it , I suppose , but you are taking quite a slice of your own world along with you , and really  --  " " And really pity is the very last article I have any use for . You are right . I was only sorry for the moment . ' Eastward Ho ' is a very happy cry . How differently we shall all take Europe , " she continued , in a moment . " There is Albert , I honestly believe he will live in his Baedeker just because he can see no further than the covers of a book . You need not laugh , for it is a fact that people confined for years to a room ca n't see beyond its limits when they are taken out into broader space , and I do n't see why it should n't be the same with a man who lives in his books as Albert does . " " He sees the world in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . " He gets a microscopic view of it , yes , " replied Mae , grandiloquently , " and Edith  --  " " Always sees just what he does , " suggested Eric maliciously . " Now , boys , " said Miss Mae , assuming suddenly a mighty patronage , " I will not have you hit at Albert and Edith in this way . It will be very annoying to them . They have a right to act just as absurdly as they choose . We none of us know how people who are falling in love would act . " No , the boys agreed this was quite true . " And I really do suppose they are falling in love , do n't you ? " queried Mae . Yes , they did both believe it . Just here , up came the two subjects of conversation , looking , it must be confessed , as much like one subject as any man and wife . " What are you talking of ? " asked Edith , " Madame Tussaud or a French salad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a foreign flavor . " " There you are mistaken , " replied the frank Eric , " we were discussing you two people , in the most homelike kind of a way . " At this Edith blushed , Albert frowned , Mae scowled at Eric , who opened his eyes amazedly , Norman Mann looked over the deck railing and laughed , the wind blew , the sailors heave-ho-ed near by , and there was a grand tableau vivant for a few seconds . " O , come , " cried Mae , " suppose we stop looking like a set of illustrations for a phrenological journal , expressive of the various emotions . I was only speculating on the different sights we should see in the same places . Confess , now , Albert . Wo n't your eyes be forever hunting out old musty , dusty volumes ? Will not books be your first pleasures in the sight-seeing line ? " " O , no , pictures , " cried Edith . " That is as you say , " Mae demurely agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And churches . " " For your mother , yes , and beer-gardens for Eric , and amphitheatres and battle fields for Mr. Mann . " " And for yourself ? " " The blue , blue bay of Naples , a grove of oranges , moonlight and a boat if it please you . " " By the way , " suggested Albert , " about our plans ; we really should begin to agitate the matter at once . " " Yes , to do our fighting on shipboard . Let us agree to hoist the white flag the day we sight land , else we shall settle down into a regular War of the Roses and never decide , " laughed Norman . " As there are six minds , " continued Albert , " there will have to be some giving up . " " Why do you look at me ? " enquired Mae . " I am the very most unselfish person in the world . I 'll settle down anywhere for the winter , provided only that it is not in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Edith , and Albert , and Mrs. Jerrold from her camp-chair . " O , how dreadful ! The only way to prevent it will be for us to stand firm , boys , and make it a tie . " " But Norman is especially eager to go to Rome , " said Edith , " and that makes us four strong at once in favor of that city . " " But is not Rome a fearful mixture of dead Caesar 's bones and dirty beggars ? And must n't one carry hundreds of dates at one 's finger-tips to appreciate this , and that , and the other ? Is it not all tremendously and overwhelmingly historical , and do n't you have to keep exerting your mind and thinking and remembering ? I would rather go down to Southern Italy and look at lazzaroni lie on stone walls , in red cloaks , as they do in pictures , and not be obliged to topple off the common Italian to pile the gray stone with old memories of some great dead man . Everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement in Southern Italy . There 's Vesuvius , and she is n't dead  --  like Nero  --  but a living demon , that may erupt any night , and give you a little red grave by the sea for your share . " " She 's not nearly through yet , " laughed Edith , as Mae paused for breath . " I 'm only afraid , " said Mae , " that after I had been down there a week , I should forget English , buy a contadina costume , marry a child of the sun , and run away from this big world with its puzzles and lessons , and rights and wrongs . Imagine me in my doorway as you passed in your travelling carriage , hot and tired on your way  --  say to Sorrento . I would dress my beautiful Italian all up in scarlet flowers and wreathe his big hat and kiss his brown eyes and take his brown hand , and then we would run along by the bay and laugh at you stiff , grand world 's folks as we skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for you , if ever you do disappear , " said Norman Mann . " But , my dear Mae , " added Albert , " though this is amusing , it is utterly useless . " " Amusing things always are , " said Mae . " The question is , shall we or shall we not go to Rome for the winter ? " " Certainly , by all means , and if I do n't like it , I 'll run away to Sorrento , " and Mae shook her sunny head and twinkled her eyes in a fascinating sort of way , that made Eric feel a proud brotherly pleasure in this saucy young woman , and that gave Norman Mann a sort of feeling he had had a good deal of late , a feeling hard to define , though we have all known it , a delicious concoction of pleasure and pain . His eyes were fixed on Mae , now . " What is it ? " she asked . " You will like Rome , I am sure . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It might save some trouble , then , if I ask you now if you expect to like me , " said he , in a lower tone . " Why certainly , I do like you very much , " she replied , honestly . " What a stupid question , " he thinks , vexedly . " Why did I tell him I liked him ? " she thinks , blushingly . So the waves of anxiety and doubt begin to swell in these two hearts as the outside waves beat with a truer sea-motion momently against the steamer 's side . Between days of sea-sickness come delightful intervals of calm sea and fresh breezes , when the party fly to the hurricane deck to get the very quintessence of life on the ocean wave . One morning Mrs. Jerrold and Edith were sitting there alone , with rugs and all sorts of head devices in soft wools and flannels , and books and a basket of fruit . The matron of the party was a tall , fine-looking woman , a good type of genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many propositions from Euclid , full of right angles and straight lines , but easy living and the dressmaker 's art combine to turn the corners gently . Edith was like her mother , but softened by a touch of warm Dutch blood . She was tall , almost stately , with a good deal of American style , which at that time happened to be straight and slender . She was naturally reserved , but four years of boarding-school life had enriched her store of adjectives and her amount of endearing gush-power , and she had at least six girl friends to whom she sent weekly epistles of some half-dozen sheets in length , beginning , each one of them , with " My dearest  --   --  " and ending " Your devoted Edith . " As Edith and her mother quietly read , and ate grapes , and lolled in a delightfully feminine way , voices were heard ,  --  Mae 's and Norman 's . They were in the middle of a conversation . " Yes , " Mae was saying , " you do away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is all the same from daffodils up to women . " " How do we classify women , pray ? " " In the mind of man , " began Mae , as if she were reading , " there are three classes of women ; the giddy butterflies , the busy bees , and the woman 's righters . The first are pretty and silly ; the second , plain and useful ; the third , mannish and odious . The first wear long trailing dresses and smile at you while waltzing , the second wear aprons and give you apple-dumplings , and the third want your manly prerogatives , your dress-coat , your money , and your vote . Flirt with the giddy butterflies , your first love was one . First loves always are . Marry the busy bee . Your mother was a busy bee . Mothers always are . And keep on the other side of the street from the woman 's righter as long as you can . Alas ! your daughter will be one . " " Well , is n't there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sporting men and booky men , in the feminine mind ? " " Perhaps so . There certainly are the fops , and nowadays this terrible army of reformers and radicals , of whom my brother Albert here is the best known example . " " What is it ? " asked Albert , looking up abstractedly from his book , for he and Eric had sauntered up the stairs too , by this time . " They are the creatures , " continued Mae , " who scorn joys and idle pleasures . They deal with the good of the many and the problems of the universe , and step solemnly along to that dirge known as the March of Progress . And what do they get for it all ? Something like this . Put down your book , I 'm going to prophesy , " and Mae backed resolutely up against the railing and held her floating scarfs and veils in a bunch at her throat , while she prophesied in this way : " Behold me , direct lineal descendant of Albert Madden , speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , want amusement ? Want to see the magic lantern to note the effects of light ? Alas ! how frivolous . Listen , children , to the achievements of your great ancestor , as reported by the Encyclopedia . " A. Madden  --  promoter of civilization and progress , chiefly known by his excellent theory entitled The Number of Cells in a Human Brain compared to the Working Powers of Man , and that remarkable essay , headed by this formula : Given  --  10,000,000 laboring men , to find the number of loaves of bread in the world . " Here , children , take these works . Progressimus , you may have the theory , while Civilizationica reads the essay . Then change about . Ponder them well , and while we walk to the Museum later , tell me their errors . Then I will show you the preserved ears of the first man found in Boshland by P. T. Barnum , jr . ' Oh , bosh , " said Mae suddenly , letting fly her streamers , " what a dry set of locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green land , and some of us butterflies would like to turn our yellow wings into solid shields against you , if we could . There , I 've made a goose of myself again on the old subject . Edith , there 's the lunch bell . Take me down before I say another word . " Exeunt feminines all . " Where did the child pick up all that ? " queried Albert . " ' All that ' is in the air just now , " answered Norman . " It is a natural reaction of a strong physical nature against the utilitarian views of the day . Miss Mae is a type of  --  " " O , nonsense , what prigs you are , " interrupted Eric , " Mae is jolly . Do stop your reasoning about her . If you are bound to be a potato yourself to help save the masses from starvation , do n't grumble because she grew a flower . Come , let us go to lunch too . " Conversation was not always of this sort . One evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edith and Albert were missing . Eric was following a blue-eyed girl along the deck , and Mae and Norman wandered off by themselves up to this same hurricane deck again . The moonlight was wonderful . It touched little groups here and there and fell full on the face of a woman in the steerage , who sat with her arms crossed on her knee and her face set eastward . She was singing , and her voice rose clearly above the puff of the engine and the jabber below . There was a chorus to the song , in which rough men and tired looking women joined . The song was about home , and once in a while the girl unclasped her arms and passed her hands over her eyes . Mae and Norman Mann looked at her silently . " I suppose we do n't know when we make pictures , " said Mae . " Do n't we ? " asked Norman pointedly . Mae looked very reprovingly out from her white wraps at him , but he smiled back composedly and admiringly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And saucy Mae began to feel in that sort of purring mood women come to when they drop the bristling , ready-for-fight air with which they start on an acquaintance . Perhaps , if the steamer had been a sailing-vessel , there would have been no story to tell about Mae Madden , for a long line of evenings , and girls singing songs , and hurricane decks by moonlight , are dangerous things . But the vessel was a fast steamer , and was swiftly nearing land again . CHAPTER II . ROME , February , 18  --  . MY DEAR MAMMA :  --  Yes , it is Rome , mamma , and everybody is impressed . The boys talk of emperors all the time ; Edith is wild over Madonnas and saints , and Mrs. Jerrold runs from Paul 's house to Paul 's walks and Paul 's drives and Paul 's stand at the prisoner 's bar , and reads the Acts through five times a day , in the most religious and Romanistic spirit . No one could make more fuss over a patron saint , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were in the most terrible ghost story . The old Romans are all around me . Underneath the street noises , I seem to hear cries , and in the air I half see a constant flashing of swords and scars and blood , and I ca n't even put my foot on the Roman pavement without wondering which dead Caesar my saucy Burt boot No. 2 is walking over . I should n't mind trampling old Caligula , but I do n't like the thought on general principles . I feel all out of place , so modern and fixed up and flimsy . If I could get into old picturesque clothes and out of the English-speaking quarter , I should not be so oppressed and might worship Rome . But I seriously think I shall die if I stay here much longer . There 's a spirit-malaria that eats into my life . I feel as if all the volumes of Roman history bound in heavy vellum , that papa has in his study , were laid right on top of my little heart , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I assure you , mamma , its worse than dyspepsia . If I could only get out on a New England hillside , where there were no graves more important than those of grasshoppers and butterflies ! What should I do when I got there ? Take off my hat , and scream for joy , and feel free and glad to be in a fresh country , with rich , warm , untainted earth and young life . But all this is nonsense , mamma , and I should n't be writing it , if I had n't just come from the catacombs of St. Calixtus . To think of Albert 's insisting upon going there the very first thing ! But so he did , and so we went , and talked solemnly about the Appian Way , and saw everybody 's tombs and ashes , and quoted poetry , until I stuck a pin in Albert 's arm and sang Yankee Doodle , to keep from crying . Then , oh , how shocked they looked . Even Mr. Mann seemed ashamed of me . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guide led the way down into the bowels of the earth . Mamma , they are very unpleasant . There were two German youths along , and green lizards crawled all over . They winked at me . The way grew so narrow that we had to walk one by one through lines of wall perforated with holes for dead bodies . Once in a while we would come to a small chapel , for miserable variety 's sake , and be told to admire some very old , very wretched painting . Jonah and the whale were represented in a double-barreled miracle picture . Not only was the whale about to swallow Jonah , but he was only as large as a good-sized brook trout , while Jonah towered away above him like a Goliath . I found myself wondering if the guide had convulsions , and , if he should have one now , and die , how many days would pass before we should eat each other . And would they take me first , because I am youngest and plumpest ? Albert would make good soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore-quarter . And by the time we came to the top again , I was all ready to cry . And then , mamma , I did an awful thing . Mr. Mann exclaimed : " Why , Miss Mae , how frightened you look . You are quite white . " And I answered very sharply : " What a disagreeable man you are . I 'm not frightened at all . " I said it in a dreadful tone , and how his face changed . He looked so strangely . Everybody was still but Albert , and he said , " Why , Mae , you are very rude to Mr. Mann . " Even then I did n't apologize . So here we are at sword 's points , and all the rest sympathizing with my foe , who is only on the defensive . Why am I such a belligerent ? I ca n't conceive where I got my nature , unless from that very disagreeable dear old grandpapa of papa 's , who fought the whole world all his life . But how egotistic I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how we are lodged and clothed and fed . We have taken apartments , as I presume Albert wrote you , on the Via San Nicolo da Tolentino , quite near the Costanzi hotel , which is in the height of the fashion as a hotel ; near too , which is better , to Mr. Story 's studio and the old Barberini palace and the Barberini square and fountains . Off behind , is that terrible church of the Cappucini , with its cemetery underneath of bones and skulls and such horrors . I like the apartments very much , principally because I have made three staunch friends and one good enemy , in the kitchen . The padrona ,  --  she 's the woman who keeps the house , and serves us , too , in this case  --  though Mrs. Jerrold has a maid to wait on the table and care for our rooms  --  well , the padrona is my first friend . Her cousin , a handsome southern Italian , is here on a visit , and she is not only my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her home and the peasants and their life , while I sit on the floor with Giovanni ,  --  friend number three and eldest son of the padrona ,  --  and even Roberto , my enemy , the crying baby of three years , hushes his naughty mouth to listen to Lisetta , for that is the cousin 's name . I am so glad I studied Italian as hard as I did for my music , for it comes very easily to me now , and already I slip the pretty words from my halting tongue much more smoothly and quickly than you would imagine I could . Mrs. Jerrold is n't quite satisfied , and would prefer the Costanzi , only she does n't believe in letting us girls stay at large hotels . She and Edith are shocked at my kitchen tastes , so that I generally creep off quietly and say nothing about it . It is strange for me to have to keep anything secret , but I am learning how . As for our clothes , O , mamma , Edith is ravishing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fringe on it , and odd loopings here and there where you do n't expect to find them . What ca n't a Parisian dressmaker do ? They have such a wonderful idea of appropriateness , it seems to me . Now , at home you know we girls always wear the same sort of thing , but Madame H  --   --  says no , Edith , and I should dress very differently ; and now Edith 's clothes all have a flow , and sweep , and grace about them , and her silks rustle in a stately way as she walks , while my dresses have n't any trimming to speak of , but are cut in a clinging , square sort of way , with jackets , and here and there a buckle , that makes me feel half the time as if I were playing soldier in a lady-like fashion . But what a budget this is . How shocked the people here would be . They take travel so solemnly , mamma , and treat Baedeker , like the Bible ,  --  and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of it . Indeed , I ca n't help it , for Paris is utterly intoxicating . It takes away your moral nature and adds it all into your powers of enjoyment . Well , good-bye , my dear , and keep writing me tremendous letters , wo n't you ; for I do love you dearly . Your loving daughter , MAE . Mae felt a great deal better when she had finished the letter , and , like a volatile girl as she was , buttoned her Burt boots and Paris gloves , singing gaily a dash from Trovatore in a very light-hearted manner . " Why , you look like a different girl , " cried Eric , as she entered the parlor , where he and Mr. Mann were sitting . " Mrs. Jerrold , Edith , and Albert have gone on in a carriage , and you are left to my tender care ; will you ride or walk ? " " How can you ask ? My feet are quite wild . No wonder I am a different girl . Are we not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people ? I have just unlocked the stop-gates and let the blood bound in my veins as it wants to . " " It has been taking the cinque-pace , I should say from your long face to-day . " " O , it has only been trying to keep step with the march of the ages , or some such stately tread , but it was hard work , and now the dear life of me hops , skips and jumps , like this , " and Mae seized her brother and danced across the room , stopping very near Mr. Mann , who stood with his back to them , drumming on the window pane . She looked at him quizzically and half raised her eyebrows . Eric shook his head , and said aloud in his outspoken way : " You owe him an apology , Mae , for this morning 's rudeness . " Mr. Mann turned quickly . " I am surprised , Eric . Let your sister find out for herself when she is rude . " " Bless me , " cried Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined . " Are you going to the Pincian with us ? " she asked . " No , I am going to stay home . " " Well , good-bye , then . Come , Eric . " The door closed behind them . Mr. Mann stood by the window and watched them walk away . Mae , with her eager , restless , fresh life showing out in every motion ; Eric , with his boy-man air and his student swing and happy-go-lucky toss of his head . Mr. Mann smiled and then he sighed . " That 's a good boy , so square and fair and merry  --  and a queer girl , " he added . " Rome is n't the place for her . She must get away , though why I should take care for her , or worry about her , little vixen . I do n't see . " Still he smiled as one would over a very winning , very wicked child , and shortly after took his hat and went to the Pincio , after all . Meantime , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Steps , and were on the Pincian hill . Here , Mae was indeed happy . The fine equipages and dark , rich beauty of the Italians delighted her , and she and Eric found a shaded bench , and watched the carriages drive round and round , and criticised , and admired , and laughed like two idle children . They bought some flowers , and Mae sat pulling them to pieces , when they caught sight , down the pathway , of two approaching Piedmontese officers . " O , " cried Mae , and dropped her flowers , and clasped her hands , and sprang to her feet , " O , Eric , are they gods or men ? " The Piedmontese officer is godlike . He must be of a certain imposing height to obtain his position , and his luxurious yellow moustaches and blue black eyes , enriched and intensified by southern blood , give him a strange fascination . The cold , manly beauty and strength of a northern blonde meet with the heat and lithe grace of the more supple southerner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegance and sensuous langour , with a fire , a verve , a nobility , that puts him at the very head of masculine beauty . Add to the charms of his physique , the jauntiest , most bewitching of uniforms , the clinking spurs , the shining buttons , the jacket following every line of his figure , and no wonder maidens ' hearts seek him out always and young pulses beat quicker at his approach . Mae 's admiration was simply rapturous . Utterly regardless of the pretty picture she herself made , of her vivid coloring and sparkling beauty , she stood among her dropped flowers until the two pairs of eyes were fixed upon her . Then she became suddenly aware of her attitude and with quick feminine cunning endeavored to transfer her admiration to some beautiful horses cantering by , exclaiming in Italian , that the officers might surely understand she was thinking only of the fine animals : " O , what wonderful horses ! " The foreign pronunciation , Eric 's amusement , Mae 's confusion , were not lost upon the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sauntered leisurely past , only to turn a corner and quicken their steps again toward the bench where Eric and Mae were seated . They found the brother and sister just arising , and followed them slowly . An Italian is quick to detect secrets . The two had not proceeded far before one said to the other ; " Eh , Luigi , we are not the only interested party . " Luigi looked slowly around and saw a crowd of Italian loungers gazing at the little stranger with their softly-bold black eyes full of admiration . He shrugged his shoulders slightly . " Bah , they gaze in that way at all womankind . See , now they are watching the next one , " and as he spoke , the boys turned with one accord to stare at a young Italian girl , who pressed closer to the side of her hook-nosed old duenna : " It is not those loungers that I noticed , " replied the other . " Look there , " and he waved his hand lightly toward the left , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood a young man . " Ah , " said Luigi , still incredulous , " he sees nothing but Rome ; he is fresh from over the seas . " " No , no , watch his eyes , " replied the other . They were assuredly fixed , with a keen searching glance , on a little form before them , and as Eric and Mae suddenly turned to the left , the stranger , half carelessly , but very quickly , crossed to another path , from which he could watch them , but be , in his turn , unobserved . " Jealous , " laughed Luigi , shrugging his shoulders again . " Her lover , probably . " " No , " replied Bero , " but he may be some time . " Then after a moment 's pause , " Good evening , " he said carelessly . " I am going to say my prayers at vespers . I 've been a sorry scamp of late . " Luigi laughed disdainfully and lightly . " You want to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to lose my heart over a little foreigner . I have other game . However , Lillia shall not know of it . Addio , Bero . " So Luigi went off the other way , and Bero , with a flushed face , followed Mae at a distance , and kept an eye on the stranger , flattering himself that he was quite unnoticed by those sharp , keen eyes . He was mistaken , Norman Mann had seen the officers before they saw him , had watched their footsteps , and had a pretty clear idea of the whole affair . Mae walked on happily , chatting with Eric , and with that vague , delightful feeling of something exciting in the air . She knew there was an officer behind her , because she had heard the clicking spurs , but she only guessed that he might be one of the two who had passed  --  the taller , perhaps ,  --  which , of course , he was . She had , moreover , in some mysterious way , caught sight of a figure resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Her spirits rose with the half-mystery , and she grew brighter and prettier and more magnetic to the two followers as she tossed her shoulders slightly and now and then half-turned her sunny head . As for Eric , he was totally unconscious of any secrets . He fancied himself and his pretty , nice , little sister all alone by their very selves , and he went so far as to expatiate on the vastness of the world , and how in this crowd there was no other life that bordered or touched on theirs . To which Mae replied : " You do n't know ; you may fall in love with one of these very Italian girls , or my future husband may be walking behind me now . " When she had said this , she flushed scarlet and was very much ashamed of herself in her heart . " We must go home now , " Eric replied , quite disdaining such sybilistic remarks . So they left the hill and went down the Steps in the rich afternoon light , and so homewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; Norman on the other side of the street , the Italian in a slyer , less conspicuous manner , by taking side streets , or the next parallel pavement , and appearing only at every corner in the distance . He appeared , however , close at hand , as Mae and Eric turned into their lodgings . His eyes met Mae 's . She blushed involuntarily as she recognized him , and at once , in that moment , there was an invisible half-acquaintance established between the two . If they should ever meet again , they would remember each other . Mae crept off to the kitchen that evening , to beg for another of Lisetta 's stories , and quite forgot her walk , the officer , and Norman Mann while she listened to the STORY OF TALILA . Talila was a young girl , destined to be a nun . She was a naughty little girl and would make wry faces at the thought , and wish she could be a man , a soldier or sailor , instead of being a woman and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , and did n't say her prayers very much , and was so bad that the priest sent for her to see him . He told her how wicked she was , and that , too , when she was to be the bride of the church ; but she said the church had many , many brides , and she would rather be the bride of Giovanni ; and that she loved red-cheeked babies better than beads , and songs were nicer than prayers . Should she sing him such a pretty , gay one she knew ? And the priest could hardly keep from laughing at the bright-eyed , naughty , naughty Talila . But he said : " If Giovanni does not want to marry you , will you then become the bride of the church ? " And Talila laughed aloud and tossed her head . " Giovanni longs to marry me , Father , " she said , " I know that already . " But the Father sent for Giovanni and gave him money if he would say he did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , but the Father showed him a purse all full of silver , which Talila 's mother had brought him , for it was she who had vowed Talila should be a nun . Then the Father said : " This is yours if you say as I wish , and if not , you shall be cursed forever , and all your children shall be cursed , because you have married the bride of the church . " Then Giovanni crossed himself and took the bag of silver , and the priest sent for Talila , and she heard her Giovanni say he did n't want to marry her  --  she had better be a nun ; and she threw up her brown arms and screamed aloud , and fell down as if dead . And afterwards she was very ill , and when she grew better she had forgotten everything and was only a little child , and she loves little children , and is ever with them , but she calls them all Giovanni . They play together by the bay through the long day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes alone to her home . But alas ! she never tells her beads , or prays a prayer , and sorry things are said of her  --  that God gave her up because she left Him . But the children all love her , and she loves them . CHAPTER III . Edith and Mae had a quarrel one morning . Mae 's tongue was sharp , but although she breezed quickly , she calmed again very soon . The latter fact availed her little this time , for Edith maintained a cold displeasure that would not be melted by any bright speeches or frank apologies . " Edith , " said little Miss Mae , quite humbly for her , as she put on her hat , and drew on her gloves , " Edith , are n't you going out with me ? " " What for ? " asked that young person indifferently . " Why  --  for fun , and to make up . Have n't you forgiven me yet ? " Edith did not reply directly . " I am going out with mamma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our balcony . Albert has engaged one for us , on the corner of the Corso and Santa Maria e Jesu . I suppose you can go too . There will be an extra seat . We 'll come home by the Pincian Hill . " " Thank you , " said Mae , " but I will get Eric and go for a tramp , " and she left the room with compressed lips and flushed cheeks . In the hall were Albert , Eric and Norman , talking busily . " Where are you going Eric , may n't I go too , please ? " " I 'm sorry Mae , but this is an entirely masculine affair  --  five-button gloves and parasols are out of the question . " " O , Ric , I am half lonely . " Mae laughed a little hysterically . At that moment she caught Mr. Mann 's eyes , full of sympathy . " But goodbye , " she added , and opened the door , " I 'm going . " " Alone ? " asked Norman , involuntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you any objections , boys ? " Eric and Albert were talking busily and did not hear her . Norman Mann held open the door for her to pass out , and smiled as she thanked him . She smiled back . She came very near saying , " I 'm sorry I was rude the other day , forgive me , " and he came very near saying , " May I go with you , Miss Mae ? " But they neither of them spoke , and Norman closed the door with a sigh , and Mae walked away with a sigh . It was only a little morning 's experience , sharp words , misunderstandings ; but the child was young , far from home and her mother , and it seemed hard to her . She was in a very wild mood , a very hard mood , and yet all ready to be softened by a kind , sympathetic word , so nearly do extremes of emotion meet . " There 's no one to care a pin about me , " said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mind to go and take the veil or drown myself in the Tiber . Then they would be bound to search for me , and convent vows and Tiber mud hold one fast . No , I wo n't , I 'll go and sit in the Pincian gardens and talk Italian with the very first person I meet and forget all about myself . I wish Mr. Mann would n't pity me . Dear me , here I am remembering these forlorn people again . I wish I could see mamma and home this morning ,  --  the dear old library . Why the house is shut up and mamma 's south . I forgot that , and here am I all alone . It is like being dead . There , I have dropped a tear on my tie and spoiled it ! Besides , if one is dead , there comes Heaven . Why should n't I play dead , and make my own Heaven ? " Here Mae seated herself , for she was on the Pincio by this time , and looked off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , the Tiber , all the domes and rising ruins and afar the campagna . " I would n't make my Heaven here , " thought this dreadful Mae , " not if it is beautiful . I 'd not stay here a single other day . Bah no ! " and she shook her irreverent little fist right down at the Eternal City . At this moment , a small beggar , who had been pleading unnoticed at her side , was lifted from his feet by a powerful hand , and a shower of soft Italian imprecations fell on Mae 's ear . She sprang up quickly , " No , no , " she cried in Italian , " how dare you hurt a harmless boy ? " She lifted her face full toward that of the man who had inspired her wrath , and her eyes met those of the Piedmontese officer . She blushed scarlet . " Pardon , a thousand pardons , " began he . " It was for your sake , Signorina . I saw you shake your hand that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was troubling the foreign lady . " Mae laughed frankly , although she was greatly confused . The officer and the beggar boy behind him waited expectantly . " I shook my hand at my thoughts , " she explained . " I did not see the boy . Forgive me , Signor , for my hasty words . " The officer enjoyed her confusion quietly . He threw a handful of small coin at the beggar , and bade him go . Then he turned again to Mae . " I am sorry , Signorina , that your thoughts are sad . I should think they would all be like sweet smiles . " He said this with an indescribable delicacy and gallantry , as if he half feared to speak to her , but his sympathy must needs express itself . Mae was , as we have seen , in a reckless , wild mood . She did not realize what she was doing . She had just broken down all barriers in her mind , was dead to her old life , and ready to plan for Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new friend , who spoke in a strange tongue , lived in a strange land was as far removed from her old-time people and society as an inhabitant of Saturn , or an angel . She accepted him under her excitement , as she would have accepted them . No waiting for an introduction , no formal getting-acquainted talk , no reserve . She looked into the devoted , interested eyes above her , and said frankly : " I was feeling all alone , and I hate Rome . I thought I would like to play I was dead , and plan out a Heaven for myself . It should not be in Rome . And then I suppose I shook my fist . " " Where would your Heaven be ? " asked the Piedmontese , falling quickly , with ready southern sympathy , into her mood . Mae seated herself on the bench and made room for him at her side . " Where should it be ? " she repeated . " Down among the children of the sun , all out in the rich orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , with Vesuvius near by , and Capri ; yes , it would be in Sorrento that I should find my heaven . " The officer smiled under his long moustaches . " For three days ,  --  at a hotel , Signorina . " " No , no ; with the peasants . I am tired and sick of books , and people , and reasons . Shall I give you a day of my Heaven ? " Bero smiled and bent slightly forward and rested his hand lightly on the stick of her parasol , which lay between them . " Go on , " he said . " I would fill my apron with sweet flowers and golden fruit  --  great oranges , and those fragrant , delicious tiny mandarins  --  and I would get a crowd of little Italians about me , all a-babbling their pretty , pretty tongue , and I would go down to the bay and get in an anchored boat , and lie there all the morning , catching the sunlight in my eyes , trimming the brown babies and the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds , tossing the pretty fruit , and laughing , and playing , and enjoying . Later , there 'd be a run on the beach , and a ride on a donkey , and a dance , with delirious music and frolic . And then the moon and quiet ,  --  and I would steal away from the crowd , and take a little boat , and float and drift  --  " " Alone ? " asked Bero , softly . " Surely , you would n't condemn a mountaineer 's yellow moustache , or a soldier 's spurs and sword , if at heart he was really a child of the sun also ? May I share your day of Heaven ? It would be paradise for me , too . " All this in the same soft , deferential manner . " Well , well , " half laughed , half sighed Mae . " All this is a dream , unless , indeed , I go home with Lisetta . " " Who is Lisetta ? " " Our padrona 's cousin . She is here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the coast . She goes home at the end of Carnival . Oh , how I do long for Carnival , " continued Mae , frankly and confidentially . " Do n't you ? I am like a child over it , I am trying already to persuade Eric  --  that is my brother  --  to take me down on the Corso the last night , for the Mocoletti . It would be much better fun than staying on our balcony . " " Where is your balcony ? " asked Bero , stroking his long moustaches . " It is on the corner of Maria e Jesu , and if I ever see you coming by , I shall be tempted to pepper your pretty uniform . How beautiful it is ! " " Yes , " replied Bero , again gazing proudly down at his lithe figure , in its well-fitting clothes , " but I would be willing to be showered with confetti daily to see you . How shall I know you ? What is to be the color of your domino ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , flashing his deep eyes , and half reaching out his hand , in that same tender , respectful way . Mae saw the sunlight strike his hair ; she half heard his deep breath ; and , like a flood , there suddenly swept over her the knowledge that this new friend , this sympathizing soul , was an unknown man , and that she was a girl . What had she done ? What could she do ? Confusion and embarrassment suddenly overtook her . She bent her eyes away from those other eyes , that were growing bolder and more tender in their gaze . " I  --  I  --  " she began , and just at this very inauspicious moment , while she sat there , flushed , by the stranger 's side , the clatter of swiftly-approaching wheels sounded , and a carriage turned the corner , containing Mrs. Jerrold , Edith , Albert , and Norman Mann . They all saw her . Mae laughed . It was such a dreadful situation that it was funny , and she laughed again . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low voice . " We can walk away , " replied the officer , and turned his face in the opposite direction . " It is too late ; and , besides , why should we ? " And Mae looked full in his face , then turned to the carriage , which was close upon them . " How do you all do ? " she cried , gleefully and bravely . " Is n't there room for me in there ? Mrs. Jerrold , I would like to introduce Signor  --  your name ? "  --  she said , quite clearly , in Italian , turning to the officer . " Bero , " he replied . " Signor Bero . He was very kind , and saved me from  --  from a little beggar boy . " " You must have been in peril , indeed , " remarked Mrs. Jerrold , bowing distantly to Bero , and beckoning the coachman , as Mae sprang into the carriage , to drive on . " I am sorry to put you on the box , Norman , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , that Mr. Mann had vacated for her , " and I hope Miss Mae is also . " But Mae did n't hear this . She was plucking up courage in her heart , and assuming a saucy enough expression , that sat well on her bright face . Indeed , she was a pretty picture , as she sat erect , with lips and nostrils a trifle distended , and her head a little in the air . The Italian thought so , as he walked away , smiling softly , clicking his spurs and stroking his moustache ; and Norman Mann thought so too , as he tapped his cane restlessly on the dash-board and scowled at the left ear of the off horse . The party preserved an amazed and stiff silence , as they drove homeward . " Eric , " cried Norman , very late that same night . " Do be sober , I have something to say to you about Miss Mae . " " Norman , old boy , how can a fellow of my make be sober when he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torn six flounces from a Paris dress ? Why , man , I am delirious , I am . Tra , la , la , tra , la , la . Oh , Norman , if you could have heard that waltz , " and Eric seized his companion in his big arms and started about the room in a mad dance . " You are Miss Hopkins , Norman , you are . Here goes  --  " but Norman struck out a bold stroke that nearly staggered Eric and broke loose . " For Heaven 's sake , Eric , stop this fooling ; I want to speak to you earnestly . " " Evidently , " replied Eric , with excited face , " forcibly also . Blows belong after words , not before , " and the big boy tramped indignantly off to bed . Norman Mann was in earnest truly , forcible also , for he opened his mouth to let out a very expressive word as Eric left the room . It did him good seemingly , for he strode up and down more quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself . " Norman Mann , you 've got to do it all alone , " he said . " Albert and Edith and Aunt Martha are too vexed and shocked to do the little rebel any good . Ric , oh , dear , Ric is a silly boy , God bless him , and here I am doomed to make that child hate me , and with no possible authority over her , or power , for that matter , trying to keep her from something terribly wild . If they do n't look out , she will break loose . I know her well , and there 's strong character under this storm a-top , if only some one could get at it . Damn it . " Norman grew forcible again . " Why ca n't I keep my silly eyes away from her , and go off with the fellows . You see , " continued Norman , still addressing his patient double , " she is a rebel , and  --  pshaw , I dare say it is half my fancy , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be summoned to the front and be shot . O , I forgot , there 's no war . Well , then , I wish he would fall in love with any body but Mae . It must be late . Ric did n't leave that little party very early , I 'm sure , but I ca n't sleep . I 'll get down my Sismondi and read awhile . I wonder if that child is feeling badly now . I half believe she is  --  but here 's my book . " Yes , Mae was feeling badly , heart-brokenly , all alone in her room . After a long , harrowing talk with Mrs. Jerrold , at the close of which she had received commands never to go out alone in Rome , because it was n't proper , she had been allowed to depart for her own room . Here she closed the door leading into Mrs. Jerrold 's and Edith 's apartment , and opened her window wide , and held her head out in the night air  --  the poisonous Roman air . The street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed under the light at the corner , but Mae had , on the whole , a desolate outlook  --  high , dark buildings opposite , and black clouds above , with only here and there a star peeping through . She had taken down her long hair , thrown off her dress , and half wrapped herself in a shawl , out of which her bare arms stretched as she leaned on the deep window seat . She looked like the first woman  --  of the Darwinian , not the Biblical , Creation . There was a wild , half-hunted expression on her face that was like the set air of an animal brought suddenly to bay . She thought in little jerks , quick sentences that were almost like the barking growls with which a beast lashes itself to greater fury . " They treated me unfairly . They had no right . I shall choose my own friends . How dare they accuse me of flirting ? I flirt , pah ! I 'd like to run away . This stupid , stupid life ! " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose Mr. Mann thinks I am horrid , but I do n't care . I wish I could see Eric , he would n't blame me so . What a goose I am to mind anyway . The Carnival is coming ! Even these old tombs must give way for ten whole riotous days . I must make them madly merry days . I wonder how I will look in my domino . I suppose the pink one is mine . " So Miss Mae dried her eyes , picked her deshabille self from the window seat , turned up the light , slipped into her pink and white carnival attire , and walked to the window again . " This is the Corso all full of people , and I 'll pelt them merrily , so , and so , and so ! " She reached forth her bare , round arm into the darkness , and looked down , where , full under the street light , gazing up at her , stood the Piedmontese officer . It was at that very moment that Norman Mann put down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . Mae met Mr. Mann at the breakfast table the next morning without the least embarrassment . Indeed , the little flutter in her talk could easily be attributed to unusually high spirits and an excited and pleased fancy . That was how Norman Mann translated it , of course . Really , the flutter was a genuine stirring of her heart with inquietude , timidity and semi-repentance ; but Mae could n't say this , and it 's only what one says out that can be reckoned on in this world . So Norman Mann , who saw only the bright cheeks and eyes and restless quickening of an eager girl and did not see the palpitating feminine heart inside , was displeased and half-cold . Could any one be long cold to Mae Madden ? She believed not . She was quite accustomed to lightning-like white heats of anger in those with whom she came in contact , but coldness was out of her line . Still she met the occasion well . " Shall I give you some coffee ? " she asked , pleasantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerrold is not well , and Edith and Albert are off for Frascati . " " Poor child ; how much alone she is , " he thought to himself . " I understand we all go to the play tonight ? " queried Mae . " The thought of Shakspeare dressed in Italian is not pleasant to me , " said Mr. Mann , after a silence of a few minutes . " I am quite longing to see him in his new clothes . There is so much softness and beauty in Italian that I expect to gain new ideas from hearing the play robed in more flowing phrases . Shakspeare certainly is for all the world . " " But Shakspeare 's words are so strongly chosen that they are a great element in his great plays . And a translation at best is something of a parody , especially a translation from a northern tongue , with its force and backbone , so to speak , into a southern , serpentine , gliding language . You have heard the absurd rendering of that passage from Macbeth where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macbeth ! Hail to thee , Thane of Cawdor ! ' into such French as ' Comment vous portez vous , Monsieur Macbeth ; comment vous portez vous , Monsieur Thane de Cawdor ! ' A translation must pass through the medium of another mind , and other minds like Shakspeare 's are hard to find . " Norman spoke with so much reverence for Mae 's greatest idol that her heart warmed and she smiled approval , though for argument 's sake she remained on the other side . " Is n't a translation more like an engraver 's art , and are n't fine engravings to be sought and admired even when we know the great original in its glory of color ? Then all writing is only translation , not copying . Shakspeare had to translate the tongues he found in stones , the books he found in brooks , with twenty-six little characters and his great mind , into what we all study , and love , and strive after . But he had to use these twenty-six characters in certain hard , Anglo-Saxon forms and confine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fen-sucked fogs , ' and such damp , shivery places , he is all right , but when he sings of ' love 's light wings , ' and all that nonsense , he is impeded ; now open to him ' Italian , the language of angels '  --  you know the old rhyme  --  and see what a chance he has among the " liquid l 's and bell-voiced m 's and crushed tz 's . " To-night you will hear Desdemona call Othello ' Il mio marito , ' in a way that will start the tears . What are the stiff English words to that ? ' My husband ! ' Husband is a very uneuphonious name , I think . " Norman Mann smiled . " Another cup of coffee , if you please  --  not quite as sweet as the last , " and he passed his cup . " I believe there is always a charm in a novel word that has not been commonized by the crowd . ' Dear ' means very little to us nowadays , because every school girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elderly ladies ' my dear ' the world at large , in a pretty and benevolent way . So with the words ' husband ' and ' wife ' ; we hear them every day in commonest speech  --  ' the coachman and his wife , ' or ' Sally Jones 's husband , '  --  but I take it this is when we stand outside . That wonderful little possessive pronoun MY has a great , thrilling power . ' My husband ' will be as fine to your ears as ' il mio marito , ' which has , after all , a slippery , uncertain sound ; and as for ' my wife '  --  " At that moment the coffee cup , which was on its way back , had reached the middle of the table , where by right it should have been met and guided by the steadier , masculine hand ; Norman 's hand was there in readiness , but instead of gently removing the cup from Mae 's clasp , it folded itself involuntarily about the white , round wrist , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little possessive pronoun that sent the sudden thrill through the unexpecting wrist ? At any rate it trembled ; the cup , the saucer , the coffee , the spoon , followed a well known precedent , and " went to pieces all at once ; " " all at once and nothing first just as bubbles do when they burst . " And so alas ! did the conversation , and that burst a beautiful bubble Norman had just blown . Damages were barely repaired when Eric entered the breakfast room with a petulant sort of face and flung himself into a chair . " My ! what a head I have on me this morning , " he groaned . " Soda water would be worth all the coffee in the world , Mae ; I 'll take it black , if you please . How cosy you two look . I always take too much of every thing at a party , from flirtation to  --  O , Mae , you need n't look so sad . I 'm not the one in disgrace now . Mrs. Jerrold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as for Mann , here ,  --  by the way , " and Eric rubbed his forehead , as if trying to sharpen up a still sleepy memory , " I suppose you two have had it out by this time . Norman sat up till ever so late to talk you over with me , Mae . Do thank him for me ; I am under the impression that I did n't do so last night . " Mae tapped her fourth finger , on which a small ring glistened , sharply against the cream jug . " If I were every body 's pet lamb or black sheep , I could n't have more shepherd 's crooks about me . Have you joined the laudable band , Mr. Mann , and am I requested to thank you for that ? " " Not at all . Perhaps your brother 's remembrances of last night are not very distinct . I certainly sat up for Sismondi 's sake , not for yours . " And he really thought , for the moment , that he told the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising as she spoke , " that I have a tremendous retinue of mentors , and nurses , and governesses already . You had better content yourself with the fact that you have four proper traveling companions , and bear the disgrace of being shocked as best you may by one wild scrap of femininity who will have her own way in spite of you all . " Mae half laughed , but she was serious , and the boys both knew it . " You flatter me , " replied Norman , " I had aspired to no such position , but for your brother 's sake , if not for your own , I wished to tell Eric that the Roman air at midnight was dangerous to your health . I saw you had your window open . " " Did you look through the ceiling , pray ? " Mae retorted from the door-way . " Eric , ring if you want anything . Rosetta is close at hand . " " I have put my foot in it this time , " said Eric , clumsily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norman did not feel like being pitied , and this remark of Eric 's roused him . He fairly ground his teeth and clenched his hands , but his big brown moustache and the tablecloth hid these outer manifestations of anger . " Do n't be a goose , Ric , " he said . " What possible difference can all this make to me ? Your sister is young and quick . " Now , it was Eric 's turn to wince . Was he giving this fellow the impression that he thought his sister 's opinions would affect him ? Horrible suspicion ! Boys always fancy everybody in love with their sister . He must cure that at once . " Of course , " he replied quickly , " I know you and Mae never agree , that you barely stand each other . But I did n't know but you would prefer to be on good terms with her , for all that . " " Miss Mae can choose the terms on which we meet . I shall be content whatever her decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric straightened himself at once . " I was a perfect fool last night , " he confessed , " and I must rely on you , old fellow , to help me out . I made engagements for two weeks ahead with Miss Hopkins and Miss Rae . At any rate , I 'm booked for the play to-night . Now , I ca n't take two girls very well . That is , I can , but I thought you might like a show . You may have your choice of the two . Miss Rae , by the way , says she 's wild to know you ; thought you were the most provoking man she ever saw ; and that you were  --  nonsensical idea  --  engaged to Mae . All because you would n't look at her the other day when she passed you two , But you can go with Miss Hopkins , if you prefer . " " Are they pretty ? " asked Norman , apparently warming to the task , " and bright ? " " I should say they were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rae is more your style . Still , you may have your choice . " " Silly boy ; you 're afraid to death that I shall choose Miss Hopkins . Well , if they are not over stupid and flirtatious  --  " " Stupid ! Oh , no , "  --  Eric scouted that idea  --  " and flirtatious , perhaps . Miss Hopkins rolls her eyes a good deal , but then she has a frankness , a winning way . " " Well , " laughed Norman , " you 're such a transparent , susceptible infant-in-arms that I 'll go with you . " " As shepherd , " suggested Eric , " as long as Mae wo n't have you . But come , we must go down and call on these people . It wo n't do at all for you to appear suddenly this evening , and say , ' I 'll relieve my friend here of one of you . ' " " Oh , what a bore . Is that necessary ? Wo n't a card or a box of Stillman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come along , then . " CHAPTER V. It was evening , and the brilliantly lighted theatre was crowded to overflowing . Of course there were English who scowled at the Americans , and Americans who smiled on every one and ate candy while Othello writhed in jealous rage , and a scattering of Germans with spectacles and a row of double-barrelled field glasses glued over them , and Frenchmen with impudent eyes and elegant gloves , and a general filling in of Italians , with the glitter here and there of nobility , and still oftener of bright uniforms . Finally there was a modicum of true gentry , and these not of any particular nation or class . It is pleasant to name our party immediately after referring to these goodly folks . They had a fine box , and although their ranks were thinned by the loss of two cavaliers , nobody seemed to care . Albert and Edith were perfectly happy side by side , and Mrs. Jerrold was well contented to observe her daughter 's smile as Albert spoke to her , and the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Edith 's . As for Mae , she had that delicious feminine pride which is as good a stimulant as success to women  --  in emergencies . And to-night was an emergency to this small , excitable , young thing . Her eyes were very dark from the expansion of the pupil . They possessed a rare charm , caught from a trick the eyelids had of drooping slowly and then suddenly and unexpectedly lifting to reveal the wide , bright depths , that half-concealed , half-revealed power , which is so tantalizing . Mae was dressed in this same spirit to-night , and she was dimly conscious of it . The masses of tulle that floated from her opera hat to her chin and down on her shoulders , revealed only here and there a glimpse of rich brown hair , or of white throat . Her cheeks were scarlet , her lips a-quiver with excitement and pleasure . She formed a pretty contrast to Edith , who sat by her side . Miss Jerrold leaned back in her chair quietly , composedly . She fanned herself in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise displaced or surprised  --  thoroughly well-bred and at home . She might have had a private rehearsal of Othello in her own dramatic hall the evening before , from her air and mien . Mae , on the contrary , was alert , on the qui vive , as interested as a child in each newcomer , and , after the curtain rose , in every tableau . Such a woman can not fail to attract attention , as long as she is herself unconscious . The world grows blase so speedily that it enjoys all the more thoroughly the sight of freshness , verve , life ,  --  that is , the male portion of the world . Women 's great desire , as a rule , is to appear entirely at ease , city-bred , high-bred , used to all things , surprised by none . So there were a great many glasses turned toward Mae that evening . Very probably the young women in the next box accepted a share of these glances as their own , and , in a crowd where the French and Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been far wrong . Every girl or woman who pretends to any possible charm is quite sure of her share of admiration from these susceptible beings . The young ladies of the next box had that indescribable New York air , which extends from the carefully brushed eyebrows quite to the curves of the wrist and hand . Praise Parisian modes all you will , but for genuine style , a New York girl , softened a trifle by commonsense or good taste , leads the world  --  certainly if she is abroad . For there she soon finds it impossible to go to the extremes that American air seems to rush her into . Three months , or perhaps , if she is observant , three days in Paris , teach her that the very biggest buttons , or the very largest paniers , or the very flaringest hats are not for her , or any lady , and by stepping back to size number two , she does not detract from her style , while she does add to her lady-likeness . These two girls , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Rae , whom chance or fate or bungling Eric Madden , who bought the tickets , had seated side by side with the Maddens and Jerrolds . It was bothersome , when Norman and Eric had played truant at any rate , but there was no help for it ; so after a little Eric introduced them all round , and the two parties apparently merged into one , or broke up into four , for tete-a-tetes soon began . It was a little hard that three girls should have each a devoted servant , and that only one , and that one , Mae , should be obliged to receive her care from the chaperon ; but so it was . Nevertheless , Mae bore herself proudly . She was seated next Miss Rae , separated only by the nominal barrier of a little railing , while just beyond sat Norman , his chair turned toward the two girls . The stranger insisted on drawing Mae into the conversation , partly for curiosity 's sake , to watch her odd face and manners , partly from that genuine generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is satisfied with her position . It is pleasant to pity , to be generous ; and Miss Rae , having the man , could afford to share him now and then , when it pleased her , with the lonely girl by her side . But Miss Rae 's tactics did not work . Mae replied pleasantly when addressed , but returned speedily and eagerly to Mrs. Jerrold or a survey of the house , with the frank happiness of a child . She was all the more fascinating to the admiring eyes that watched her , because she sat alone , electrified by the inspiration and magnetism from within , and did not need the stimulus of another voice close by her side , breathing compliments and flattery , to brighten her eyes and call the blushes to her cheeks . Norman Mann saw the eyes fixed on her , and they vexed him . At the same time , he liked her the better on that very account . And at last the curtain rose . It was just as Desdemona assures her father of her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze  --  of a presence . Lifting her eyes , and widening them , she looked over to the opposite side of the house , and there , of course , was the Piedmontese officer again , handsomer , more brilliant than ever , with a grateful , soft look of recognition in his eyes . Mae was out of harmony with all her friends . She was proud and lonely . The man 's pleased , softened look touched her heart strangely . There was almost a choke in her throat , there were almost tears in her eyes , and there was a free , glad , welcoming smile on her lips . Norman Mann saw it and followed it , and caught the officer receiving it , and thought " She 's a wild coquette . " And Mae knew what he saw and what he thought . Then a strange spirit entered the girl . Here was a man who vexed her , who piqued her , and who was rude , for Mae secretly thought it was rude to neglect Mrs. Jerrold , as the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piqued in his turn , if she did what he did n't like and looked at another man . And then here was the other man . Mae looked down at him . Bless us ! who is to blame a young woman for forgetting everything but the " other man " when he is a godlike Piedmontese officer , with strong soft cheek and throat , and Italian eyes , and yellow moustaches , and spurs and buttons that click and shine in a maddening sort of way ? Of course , in reality , everybody is to blame her , we among the very virtuous first . In this particular case , however , we have facts , not morals , to deal with . Mae did see Norman Mann talking delightedly to a pretty girl , and she did see the officer gazing at her rapturously , and she quite forgot Othello , and gave back look for look , only more shy and less intense perhaps , and knew that Norman Mann was very angry and she and the officer very happy . What matter though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she  --  But , bother all things but the delirious present moment . Never fear consequences . There were bright lights , and brilliant people , the hum of many voices , the flash of many eyes , and a half secret between her , this little creature up in the box , and the very handsomest man of them all . So while Othello fell about the stage , and ground out tremendous curses , Mae half shivered and glanced tremblingly toward Bero , and Bero gazed back protectingly and grandly . Once , when Desdemona cried out thrillingly , " Othello , il mio marito , " Mae looked at Norman involuntarily and caught a half flash of his eye , but he turned back quickly to his companion and Mae 's glance wandered on to Bero and rested there as the wild voice cried out again , " il mio marito , il mio marito . " So the evening slid on . Mae smiled and smiled and opened and half closed her eyes , and Norman invited Miss Rae to go to church with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and to go to the galleries with him , " until , Susie Hopkins , if you will believe it , I fairly thought he would drop on his knees and ask me to go through life with him , right then and there . " So Miss Rae confided to Susie Hopkins after the victorious night , in the silence of a fourth-story Costanzi bedroom . Susie Hopkins was putting her hair up on crimping-pins , but she paused long enough to say : " Well , Jack Durkee had better hurry himself and his ring along , then . " " O , he 's coming as quickly as ever he can , " laughed Miss Rae , whereat she proceeded to place a large letter and a picture under the left-hand pillow , crimped her hair , cold-creamed her lips , and laid her down to pleasant dreams of  --  Jack . CHAPTER VI . Mae was very much ashamed of herself the next morning . She had been restored in a measure to popular favor , through Eric , the day before . Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his raid bravely on their forces combined with those of Mrs. Jerrold . He advanced boldly . " It 's all nonsense , child , as she is , " he said . " It was natural enough , to talk with the man , " for Mae had made a clean breast of her misdoings to him , to the extent of saying that they had chatted after the beggar left . " Do forgive her , poor little proud tot , away across the sea from her mother . Albert , you 're as hard as a rock , and that Edith has no spirit in her , " he added , under his breath . This remark made Albert white with rage . Nevertheless , he put in a plea for his wayward , reckless little sister , with effect . After a few more remarks from Mrs. Jerrold , Mae came out of the ordeal ; was treated naturally , and , as we have seen , accompanied Mrs. Jerrold to the play the night before . Now , it was the next day . Mrs. Jerrold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in writing home letters full of the Peter and Paul reminiscences and quotations . Norman and Eric left for the Costanzi , and Albert and Edith , armed with books , and note-books , and the small camp-stools , again started away together . This last ' again ' was getting to be accepted quite as a matter of course . Everybody knew what it meant . They always invited the rest of the company to go with them , and were especially urgent , this morning , that Mae should accompany them . " Why , with mamma in her room you will be lonely , " suggested Edith , " and you ca n't go out by yourself . " Mae winced inwardly at this , but replied pleasantly : " I have letters to write also , and I 'm not in the mood to-day for pictures , and the cold , chilling galleries filled with the damp breath of the ages . " So Edith and Albert , nothing loth , having discharged their duty , started off . These two have as yet appeared only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in opposition and contrast to Mae . They really , however , were very interesting young people . Albert with a strong desire in his heart  --  or was it in his head ?  --  to aid the world , and Edith with a clear self-possession and New England shrewdness that helped and pleased him . Their travels were enriching them both . Edith was trying to draw the soul from all the great pictures and some of the lesser ones , and Albert was waking , through her influence , to the world of art . This morning they were on their way to the Transfiguration to study the scornful sister . They were taking the picture bit by bit , color by color , face by face . There are advantages in this analytical study , yet there is a chance of losing the spirit of the whole . So Mae thought and said : " I know that sister now , Edith , better than you ever will . " This was while she was looping up her friend 's dress here , and pulling out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifying each other . " See here ! " And down sank Miss Mae on her knees , with her lips curved , and her hands stretched out imploringly , half-mockingly . No need of words to say : " Save my brother , behold him . Ah , you can not do it , your power is boast . Yet , save him , pray . " " A little more yellow in my hair , some pearls and a pink gown , and you might have the sister to study in a living model , Edith , " laughed Mae , arising . Edith and Albert were both struck by Mae 's dramatic force , and they talked of her as they drove to the Vatican . " I wish I understood her better , " said Edith . " I can not feel as if travel were doing her good . She is changing so ; she was always odd , but then she was always happy . Now she has her moods , and there is a look in her eye I am afraid of . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome would delight her nature , for she craves beauty and poetry in everything . I do n't believe the theatre is good for her . Albert , suppose we give up our tickets for Thursday night . " " But you want particularly to see that play , Edith . " " I can easily give it up for Mae 's sake . It would be cruel to go without her , and I think excitement is bad for her . " " You are very generous , Edith , and right , too , I dare say . I wish my little sister could see pleasure and duty through your steadier , clearer eyes . " Then the steady , clear eyes dropped suddenly , and the two forgot all about Mae , and rolled contentedly off , behind the limping Italian horse . And the red-cheeked vetturino with the flower in his button-hole , whistled a love-song , and thought of his Piametta , I suppose . Meantime , Mae , left to herself , grew penitent and reckless by turns , blushed alternately with shame and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the officer 's smile . She wondered where he lived , and whether she would see him soon again . Poor child ! She was really innocent , and only dimly surmised how he would haunt her hereafter . Would he look well in citizen 's clothes ? How would Norman Mann seem in his uniform ? She wished she had a jacket cut like his . And so on in an indolent way . But penitence was getting the better of her , and after vainly trying to read or write , she settled herself down for a cry . To think that she , Mae Madden , could have acted so absurdly . She never would forgive herself , never . Then she cried some more , a good deal more . About four in the afternoon a very bright sunbeam peeped through her closed blinds , and she brushed away her tears , and peace came back to her small heart , and she felt like a New England valley after a shower , very fresh and clean , and goodly ,  --  just a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had heard that there was lovely music at vespers , in the little church at the foot of Capo le Case . St. Andrea delle Frate , was it ? It was n't very far away . She could say her prayers and repent entirely and wholly . So she dressed rapidly , singing the familiar old Te Deum joyously all the while , and off she started . The air was cool and clear and delicious and the street-scenes were pretty . Mae took in everything before her as she left the house , from the Barberini fountain to the groups of models at the corner of the Square and the Via Felice ; but she did not see , at some distance behind her , on the opposite side of the street , the sudden start of a motionless figure as she left the house , or know that it straightened itself and moved along as she did , turning on to the pretty Via Sistina , so down the hill at Capo le Case , to the church below . She was early for vespers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little heart as she entered the quiet place . The contrast between the spot , with its shrines and symbols and aids to faith , and all that she had associated with religion , conspired to separate her from herself and her past , and left her a bit of breathing , worshiping life , praising the great Giver of Life . She fell on her knees in an exalted , jubilate spirit . She was more like a Praise-the-Lord psalm of David than like a young girl of the nineteenth century . And yet close behind her , a little to the left , was Bero on his knees too , at his pater nosters . By and by the music began . It was music beyond description ; those wonderful male voices , the chorus of young boys , and then suddenly , the organ and some one wild falsetto carrying the great Latin soul-laden words up higher . All this while Mae 's head was bent low and her heart was a-praying . All this while Bero was on his knees also , but his eyes were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mae heard indistinctly the sweep of trailing skirts , the sound of footsteps on the marble floor , the noise of voices as the people went away , but still she did not move . The selah pause had come after the psalm . When she did rise , and turn , and start to go , her eyes fell on the kneeling form . She tried to pass quickly without recognition , but he reached out his hand . " This is a church , " said Mae ; " my prayers are sacred ; do not disturb me . " He held his rosary toward her , with the cross at the end tightly clasped in his hand . " My prayers are here , too , " he said . " Oh , Signorina , give me one little prayer , one of your little prayers . " He knelt before her in the quiet , dim , half light , his hands clasped , and an intense earnestness in his easily moved Italian soul , that floated up to his face . It looked like beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sympathy with hers , one which met her harmoniously in every mood , slid into her dreams and wild wishes , sparkled with her enjoyment , and now knelt as she knelt , and asked for one of her prayers . She stood a minute irresolute . Then she smiled down on him a full , rich smile , and said in English : " God bless you , " The next moment she was gone . Bero made no movement to follow her , but remained quietly on his knees , his head bowed low . * * * * * " I looked in at St. Andrea 's , at vespers , " said that dear , bungling fellow , Eric , at dinner that night , " and saw you Mae , but you were so busy with your prayers I came away . " There was a pause , and Mae knew that people looked at her . " Yes , I was there ; the music was wonderful . " " Mae , " asked Mrs. Jerrold , " Do you have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mrs. Jerrold was a Puritan of the Puritans , and had breathed in the shorter catechism and the doctrine of election with the mountain air and sea-salt of her childhood . Possibly the two former had had as much to do as the latter with her angularity and severe strength . " Indeed , " cried Mae , impulsively , " I wish I could always enter a church to say my prayers . There is so much to help one there . " " Is there any danger of your becoming a Romanist ? " enquired Mrs. Jerrold , pushing the matter further . " I wish there were a chance of my becoming anything half as good , but I am afraid there is n't . Still , I turn with an occasional loyal heart-beat to the great Mother Church , that the rest of you have all run away from . " " Yes , you have , " Mae shook her head decidedly at Edith . " She may be a cruel mother . I know you all think she 's like the old woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and sends them supperless to bed , and gives them a stone for bread , but she 's the mother of all of us , notwithstanding . " " What a dreadful mixture of Mother Goose and Holy Bible , " exclaimed Eric , laughingly , while Mae cooled off , and Mrs. Jerrold stared amazedly , wondering how to take this tirade . She concluded at last that it would be better to let it pass as one of Mae 's extravagances , so she ended the conversation by saying : " I hope , Eric , you will wait for your sister , if you see her alone , at church . It is not the thing for her to go by herself . " " No , " added Albert , " we shall have to buy a chain for you soon . " " If you do , " said Mae quietly , " I 'll slip it . " And not another prayer did she say that night . CHAPTER VII . It was the first day of Carnival . The determination to enjoy herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone with her " good time coming . " She popped her head out of the doorway , and flung a big handful of confetti right at Eric , but he dodged , and Norman Mann caught it in his face . Then , seeing a try-to-be-dignified look creeping upon Mae , he seized the golden moment , gathered up such remnants of confetti as were tangled in his hair and whiskers , and flung them back again , shouting : " Long live King Pasquino ! So his reign has begun , has it ? " " Yes ; King Pasquino is lord , now , for ten whole days , " and she slowly edged her right hand about , to take aim again at Norman . He saw her , and frustrated the attempt by catching it and emptying the contents out upon the floor . The little white balls rolled off to the corners and the little hand fell slowly by Mae 's side . " Why not go down to the Corso , you and I , and see the beginning of the fun ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you , too , Eric , " and the three started off like veritable children , in a delightful , familiar , old-time way . Arrived at their loggia , they found an old woman employed in filling , with confetti , a long line of boxes , fastened to the balustrade of the balcony . Little shovels , also , were provided , for dealing out the tiny missals of war upon the heads below . There were masks in waiting , some to be tied on , while others terminated in a handle , by a skilful use of which they could be made as effective as a Spanish lady 's fan . Mae chose one of these latter . The Corso was alive with vendors of small bouquets and bon-bons and little flying birds tied in live agony to round yellow oranges . The fruit in turn was fastened to a long pole and so thrust up to the balconies as a tempting bait . If bought , the birds and flowers were tossed together into the streets to a passing friend . As Mae was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stragglers hurrying to the Piazza del Popolo , admiring the bannered balconies and gay streamers , several of these little birds were thrust up to her face , some of them peeping piteously and flapping their poor wings . She put up her hands and caught the oranges , one  --  two  --  three  --  four . In a moment she had freed the fluttering birds and tossed the fruit back into the street . " Pay them , Eric , " she cried indignantly ; " Why , what is this ? " for one of the little creatures , after vainly flapping its wings , had fallen on the balcony . Mae picked it up . It half opened its eyes at her and then lay still in her hands . " It is dead , " said Mae , quietly , going up to Norman . " Oh ! Mr. Mann , I thought Carnival meant real fun , not cruelty . Is n't there anywhere in this big world where we can get free from such dreadful things ? Well ! " she added , impatiently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes the world better than you do , time to apologize for it , " replied Norman , as familiarly as Eric would have done . The tone pleased Mae . She looked up and laughed lightly . " At any rate , " suggested he , " let 's forget the cruelty now and take the fun . Three of them are safe and very likely this scrap , " and he touched the dead bird in her hand , " is flying to rejoin his brothers in hunting-grounds that are stocked with angle-worms , and such game . We are to have a good time to-day , you and I. " At this moment Eric rushed up . " Say , Mann , " he cried , " here they come . They have taken the balcony just opposite , after all . And Miss Hopkins looks perfectly in a white veil . And oh ! here are the rest of our own party . " Mae lifted her eyes to the opposite side of the street , but they did not fall to the level of the Hopkins-Rae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , fourth-story window , beyond the circle of flying fun and frolic , confetti and flowers , Mae saw a wonderful woman 's face , a face with great dark eyes and raven hair . A heavily-figured white lace veil was pulled low over her brow , and fell in folds against her cheeks . Her skin was white , the scarlet of her face concentrating in her lips . There was a strange consonance between the creamy heavy lace and its flowing intertwined figures , and the face it encircled . A mystery , a grace , a subtle charm , that had the effect of a vivid dream , in its combination of clearness and unreality . There was life , with smothered passion and pride and pain in it , Mae was sure . So near to her that her voice could have arched the little distance easily , and yet so far away from her life and all that touched it . A gentleman attending the lady whispered to her . She bent her eyes on Mae , and met her glance with a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bero all that afternoon . She felt sure he would be there , and very soon she saw him among a crowd of officers sauntering slowly down the Corso . He looked up at the window opposite . The veiled lady leaned slightly forward and bowed and waved her white hand . Bero bowed . So did the other officers . Norman Mann and Eric excused themselves long enough to dash over to welcome their friends and then stayed on for a little chat . These young women were quite gorgeous in opera cloaks and tiny , nearly invisible , American flags tucked through their belts . They tossed confetti down on every one 's heads , and shouted  --  a little over-enthusiastically , but one can pardon even gush if it is only genuine . That was the question in this case . The horse race came ; and Mae went fairly wild . When it was over , every body prepared to go home . King Pasquino had virtually abdicated in favor of the Dinner Kings . Mae unclasped her tightly strained hands , clambered down from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the veiled lady , and came away . She rode home quietly with a big bouquet of exquisite blue violets in her hand . There was a rose on top and a fringe of maiden 's hair at the edge , and the bouquet was flung from Bero 's own hand up at the side window on the quiet Jesu e Maria , when everyone else but Mae was out on the Corso balcony . " It is dreadful to grow old , " said Mae , breaking silence , as the carriage clattered over the stony streets . " My dear , " expostulated Edith , " you surely do n't call yourself old . What do you mean ? " " I fancied I could take the Carnival as a child takes a big bonbon and just think with a smack of the lips , ' My ! how good this is . ' But here I am , wondering what my candy is made of all the time , and forgetting , except at odd moments , to enjoy myself for trying to separate false from true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of this stuff now ! I 'll remember that horse race , for there I did forget myself and everything but motion . How I would like to be a horse ! " And the volatile Mae seized the stems of her bouquet for whip and bridle and gave a little inelegant expressive click-click to her lips as if she were spurring that imaginary steed herself . Norman smiled . " We ca n't keep children for ever , even  --  " " The silliest of us ? " " Even the freshest and blithest . " " O , dear , that is like a moral to a Sunday-school book , " said Mae ; " do n't be goody-goody to-night . " " What bad thing shall I do to please your majesty , my lady Pasquino ? " " Waltz , " said Mae . So , after dinner , Edith and Eric sang , and Norman and Mae took to the poetry of motion as ducks take to water , and outdanced the singers . " Thank you , " said Mae , smiling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She pushed the brown hair back from her forehead and drew some deep breaths and leaned back in her chair , still tapping her eager , half-tired foot against the floor , while Norman fanned her with his handkerchief . This time Bero and the strange , veiled lady and Miss Hopkins and every other confusing thought floated off , and left them quite happy for  --  well  --  say for ten minutes . And ten minutes consecutive enjoyment is worth waiting for , old and cynical people say . * * * * * The next morning brought back all her troubles , with variations and complications , on account of some more misunderstood words . " I think , " said Mae , as she paused to blot the tenth page of a home letter , " that likes and dislikes are very similar , do n't you , Edith ? " Then , as Edith did not reply , she glanced up , and saw that her friend 's chair was occupied by Norman Mann . He looked up also and smiled . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your theory all the same . Only , as I am a man , I shall require you to show up your reasons . " " Well , I find that people who affect me very intensely either way , I always feel intuitively acquainted with . I know what they will think and how they will act under given conditions , and I believe we are driven into friendship or strong dislikes more by the force of circumstances than by  --  " " Elective affinities or any of that nonsense , " suggested Norman Mann . " Yes , " said Mae , nodding her head , and repeating her original statement under another form , as a sort of conclusion and proof to the conversation . " Yes , a natural acquaintance may develop into your best friend or your worst foe . " She started on page number eleven of her letter , dipping her pen deep into the ink-stand and giving such a particular flourish to her right arm , as to nearly upset the bouquet of flowers at her side . It was Bero 's gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fingers fell in among the soft flowers and touched something stiff . It felt like a little roll of paper . Indignantly and surprisedly he pulled it out . " What is this ? " he cried . Mae sprang forward , her cheeks aflame . " It is mine , " she said . " Did you put it here ? " asked Norman . " No . " " Then how do you know it is yours ? Is not this a carnival bouquet , idly tossed from the street to the balcony ? " Mae straightened to her utmost height which was n't lofty then and said hastily : " Mr. Mann , this is utterly absurd , and more . I am not a child , and if I catch an idly flung bouquet that holds idle secrets , I surely have a right to them . " She laughed hurriedly . " Come , give me my note ,  --  some Italian babble , I dare say . " Norman looked at her for a minute with a struggle in his heart and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . What was he thinking ? That the child was in danger . He had no doubt in his own mind now that the flowers and the note came from Bero and that Mae knew it . He held the paper crushed in his hand , while he looked at her . " I presume you will never forgive me , " he said , " but I must warn you , not as a mentor or even as a friend , " noticing her annoyed air , " but as one soul is bound to warn another soul , seeing it in danger . Take care of yourself , and there ! " And taking the crushed note between his two hands , he deliberately tore it asunder and threw the halves on the table before her . " And there , and there , and there ! " cried Mae , tearing the fragments impetuously , and scattering the sudden little snow flakes before him . Then , with a look of supreme contempt , she left the room . Norman looked down on the white heap that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , " he thought . " Little Mae Madden , little Mae Madden , I am so sorry for you , " repeated that excited bit of womankind to herself in the silence of her own room . " What wo n't they drive you to yet ? How dreadful they think you are ? And only last night we thought things were all coming around beautifully ! " And she looked at herself pityingly in the glass . A mirror is a dangerous thing for a woman who has come to pity herself . She sees the possibilities of her face too clearly . And Mae , looking into the mirror then , realized to an extent she never had before , that her eyes and mouth might be powerful friends to herself and foes to Norman Mann , if she so desired . And to-day she did so desire , and went down to the Carnival with as reckless and dangerous a spirit as good King Pasquino could have asked . The details of this day were very like those of the last . Norman and Eric vibrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ; confetti and flowers filled the air ; and up above it all , circled by her crown of misty , heavy lace-work , shone out the beautiful , wonderful face of the strange lady . She dropped smiles from under her long black lashes and from the corners of the rare , sweet mouth over the heads of the idlers to Mae , who looked up to catch them . There was a resting , almost saving influence , Mae 's excited soul believed , in the strange face ; and her eyes sought it constantly . She had been quite oblivious to the friends about this beautiful stranger , but once , as her eyes sought the Italian 's , she saw her arise with a sudden flash of light on her face , and hold out a white hand . A head bent over it , and as it lifted itself slowly , Mae saw once more the well-known features of the Signor Bero . She looked down toward the street quickly and a sharp pain filled her heart . She had lost her only friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he knew that wonderful woman , and if she flashed those weary , great eyes for him , how could he see or think of any other ? Moreover , it was very vexatious to have him there . If she smiled up at the girl , Bero might think she was watching him , trying to attract his notice . So Mae appeared very careless and played she did not see him at all , at all . Yet she could not resist looking up now and then for one of the rare smiles . They seemed like very far between " nows and thens " to Mae , averaging possibly a distance of four minutes apart . But that is as one counts time by steady clock-ticks , and not by heart-beats . Meanwhile , what could she do with her eyes ? They would wander once in a while over to the opposite balcony , at just such moments as when Norman Mann was picking up Miss Rae 's fan and receiving her thanks for it from under her drooped eyelids , or choosing a flower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann , " before she threw the rest to the winds and the passing gallants . As Mae grew reckless her eyes grew bright . There were few passers-by who were not attracted by the flash of those eyes . The sailor lads , as they trundled past in their ship on wheels , left the barrels of lime from which they had been pelting the pleasure-seekers to throw whole handfuls of flowers up to the Jesu e Maria balcony ; a set of hale young Englishmen picked out their prettiest bonbons for the same purpose ; and one elderly , pompous man , who drove unmasked and with staring opera glasses up and down the Corso , quite showered her with bouquets , which he threw so poorly , and with such a shaky old hand , that the street gamins caught them all except such as he craftily flung so that they might assuredly tumble back to the carriage again . And Mae , though she had felt the pleased gaze of a good many eyes before , had never quite put its meaning plainly to herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excited , joyous , but now she realized well that she was being admired , and she led on for victory ardently . She tossed back little sprays of flowers , or quiet bonbons , or now and then mischievously let drop a sprinkling of confetti balls through her half-closed fingers . To do this she drooped her hand low over among the balcony trimmings , following the soft shower with her eyes , as some straight soldier would wipe the tiny minie balls from his face and glance up to see where they came from . If he looked up once , he never failed to look again , and generally darted around the nearest corner to return with his offering , in the shape of flowers or other pretty carnival nonsense . Mae rather satisfied her conscience , which was tolerably fast asleep for the time being , at any rate , with the fact that she did n't smile at these strangers  --  she only looked ! Her pleasure was heightened by the knowledge that she was watched . If she glanced across quickly , Miss Rae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be gazing in the opposite direction in the most suspicious manner . From above her strange friend leaned over admiringly and once , as Mae looked joyously upwards , clapped her white hands softly together , while beyond her a tall figure stood motionless , Mae had pretended not to see Bero yet , but as the Italian applauded her in this gentle manner , her eyes sought his involuntarily . He was gazing very fixedly and rapturously down on her , without any apparent thought of the beautiful girl by his side . After that , Mae looked up often , in a glad , childlike way , for spite of this first lesson in wholesale coquetry , and the new conflict of emotions within her mind , she was enjoying herself with the utter abandon of her glad nature . Toward the close of the afternoon , the Italian was suddenly surrounded by a great mass of flowers , over which she waved her hand caressingly and pointed down at Mae . " For you , " the gesture seemed to say . The veiled lady appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen left the other window and its group of girls , and began the difficult task of attempting to toss the bouquets from their height down to Mae . This was rendered the more difficult as the Madden balcony was covered , and the best shots succeeded in landing their trophies on this awning , where they were speedily captured and drawn in by the occupants of the next flat , an ogre of an old woman and her hook-nosed daughter , who wore an ugly green dress and was otherwise unattractive . The entire Madden party became interested and stood looking on with the most encouraging smiles . The very last bouquet was vainly thrown , however , and gathered in by the ogre , when Bero suddenly appeared , a little behind the party in the window . The flowers in his hand were of the same specimens as those he had given Mae the day before , although different in arrangement . He lifted the bouquet quickly to his lips , so quickly that perhaps only Mae understood the motion , and flung it lightly forward . Mae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and caught it in her very finger tips . The party above bowed and applauded , as she raised the flowers triumphantly to her face . So the second day of the Carnival was a success , till they turned their backs on the Corso . In the carriage Mrs. Jerrold spoke gently but firmly to Mae . " Be a little more careful , dear ; do n't let your spirits carry you quite away during these mad days . " Mae smiled , but was silent . " What a strangely beautiful girl that was in the gallery opposite , " Edith said , a moment later . " I wonder if she is engaged to that superb man ; I fancied I had seen him before . Why , Mae , what in the world are you blushing at ? " For Mae 's face was scarlet . " Why , nothing , " replied Mae , redder yet ; " nothing at all . What do you mean ? " The same thought occurred to Edith and Albert . The officer was Mae 's chance acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is as well to be careful before getting up too sudden an acquaintance with your Italian girl . Take care of your eyes . " " Has it come to this ? " cried Mae , half jestingly , half bitterly . " Are nor my very eyes my own ? I shall feel , Albert , as if you were trying to bind me in that chain you threatened , " and Mae started : her fingers had felt another scrap of paper among the flowers , but she did not drop it from the carriage , as her first impulse was ; she held it tight and close in her warm right hand until she was fairly at home and safe in her own room . Then she opened and read in an Italian hand , " To my little Queen of the Carnival . " Could he have written that as he stood by the wonderful veiled lady , with her white mysterious beauty , with the purple shadows about her dark eyes , while she  --  and Mae looked in her glass again . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture for all that . Life and color and youth , a-tremble and a-quiver in every quick movement of her face , in the sudden lifting of the eyelids , the swift turn of the lips , the litheness and carelessness of every motion ; above and beyond all , the picture possessed that rare quality which some artist has declared to be the highest beauty , that picturesque charm which shines from within , that magnetic flash and quiver which comes and goes " ere one can say it lightens . " The veiled lady 's face was stranger , more mysterious , to an artistic or an imaginative mind ; but youth , and intense life , and endless variety usually carry the day with a man 's captious heart , and so Bero called Mae " My little Queen of the Carnival . " CHAPTER VIII . Mae 's good times were greatly dimmed after this by the thought that she was watched . The bouquets which came daily from Bero troubled her also not a little . They were invariably formed of the same flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So she stayed home from the Corso one day not long after , when she was in a particularly Corso-Carnival mood . She wandered helplessly about , restless and full of desire to be down at the balcony with the rest . And such a strange thing is the human heart , that it was Norman Mann 's face she saw before her constantly , and she found Miss Rae 's little twinkling sort of eyes far more haunting than those of her veiled friend . The rich life in Mae 's blood was surging in her veins and must be let off in some way . If she had had her music and a piano she might have thrown her soul into some great flood-waves of harmony . The Farnesina frescoes of Cupid and Psyche over across the Tiber would have helped her , but here she was alone , and so she did what so many " fervent souls " do  --  scribbled her heart out in a colorful , barbarous rhyme . Mae had ordinarily too good sense for this , too deep a reverence for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bow the knee , and loose the shoe from his foot , and tread softly . She did n't care for this to-day . She plunged boldly in , wrote her verse , copied it , sent it to a Roman English paper , and heard from it again two days later , in the following way . The entire party were breakfasting together , when Albert suddenly looked up from his paper and laughed . " Look here , " he cried . " Here is another of those dreadful imitators of the Pre-Raphaelite school . Hear this from a so-called poem in the morning 's journal : ' The gorgeous brown reds Of the full-throated creatures of song . ' " " I do n't see anything bad in that , " said Eric , helping himself to another muffin . " What is the matter with you ? " " Matter enough , " returned Albert . " Because their masters , sometimes , daub on colors with their full palettes and strong brushes , this feeble herd tag after them and flounder around in color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on , " shouted Eric , " he is our own brother , Mae , after all , you see . Fancy my Lord Utilitarian turning to break a lance in defence of beauty . Edith , you and the picture-galleries are to blame for this . " Mae had been paying great attention to her rolls and coffee , and very little apparently to the conversation , but she spoke eagerly now . " Their masters do not daub . They do hold palettes full of the strongest , richest colors , and dare lay them , in vivid flecks , on their canvas . They do not care if they may offend some modern cultivated eyes , used only to the invisible blues and shadowy greens and that host of cold , lifeless , toneless grays , of refined conventional art . They know well enough that their satisfying reds and browns and golds of rich , free nature will go to the beating hearts of some of us . " Mae had a way of dashing into conversation abruptly , and the Madden family had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party ate their breakfast placidly enough . " Mae 's right , " said Eric , a trifle grandly , " only , to change the figure of speech for one better fitted for the occasion , they may satiate , though they never starve you . But they are wonderfully fine , sometimes . O , bother , I never can quote , but there is something about ' I will go back to the great sweet mother . " ' " Or this , " suggested Mae , " ' And to me thou art matchless and fair As the tawny sweet twilight , with blended Sunlight and red stars in her hair . ' " " I love my masters , " continued this young enthusiast , " because they fling all rules aside , and cry out as they choose . It is their very heart 's blood and the lusty wine of life that they give you , not just a scrap of ' rosemary for remembrance ' and a soothing herb-tea made from the flowers of fancy they have culled from those much travestied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a lover of Wordsworth , who holds the ' Daffodils ' and ' Lucy ' as her chief jewels , and quotes the ' Immortality ' perpetually ! " cried Eric . " If any body ever wandered up and down those same fields of thought , by more intricate , labyrinthine passages and byways , I 'd like to know of him . Talk about soothing herbs , bless me , it 's hot catnip-tea , good and strong , that he serves up in half of his strings about  --  " " O , Eric , hush , " cried Mae , " I am afraid for you with such words on your lips . Think of Ananias . " " Before you children go wandering off on one of your poet fights , " broke in Albert , " let me take you to task , Mae , for stealing ; that lusty wine you talked of just now is in the poem ( ? ) I hold in my hand . " " Do read it to us , " said Edith , " and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL ON A SUMMER 'S DAY . " Far away the mountains rise , purpling and joyous , Through the half mist of the warm pulsing day , while nigh At hand gay birds hang swinging and floating And waving betwixt earth and sky , Ringing out from ripe throats A sensuous trickling of notes , That fall through the trees , Till caught by the soft-rocking breeze They are borne to the ears of the maiden . Her eyes wander after the sound , And glimpses she catches along Through green broad-leaved shadows , Through sunbeams gold-strong , Of the gorgeous brown reds of the full-throated creatures of song . One hand on her brown bosom rests , Rising and falling with every heart-beat Of the delicate , slow-swelling breasts . A lily , proud , all color of amber and wine , Waves peerless there , by right divine Queen o'er the moment and place . As the wind bends her coaxingly , Brushes softly the maiden 's white hand  --  That falls with an idle grace , Listlessly closed at her side  --  With a rippling touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer day , On the quiet shore of some peaceful bay . There she stands in the heavily-bladed grass , Under the trumpet-vine , Drinking long , deep , intoxicate draughts Of Nature 's lusty , live wine . There he sees her as he approaches ; Then pauses , as full on his ear There swells , on a sudden , loud and clear , A wonderful burst of song . A mad delicious glory ; a rainbow rhythm of life , Strong and young and free , a burst of the senses all astrife , Each one fighting to be first , While above , beyond them all , Loud a woman 's heart makes call . " " Now , fire ahead , " said Eric , " get your stones ready . Mrs. Jerrold , pray begin ; let us put down this young parrot with her ' lusty , live wine . ' " " Her ? " exclaimed Edith . " Him , you mean . " " Not a bit of it ; a woman wrote that , did n't she ? " Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced at Mae to discover her opinion . There was a look of secret amusement in her face , and a dim suspicion entered his mind , which decided him to watch her closely . " Well , " said Mrs. Jerrold , " I will be lenient . You children may throw all the stones . It is not poetry to my taste . There 's no metre to it , and I should certainly be sorry to think a woman wrote it . " " Why ? " asked Mae , quickly , almost commandingly . Norman glanced at her . There was a tiny rosebud on each cheek . " Because , " replied Mrs. Jerrold , " it is too  --  too what , Edith ? " " Physical , perhaps , " suggested Edith . " It is a satyr-like sort of writing , " suggested Norman . " I should advise this person , " said Edith  --  " To keep still ? " interrupted Eric . " No , to go to work ; that is what he or she needs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suppose she  --  or he  --  is young , does n't know what to do , is a traveler , like ourselves , for instance . " " There are plenty of benevolent schemes in Rome , I am sure , " said Edith , a trifle sanctimoniously . " And there 's study , " said Albert , " art or history . Think what a chance for studying them one has here . Yes , Edith is right  --  work or study , and a general shutting up of the fancy is what this mind needs . " " I disagree with you entirely , " said Norman with energy . " She needs play , relaxation , freedom . " Then he was sorry he had said it ; Mae 's eyes sparkled so . " She needs , " said Eric , pushing back his chair , " to be married . She is in love . That 's what 's the matter . Read those two last lines , Albert : ' While above , beyond them all , Loud a woman 's heart makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O , wise young man , " laughed Edith . But Mae arose . The scarlet buds in her cheeks flamed into full-blown roses . " There speaks the man , " she cried passionately , " and pray does n't a woman 's heart ever call for anything but love  --  are n't life and liberty more than all the love in the world ? Oh ! " and she stopped abruptly . " Well , we have wasted more time than is worth while over this young , wild gosling , " laughed Albert . " Let us hope she will take our advice . " Mae shook her head involuntarily . There was a smile on Norman Mann 's lips . " Here 's health and happiness to the poor child at any rate , " he said . " He pities me , " thought Mae , " and I hate him . " But then she did n't at all . Mae wandered off to the kitchen , as usual , that day , for another of Lisetta 's stories . The Italian , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transformed in her imaginative mind into a veritable improvisatore . Talila was not by any means the only heroine of the little tales . Mae had made the acquaintance of many youths and maidens , and to-day Lisetta , after thinking over her list of important personages , chose the Madre Ilkana as the heroine of the occasion . Mae had already heard one or two amusing incidents connected with this old mother . " I am sure she has a cousin in America , " she asserted to-day , before Lisetta began , " for I know her well . She knits all the time , and is as bony as a ledge of rocks , and her eyes are as sharp as her knitting-needles , and her words are the sharpest of all . Her name is Miss Mary Ann Rogers . Is she like the Madre Ilkana ? " Lisetta shook her head . " No , no , Signorina , La Madre is as plump and round as a loaf of bread , and as soft as the butter on it . She has five double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has stiff bristles , like a man 's , growing on them , and her knitting-needles and her words are all sharp as la Signora Maria Anne R-o-o-g-eers , I doubt not . But her eyes ! Why , Signorina , she has the evil eye ! " This Lisetta said in a whisper , while Giovanni shrugged his shoulders bravely , and little Roberto cuddled closer to Mae . " Yes , " continued Lisetta , " and so no one knows exactly about her eyes , not daring to look directly into them , but as nearly as I can make out they are black , and have a soft veil over them , so that you would think at first they were just about to cry , when suddenly , fires creep up and burn out the drops , and leave her hot and angry and scorching . " She must be terrible , " cried Mae , with a sudden shrinking . " She IS terrible , " replied Lisetta , " but then she is very clever . You will see if she is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " and Lisetta laughed , and showed her own one double chin , with its two little round dimples . Then she smoothed down her peasant apron , bade Giovanni leave off pinching Roberto , and commenced . " The government hates the banditti , " began Lisetta , wisely , " and indeed it should , " and she looked gravely at Giovanni , " for they are very wild men , who live reckless bad lives , and steal , and are quite dreadful . But we poor , we do not hate them as the government does , because they are good to us , and do not war with us , and sometimes those we love join them  --  a brother or a cousin , perhaps , "  --  and Lisetta 's black eyes filled , and her lip quivered . " As for the Madre , she loved them all , and said they were all relations . " At this time of which I speak , the soldiers were chasing and hunting the banditti very hard , and they had been compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have died , had it not been for the peasants , who supplied them with food . Small parties of the bandits would come out for it . There were two very powerful men of the banditti , who were skirmishing about in this way , not far from the Madre Ilkana 's , when they saw two soldiers , in advance of their company , approaching them . The banditti were not afraid for themselves , but they wanted to get back to their friends with the bread and meat , so instead of fighting , they fled to the Madre . She took them in , and bade them be sure they were safe with her . But the soldiers had caught sight of them , and they stopped at every house and enquired and searched for them ; and so , soon they came to the Madre Ilkana 's . They charged her in the name of the government to give up the banditti in her house . The Madre kept on with her knitting , and told them there were only her two sons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one . " ' Ha ! ' laughed one of the soldiers , ' mothers must give up their children to King Death , and it is He who wants your bad boys . ' Upon which , the Madre arose and cursed them . Curses are common with us , Signorina , but not La Madre 's curses . She talked of their mothers to them , and of their sons , and of the Holy Virgin and child , and she cursed them in the name of all these , if they dared steal her children from her . They should take them over her old dead body , she swore , though her knitting-needles and her eyes were her only weapons , and then she turned her eyes full upon them , with the evil spirit leering and laughing out of them , and the soldiers , one of whom was an officer , fell on their knees and shook like leaves , and prayed her to forgive them ; saying that they were sure her boys were good sons , and no banditti . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and in rushed the banditti , armed with great knives . They caught and bound the two soldiers , and took away their weapons , and jumped on their horses , and fled . " La Madre took her knitting again , and sat down quietly by the side of the bound men , until a half hour later some twelve more soldiers cantered up . As they rode by , all the people came to their doorways , and the soldiers stopped and asked if they had seen two horsemen . Then La Madre gathered up her knitting and went quietly out into the crowd . She made a low bow to the man with the biggest feather in his cap , and she told him her story . ' I have two sons , ' she said , ' whom I love so well . ' Then she told how the soldiers mistook her sons for banditti , and tried to take them from her in her own house . ' Though I am old , I have a good life among my friends and neighbors here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I said to my sons : Go , my boys , your mother will die for you . But I did it . I bade them bind the soldiers and steal away . Then I sat guarding the men till you came . You will find them safe in my little house there . Now , take me to prison  --  kill me , but look in my eyes first , and then , whoever lays a hand on me , take La Madre Ilkana 's curse . ' " And the people all swore that there were two snakes coiled up in La Madre 's eyes then , and they hissed , and struck out with their fiery tongues , and the crowd fell on their knees , and the neighbors all set up a great shout of ' La Madre Ilkana , ' so that they quite drowned the voice of the man with the big feather . " " Is that all ? " asked Mae , as Lisetta paused . " What did the soldiers do ? " " O , they hired a passing carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castellamare , and they all cantered off , without saying a word to La Madre , and when they had turned a corner of the road , she began to laugh . O , how she laughed ! All the people laughed with her , and the children crowed and the dogs barked , for the rest of that whole day . " And a neighbor who passed La Madre 's at midnight , said she was laughing out loud then . " CHAPTER IX . " Signorina . " Mae was passing down the long hall when she heard the whisper . She turned and saw Lisetta , with shining eyes and pink cheeks , standing at her side . Her pretty plump shoulders were only half covered , and the array of colors about her transformed her into a sort of personified rainbow . This was Lisetta 's Carnival attire , and very proud she was of it . " Why , Lisetta , what do you want , and what makes you so happy ? " called Mae . " O , Signorina , the cousins are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fill Maria 's rooms quite full . It is very gay out there , and they all want to see you , Signorina . I have told them how well you speak Italian and how you love Italy , and to-night , they say , you shall be one of us . So come . " All this while Lisetta had been leading Mae swiftly down the corridor , until as she said these last words , she reached and pushed open the door . A great shout of laughter greeted Mae 's ear , and a pretty picture met her eyes  --  gaily decked youths and maidens clapping their hands and chattering brightly , while the padrona was just entering the opposite doorway , bearing two flasks of native wine , and some glasses . " ' T is genuine Orvieto , " she called out , and this raised another shout . Then she caught sight of Mae and bowed low towards her . " Here is the little foreign lady , " she cried , and a dozen pairs of big black eyes were turned eagerly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said in pleading tones , " O , pray do not call me the ' little foreign lady ' now . Play I am as good an Italian as my heart could wish I were . " This speech was received with new applause , and the padrona handed around the glasses saying : " We must drink first to the health of our new Italian . May she never leave us . " " Yes , yes , " called Lisetta , lifting high her glass . " Yes , yes , " cried all , and Mae drank as heartily as any of them . Then she shook her head and gazed very scornfully down on her dark , stylish clothes . " I am not thoroughly Italian yet , " she cried . " Here , and here , and here , " cried one and another , proffering bits of their own gay costumes , and in a moment Mae had received all sorts of tributes  --  a string of red beads from one , a long sash from another , a big-balled stiletto from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleanings to trim herself up into at least a grotesque and un-American Carnival figure . Then the Italians with their soft tongues began to flatter her . " How lovely the Signorina would look in a contadina costume  --  the home costume , " said Lisetta gravely . " It is so beautiful , is it not ? " And then those two or three privileged ones , who had seen Lisetta 's home , went into ecstasies over its many charms . Lisetta , next to the Signorina , was the heroine of the occasion . She was from a distance , was handsome and clever , and the padrona gave glowing accounts of her full purse , and two pretty donkeys , and house by the sea . They had a very gay time . Such singing , and then dancing and frolicking , and such a feline softness in all their gaiety . None of the German or Saxon bullying , and barking and showing of teeth ; in no wise a game of dogs , which always ends in a fight ; but a truly kittenish play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very softest paws , and a rich , gentle curve of motion , inexpressibly witching to our little northern maiden , who was fast losing her head amid it all . Mae did not reflect that felines are treacherous . She only drew a quick , mental picture of the parlor on the other side of the hall , which she compared to this gay scene . Mrs. Jerrold filling in dull row after row of her elaborate sofa cushion , which was bought in all its gorgeousness of floss fawn 's head and bead eyes , Edith and Albert hard at work over their note books , or reading up for the sights of to-morrow , Mr. Mann with his open book also , all quiet and studious . Eric , alone , might be softly whistling , or writing an invitation to Miss Hopkins to climb up St. Peter 's dome with him , or to visit the tomb of Cecilia Metella , or the Corso , as the case might be , while here  --  As Mae reached this point in her musings , the Italians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join them . Two or three peasants from the country south had wandered up with the world to Rome , for Carnival time , then for Lent . They had brought with them their pipes and zitterns . In the mornings they made short pilgrimages , playing in front of the shrines about the city , or roaming out on the campagna to some quiet church . In the evening time they wandered up the stone stairways of the great houses , and paused on the landings before the different homes . If all was still they passed on , but if there was noise , laughter , sound of voices , they laid aside their penitential manner , and struck into dance music , flashing their velvety eyes , and striking pretty attitudes , aided greatly by their Alpine hats and sheep-skins and scarlet-banded stockings . Three of these peasants had appeared at the padrona 's doorway , by a sort of magic . They bowed and smiled , and commenced to play . Every one sprang up . " Dance , " cried they all , and flew for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , and having the most willing and nimble of feet , she soon toned and coaxed the fashionable waltz on which she had started into accord with the more elastic footsteps of her companion . There was something in the serpentine , winding and unwinding motion , the coaxingness of the steps , that was deliciously intoxicating to Mae . The color came to her cheeks , the smile played around her lips , and when she paused to breathe , she found the Italians showing their white teeth , and clapping their brown hands in her honor , while the tallest musician gazed at her from the dark doorway , with the rapt reverence he gave to all things beautiful and thrilling . She was a new song to him . " The Signorina is the veriest Italian of us all , " cried Lisetta . " She honors our Italy , " called Mae 's last partner . " Her feet are those of a chamois , " said one from the north . " Nay , she flies , " replied another . They all spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in fulsome flattery in English , were delicate and stimulating as they slid in soft Italian from their full , red lips . Mae tossed her head carelessly , but she sipped the praises and found them sweet . " Now for the Tarantella , " said the padrona , so Lisetta shook her tambourine wildly , and the very prettiest girl of them all , and a big , brown boy ( happy fellow ! ) began that coquettish bit of witchery . The pretty girl tripped around and around and wreathed her arms over her head , and the boy knelt appealingly and sprang up passionately again and again , until the clock struck ten , and the party broke up . Mae shook hands with a new friend . He was a stone-cutter , and was soon to be married , and he poured out all his plans and hopes into her sympathetic ears , and told of his pretty bride to be , and of her dowry . Mae , in turn , sent her love to the happy bride , and took a charm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , and she sent it with a hope that some day they might both sail over to America . At which the bridegroom shook his head very decidedly , and kissed Mae 's hand and bowed himself out . Then , after she had disrobed her of her borrowed plumes , all the others kissed her hand and bowed themselves out , and Roberto and Giovanni awaked , and got up from the corner , and stood on their heads and hallooed as loud as ever they pleased , and the evening was over , and Lisetta and the padrona and the boys and Mae were alone . " Oh , oh , oh , " cried Mae , " how perfectly perfect . Do you always have such good times as this ? " " At home , yes , " replied Lisetta , folding her hands and smiling . " We have many a play-day on the bay of Naples . " Then she roused herself : " Good night , Signorina , " she said , " keep your ears open . " Mae had barely reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heard music in the street below . She raised her window ; Eric and Norman lifted the parlor window at the same moment , " Come in here , " they cried . So in she ran , took a place between them , and they silently listened to the maskers ' serenade . The musicians sang at first the gayest of tunes , but suddenly , by some subtile impulse , they changed to quieter minor airs , and sang songs full of tears and passion and love and tenderness . Then they silently turned to go . Norman Mann touched Mae on the shoulder . He handed her a bunch of Carnival flowers . They were Bero 's , but she flung them unhesitatingly into the street , leaning far out to watch the singers catch them and separate them in the moonlight . They called out loud their thanks  --  their " Grazie , grazie , " as sweet as any lily just broken from its stem  --  and as they turned to go Mae saw that each one was decked with a sprig from the bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Only the tallest musician , who walked somewhat apart , carried his flower tightly clasped in his hand , and now and again he raised it to his lips . He probably dreamed over it that night , and played his dream out in a gentle , wistful , minor adoration before the Madonna at the Quattro Fontane the next morning . O , the dreams and poems and songs without words that drop into our lives from the sudden flash of stranger eyes , or the accidental touch of an unknown hand , or the tender warmth of a swift smile ! And if our eyes , our touch , our smiles may only have floated off in like manner  --  as dreams and poems and melody  --  to give added rhythm and harmony to other lives . Mae drew a long sigh , one of those delightful , contented sighs , with a smile wrapped up in it . " I am glad you are so happy , " said Norman Mann , smiling down at her . When Norman spoke like that Mae felt only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudges against him ; she would have liked just at that moment to have the world stand quite still . This was very different from the ordinary Mae . Usually she longed that it might go faster , and would put her pink and white ear quite close to the brown earth to hear if it were turning as swiftly as ever it could . " I like it to hurry , hurry , hurry , " said eager , restless Mae . " I love to live quickly and see what 's coming next . " But Mae was not in that mood to-night . She leaned out of the window all untroubled . If the sun could stand still off behind the world  --  as he is now  --  and the moon could stand still right before us  --  as she is now  --  and we could stay right here , we three . Why , no , Eric has gone in and is walking up and down nervously . Thus Mae thought , and was quiet . " What are you thinking about ? " asked Norman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she reached the words " and we . " Then her eyes fell , and she paused . " Yes , " replied Norman , " I have the same feeling , " and there was a great deal more on the very tippest tip of his tongue . But Mae turned her face from him slightly ; the moon stole softly behind the flimsiest little cloud that any one could have seen through , and he paused , silly fellow . These slight withdrawals , that should have urged him on , deceived him . He stopped , and then he remembered Mae 's past doings , her recklessness , her waywardness . It was not time yet to speak what he had in his heart to say , and what quivered on his tongue . So he only asked abruptly : " You will go with me to-morrow night for one of your gayest frolics , will you not ? We will go down on the Corso for all the Mocoletti fun . I am very anxious to be in another of your good times . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " I am so glad . I should delight in it . It will be almost too good . " She stopped abruptly again , and gave him a quick , soft glance , just as the moon rode triumphantly out from behind the filmy , flimsy veil , and shone full down on her eyes and hair . It fell on a bright , round , glistening ball , tucked in among some half curls behind her ear . " What is that ? " asked Norman . " That "  --  Mae put up her hand and drew it out  --  " that is my stiletto . I forgot to give it back to Lisetta . It is pretty , is n't it ? " Norman took the long needle from her hand and looked at it . " It is not as pretty as the flowered stiletto . Why did n't you get one of those ? " " Why , do you not know that those are not worn by free maidens ? They are one of the added glories of a matron . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means liberty . " And she plunged the steel tremulously back into her hair . " We had better go in now ; this night air is bad for you . " The moon blazed scornfully down on Norman Mann as he said this . She had had a wide experience , and had rarely seen such a stupid , cowardly fellow , so she thought . Yet , after all , Norman only acted in self-defense . Here was a girl by his side who gloried , as it seemed to him , in her freedom , and that being so , he must get away as soon as possible from that window , that moon , and that little girl . " Well , Norman , " cried Eric , advancing eagerly as they turned from the window , " when do you really suppose it will come off ? " " Suppose what will come off ? " inquired Mae . " O , I forgot you were here . Well , do n't tell any one else . Norman is to fight a duel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gasped Mae . " You have but a poor opinion of my powers , " laughed Norman , " although the German looked a veteran duellist from his scars . His face was fairly embroidered or fancy-worked with red lines . A sort of hem in his nose , and tucks and seams all over his cheeks . Notice my knowledge in this line , Miss Mae . You ought to be ashamed , Eric , to have spoken of it . " " Is n't it all a joke ? " asked Mae , pushing her head out of the window again , to hide the sudden white terror in her face . " I did n't suppose Americans fought duels when they were off pleasuring . " This sentence Mae meant to pass as a gay , light , easy speech , to prove that Norman Mann and a duel were not such a very dreadful combination to her feminine mind . " NO , it is no joke , but dead earnest , " replied Eric . " I am to be his second , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all over . " " All over ! "  --  a sudden vision of Norman lying white and motionless with a deep wound across his soft , brown temple . Mae closed her eyes . " I suppose I might as well tell you about it , " said Norman , " now that this stupid Eric has let out about the affair , although it may never come to anything . I was dining to-night at a little restaurant on the Felice , a quiet , homelike place , which a good many artists , and especially women , frequent . There is a queer , crazy little American , who thinks herself a painter , and is a harmless lunatic , who is a regular guest at this restaurant . Everybody smiles at her absurdities , but is ready enough to be kind to the poor old creature . To-night , however , I was hardly seated when in came a party of Germans , all in mask and Carnival costume . One of them was arrayed in exact imitation of this old lady . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dangling fingers , such as she invariably wears . These he waved around mockingly and seating himself opposite her , he followed her every motion . The ladies at the same table rose and went away . Then up gets this big ruffian and sits down on the edge of the old lady 's chair . I could stand it no longer , but jumping in front of him , showered down all the heavy talk I knew in German , Italian and French , subsiding at last into my mother tongue , with her appropriate epithets . Having sense enough left to know that he could not reap the full benefit of English , I pulled out my card , wrote my address on it , and threw it on the table , and I rather think that was understood . There 's no country that I have heard of where men do n't know what ' we 'll fight this out , means . ' " Norman was striding up and down the room now almost as restlessly as Eric had done , but he seated himself again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very simple , Miss Mae  --  mere business . I turned to go away , and one of his friends approached me to ask for the name of my second . I gave Eric 's here . He bowed and said : ' He shall hear from me this evening , and I came home . The evening has advanced to midnight , but not a word yet . No , it is not quite eleven , I see . " " You 'll have the choice of weapons if they challenge you , " said Eric ; " you 'll take pistols , I suppose ? Just think of my living to really assist in a ' **26;41;TOOLONG ' affair ! " " I daresay it will be coffee for two , served separately , and with no thought of pistols . I do n't really believe it will come to anything . There are ways of getting out of it , " said Norman , lighting a cigarette . " Will you refuse to fight ? " asked Mae , and her heart , which had been white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quick , red scorn . Even the Huguenot maiden would , after all , have despised her lover if he had quietly allowed her to tie the white handkerchief to his arm . Believe it , she loved him far , far better as she clung to him , pressed closely to his warm , living heart , because she realized in an agony that his honor was strong enough to burst even the tender bonds of her dear love , and that he would break from her round arms to rush into that ghostly , ghastly death-embrace on the morrow , at the dreadful knell of St. Bartholomew bells . Suppose he had yielded . Suppose we saw him in the picture standing quietly , unresistingly , as her soft fingers bound the white badge , that meant protection and life , to his arm . Would not she , as well as he , have known that it was a badge of cowardice , and that he wore a heart as white ? And afterwards , would she have loved the living man , breathing in air heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she worshiped the dead man , whose cold body rested forever down deep in mother earth 's brown , soft bosom , but whose very life of life swelled the great throng of heroes and martyrs who have closed their own eyes upon life 's pictures , that those pictures might shine clearer and brighter to other eyes ? If the man had yielded , and the picture showed him thus , would we see the Huguenot lovers adorning half the houses of the land ? Most often they are found in that particular corner of the home belonging to some maiden  --  that sacred room of her own , where she prays her prayers , and lives her most secret life . I have often wondered at the many girls who hang that especial picture over their fire-places . It must be a case of unconscious ideality . They realize that love must be so subject to honor that heart-strings would break for the sake of that honor , if need be , even though the harmonious love-song of two hearts is hushed ; and what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor for the world  --  those wonderful life-songs that we all know ? One of them sings itself so loudly to me now , over ages of romance and history , that I must let my simple story wait and give way to it for a minute . There was a man who lived once . If God did not create him , Homer did . The Oracle told him that the first man who put foot on the Trojan shores would die . He knew this before he started on his voyage for Greece . He left a wife and home behind him , whom he dearly loved . I wonder if he used to pace the deck of the rich barge , and listen to the men chatting around him , and smile as they planned of returning , proud and victorious , to their homes and their wives . All the while under his smile he knew he was to die , not in the glory of fight , although his sword swung sharp and bright at his side , in any thrilling fashion , to be sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the heavy barge sailed on , and at last land came in sight . I wonder if his heart was full when he saw it ? Did he remember his wife and his home ? Did he feel his life strong within him , and eager as a battle-horse , as he neared the land where wars were to be fought , and glories won ? All the while his heart was firm . He stood the very foremost of them all , as they drifted quite in to the green , green shore . Around him men talked and laughed , and the sun shone . He may have laid his hand commandingly on some youthful shoulders and pushed back the eager boy who longed to bound first into this new world . He may have saved him thus from death for life . We do not know . All we do know is , that with his own brave feet he marched ahead of them all , solemnly , smilingly , with the oracle in his heart . From the vessel to the green , green shore  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge to the Trojan land , alive . Does he turn to look at his comrades and off eastwards , beyond homewards , with a great thrill before he falls dead ? We do not know . All we do know is , that WE thrill now as we see him leaping to his death , even over this gap of ages , through these shadows of unreality . We have left Mae flashing scorn at Norman for a long while , a much longer while than she really needed for her flash , for Norman 's angry start , violent exclamation , and indignant glance convinced her of her mistake before he answered her . " I refuse to fight  --  I  --  Great  --  I beg your pardon , Miss Mae , but of course I 'll fight . I only hope the fellow is n't such a craven as to let it blow over . However , I strongly suspect policy and his friends will keep him from it . For my part , I would like to break my lance for the poor woman . Any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth a bit , I suppose . " " That 's your idea of life ? " queried Eric , rather gravely . " My efforts are all to push Eric Madden on his way a bit . " " And I have n't any idea ; I just live , " said Mae , " like a black and tan dog . I wish I were one . Then the only disagreeable part of me , my conscience , would be out of the way . But what has all this to do with the duel ? " " That has something to do with it , I fancy , " said Eric , rising and leaving the room hastily , as the bell rang . " No , stay where you are . I 'll receive him in the little salon . " Mae rose and walked to the fireside , and looked down on the two small logs of wet wood that sizzled on the fire-dogs . The faint , red flame that flickered around them , looked sullen and revengeful , she thought , as she watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the room . What was Norman thinking ? What was the stranger saying out in the little salon ? No , no , she would not think thus . She would repeat something to quiet herself  --  poetry  --  what should it be ? Ah , here is Eric . It was Eric . His face was flushed . His lip curled . " Coward ! craven ! " he exclaimed , " Coward , craven . " " Well , tell us about it , " said Norman , coolly , but a wave of color rushed over his face . " O , palaver and stuff . Somebody 's dreadfully ill  --  dying , I believe , and that somebody is wife , or mother , or son to this brute you challenged . He 's got to go , the coward . If you are ever in his vicinity again , and send him your card , he will understand it and meet you at such place and with such weapons as you prefer . Bah  --  too thin ! " and Eric concluded with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped hands which rested on the mantel-piece . How strangely everything looked ; even the dim fire had a sort of aureole about it , as her eyes rested there again ; but when one looks through tears , all things are haloed mistily . Norman turned and looked at Mae , as Eric walked impatiently about . She did not move or speak . He walked to her side , and stood looking down at her . The faint mist in her left eye was forming into a bright , clear globe as large as any April raindrop . Mae knew this , and knew it would fall , unless she put up her hand and brushed it away , and that would be worse . The color rose to her cheeks as she waited the dreadful moment . She was perfectly still , her hands clasped before her , her head bent , as the crystal drop gathered all the mist and halo in its full , round embrace , and pattered down upon the third finger of her left hand  --  her wedding-ring finger  --  and lay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooped and laid his hand over it . " You are glad , then ! " " I should be sorry to have you die , " said Mae , but her dimples and blushes and drooping eye-lids said , oh , a great deal more . " Good night , " she fluttered , and ran off . CHAPTER X. Mae dreamed happy dreams that night , and awoke with a smile on her lips . She dressed with the greatest care , put a touch of the color Norman liked at her throat , and fastened a charm he had given her to her bracelet . Still , she loitered on her way to the breakfast-room , and when she seated herself at the table , a sudden embarrassment made her keep her eyes on her plate , or talk to Eric , or Edith , or any one but Norman . Yet she was perfectly conscious of his every word and motion . She knew he only took two cups of coffee instead of three , and that he helped her to mandarins  --  a fruit of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a plate heaping with golden untouched balls before her . After breakfast , she felt a great desire to run away , so she asked Eric to take her to the Capitol , and leave her there for a time . " I want to see something solid this morning , that has lasted a long while , and the marbles will do me good . " Yes , Eric would take her at once . Would she go and get her hat ? She went for it , and scolded herself all the time for running away when she wanted to stay home . Yet , after all , who dares put out one 's hand to grasp the moon when at last it approaches ? No woman , at any rate . There was a malicious sort of teasing pleasure in running away from Norman , mingled with a shrinking modesty ; and , besides , he knew the way to the Capitol , if he chose to follow , and knew she was to be there alone . So , on the whole , Mae went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that celebrated room , immortalized by the Gladiator , the Faun and the Antinous , scales seemed to fall from her eyes and a weight from her heart . Life meant something more than the mere play she delighted in , or the labor she despised . She took it in in this way . She realized , first of all , the enduringness of the marbles . They had stood , they will stand , for thousands of years . What have stood ? What will stand ? Idle blocks of stone , without form or meaning , or simply three beautiful shapes ? No ; three souls , thinks Mae , three real people , and she looks at the abiding faun , freedom and joy of the Satyr , the continual sentimental sadness of the Antinous , and the perpetual brave death-struggle of the Gladiator . They are living on now , and touching our hearts . Their mute lips open other eloquent mouths to speak for them . Hawthorne and Byron tell us what the Faun 's soul , what the Gladiator 's soul , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily repeats the story the Antinous whispers in his bent , beautiful head , the vanitas vanitatum that our own hearts whisper , when we drop earnest life for voluptuous pleasures . The Faun may smile , although life is only one long play-day in green fields and woods , because he is a Faun . The man must sigh , when he has drained his wine-cups and laughed his heartiest laugh , and wakes to another morning , because he is a man . The cry of humanity echoes in our souls . We can not stifle it ; we may hush it , and follow our idle joys , but the day comes when we bend our head with Antinous and Solomon and the rest of them , and sigh out our vanitas , vanitas also , in the great weary chorus . No need , alas ! for a Hawthorne , or Byron , or even a Shakspeare to interpret what the Antinous says for us . Our own hearts do it . Mae caught the spirit of all this , as her eyes roamed out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang . She saw the aqueducts bounding , even in their ruin , arch after arch , to the treasure house of the waters . " They never can reach it , now , " thinks she , " never . Suppose they can not , is not the spirit the same ? " And now Mae is ready for the sudden light that dawns on her soul . She springs to her feet . She is alone in the room with the marble men ; and they are quiet ; even the Gladiator bites back his last groan once more . " The Eternal City , " shouts Mae ; " I know what it means at last . Oh ! Rome , Rome , I love you ! " and she rests her hand on the windowsill , and looks out on Rome . " Why , it is like a resurrection morn . Ruins ? Yes , it is all ruins , dry bones , and great dead in dust ; but there is something more . I only saw that graveyard part of it before ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds , and words , and thoughts , and prayers , " cries Mae , exultantly . " Why , they are here ; not dead , like the rest , but alive , all around us . Oh ! Rome , Rome , forgive me ! " Now , this might have seemed absurd to the custode , or some other people , if they had put their head in at the door just then . But they did n't ; and , really , it was not absurd . I can not believe that this small Mae Madden is the only being who has had a swift , brilliant awakening from the first surface , depressing thoughts of Rome  --  an awakening to the living spirits which float proudly over their vacant shells that lie below the old pavements . Once you do feel the strong , rich Roman life about you , the decay , the ruin float off on the dust of the ages , before the glorified breath of proud matrons and stately warriors , who step over the centuries to walk by your side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandeur , and nobility , and bravery , and civilized them a bit . They form into pageants for you , and fill the baths and the palaces , but never crowd the Coliseum for the dreadful contests , unless , maybe , for an occasional bull-fight  --  some great , horrid , big bull which would be killed at market to-morrow at any rate  --  and even that is as you please . It is wonderful , truly , once we discern the spirits around us , to notice what a miraculous place Rome is ; how the intervening years of purgatorial flames have turned old Nero himself into a fairly benevolent , soft old gentleman , even though his estates have crumbled to such an extent that he may put his golden palace into the head of his cane , which he always carries now , since his chariots have gone away . Where are they ? Caligula has even made it up with his mother-in-law , and you reflect with joy on that fact , as the two flit by your mind 's eye , hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who HAVE awakenings . The rest of " our party " may sit at Spillman 's and eat coffee-cakes and sip Lachrymae Christi , while we walk alone through the Coliseum , with the crowd of old heathen . They stop , every one , at the iron cross in the middle , reared over their carnage and mad mirth , and press their lips to it now . The centuries have done that . We only , alas ! stand gazing mournfully , doubtingly . " Will you have another coffee-cake ? " says some one , and we remember that we are at Spillman 's also . And , indeed , we might be more sensible to stay with our party always ; eat cakes , drink wine , laugh at the old world , vaunt the new , read Baedeker and the Bible , say our orthodox Protestant prayers , with a special " Lead us not into Romanism " codicil , and go to bed , and dream of our own golden houses , Paris dresses , and fat letters of credit . At any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , a surging rush of reverence for Rome , and makes no doubt in her own mind , to this day , that the Faun laughed with her in her joy . In this exalted frame of mind , she wandered down through the long halls . She was passing from the room of the Caesars when she heard Norman 's voice . So he had come for her with Eric . She had half fancied he would . She paused to listen . It was a ringing elastic voice , in no wise lagging in speech , with a certain measurement in its tones , as if he weighed his words and thoughts , and gave them out generously , pound for pound , a fair measure which our grandmother 's recipes approved . Mae smiled to herself . " He has loved Rome always . He caught the spirit of it long ago . He will be glad to know I have found it also . I wish "  --  and Mae sighed a scrap of a sigh , and looked down at the toe of her boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mae was truly in a very tender mood to-day . I think if Norman had caught sight of her face at that moment , he would have sent Eric off , and right there and then , before all the Caesars  --  why what is the matter ? The face contracts as if in pain . What was the cause ? She had heard Norman say , " I 'm afraid I was wrong , but I never meant anything by my attentions to the girl , Eric . It was really on your account . I never liked Miss Rae particularly . I was thrown much with her because you and I have been together constantly , but she does not grow on me . I never expected you should consider me as her necessary cavalier always . As for this evening , I am engaged to Miss Mae , so that settles this matter , but I wish that hereafter you would not get me into such scrapes . " Poor Mae ! she leaned against Nero  --  or was it Caracalla ?  --  surely somebody very hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . For she had heard wrong , had misunderstood Miss Rae for Miss Mae , and supposed it was of herself that he spoke . Her heart stood still for the minutest part of a minute . Then she turned softly and quickly , went back to the Gladiator 's room , left word with the custode for Eric that she was n't well , and had gone home alone , walked off down the Capitol steps , took a cab and drove away . At home she had a long , earnest talk with Lisetta , after which Lisetta had a short , brisk talk with the padrona . " It means money , " she said , " and I can play I did it for the Signorina 's safety . " Later , Mae wrote a brief , polite note to Norman Mann . She was ill , had gone to bed , and would n't be able to go to the Corso with him to-night . She tried to stifle the hot anger and other emotions out of the words , and read and re-read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and polite . At last she tore them up and sent this instead : MY DEAR MR . MANN :  --  Such a pity that we are not to have our fun , after all . Yet , perhaps it is just as well . I should be very speedily without my light , and the cry of " senza moccolo , senza moccola , " must be very dispiriting . Have a good time right along . Good-bye  --  good-bye . Of course , if Mae had not been beside herself with conflicting emotions , she would never have sent this note , or repeated the good-bye in that echoing , departing sort of way . Norman Mann knit his brow as he read it . " What is the row now ? " he thought . " What a child it is , anyway . She has had the mocoletti fun in her mind since we left America , and now she throws it away . Well , there 's no help for it ; I 'm booked for Miss Rae . I 'll get Eric to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's afraid of me , because she cried last night , afraid I took that big tear for more than it was worth . " Mae , " said Eric , entering her room an hour later , " Norman feels dreadfully that you are not able to go to-night , and so do I. I suppose those wretched marbles did it this morning . Could n't you possibly come ? " " No , " replied Mae , rising on her elbow , " but sit down a moment , Eric . " " How pretty you look , " said her brother , seating himself by her side . Mae 's hair was tumbled in brown waves that looked as if they could n't quite make up their minds to curl , much as they wanted to ; her eyes shone strangely ; and the little scarlet shawl that she had drawn over her head and shoulders was no brighter than her flushed cheeks . She smiled at her brother , but said hurriedly ; " Tell me of your plans for to-night . I suppose you and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Norman will go with me and the girls , but he does it with a bad enough grace . He 's dreadfully tired of Miss Rae ; and , to tell you the truth , Mae , she is rather namby-pamby  --  very different from Miss Hopkins , and then , besides , he had so set his heart on going with you to-night . " " O , yes , " said Mae , scornfully , and bit her lips . " Why , Mae , what is the matter with you ? You seem to doubt every one and everything . You know Norman is truth itself . " " Is he ? " asked Mae , indifferently . " I 've seen for a long time , " continued Eric , " that you two were not the friends you once were , but I do n't understand this open dislike . Does n't it spoil your pleasure ? You do n't seem to have the real old-fashioned good times , my little girl , " and Eric pulled his clumsy dear hand through a twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Mae , " that is like old times again , " and a tear splattered down into the big hand . " What , crying , Mae ? " " No , dear  --  that is , yes . I believe I am a little bit homesick . I wish I could go back behind my teens again . Do you remember the summer that I was twelve  --  that summer up by the lake ? I wish you and I could paddle around in one of the old flat-bottomed tubs once more , do n't you , Eric ? We 'd go for lilies and fish for minnows  --  that is , we 'd fish for perch and catch the minnows  --  and talk about when you should go to college and pull in the race , and I should wear a long dress and learn all the college tunes to sing with you and your Yale friends . Do you remember , Eric ? And now , O dear me , you lost your race , and I hate my long gowns . O  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as you thought you would ? " " Why , Mae , you poor little tot , you 're sentimental  --  for you . Yes , I like the future as well as I always did . I never gave much for the present , at any rate . " " But I did , Eric ; I always did , till just now , and now I hate it , and I 'm afraid of the future , and I 'd like to grow backwards , and instead , in a month , I 'll have another birth-day , and go into those dreadful twenties . " Then Mae was quiet a moment . " Eric , I was sentimental , " she said , after a pause . " Really , I do like the future very much . I quite forgot how much for the moment . " " You 're a strange child , indeed , " replied Eric , the puzzled . " Your words are like lightning . I had just got melted down and ready to reply to your reminiscences by lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-fact again . I was growing so dreadfully unselfish that I should have insisted on staying home with you this evening to cheer you up a bit . " " And give up the mocoletti ! Why , Eric ! I should n't have known how to take such an offer . No , no , trot off and array yourself , and you may come back and say good-bye . " " I must say good-bye now , dear , for I dine at the Costanzi with the girls and their aunt . " " Now , just now , Eric ? " " Why yes , Mae . You are getting blue again , are n't you ? Getting ready for Ash Wednesday to-morrow ? " " Oh , no , no , dear . Kiss me , Eric , again . You 're a good , dear boy . No ; I did n't cry that drop at all . Good-bye ; and to-morrow is Ash Wednesday . But we do n't sorrow or fast in Paradise , I suppose . " CHAPTER XI . The Corso was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balcony stood a party of peasants . Of this group , two were somewhat aside . One of these was tall , dark , a fair type of Southern Italian ; the other small , agile and graceful , dressed in a fresh contadina costume , with her brown hair braided down her shoulders . She seemed excited , and as the crowd pressed nearer she would draw back half-fearfully . " Lisetta , " she whispered , " I am spoiling your good time . Talk to your friends ; never mind me . I will follow by your side , and soon I shall catch the spirit of it all , too . " Saying this , she stepped from under the balcony , held out her feeble little taper and joined in the cries around her , pausing to blow at any lowered bit of wax that came in her way . It was maddening sport ; her light was extinguished again and again , but she would plead to have it relit , and there was sure to be some tender-hearted , kindly knight at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gliding and creeping and sliding through the crowd , her hair flying , her eyes dancing . Even in the dense throng many turned to look at her , and one tall man started suddenly from the shadow of a side street , where he had been standing motionless , and threw himself before the girl . He put out his arm , grasped her tightly , and drew her a few feet into the shadow . " Signorina ! " he said . " Hush , hush , " she whispered then in colder tones . " Let me go , Signor ; you are mistaken . You , do not know me . " He smiled quietly , holding her hands clasped in his . " I do not know you , Signorina ? You do not know me . Your face is the picture always before my eyes . " " Yes , yes , forgive me , " she fluttered , " I was startled , and indeed I am no Signorina now , but one of your own country peasants . I am with Lisetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , was she ? There were hundreds of contadine in the great crowd surging by , but no Lisetta . The little peasant wrung her hands quite free from the man 's grasp . " I must go home , " she said . " I do n't want any more Carnival . " " No , no , " said the officer , quietly , reassuringly . " Get cool . Tell me how Lisetta looks and is dressed , and if we can not find her here , I will take you up to your friend 's balcony . " " O , no , not there . Anywhere else , but not there . " " Why not ? " asked Bero . " Because , because ,  --  yes , I will tell you , " said Mae , remembering her wrongs , and suddenly moved by the sympathy and softness of the great eyes above her ,  --  " because they think I am home ill , and here I am , you see , " and she laughed a little hurriedly ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  hush , let no one hear ,  --  to Sorrento . You must never , never tell . How do I look ? Will I make a good peasant , when once the dear sun has browned my hands and forehead , and I have grown Italianized ? " And she lifted her face , into which the saucy gaiety had returned , up to him temptingly . His warm blood was kindled . " You are a little child of the sun-god now , " he exclaimed , passionately . " May I share some of your days in heaven ? I am ordered to Naples tomorrow night ; shall be only twelve hours behind you . May I come on the day after to see you in your new home ? " " O , how delightful ! But , perhaps , my lord , our little cottage by the sea is n't grand enough for your spurs and buttons and glory . We are simple folks you know ,  --  peasants all ,  --  but our hearts , Signor , they are hospitable , and such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say to the bay of Naples , and oranges for our luncheon day after tomorrow ? " And Mae laughed lightly and joyously . Her little burnt taper fell to the ground , and she clasped her hands together . " What a happy thing life will be ! " " Will you live there and be a peasant forever ? " asked Bero , leaning forward . " There are villas by the sea , too , Signorina . " Mae did n't hear these last words . Her heart had stood still on that " forever . " Live there forever , forever , and never see her mother or Eric , or ,  --  or any one again ! " I had n't thought of that , " she said , " I had n't thought of that . " She stood still with her hands clasped , thinking . The officer at her side , looking down at her , was thinking also . He was fighting a slight mental struggle , a sort of combat he was quite unused to . Should he let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage by the sea ; the peasant home would be dreadful to her . He knew that by that same day after to-morrow , life in lower Italy , with the dirty , coarse people about her would be a burden . Yet he hesitated . He fought the battle in this way : Should he not stand a better chance if he let her go ? He had his leave of absence for three weeks ( this was true ; " ordered to Naples , " he had called it to Mae ) . Three weeks away from his world , near this winsome , strange , magnetic little being , with the bay of Naples , and moonlight , and his own glories and her loveliness ! He could n't give up this chance . No , no . He would surely see her in a few hours after her troubles began , and comfort her . So he only smiled quietly down at her again , as she stood troubled by his side , and said : " Lisetta will seek you near your balcony if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But where is my balcony ? " asked Mae . " Come here , " said Bero , leading her slightly forward . She looked up and saw the quiet side-window , where day after day the officer had flung her the sweet flowers when no one was looking . " I know this place very well , " he said meaningly . Mae smiled a little cheerfully . " You have beautiful taste , " she replied , " I have never seen such exquisite bouquets before . " Bero stroked his moustaches complacently . " You honor me , Signorina . I hope you may receive many , many more beautiful flowers  --  from the same hand . " He whispered these last words , and Mae turned her head half uneasily . She looked up at the balcony . How odd it was that there , but a few feet away , were Mrs. Jerrold , Edith , and Albert . She fancied she could detect their voices , though she could not see them . The Hopkins-Rae window was vacated . " The girls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mae drew a little nearer to Bero , and looked up half appealingly . His eyes were fixed strangely on something or some one across the street . Mae followed their gaze , and saw upon the opposite balcony the beautiful veiled lady . She held in her hand a long rod tipped with a blazing taper . " O , she is like a vestal virgin with her light , or a queen with a sceptre , " cried Mae exultingly . " She may be the vestal virgin , but the queen is by my side , " said Bero earnestly . Mae wished he would not talk in this way , and she tried to laugh it off . " I have no sceptre or crown ; I 'm but a poor queen in my common garb . " " We 'll have the coronation day after to-morrow , " replied Bero , very earnestly still . " Tell me about her , " and Mae nodded her head toward the strange lady . " There is little to tell , " said Bero , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome as an artist . He lives there with his sister and an old duenna . She wears this mysterious veil constantly , and some fanciful people see just as mysterious a cloud resting about her life . I only know she is strange and beautiful , and that her name is Lillia . " Yet Bero had seen this woman almost daily for six months . But he only knew she was strange and beautiful , and that her name was Lillia . Mae had never spoken to the veiled stranger , yet if Bero had turned upon her and asked , " Who is she ? " she would have replied : " I do not know her name or where she lives , but I know she struggles , and despairs , and smiles over all . And I know her suffering comes from sorrow  --  not from sin . " But Mae did not say all this . She only looked at the veiled lady . Her vestal lamp had dropped for the moment , and she seemed to be gazing far away . A fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her great dark eyes . They were unshaded , yet they too , seemed clouded for the moment . " Her name is Lillia , " said Mae , reassuringly to herself . " Her name is Lillia . I am sure she is like her name . " Bero smiled . Just then Lisetta appeared . CHAPTER XII . Early the next morning , in the misty light , Lisetta and Mae , the latter still in her contadina costume , left the house quietly . In an hour the train for Naples was to start , but Lisetta wanted to say her prayers in Rome on this Ash Wednesday . They wandered into a little church , one of the many Roman churches , and knelt side by side , Lisetta with her beads and her penance , and Mae with her thoughts , which grew dreary enough before the peasant was ready to go . Mae had already entrusted her money to Lisetta 's keeping  --  some one hundred and fifty dollars , which she had gotten the day before from Albert to buy clothes with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not know therefore , until the train started , that their seats were in a third-class carriage . Every one was hurrying on board , so Mae was obliged to jump in without a word , and accept her fate as best she could . It was no very pleasant fate . The van was dirty , crowded , garlic-scented . Mae was plucky , however , and knew she was to find dirt and dreadful odors everywhere . Two months of Rome had taught her that . But it grew very dreadful in the close travelling-carriage . There was an old woman at her side , with a deformed hand , and two soldiers opposite , who stared rudely at her , and made loud , unpleasant remarks ; and having no books , and nothing to entertain herself with , she was forced to curl up in a corner , and try to sleep , which she could not do . Poor child ! it was a hard day . Dull and dreary outside , and within , the sickening odors and people . Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that she had gone ? And Eric , how was he feeling ? No , no , she must not think of all this . It belonged to the past . Before her lay Sorrento , the bay of Naples , oranges , white clouds , and the children of the sun . Mamma was south , too  --  if she were only going to her . So the day dragged on , until with the evening they reached Naples . They spent the night with a friend of Lisetta , who rented apartments to English and Americans . Mae was fortunate , therefore , in securing an unlet bedroom that was comfortably furnished . She enjoyed listening to Lisetta 's stories of Rome and the Carnival ; and after a quiet night in a clean bed , awoke tolerably happy and very eager for her first sight of the bay . They took an early train out to Castellamare , and as they left the city , Mae wondered if Bero were just entering it . But she soon forgot him and every one in the blue glories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , was awaiting them , with a malicious little donkey , tricked out gaily enough in tags of color and tinkling bells . It was very quaint and delightful to get into the funny , low , rattling cart , and go jogging off , while the feminine sight-seers fanned themselves in the windows of the ladies ' waiting-room , and grumbled , and the poor masculine travellers bartered in poor Italian , with their certain-to-conquer enemies , those triumphant swindlers , the drivers of the conveyances between Sorrento and Castellamare . Then they began that wonderful ride along the coast . The horrors of the day before rolled away like a mist as the donkey jogged along that miraculous drive . Lisetta and Gaetano chattered together , and Mae sat very still , with her face to the sea , drinking in all the glory , as she had longed and planned . Hope revived in her breast , pride had stood by her all the while , and here was glorious nature coming to her aid . She was going swiftly to the orange groves and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies and dancing , and at night a great , yellow moon would light up the whole scene . So on and on they went , the travelling carriages dashing by them now and then , with their three donkeys abreast , and the driver cracking his whip , and the travellers oh-ing and ah-ing . " That is the most picturesque peasant I have yet seen , " said a gentle lady in brown to her husband , as they passed the humble little party . " Yes , she is clean , and more like the ideal than the actual peasant , and I am very glad I have seen her . " Really , Mae was for the moment , at a quick glance , the ideal peasant . Her hands lay in her lap , her face was toward the sea , and her attitude and features were all full of that glow of existence that peasant portraits possess . She lived and moved and had her being as part of a great , warm , live picture . If the lady in brown had not passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in Mae 's face that spoiled her for a peasant , an earnestness in her admiration , a sharp intensity in her joy , that was very different from the languid content of a Southern Italian . Her movements were rather like those of the Northern squirrel , which climbs nimbly and frisks briskly , than like the sinuous , serpentine motions of the Southern creatures of the soil . We are , after all , born where we belong , as a rule , and the rest of us soon belong where we are born . After a time the donkey pattered along towards a little patch of houses on the shore . They had already passed a half dozen of similar settlements . Very dirty children ran about crying , ugly , old women knitted , mongrel dogs and cats barked and yelped and rolled in the mud . Bits of orange-peel and old cabbage and other refuse food lay piled near the doors . There were , to be sure , young girls with dark eyes , plaiting straw , and the very dirt heaps had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to look , but never to enter . Yet it was here that Mae must enter . This was her new home . The neighbors came crowding about curiously , and she was hurried into the little hut that seemed as if it were carved roughly from some big garlic , probably by taking out the heart of it for dinner . Mae hardly comprehended the situation at first , but when she began to realize that this was a substitute for sea breeze , and that the coarse clipped patois ( which sounded worse in the mass than when it fell from Lisetta 's lips alone ) was in place of the flowing melody of speech she had longed for , she grew sick at heart . The folly , the dreadfulness of what she had done , swept over her like a flood , and with it came dreadful fear . She was helpless ,  --  an outcast . Pride would never let her go home . She could go nowhere else . They had her money , and here she must live and die . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed to the squabbling children who pulled at her gown , or the dogs who sniffed snappingly at the stranger . Lisetta , busy with greetings and chattings , quite forgot her for a time , and was dismayed when she saw her sitting disconsolately by . " Come , Signorina , " she cried , " go down to the bay . Here is Talila ; she will guide you . " Mae looked up quickly at that . Talila , was she here ? A few feet from her she saw an uncouth woman , with that falling of the jaw most imbeciles possess , and a vacancy in her eyes . She had her hand raised and was swearing at one of the children . " Talila , " repeated Mae , rubbing her eyes , and shivering , " but I thought Talila would be different . You said she loved children , but this woman swears at them . " " O , dear , we all swear at them , but we love them ; you shall see how they follow her . Talila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next moment there was a general scamper of brown children headed by this tall , vacant-looking woman . " Take the lady to the sea , " continued Lisetta . And Mae arose , as if in a dream , and followed them . The half-clad children of the sun ran before her as she had dreamed they would ; flowers sprang up along the way , but she did not stop to pluck a single bud or turn to look at anything . She wandered on in an awful sort of fright and came at length to the water 's edge . Here there were row-boats lying at anchor , into which the children clambered . Mae stepped into one of them and sat down in the stern , and looked about . All was as she had planned . Her day of heaven was here . She tried to be brave . O , she tried very hard . She wanted to love and enjoy the sea , and think beautiful thoughts . She roused a little and stretched herself out to catch the sunbeams in her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . An umbrella would be a luxury  --  and a book ! But these belonged to the world she had left so far behind her . The dirty children babbled a strange tongue ; the water around the boat , by the shore , was covered with a scum , and alas ! alas ! the land of her desire was farther off than ever . Then she remembered that Norman Mann had once said : " If you ever do disappear I shall know where to look for you . " Would he think of it now ? Would he come for her ? If he had only come last night , and would drive by now to Sorrento . He would be here soon if he had . Would she call him loudly or shrink down in the boat and hide her face in her hands till she knew he was a long way past ? The rest of them would not know where to look for her . They did not know anything about Lisetta , and she had promised not to tell even the padrona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come for her , after what he had said at the Capitol . That was what finally drove her away . How unlike him it did seem to speak of her in that way to Eric . She thought over his words , and as she did so she seemed to see her mistake , and grasp his meaning . She sprang up in the boat . " It was the other girl  --  Miss Rae  --  he was speaking of . Oh , oh , oh  --  and now it is too late . He will hate me always . " As she stood there , a carriage rolled by . Some one looked out . " O , mamma , " said a young voice in English , " look at that pretty little peasant , " and a kid-gloved hand was stretched through the open window to spatter a shower of base coin toward her . It was terrible ! The children sprang for it , and , fighting and laughing , ran homewards with the dreadful Talila . The parti-colored picturesque dress had been a joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die  --  die ! No , she was afraid to die . She would have to live , and she did n't know how , and she laughed a bitter sort of laugh . There was a sound of horses ' feet again . The road lay almost close to the shore just here . A low exclamation , a vault from his horse , which was speedily cared for by a dozen boys near at hand , and before Mae knew it , the officer was beside her once more . O , how beautiful it was to see some one from the world , fresh , and clean , and fair . Mae gazed at him in delight , and sprang up warmly , holding out both her hot hands , " How is Heaven ? " asked Bero , as he raised the white fingers to his lips . " That is not the custom with us , " said Mae , withdrawing her hand . " But what is custom in Heaven ? " he laughed . " Ca n't we do as we please in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Heaven , and I do n't please . O , how could you let me come to this dreadful place . Did you know how awful it would be ? " " Shall I tell you why I said nothing ? Let me row you away from all this , " and he began to untie the boat . " When did you come ? " asked Mae , " I left Rome last night , reached Naples this morning , and here I am as soon as possible , Signorina . " Mae felt herself gradually yielding to the spell of this man 's soft power . She had grown strangely quiet and passive , and she folded her hands and looked off seawards in a not unhappy way . She seemed to be some one else in a strange dream . " Are you glad I came ? " asked Bero , as he jumped into the boat and sat down opposite her . Mae did not reply . She had almost lost the power of speech . She only smiled feebly and faintly . Bero had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he who had changed her , and the sense of his own power excited him the more . He bent his proud head and flashed his beautiful eyes as he lifted the oars to the locks , and silently pulled out toward the bay . As he rowed he gazed fixedly at her , and the frightened , puzzled child could not turn her eyes from his . His look grew softer and tenderer , his head bent towards her , the oars moved slower and slower and at last stopped imperceptibly . Still the man gazed passionately , claimingly , and the girl breathed harder and let her eyes rest on his , as if he had been a wondrous , charming serpent , and she a little , unresisting dove . Then he spoke . His words were so low , it seemed as if his eyes had found voice ; his words were so caressing , it seemed as if they changed to kisses as they fell . " Listen , " he said , softly , and drew up his dripping oars and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven , but I know a villa by the sea . There are hills and woods about it ; flowers , fruits , and in the day , sunshine , at night , moonlight and music ; drives , and walks , and vines , and arbors . Could you find there your Heaven  --  with me ? May I take you to my villa ? " When he ceased , his words dropped slowly into silence , and Mae still gazed at him . She saw him come nearer to her , with his eyes fixed on hers ; she saw his hand leave the oar and move slowly toward hers , but she was motionless , looking at the picture he had painted her of life  --  the cloudless days , moonlit nights  --  the villa by the sea  --  the glowing Piedmontese . Her eyelids trembled , her pulse beat . Could she take that villa for her home ? That man for her husband ? She had half thought till now in soft luxurious Italian , but ' my home ' and ' my husband ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a long shiver , and pulled her eyes from his . It was like waking from a dream . " No  --  oh , no ; take me home , " she gasped , and turned toward the shore , where , erect , with folded arms and head bared , stood Norman Mann . The Italian bit his lip , and said something under his breath , but he took the oars and pulled ashore . Mae turned her eyes downward and felt the color creep up , up into her cheeks . It seemed eternity . The boat was Charon 's , and she was drifting to her fate . Norman Mann stood like a statue . The wind moved his hair over his forehead , and once Mae saw him toss the unruly locks back in a familiar way he had . She did not know why , but the tears half came to her eyes as he did it . He stood as firm and hard and still as a New England rock , while the Italian swayed lithely as he pulled the oars , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boat came safely ashore . The Piedmontese helped her to land , and the three stood silent ; but Mae under all her shame felt content to be near Norman . His voice broke the quiet , quick and clear . " Are you married ? " he asked . " I ! married ! What do you  --  what can he mean ? " " Why is this man here , then ? " Mae stood an instant so still that the heavy breaths of the two men were distinctly audible , the passionate boundings of Bero 's pulse , the long , deep throbs of Norman 's heart . The officer stepped toward her . Norman stood unmoved . The Italian 's eye wandered restlessly , his hand fell to his sword . Norman 's arms were folded , and his face set . Mae looked at one , then at the other , perplexedly . Then she understood . Like lightning , a terrible temptation flashed into her mind . The Italian loved her , would shield , protect , honor her . Norman must hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little weak woman 's hand and place it in the man 's hand ready to claim it , or stand still and be crushed by that other hand there ? Ah ! she could not do it . She tried once . She held out weakly her right hand toward Bero ; but the left stretched itself involuntarily to Norman . Then the two met in each other 's pitiful clasp over her bent head , and with a low wailing cry she fell in a little heap on the sand . When she opened her eyes , they were both bending over her . " Take me home , " she gasped to Norman . He glared at the officer . " Go ! " he said . Bero put his hand to his sword . Mae sprang up . " No , " she said , gently , " no , my friend , for you have always been kind and friendly to me . Pray go . " Bero was touched by this . This little girl had taken only good from him , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thought . Then the officer smiled pleasantly . He shrugged his shoulders slightly , regretfully , and bowed and rode away . And so the clinking spurs and yellow moustaches and amorous eyes vanished from Mae 's sight . As he rode off he was somewhat sorrowful ; but he took a picture from his pocket and looked at it . " She 'll be glad to welcome me back again , " he said to himself , pleasantly , " and she belongs to my own land . This little foreigner might have pined for her own home , by and by . " Then he sighed and shook his head . " Alas ! this little stranger will dance before you often , still ! " and he touched his eyes ; " but I will put you back in your place here , now . " This he said , looking at Lillia 's picture and with his hand on his heart . CHAPTER XIII . " Take me home , " said Mae again imploringly . " Not back there , " as Norman drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O no , not even for a minute . " " Sit here then , " he replied quietly , " while I arrange it with the woman , " and he walked quickly away . Mae watched him till he entered the low doorway , in a sort of subdued , glorified happiness , that would break out over her shame and fear . She was afraid he would hate her , at least she told herself so , but in reality , everything and everybody and every place were fast fading out of this eager little mind . She and Norman were together , and she could not help being content . There was a certain joy in her weakness and shame , though they were genuine and kept her hushed and silent . Poor Lisetta was very much frightened , but told her story to this angry stranger with true Southern palaver . She said the little lady loved Italy so , and wanted to be a peasant , and insisted she would run away quite by herself if Lisetta would not take her , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send word to the friends . " And the man ? " asked Norman , impatiently . " What man ? O , the officer . He just rode down this morning for a morning call . I never saw him before . " A great weight , as large as the Piedmontese , fell from Norman 's heart then , and he scattered money among the children recklessly and ordered up the donkey ; and smiled on the amazed Lisetta all in the same breath , and went back to help Mae into the wagon with the lightest kind of a heart . It was a strange ride they took back to Castellamare . I think they both wished the world could stand still once more . When they had arrived at the station they found the next train to Naples was not due for two hours . Norman left Mae in the waiting-room for a time . Through the window she watched Gaetano and the donkey start homeward , with a great sigh of relief . She had time while she was sitting to think , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only feel sorry and ashamed and meek and happy , all mixed together . The sensation was odd . " I have telegraphed Eric that we would start home by the next train , that you had only been off for a frolic . I hope we can buy a waterproof or shawl and a hat in Naples for you ? " " Yes , " said Mae , meekly , " I have my waterproof here . I think I will put it on now , please , " and she began nervously to untie the shawl strap . Norman put her fingers gently aside , and unbuckled it for her . He handed her the long deep-blue cloak , which she put tightly about her , drawing the hood over her head . " You look like a nun , " said Norman , smiling . " I wish I were one , " replied Mae , with a choke in her throat . She was growing very penitential and softened . " What shall we do now ? " asked Mr. Mann . " We have a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find a pleasanter spot than this . " " Go anywhere you please , " replied Mae meekly . " What is the matter with you ? "  --  for Norman had a very amused expression in his brown eyes . " I hardly recognize you . Not a trace of fight so far , and it must be two hours since we met . " " Do n't , " said Mae , with her eyes down , so of course he did n't , but the two just marched quietly along back on the Sorrento road towards some high rocks . They sat down behind these , with their faces towards the sea , and were as thoroughly hidden from view , as if they had been quite alone in the world . " I suppose they were frightened , " asked Mae , " at home  --  at Rome , I mean . " " Dreadfully , " replied Norman , trying to be sober , but with the glad ring in his voice still . " Edith was for dragging the Tiber ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Jerrold searched your trunks and read all your private papers , I am morally certain . " Then Norman stopped abruptly , and Mae drew the long stiletto from her hair nervously and played with it before she said , " And the boys ? " " Albert was very , very sad , but reasonably sure you would be found . We all feared the Italian , but Albert worked carefully , and soon discovered that the officer was said to be engaged to a young girl with whom he had been seen the day after you left , and that gave him courage , "  --  then Norman stopped again abruptly . " And Eric ? " " Eric sat down with his face in his hands and cried , Miss Mae , and said , ' I 've lost my sister , the very dearest little sister in the world . ' " " And you came and found me , " said Mae , after a pause , wiping the tears from her eyes . " Yes , thank God , " said Norman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? " asked Mae , " when I had been so naughty , and silly , and unkind ? " He came very near telling her the reason as she looked up at him , but he did not , for she dashed on , " O ! Mr. Mann , I have been  --  " " Do n't confess to me , Miss Mae . Leave all of this till you get home to your own , who have a right to your confessions and penitence . Never mind what you have been , here you are , and as I have only one more handkerchief and your own looks as if it had been sea-bathing , you had better dry your eyes and be jolly for the next two hours . " This was a precarious speech , but Mae only laughed at it , and dried her eyes quickly . " But I have one thing to say to you , " she said , " and please may n't I ? " " You may say anything you please to me , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about the miserable past or my doings , but it 's about the future . I 've said good-bye to my dreams of life  --  the floating and waving and singing and dancing life that was like iced champagne . I 'd rather have cold water , thank you , sir , for a steady drink , morning , noon and night . I 'm going to be good , to read and study and grow restful , "  --  and Mae folded her hands and looked off toward the sea . " She 's a witching child , " thought Norman . Then she raised her head . " I said it lightly because I felt it deeply , " she added , as if in reply to his thought . " I am going to grow , if I can , unselfish and sympathetic , and perhaps , who knows , wise , and any way good . " " There is no need of giving up your champagne entirely . Give yourself a dinner party now and then o ' holidays . The world is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study is full of it  --  most of all it lives in humanity . " " Well , " said Mae , " are n't you glad I 'm going to change so ? " " I 'm glad you 're going to give your soul a chance . Your body has been putting it down hard of late . " " It 's but a weakling , " said Mae , with a shake of her head , " and I 've hardly heard its whimpers at all , but  --  O , Mr. Mann , if you could have seen Talila  --  she 's dreadful . " " Who is Talila ? and what has she to do with your soul ? " " O , she 's one of those Sorrento people , " replied Mae , as if she had lived there for years . " I have so much to tell you : it will take  --  " " Years , I hope , dear . " The last word dropped without his noticing it , but Mae caught it and hid it in her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , after a pause , during which Norman had hummed a song as she had been writing her name on the sand . They were quite on the shore and only a narrow stretch of beach separated them from the bay . " You said if you ever came away , you would go to Sorrento , and I knew you had a friend in the kitchen who lived near Naples . So I searched for her and the padrona , and , finding neither of them , set Giovanni a babbling , and learned that the woman Lisetta had left that morning for Sorrento . I told the boys I had a mere suspicion that I would trace for them . So off I came last night , and by stopping and enquiring at every settlement , at last discovered you . " " This is my birth-day ; I am twenty years old , " said Mae , " Why , what are you doing ? " For Norman had bent down to the sand also , and had drawn a queer little figure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , " he laughed , " and you could only crow and kick your small feet , and smile now and then , and cry the rest of the time . " " That is about all I can do yet , " said Mae . " Here comes number two , " and he drew his hand across the sand and smoothed the baby image away , leaving in its place a round , sturdy little creature , poised dangerously on one foot . " You have walked alone , and you have called your father 's name , and you 're a wonderful child by this time . " " This is the three-year-old , white aprons and curls , please observe . Now , you recite ' Dickery , dickery dock ' and ' I want to be an angel , ' and you have cut all your wisdom teeth . " " O , Mr. Mann , I have n't cut them yet . Babies do n't have them . " " Do n't they ? Well , you have other teeth in their place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years old . " " Ah , here I begin to remember . You draw the pictures , and I 'll describe myself . Four years old !  --  let me see  --  I had a sled for Christmas , and I used to eat green apples . That 's all I can remember ; and five and six years old were just the same . " " O , no , I 'm sure you went to church for the first time somewhere along there ; and is n't that a noteworthy event ? I suppose all your thoughts were of your button boots and your new parasol ? " " I behaved beautifully , I know ; mamma says so ; sat up like a lady , while you were sleeping , on that very same Sunday , off in some little country church , I suppose . " " I should n't wonder  --  sleeping in my brother 's outgrown coat into the bargain , with the sleeves dangling over my little brown hands . " " It does n't seem as if they could ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Mann unfolded five fingers and a thumb and surveyed them gravely for a moment . " It is strange that this once measured three inches by two and could n't hit out any better than your 's could . " Mae had laid her hand on her knee and was looking at it also in the most serious manner . Now she doubled it into a small but very pugnacious looking fist , which she shook most entrancingly before the very eyes of the young man by her side . The eyes turned such a peculiar look upon her that she hastened to add : " Go on with your dissolving views . It is number eight 's turn next . You are the showman , and I am interested spectator . " " You insist upon describing my pictures , so I think you are properly first assistant to the grand panorama . Here 's eight-year-old . Try your powers on her . " " Let me see . O , then I read all the while , the ' Fairchild Family ' and ' Anna Ross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth braids , I remember . I was ever so good . " " Impossible ; you must have forgotten , " suggested Norman . " You surely whispered in school and committed similar dreadful crimes . Poor little prig . " " No , do n't , " plead Mae ; " please do n't laugh at the little girl me . I love to think of her as so goody-goody . Last night , " and Mae lowered her voice , " I seemed to see little Mae Madden kneeling down in the old nursery in her woolly wrapper saying her prayers , " and Mae brought up on the prayers very abruptly , and bent over toward the sand and began to draw hastily . " Here comes nine-year-old Mae . Mr. Mann , you may do the describing . " " O , I suppose there were doll 's parties , first valentines , and rides with Albert in his buggy , when you clung very tightly to the slight arm of the carriage and smiled very bravely up in his face . You must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly . I had broken out two teeth climbing a stone wall . " " You had stopped being good ? " " Yes , that only lasted a little bit of a time . " " Miss Mae , I 'm sure you were never ugly , but naughty and silly , I dare say . Kept a diary now , did n't you ? " " Yes , and went to sleep with Eliza Cooke 's poems under my pillow every night , and my finger holding the book open at some such thrilling verse as this : ' Say on that I 'm over romantic In loving the wild and the free , But the waves of the dashing Atlantic , The Alps and the eagle for me . ' " " Did you wear your hair plaited when you were ten years old ? " enquired Norman , intensely busy with another drawing . " O no ; I did n't do anything when I was ten years old but get mad and make up with my two dearest friends . " " One of whom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it , I suppose . " " Do n't be satirical , sir . I had a lover when I was eleven ; I used to skate with him and write him little notes , folded very queerly . " " Why do you draw twelve and thirteen with their heads down ? " asked Mae , after a moment . " Because they read so much ; everything they can get hold of , including , possibly , a very revised edition of ' Arabian Nights ' ? " " Yes , " laughed Mae , " and my first novel , ' Villette . ' " " You go to a play for the first time now , " suggested Norman . " How you clasp your hands and wink your eyes and bite your lips ! And next day , in front of your mother 's pier-glass , how you scream ' O , my love , ' and gasp and tumble over in a heap in your brown calico , as the grand lady did the night before , in her pink silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die in my own clothes , let me assure you . The garret was overhauled , and had been since I was a mere baby , for effective , sweeping garments . Let us hurry along over fourteen and fifteen . I was sentimental and tried to be so young-ladyish then . I used to read history with Albert , and always put on both my gloves when I started out , and had great horror of girls who talked loud in the street . I learned to make bread , and shirt bosoms , and such things . " " Well , here you are in a long dress , Miss Sweet Sixteen . I remember you home from boarding school on a vacation . " " What did you think of me ? " asked Mae , " did n't we have a nice time that summer ? O , how silly I was ! " She hurried on , because the eyes had given her that peculiar look again , which put her heart in a tremble . " I did have a beautiful time at boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such girls . " " Then I suppose you wrote a salutatory in forlorn rhyme to end off with , " laughed Norman , " and read it , all arrayed in white , in a trembling voice , and everybody applauded , and even old Judge Seymour admired it , while you were reading , with your pink cheeks and trembling hands and quivering voice . " " Abominable ! I did n't have the salutatory , and the girl who did , read a superb one , as strong and masculine  --  " " Then the Judge went to sleep , I 'm sure , " declared Norman . " Well , " said Mae , " you are leaving out two years , " for Norman had leaned back against the rock with his arms folded . " By and by , " said Norman , " we all come off to Europe , and some of us go through the heart-ache , do n't we ? " " Yes , " replied Mae , softly . " But come out ahead one day at Sorrento , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no direct reply . " All the Mae Maddens have faded away , " she said , looking down at the sand again . " The tide is rising . " And she walked forward to the ripples of water , and then came slowly back and stood before Norman seriously . He laughed . " Why , Mr. Mann , " said Mae , " I have been so very , very wicked . " The dreadful Mr. Mann only laughed again . " You act as if it were all a joke . I never saw you so merry before . " " I have never been as happy before in my life . " " Why ? " asked Mae , in a low voice . " Because I have found you , " he answered earnestly , and before she knew it Mae was lifted in the strong , manly arms , her pink cheek close to Norman 's brown one , and his lips on hers . She leaned her face against his and clung tightly to him , " O , Mr. Norman Mann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much  --  as I do you ? " And Norman , still holding her tightly , bent his hand , with hers clasped in it , to the sand , and after the Mae Madden , he wrote another name , so that it read : MAE MADDEN MANN . Then he said a great many , many things , all beginning with that electric , wonderful little possessive pronoun " my , " of which he had discoursed formerly , and he held her close all the while , and they missed the next train for Naples . The gay peasant costume fell about the girl 's round lithe form like the luxuriant skin of some richly marked animal ; but out of her eyes looked a woman 's tender , loving , earnest soul . Norman Mann had saved her . CHAPTER XIV . Edith was quietly married to Albert at Easter time , in the English Chapel at Florence . The event was hastened by the sudden appearance of Mae 's parents , who set sail soon after hearing of the Sorrento escapade and the embryonic engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beautifully smooth at last . Edith and Albert left the day of their marriage for Munich , and later , Mrs. Jerrold was to settle down with them at Tuebingen . The rest of the party were to summer in Switzerland ; then came fall , and then  --  what ? Norman thought he knew , and Mae said she thought he did n't , but this young woman was losing half her character for willfulness , and Norman was growing into a perfect tyrant , so far as his rights were concerned . Easter is a season of marriages . Mae read in a Roman paper the betrothal announcement of the Signor Bero and Signorina Lillia Taria . " I would like to send them a real beautiful present , " said she , and Norman did not say no . So these two hunted all over Florence , and at length , in the studio of a certain not unknown Florentine , they discovered the very gift Mae desired  --  a picture of a young Italian soldier , bringing home his bride to his own people . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid the dark-eyed girl welcome . " She has a real ' old Nokomis ' air , " laughed Mae . " I know she would have told her son not to seek ' a stranger whom he knew not . ' " The distant olive-colored hillsides , the splashing fountain near at hand , each face , and even the thick strong sunshine seemed to bear a tiny stamp with Italy graven on it . " The name of the picture is exactly right , " said Mae . Under the painting were these words : " Italia Our Home . " Norman would hardly have been human if he had not cast a quick glance at her as she stood thoughtfully before the picture . Mae was almost as good as an Italian for involuntary posing . She had made a tableau of herself now , with one hand at her eyes to shade them from the glare of the sun that fell fiercely through the window , her head half on one side , and a bit of drapery , of lace or soft silk , tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked up quickly , and smiled and shook her head : " No , Italy is not my home , although I love it so well . There is a certain wide old doorway not many miles from New York , and the hills around it , and the great river before it , and the people in it , all belong together , too . That 's where we belong , Norman , in America , our home , " and Mae struck a grand final pose with her hands clasped ecstatically , and her eyes flashing in the true Goddess of Liberty style . " Yes , I believe we do , Mae ; I am almost anxious to get back and begin work in that young , eager country . " " And so am I , " said Mae . Norman laughed . " To think of your coming down to work , you young butterfly . " " It is what we all have to come to , is n't it ?  --  unless we go to that creature that finds some mischief still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to stone-cutting or cattle-driving , but I do expect to settle down into a tolerable housewifely little woman , and  --  " " And look after me . " " Yes , I suppose so  --  and myself , and probably a sewing-class and the cook 's lame son . Heigh-ho-hum ! What a pity it is , that it is so uninteresting to be good . " " How do you know ? " " Do n't be saucy . I do know , perfectly well , that Mae Madden , naughty , idle , and silly , may be , after all , not so stupid ; but get me good , industrious and wise , and it will take all of my time when I 'm not asleep to keep so . No , there 'll be nothing to say about me any more . I 'll be as humdrum as  --  " " As I am . " " You  --  why Norman , are you humdrum ? " " Of course I am , dreadfully humdrum . If you and I were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep the reader awake . But then , story-books are n't the end of life . Suppose you , Mae Madden , have been odd , full of variety , ready to twist common occurrences into something startling and romantic , have you been happy ? Have n't you been restless and discontented ? Now , ca n't you , grown humdrum and good , be very happy and contented and joyful , even if the sun rises on just about the same Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesdays , the year round ? You will not do for a story-book then , but wo n't you do better for life ? And , after all , a lively murderer is a great deal more sensational than you could ever be . " " Even when I ran away ? " " Yes . Now , you see , I have been humdrum again , and half preached a sermon . " " All right , sir ; so long as you take me for a text , you may preach as you want to , and by and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It would have been a great deal more interesting if you had married that Italian . " " How do you know I could have married that Italian , my lord ? He is going to marry a girl as much more beautiful than I am as  --  as Bero himself is than you  --  and yet I would rather have you . And now , do n't you dare look at me in that way . I 'll never say another nice thing to you if you do . This artist will think we are  --  " " Lovers , my dear . And are n't we ? " * * * * * Ten days later Norman entered with a letter for Mae . " Read it to me , " she said , throwing back the blinds and leaning her elbows on the window-cushion . " It is from Lillia . Would you rather read it yourself ? " " O , no . " So Norman read what Lillia had written in her pretty broken English : " My DEAR MISS MAE :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . I have had so little home since long , long ago my mother died , and now I am to have one as the maid in the picture has . We will marry the fifth day of May at five o'clock , and will wish you to be there . Do n't forget me . " LILLIA . " " Signor Bero has added a postscript , Mae , which you can translate better than I. " And Norman handed her the letter . Mae translated it thus : " Did you know all that the picture would say to me , Signorina ? Receive my thanks for it , too , and believe I shall always live worthy of my Italy , my wife and friends that I see in the picture , and of another friend who lives so far away , whom I shall never see again , if I have such a friend . Think of my beautiful Lillia on our wedding day . We shall be married at St. Andrea 's , at vesper time . " Bero . " " And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the very hour , allowing the bride and the sun a few minutes each , " added Norman , glancing at the clock . They gaze quietly out of the window of their lodgings on the Borgo Ognissante , but Mae sees far away beyond the Arno , into the church of St. Andrea ,  --  music , and pomp , and beautiful ceremony , and before the altar , a woman in her bridal robes , with heavily figured lace falling over her black hair and white forehead , and against her soft cheeks and shoulders . Her great brown eyes have thrown away the mist of sadness for a luminous wedding veil of joy , and she is Lillia , and by her side , erect , proud , glorious , with a lingering ray of light falling on his golden head , is her happy husband , Bero . They stand before the altar of St. Andrea 's . " God bless you , " says Mae aloud . Then her gaze wanders back to the coral and mosaic shops below in the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-haired , brown-moustached , brown-eyed man leans , puffing smoke from his curved lips , and holding his cigarette in his slender fingers . She meets his gaze now , as she has met it before . " He is wondering what life will bring to these two young people , I fancy , " says Mae . " Our own wedding-day , Mae , " Norman replies ; and they both forget all about Lillia , and Bero , and the stranger , and suddenly leave the window . The long-haired man puffs his cigar in a little loneliness , and wishes that wedding bells might ring for his empty heart too .
