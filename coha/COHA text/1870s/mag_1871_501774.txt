@ // THERE used to be a story current in London , which I dare say is not true , to the effect that her gracious Majesty Queen Vi*oria once demurred to the Prince and Princess of Wales showing themselves too freely in society , and asked them angrily whether they meant to make themselves " as common as the Cambridges . " Certainly the Duke of Cambridge and his sister the Princess Mary , now Princess of Teck , were for a long time , if not exactly " common , " if not precisely popular , the most social , the most easily approached , and the most often seen in public pageantry of all members of the royal family . The Princess Mary might perhaps fairly be called popular . The people liked her fine , winsome face , her plump and buxom form . if she has not a kindly , warm , and generous heart , then surely physiognomy is no index of character . But the Duke of Cambridge , although very commonly seen in public , and ready to give his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution which can claim to be fashionable , never seems to have attained any degree of popularity . Like his father , who enjoyed the repute of being the worst after-dinner speaker who ever opened his mouth , the Duke of Cambridge is to be found acting as chairman of some public banquet once a week on an average during the London season . He is president or patron of no end of public charities and other institutions . Yet the people do not seem to care anything about him , or even to like him . His appearance is not in his favor . He is handsome in a certain sense , but he is heavy , stolid , sensual-looking , and even gross in form and face . He has indeed nearly all the peculiarities of physiognomy which specially belong to the most typical members of the Guelph family , and there is , moreover , despite the obesity which usually suggests careless good-humor , something sinister or secret in his expression not pleasant to look upon . He seems to be a man of respectable average abilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he addresses the House of Lords , which he does rarely , or a public meeting or dinner-party , which he does often , he acquits himself rather better than the ordinary county member of Parliament . Judging by his apparent mental capacity and his style as a speaker , he ought to be rather popular than otherwise in England , for the English people like respectable mediocrity and not talent in their princes . " He is so respectable and such afl ass , " says Thackeray speaking of somebody , " that I positively Wonder he did n't get on in England . " The Duke of Cambridge is so respectable ( in intellectual capacity ) and so dull that I positively wonder he has not been popular in England . But popular he never has been . No such clamorous detestation follows him as used to pursue the late Duke of Cumberland , subsequently King of Hanover . No such accusations have been made against him as were familiarly pressed against the Duke of York . Even against the living Prince of Wales there are charges made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked of in regard to the Duke of Cambridge . But the English public likes the Duke as little as it could like any royal personage . England has lately been growing very jealous of the manner in which valuable appointments are heaped on members of the Queen 's family . The Duke of Cambridge has long enjoyed some sinecure places of liberal revenue , and he holds one office of inestimable influence , for which he has // never proved himself qualified , and for which common report declares him to be utterly disqualified . He is Commander-in-Chief of the British army ; and that I believe to be his grand offence in the eyes of the British public . Many offences incident to his position are indeed charged upon him . It is said that he makes an unfair use , for purposes of favoritism , of the immense patronage which his office places at his disposal . Some years ago scandal used to charge him with advancing men out of the same motive which izijluced the Marquis of Steyne to obtain an appointment for Colonel Rawdon Crawley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been immoral , and unluckily for him it so happened that some of his closest friends and favorites became now and then involved in scandals of which the law courts had to take cognizance . But had none of these things been so , or been said , I think the Duke of Cambridge would have lacked popularity just as much as he does . The English people are silently angry with him , mainly because he is an anachronism  --  a man raised to the most influential public appointment the sovereign can bestow , for no other reason than because he is a member of the royal family . The Duke of Cam . bridge in the office of Commander-in-Chief is an anachronism at the head of an anomaly . The system is unfit for the army or the country ; the man is incompetent to manage any military system , good or bad . As the question of army re* organization , now under debate in England , has a grand political importance , transcending by far its utmost possible military import , and as the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalies about to be abolished , it may surely interest American readers if I occupy a few pages in describing the man and the system . Altering slightly the words of Bugeaud to Louis Philippe in 1848 , this reorganization of the army in England is not a re* form , but a revolution . It strikes out the keystone from the arch of the fabric of English aristocracy . The Duke of Cambridge is , as everybody knows , the first cousin of the Queen of England . He is about the same age as the Queen . When both were young it used to be said that he cherished hopes of becoming her husband . He is now himself one of the victims of the odious royal marriage act , which in England acknowledges as valid no marriage with a subject contracted by a member of the royal family without the consent of the sovereign . The Duke of Cambridge , it is well known , is privately married to a lady of respectable position and of character which has never been reproached , but whom , nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the royal consent has not ratified the marriage . Many readers of THE GALAXY may . perhaps remember that only four or five years ago there was some little commotion created in England by the report , never contradicted , that a princess of the royal house had set her heart upon marrying a young English nobleman who loved her , and that the Queen utterly refused to give her consent . Much sympathy was felt for the princess , because , as she was not a daughter of the Queen and was not young enough to be reasonably expected to acknowledge the control of any relative , this rigorous exercise of a merely technical power seemed particularly unjust and odious . It will b* seen , therefore , that the objections raised against the Duke and his position in England are not founded on the belief that he is himself as an individual inordinately favored by the sovereign ; but on the obvious fact that place and power are given to him because he is a member of the reigning family . The Duke of Cambridge has never shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of war . In his only campaign he proved worse than useless , and more than once made a humiliating exhibition , not of cowardice , but of utter incapacity and flaccid nervelessness . His warmest admirer never ventured to pretend // that the Duke was personally the best man to take the place of Commander-inChief . While he was constantly accused by rumor and sometimes by public insinuation of blundering , of obstinacy , of ignorance , *of gross favoritism , no defence ever made for him , no eulogy ever pronounced upon him , went the length of describing him as a well-qualified head of the military organization . His upholders and panegyrists were content with pleading virtually that he was by no means a bad sort of Commander-in-Chief ; that he was Rot fairly responsible for this or that blunder or malversation ; that on the whole there might have been men worse fitted than he for the place . The social vindication of the appointment was that which proved very naturally its worst offence in the eyes of the public  --  the fact that the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Duke of Cambridge , and that the ministers then in power either had not the courage or did not think it worth their while to resist the royal inclination . The Duke , if he never proved himself much of a soldier , had at least opportunity enough to learn all the ordinary business of his profession . He actually is , and always has been , a professional soldier-not nominally an officer , as the ate Prince Albert was , or as the Prince of Wales is , or as the Princess Victoria ( Crown Princess of Prussia ) may be said for that matter to be , the lady holding , I believe , an appointment as colonel of some regiment , and being doubtless just as well acquainted with her regimental duties as her fat and heavy brother . The Duke of Cambridge was made a colonel at the age of eighteen , and he did the ordinary barrack and garrison duties of his place . He used when young to be rather popular in garrison towns . In Dublin , for example , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was followed with glances of admiration by many hundred pairs of bright eyes . On the death of his father ( whose after-dinner eloquence used to afford " Punch " a constant subject for mirth ) Prince George became in x8*o Duke of Cambridge . He holds some appointments which I presume are sinecures to him ; among the rest he is keeper of some of the royal parks ( I do n't know the precise title of his office ) , and the name of " George " may be seen appended to edicts inscribed on various placards on the trees and gates near Buckingham Palace . Nothing in particular was known about him as a soldier until the Crimean war . Indeed , up to that time there had been for many years as little chance for an English officer to prove his capacity as there was for a West Point man to show what he was worth in the period between the Mexican war and the attack on Fort Sumter . When the Crimean war broke out the Duke was appointed tcr the command of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it is beyond all doubt that he proved himself unfit for the business of war . He " lost his head , " people say ; he could not stand the sights and sounds of the battle-field . It required on one occasion-at Inkerman , I believe  --  the prompt and sharp interference of the late Lord Clyde , then Sir Cohn Campbell , to prevent his Royal Highness from making a sad mess of his command . It is not likely that he wanted personal courage-few princes do ; but his nerves gave way , and as he could be of no further use to anybody he was induced to return home . France and England each sent a fat prince , cousin of the reigning sovereign , to the Crimean war , and each prince rather suddenly came home again with the invidious whispers of the malign unpleasantly criticising his retreat from the field . After the Duke 's return the corporation of Liverpool gave him ( why , no man could well say ) a grand trig umphal entry , and I remember that an irreverent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the devices exhibited in honor of the illustrious visitor , a white feather would be an appropriate emblem . There the // 1871 . Duke 's active military career began and ended . He had not distinguished himself . Perhaps he had not disgraced himself ; perhaps it was really only illhealth which prevented him from proving himself as genuine a warrior as his relative , the Crown Prince of Prussia . But the English people only saw that the Duke went out to the war and very quickly came back again . Julius Clesar or the First Napoleon or General Sherman might have had fo do the same thing under the same circumstances ; but then these more lucby soldiers did not have to do it , and therefore were able to prove their military capacity . One thing very certain is , that without such good fortune and such proof of capacity neither Ca*sar , Napoleon , nor Sherman would ever have been made commander-inchief , and therein again they were unlike the Duke of Cambridge . For it was not long after the Duke 's return home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now quite remembQr which ) of Viscount Hardinge , our heavy " George " was made Commander-in-Chief of the British army . I venture to think that , taking all the conditions of the time and the appointment into consideration , no more unreasonable , no more unjustifiable instance of military promotion was ever seen in England . For observe , that the worst thing about the appointment of the Duke of Cambridge is not that an incompetent person obtains by virtue of his rank the highest military position in the State . If this were all , there might be just the same thing said of almost every other European country-indeed , of almost every other country . The King of Prussia was Commander-in-Chief of the armies of North Germany , but no one supposed that he was really competent to discharge all the duties of such a position . Abraham Lincoln was Commander-in-Chief of the Federal army , by virtue of his office of President ; but no one supposed that his military knowledge and capacity would ever have recommended him to such a post . The appointment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political convenience and propriety . It did not seem wise or even safe that the supreme military authority should be formally intrusted to any one but the ruler or the President . It was thoroughly understood that the duties of the office were discharged by some professional expert , for whose work the King or the President was responsible to the nation . But the office of Commander-in-Chief of the English army is something quite different from this . It is understood to be a genuine office , the occupant actually doing the work and having the authority . In the lifetime of the Duke of Wellington the country had the services of the very best Commander-in-Chief England could have selected . The sound and wise principle which dictated that appointment is really the principle on which the office is based in England . The Commander-in-Chief is not regarded , as on the Continent , in the light of an ornamental president of a great bureau whose duties are done by others , but as the most efficient military officer , the man best qualified to do the work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was General Seymour Conway . When in 1828 the Duke of Wellington became Prime Minister , and therefore resigned the command of the army , Lord Hill was placed at the head of military affairs . The Duke of Wellington resumed the command in 1842 and held it to his death , when it was given to Viscount Hardinge , a capable man . The title of the office was not , I believe , actually " Commander-in-Chief , " but " General Commandingin-Chief . " It was , if I remember rightly , owing to the disasters arising out of military mismanagement in the Crimea , that the changes were made which created a distinct Secretary of War and gave to the office of Commander-inChief its present title . Therefore it will be seen that the intrusting the command of the army to the Duke of Cambridge is not even justifiable on the // ground that it follows an old established custom . It is , on the contrary , an innovat*on , and one which illustrates the worst possible principle . There is noth. * ing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When Viscount Hardinge died , if the principle adopted in his case-that of appointing the best man to the place .. - had been still in favor , there were many military generals in England , any one of whom would have filled the office with efficiency and credit . But the superstition of rank prevailed . TML Duke of Wellington is believed to have once recommended that on his death Prince Albert , the Queen 's husband , should be created Commander-in-Chiefi Ridiculous as the suggestion may seem , it would probably have been a far better arrangement than that which was more recently adopted . Prince Albert could hardly have been called a professional soldier at all ; and this would have been greatly in his favor . For he would have filled the place merely as the King of Prussia does ; he would have intrusted the actual duties to some qualified man , and being endowed with remarkable judgment , temper , and discretion , he would doubtless have found the right man for the work . But the Duke of Cambridge , as a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform and does perform the duties of his office , after his own fashion . He is too high in rank to be openly rebuked , contradicted , or called to account ; he is nOt high enough to be accepted as a mere official ornament or figurehead . He is too much of a professional general to become willingly the pupil and instrument of a more skilled subordinate ; too little of a professional general to render his authority of any real value , or to be properly qualified for any high military position . So the Duke of Cambridge did actually direct the affairs of the army , interfered in everything , was supreme in everything , and I think it is not too much to say , mismanaged everything . He stood in the way of all useful reforms ; he sheltered old abuses ; he was as dictatorial as though he had the military genius of a Wellington or a Von Moltke ; he was as independent of Rublic opinion as the Mikado of Japan . The kind of mistakes which were made and abuses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract much of the attention or interest of the newspapers . In England the press , moreover , is not supposed to be at liberty to criticise princes . Of late some little efforts at daring innovation are made in this direction ; but as a rule , unless a prince does something very wrong indeed , he is secure from any censure or even criticism on the part of the newspapers . There was , besides , one great practical difficulty in the way of tiny one inclined to criticise the military administration of the Duke of Cambridge . The War Department in England had grown to be a kind of anomalous two-headed institution . There is a Secretary of War , who sits in the House of Lords or the House of Commons , as the case may be , and whom every one can challenge , criticise , and censure as he pleases . There is the Commander-in-Chief . Which of these two functionaries is the superior ? The theory of course is that the Secretary of War is supreme ; that he is responsible to Parliament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But everybody in England knows that this is not the actual case . There stands in Pall Mall , not far from the residence of the Prince of Wales , a plain business-like structure , with a statue of the late Lord Herbert of Lea ( the Sidney Herbert of Crimean days ) in front of it ; and this is the War Office , where the Secretary of War is in power . But there is in Whitehall another building far better known to Londoners and strangers alike ; an old-fashioned , unlovely , shabby-looking sort of barrack , with a clock in its shapeless cupola and two small arches in its front , in each of which enclosures sits all day a gigantic horseman in steel cuirass and high jack-boots . The country visitor comes here // 1871. to wonder at the size and the accoutrements of the splendid soldiers ; the nursery-maid loves the spot , and gazes with open mouth and sparkling eyes at the athletic cavaliers , and too often , like Hylas sent with his urn to the foun* tam , " *roftositoftorem pr*tulit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing before** her to the duty of watching her infantile charge in the Verambulator . This building is the famous " Horse Guards , " where the Com* mander-in-Chief is enthroned . I suppose the theory of the thing was , that while ' the army system was to be shaped out and directed in the War Office , the actual details of practical administration were to be managed at the Horse Guards . But of late years the relations of th*two departments appear to have got into an almost inextricable and hopeless muddle , so that no one can pretend to say where the responsibility of the War Office ends or the authority of the Horse Guards begins . The Duke of Cambridge , it is said , habitually acts upon his own authority and ignores the War Office altogether . Things are done by him of which the Secretary for War knows nothing until they are done . The late Sidney Herbert , a man devoted to the duties of the War Department , over which he presided for some years , once emphatically refused during a debate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step taken at the Horse Guards , by pleading that it was made without the knowledge of the War Office . He declared that he considered himself , as War Secretary , responsible to Parliament for everything done in any office of the War Department . But it was quite evident from the tone of his speech that the thing had been done without his knowledge or consent , and that if anybody but the Queen 's cousin had done it there would have been a " row in the building . " Now Sidney Herbert was an aristocrat of high rank , of splendid fortune , of unsurpassed social dignity and influence , of great political talents and reputation . If he then could not attempt to control and rebuke the Queen 's cousin , how could such an attempt be expected from a man like Mr. Cardwell , the present War Secretary ? Mr. Cardwell is a dull , steady-going , respectable man , who*has no pretension to anything like the rank , social influence , or even popularity of Sidney tlerbert . In fact , the War Secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cambridge that a New York judge occasionally holds toward one of the great leaders of the bar who pleads before him and is formally supposed to acknowledge his superior authority . The person holding the position nominally superior feels himself in reality c*uite " over'cro*ved , ' to use a Spenserian expression , by the influence , importance , and dignity of the other . Let any stranger in London who happens to be in the gallery of the House of Lords , observe the astonishing deference with which even a pure-blooded marquis or earl of antique title will receive the greeting of the Duke of Cambridge ; and then say what chance there is of a War Secretary , who probably belongs to the middle or manufacturing classes , venturing to dictate to or rebuke so tremendous a magn*flco . Lately an audacious critic of the I ) uke has started up in the person of a clever , vivacious young member of Parliament , George Otto Trevelyan , son of one of the ablest Indian administrators and nephew of Lord Macaulay . Trevelyan once held , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has lately been horrifying the conservatism and veneration of English society by boldly making speeches in which he attacks the Queen 's cousin , declares that the latter is an injury and nuisance to the army system , that he stands in the way of all improvement , and that he ought to be abolished . But although most people do profoundly and potently believe what this saucy Trevelyan says , yet his words find little echo in public debate , and his direct motions in the House of Commons have been unsuccessful . The Duke , I perceive , has lately , however , de // scended so far from his position of supreme dignity as to defend himself in a public speech , and to claim the merit of having always been a progressive and indeed rather daring army reformer . But I do not believe the English Government or Parliament would ever have ventured to take one step to lessen the Duke of Cambridge 's power of doing harm to the military service , were it not for the pressure of events with which England had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong for the resistance even of princes and of vested interests . The practical dethronement of the Duke of Cambridge I hold to be as certain as any mortal event still in the future can well be declared . The anomaly , the inconvenience , the degrada&amp;in which English Governments and Parliaments would have endured forever if left to themselves , may be regarded as destined to be swept *iway by the same flood which overwhelmed the military organization of France , and washed the Bonapartes off the throne of the Tuileries . The Duke of Cambridge too had to surrender at Sedan . For with the overwhelming successes of Prussia and the unparalleled collapse of France , there arose in England so loud and general a cry for the reorganization of the decaying old army system that no Government could possibly attempt to disregard it . Mr. Gladstone 's Cabinet had the sense and spirit to see that no middle course of reform would be worth anything . Zn medlo Iuti.rsimus ibis would never apply to this case . Any reform must count on the obstinate opposition of vested interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to bear down that opposition would be by introducing a reform so thorough and grand as to carry with it the enthusiasm of popular support . Therefore the Government have undertaken a new work of revolution , certainly not less bold than that which overthrew the Irish Chnrch , and destined perhaps to have a still more decisive influence on the political organization of English society . One of the many changes this measure will introduce  --  and it is certain to be carried , first or last-will be the extinction of the anomaly now represented by the position of the Duke of Cambridge . I shall not inflict any of the details of the measure upon my readers in THE GALAXY , and shall even give but slight attention to such of its main features as are of purely military character and import . But I shall endeavor briefly to make it clear that some of the changes it proposes to introduce will have a profound influence on the political and social condition of England , and are in fact steps in that great English revolution which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of the purchase system as regards the commissions held by military officers . Except in certain regiments , and certain branches of the service outside England itself , the rule is that an officer obtains his commis* sion by purchase . Promotion can be bought in the same way . A commission is a vested interest . The owner has paid so much for it , and expects to sell it for an equal sum . The regulation price recognized by law and the Horse Guards is by no means the actual price of the article . It is worth ever so much more to the holder , and he must of course have its real , not its regulation value . The pay in the English army is , for the officers , ridiculously small . The habits of the army , among officers , are ridiculously expensive . An officer is not expected to live upon his pay . Whether expected to do so or not , he could hardly accomplish the feat under any conditions ; under the common conditions of an officers ' mess-room the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask himself what becomes of a department of the public service where you obtain admission by payment , and where when admitted you receive practically no remuneration ? Of course it becomes a mere club and association for the wealthy and aristocratic ; a brotherhood into which admission is sought for the // sake of social distinction . Every man of rank in England will , as a matter of course , have one of his sons in the army . It is the right sort of thing to do , like hunting or going into the House of Commons . Then , on the other hand , every person who has made money sends one of his sons into the army , because thereby he acquires a stamp of gentility . Poverty and merit have no chance and no business there . It certainly is not true , as is commonl*y believed here , that promotion from the ranks never takes place ; but speak*g of the system as a whole , one may fairly say that promotion from the ranks is opposed to the ordinary regulation , and occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration here . Therefore the English army . became an essentially aristocratic service . To be an officer was the right of the aristocratic , the luxury , ambition , and ornament of the wealthy . One is almost afraid now to venture on saying anything in praise of the French military system ; but it had , if I do not greatly mistake , one regulation ambng others which hdnorably distinguished it from the English . I believe it was not permitted to a wealthy officer to distinguish himself from his fellows while in barracks by extravagance of expenditure . He had to live as the others lived . But the English system allowed full scope to wealth , and the result was tl*t certain regiments prided themselves on luxury and ostentation , and a poor man , or even a man of moderate means , could not live in them . Add to all this that while the expenses were great and the pay next to nothing , there were certain valuable prizes , sinecures , and monopolies to be had in the army , which favoritism and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable that the control of the military organization should be retained in the hands of the aristocracy . John Bright described the military and diplomatic services of England as " a gigantic system of outdoor relief for the broken-down members of the British aristocracy . " This was especially true of the military service , which had a large number of rich and pleasant prizes to be awarded at the uncontrolled discretion of the authorities . It might be fairly said that every aristocratic family had at least one scion in the army . Every aristocratic family had likewise one in the House of Commons ; sometimes two , or three , or four sons and nephews . The mere numerical strength of the military officers who had seats in the House of Coinmons was enough to hold up a tremendous barrier in the way of army reform or political reform . It was as clear as light that a popular Parliament would among its very first works of reformation proceed to throw open the army to the competition of merit , independently of either aristocratic rank or moneyed influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some few and remarkable exceptions , steady Tories and firm opponents of all reform either in the army or the political system . Year after year did gallant old De Lacy Evans bring forward his motion for the abolition of the purchase system in vain . He was always met by the supposed practical authority of the great bulk of the military members and by the dead weight of aristocratic influence and vested interests . The army , as then organized , was at once the fortress and the trophy of the English aristocracy . At last the effort at reform seemed to be given up altogether . Though humane reformers did at last succeed in getting rid of the detestable system of flogging in the army , the practice of trafficking in commissions seemed safer than ever . One difficulty in the way of its abolition was always pressed with special emphasis by persons who otherwise were prodigal enough of the public money  --  the cost such a measure would entail on the people of England . It would be impossible , of course , to abolish such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissions which thenceforward could be sold no more . The amount of money required for such compensation // would be some fbrty millions of dollars . Moreover , when commissions are given away among all classes according to merit , the pay of officers will have to be raised . It would indeed be a cruel mockery to give poor Claude Melnotte an officer 's rank if he does not at the same time get pay enough to enable him to live . Therefore for once the English aristocrats and Tories were heard to raise their voices in favor of the saving of public money ; but they were only assuming the attitude of economists for the sa* -- of upholding their own privileges and defending their vested interests . There will , of course , be a fierce and long fight made even still against the change , but the change , I take it , will be accomplished . The English army will cease to be an army officered exclusively from among the ranks of the aristocracy and the wealthy . Our time has seen no step attempted in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly realize to my mind what England will be like when commissions and promotions in its military service are the recognized prizes of merit in whatever rank of life , and are won by open competition . Next , the English Government , approaching rather delicately the difficulty about the Commander-in-Chief ; propose to unite the two departments of the service under one roof . The Commander-in-Chief and his staff and offices will be transferred from the Horse Guards in Whiteh4ll to th' War Office in Pall Mall , and placed more directly under the control of the Secretary of War . This change must inevitably bring about the end at . which it aims - the abolition of the embarrassing and injurious dualism of system now prevailing . It must indeed reduce the General commanding-in-chief to his proper position as the executive officer of the War Secretary , who is himself the servant of Parliament . Such a position would entail no restriction whatever on the military capacity or genius of the Commander-in-Chief were he another Marlborough ; but it would make him responsible to somebody who is himself responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken for granted that this will come to mean , sooner or later , the shelving of the Duke of Cambridge . It may be hoped that he will not consider it consistent with his dignity as a member of the royal family to remain in a position thus made virtually that of a subordinate . Some other place perhaps will be found for the cousin of the Queen . I have . already heard some talk about the possibility and propriety of sending his Royal Highness as Lord Lieutenant to govern Ireland . Why not ? There is a vile corpus convenient and ready to hand for any experiment . It would be quite in keeping with all the traditions of English rule , with the practice which was illustrated only a few years ago when the noisy and brainless scamp Sir Robert Peel , whom " Punch " christened " The Mountebank Member , " was made Irish Secretary , if the Duke of Cambridge were allowed to soothe his offended dignity by practising his skilful hand on the government of Ireland . Finally , the Government propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible the regular and irregular forces of the country . There are in England three classes of soldiery  --  the regular army , the militia , and the volunteers . The militia constitute a force as nearly as possible corresponding with that in whose companionship Sir John Falstaff declined to march through Coventry . Bombastes Furioso or the Grande Duchesse hardly ever marshalled such a body of men as may be seen when a British militia regiment is turned out for exercise . Awkward country bumpkins and beer-swilling rowdies of the poacher class make up the bulk of the privates . They are a terror to any small town where they may happen to be exercising , and where not infrequently they finish up a day 's drill by a general smashing of windows , sacking of shops , and plundering of inhabitants . The volunteers are a force composed // of a much better class of men , and are capable , I think , of great military efficiency and service if properly organized . Of late the volunteer force has , I believe , been growing somewhat demoralized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position was hardly defined , and the national enthusiasm out of which it sprang naturally began to languish . We in England have always owed our volunteer force to some sudden menace or dread of French invasion . It was so in the time of William Pitt* We all remember the famous sarcasm with which that statesman replied to the request of some volunteer regiments not to be sent out on foreign service . Pitt gravely assured them that they never should be sent out of the country unless in case of England 's invasion . Erskine was a volunteer , and I thihk it was as an officer of volunteers that Gibbon said he acquired a practical knowledge of military affairs , which proved useful to him in describing the decline and fall of the Roman empire . Our present volunteer service originated in the last of the " three panics " described by Cobden  --  the fear of invasion by Louis Napoleon , the panic which Tennyson endeavored to foment by his weak and foolish " Form , form ! Riflemen , form ! " The volunteer force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm had died away ; and even though recently the progress of improvement seems to have been somewhat checked , and the volunteer body to have become lax in its organization , it appears to me that in its intelligence , its earnestness , and its physical capacity there exists the material out of which might be moulded a very valuable arm of the military service . The War Minister now proposes to take steps which shall render the militia a decent body , commanded by really qualified and responsible officers , which shall give better officers to the volunteers , and place these latter under more effective discipline , and which shall bring militia and volunteers into closer relationship with the regular army . How far these objects may be attained by the measures now under consideration I do not pretend to judge ; but I can not regard the present War Minister as a man highly qualified for the place he holds . Mr. Cardwell is an admirable clerk-patient , plodding , untiring ; but I doubt whether he has any of the higher qualities of an administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dullest speaker holding a mark**osition in the House of Commons . He is fluent , not as Gladstone and a river are fluent , but as the sand in an hour-glass is fluent . That sand itself is not more dull , colorless , monotonous , and dry , than is the eloquence of the War Minister . Mr. Cardwell is not always fortunate in his military prophecies . On the memorable night in last July when the rievt 's reached London that France had declared war against Prussia , Mr. Cardwell affirmed that that meant the occupation of Berlin by the French within a month . It must be remembered , however , as an excuse for the War Minister 's unlucky prediction , that an English military commission sent to examine the two systems had shortly before reported wholly in favor of the French army organization and dead against that of Prussia . The English Government , wisely , I think , decline to attempt the introduction of any measure for general and compulsory service , except as a last resource in desperate exigencies . The England of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroil herself much in Continental quarrels ; and she may be quite expected to hold her own in the improbable event of any of her neighbors attempting to invade her . For myself , I can recollect no instance recorded by history of any foreign war wherein England took part , from which good temper , discretion , judgment , and justice would not alike have counselled her to hold aloof . Such then are in substance the changes which are proposed for the reconstruction of the English army . The one grand reform or revolution is the aboli // MAY , tion of the purchase system . This change will inevitably convert the army into a practical and regular profession , to which all classes will look as a possible means of providing for some of their children . It will have one advantage over the bar , that admission to the ranks of the officers will not necessarily involve the preliminary payment of any sum of money , however small . The profession will cease to be ornamental and aristocratic . It will no longer constitute one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sy#em of aristocracy . Its reorganization will be another and a bold step toward the establishment of that principle of equality which is of late years beginning to exercise so powerful a fascination over the popular mind of England . Caste had in Great Britain no such illustration and no such bulwark as the army system presented . I should be slow to undertake to limit the possible depth and extent of the influence which the impulse given by this reform may exerciqe over the political condition of England . I can hardly realize to myself by any effort of imagination the effect which such a change will work in what is called society in England , and in the literature , especially the romantic and satirical literature , of the country . Are we then no longer to have Rawdon Crawley , and Sir Derby Oaks , and " Captain Gandaw of the Pinks " ? Was Black-Bottle Cardigan really the last of a race ? Will people a generation hence fail to understand what was meant by the intimation that " the Tenth do n't dance " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth as Guy of Warwick ? Is the English military officer to be henceforward simply a hard-working , well- qualified public servant , who obtains his place in open competition by virtue of his merit* ? Appreciate the full meaning of the change who can , it is too much for me ; I can only wonder , admire , and hope . But it is surely not possible that the Duke of Cambridge , cousin of the Queen , can continue to preside over a service wherein the butcher , the baker , and the candlestick-maker have as good a chance of obtaining commissions for their sons as the marquis or the earl or the great millionaire . Only think of the flood of light which will be poured in upon all the details of the military organization , when once it becomes the direct interest of each of us to see that the profession is properly managed in which his own son , however poor in purse and humble in rank , has a chance of obtaining a commission ! I believe the Duke of Cambridge had and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy interference of public and unprofessional criticism where the business of the sacred Horse Guards is concerned . Once , when goaded on to sheer desperation by comments in the papers , hi* Royal Highness actually wrote or dictated a letter of explana4ioa to the " Times , " signed with the monosyllabic grandeur of his name " George , " we all held up the hands and eyes of wonder that such things had come to pass , that royal princes condescended to write to newspapers , and yet the world rolled on . I can not think the Duke will abide the awful changes that are coming . He will probably pass into the twilight and repose of some dignified office , where blundering has no occupation and obstinacy can do no harm . Everything considered , I think we may say of him that he might have been a great deal worse than he was . My*own impression is that he is rather better than his reputation . If the popular voice of England were to ask in the words of Shakespeare 's " Lucio , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a coward , as you then reported him to be ? " I might answer , in the language of the pretended friar , " You must change persons with me ere you make that my report . You indeed spoke so of him , and much more , much worse . " JUSTIN MCCARTHY .
