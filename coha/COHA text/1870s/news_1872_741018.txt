txt The peculiar sort of wickedness which finds delight in throwing railway trains off the track is difficult to explain on any basis short of total depravity or absolute insanity . And . when this abominable villainy is perpetrated by children for mere sport , one is almost inclined to give credence to that unflattering theory of human origin which finds our ancestors in the gorilla . Two or three years ago , a couple of little boys , it will be remembered , were caught obstructing the track of a Pennsylvania railway , at a spot where the destruction of the coming passenger-train was sure to be attended with fearful slaughter . When questioned as to their motives for attempting such a crime , these artless youngsters explained that they wanted to see " the funny way in which the cars would jump . " A fit play-fellow for these sportive young assassins has just been found in England , where a lad named EVANS . aged . sixteen , and described as the son of respectable parents , was not long since detected in plaoing obstructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to stop the train , which , however , passed over the obstacles in safety . Probably , in this ease also , this ingenious youth was bent merely on innocent recreation . In consoling contrast , however , to such instances of inexplioable malignity , cases are happily no leas frequent where human life is freely and generously placed in peril to avert accidents of this nature . In the same paper which records young Master EVANS ' pretty little joke , is chronicled the exploit of a brakeman named WeavOri , who , seeing two men standing on the track . unconscious of the near approach of a swift express . rushed upon them and flung them in succession off the track , and into safety , at the imminent risk of his own destruction . This , too , was the second feat of the same sort ho had performed . He had better fortune than that brave negro who , near Philadelphia , a few months ago , saved five lives in a similar way . at the expense of his own . Each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as true a hero as the leader of a forlorn hope , or the victor of many battles . Incidents like these , placed side by side , bring out in startling vividness the perplexing mass of contradictions which go to make up human nature . GOETHE once said that , examining the depths of his own soul , he could discern in himself a potential capacity for any crime . If such revelations are disheartening to the lover of his kind , there is comfort iu the reflection , enforced by examples like these , that side by side with the elements of this possible baseness are also the seeds of ail possible nobleness . And , perhaps , if we inquire into the problem shrewdly wo shall find that it is not these track-obstructers who are so much to blame for their wickedness , as society , which fails properly to foster the better side of their natures . A. more systematic development of that timely benevolence which exerts itself in the direction of Children 's Aid Societies , and Summer excursions , may go tar to diminish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible Watsons .
