txt GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVENTION : I. thank you heartily for selecting me to preside for tho present , and my acknowledgments are more grateful still for your warm and generous greeting . Deeply Is it appreciated ; long , long will ithe hold in grateful and treasured memory . Wo meet as members of a grand historic organization ? an organization in which some of us have grown old . Time with his frosty fingers has silvered many heads , but you have shown that your hearts are as young , as warm . and as true as in days that are long gone by . Reciprocating all your kindness , I accept it as an earnest of the harmony and concord which I invoke on all our proceedings , crowned , as I believe they will be , with popular approval and success . I congratulate yen on the auspicious promises of this day  --  auspicious for the Republican Party , and , for the same reasons , auspicious for the Republic . Three threatening dangers appear now in national affairs : First , the pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; third , hurtful designs on the Treasury , there be a fourth peril belonging to this catalogue , it is the offspring of the other three ? I mean the industrial , political , and general disturbance and madness pervading much of the South , trampling on human rights and liberty , and paralyzing and driving out the labor , which is the life-blood of its existence . Financially , the country needs nothing so much now as to be saved from Congressional meddling and tampering . Despite the depression caused by an exhausting war , and paper in addition , we have regained much lost ground , and entered anew on a career of sure and stable prosperity , general health , and strength . Yet this very abundance seems for the time to work hardship in some instances . Over-production depresses particular industries and localities  --  the dairy interest in this State , for example . But time and sense and justly-regulated freights will set all this even , and tinkering the currency will only aggravate the evil . What we need is that Congress , conventions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , and business march on . The turning  --  point of financial safety was passed five years ago . in 1874 an act of Congress made its way through both houses under which we should have drifted on a shoreloss and soundless sea of irredeemable paper . The death of this inflation act was the birth of the Resumption act , and of actual resumption of specie payment . After it had passed both houses the act was strangled by a quiet man , a man quiet alike under calumny or praise . It was vetoed by President Grant . Immediately after this veto a committee , composed wholly of Republican Senators , framed the law under which the people , by their enterprise , industry , and integrity , have established an unrivaled credit throughout all lands , and made every paper aollar as good as gold . This law , drawn by Republicans , received every Republican vote in the Senate . Every Democrat who voted voted against it . A Republican President signed it . The Democrats derided and denounced it . The National Democratic Convention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it has barely escaped repeal . It fixed the 1st of January as the day when every paper dollar should be redeemable and redeemed in money  --  hard money . Universal and unanimous Democratic assertion pronounced it absurd and impossible . There wore no end of reasons why it never would or could be done . The day came , and without strain , jar , or harm of any kind , resumption of specie payments came as easily and noiselessly as night molts i into day . Vast savings of interest on the national debt and settling down to the confidence of business interests everywhere are the incidents and results of this fortunate event . It is fair and wise , in viewing this matter , to view it as a test between the two parties  --  a test of the capacity and wisdom in affairs . If let alone by politicians and men with political schemes and hobbies , our currency and finances will be safe , and better from this time on than they have been for many years . Republican ascendency will assure this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the States vote and be counted , Republican ascendency would be easy and very sure ; but all voters can not vote and be counted . The dogma of State rights , the same heresy which has once drenched our land in blood and buried it in taxes , again uplifts itself , and grasps at dominion . It declares now that the national authority has no right to protect n national election . This means that in several States there shall bo no free election or count . To bring this iniquity to pass , the Democratic Party has shrunk from nothing . The majority in Congress took the Government by the throat and threatened to choke it to death , unless the President would give rip his judgment , his conscience , and his oath , and forswear himself by signing bills to overthrow laws which he knew to be just and needful . Despite all resistance , serious and alarming progress was made in this plot of nullification and destruction . Jury laws 80 years old wore prostrated , and the jury-box is hereafter to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent jury legislation is corrected wo are not lixely to see punishment fall , in the South , on any crime done in violation of the thirteenth , fourteenth , or fifteenth amendments , or against the laws enforcing them . This gives violence new impunity and scope on election day and on every other day , and so it becomes a political engine . The Army has been manacled , and ancient laws providing for the preservation of the peace have been nullified , and yet , all the rifle clubs , white leagues , and banded desperadoes have been left free to surround and garrote the polls and turn elections into a brutal farce . Amendments curbing such lawless forces were offered and voted down by the vote of every Democratic Senator . Four of the Southern States are Republican by large majorities . Two more are probably Republican with a fair vote and count , but even the law providing civil police officers to protect the citizen on election day has been , and will bo , nullfied so as to give free course to violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no contested Presidential election next year . Some man may contest the office of Sheriff , though even this has been forbidden by murder . A Congressional district may see a bolting Democrat strive against the regular nominee , but no Presidential election worthy the name will he allowed in the Southern Republican States . Whoever may be the Democratic nominee , every Electoral vote in the South will be registered for him . Thls done , but 47 Electoral votes are needed in all the Northern States ; from sea to sea . New-York has 35 of these hoped-for votes , and it was for New-York in the past that the Election laws have been prostrated and are to be further prostrated next Winter . NowYork thus stands in the fore-front of great danger , great responsibility , and great opportunity . NowYork will decide the great contest of 1880 . Her action this year will go far to decide it . Her action this year will go far to decide whetuer the next Congress is to be governed by the tax-paying or the non-tax-paying States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of the National Treasury , and the financial safety and stability of the country . Not to speak of State issues , grave as they are , the last thing in the interest of the nation must hinge largely on the action of this State in the coming election . Is there a Republican , be his preference for one man or one candidate or another , who will not at such a crisis stand by the foundation-stones of his faith ? Is those a Republican who will connive at the rupture of the National Government by a solid South , dominated by ? the same men ' who , in the name of State rights , draped the land in mourning , and who now seek to make State rights rise again and trample the graves of our heroic dead. ? is there a Republican who , between his country and his creed on one side , and some trivial prejudice on the other , would turn his back on creed and country 1 There is no suet Republican , and , therefore , no one have I offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeec on every living issue . Last year , and the year betorel this was not so true as it is now . Time make ; us all wiser , and things we have dif fered about heretofore have been settle ( by events . No'matter who was right or who win mistaken or deceived ? if any one was  --  faith and ex perience have made us whole . Many who have op posed us in the past have become convinced the , Democratic success , which means Southern domiva tion now , is not wise or safe . I speak not of man agora or contending leaders , but of men of lave beads who think and look beyond the present With such a ticket and such a platform a , we shall present , we can fail to carry tin State only by inaction and neglect . There wil be no inaction or neglect this year , The duty is to high and too urgent , the occasion is too great and too vital . The feeling and convictions of Repub beans are ? too deep . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave up their bravest and their best , will not fold their hands it ignoble supineness. when all they won in battle is peril of being snatched away . New-York must stall this year at the head of the Republican column ; to this end let us pledge ourselves and each other . When Mr. Conkling had finished speaking ho me greeted with loud applause .
