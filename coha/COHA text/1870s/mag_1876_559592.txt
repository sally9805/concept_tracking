OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . I. A FEW years ago I received from the friend to whom they had been addressed a collection of my own letters , written during a period of forty years and amounting to thousands - a history of my life . It has occurred to me that when I am dead some ingenious person may undertake to publish some record of me , similar to those with which the more celebrated members of my family have been honored . Sketches and notices ( more or less mendacious and veracious ) I have already been favored with , and so I think my " post mortem examination " a not impossible event . My letters constitute a ready written autobiography ; and though it would not be easy to find a less important or valuable subject for literary illustration than myself , they contain reminiscences of people and events that may have interest for some of my contemporaries , and furnish entertainment to those who come after me . The passion for universal history ( i. e. any and every body 's story ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollections good enough to be printed and read ; and as the public appetite for gossip appears to be insatiable , and is not unlikely some time or other to be gratified at my expense , I have thought that my own gossip about myself may be as acceptable to it as gossip about me written by another . I have come to the garrulous time of life - to the remembering days , which only by a little precede the forgetting ones ; I have much leisure , and feel sure that it will amuse me to write my own reminiscences ; perhaps reading them may amuse others who have no more to do than I have . To the idle , then , I offer these lightest of leaves gathered in the idle end of autumn days , which have succeeded years of labor often severe and sad enough , though its ostensible purpose was only that of affording recreation to the public . There are two lives of my aunt Siddons , one by Boaden and one by the poet Campbell . In these biographies due mention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , Mrs. Roger Kemble , I am proud to see , by Lawrence 's portrait of her , I bear a personal resemblance ; and I please myself with imagining that the likeness is more than " skin deep . " She was an energetic , brave woman , who , in the humblest sphere of life and most difficult circumstances , together with her husband fought manfully a hard battle with poverty , in maintaining and as well as they could training a family of twelve children , of whom four died in childhood . But lam persuaded that whatever qualities of mind or character I inherit from my father 's family , I am more strongly stamped with those which I derive from my mother , a woman who , possessing no specific gift in such perfection as the dramatic talent of the Kembles , had in a higher degree than any of them the peculiar organization of genius . To the fine senses of a savage rather than a civilized nature , she joined an acute instinct of correct criticism in all matters of art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividness of expression , that made her conversation delightful . Had she possessed half the advantages of education which she and my father labored to bestow upon us , she would , I think , have been one of the most remarkable persons of her time . My mother was the daughter of Captain Decamp , an officer in one of the armies that revolutionary France sent to invade Switzerland . He married the daughter of a farmer from the neighborhood of Berne . From my grandmother 's home you could see the great Yungfrau 152 August , // range of the Alps , and I sometimes wonder whether it is her blood in my veins that so loves and longs for those supremely beautiful mountains . Not long after his marriage my grandfather went to Vienna , where , on the anniversary of the birth of the great Empress-King , my mother was born , and named , after her , Maria Theresa . In Vienna , Captain IJecamp made the acquaintance of a young English nobleman , Lord Monson ( afterwards the Earl of Essex ) , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accomplished Frenchman to come and settle in London , where his talents as a draughtsman and musician , which were much above those of a mere amateur , combined with the protection of such friends as he could not fail to find , would easily enable him to maintain himself and his youn0 wife and child . In evil hour my grandfather adopted this advice , and came to England . It was the time when the emigration of the French nobility had filled London with objects of sympathy , and society with sympathizers with their misfortunes . Among the means resorted to for assisting the many interesting victims of the Revolution were representations , given under the direction of Le Texier , of Berquin 's and Madame Dc Genlis 's juvenile dramas , by young French children . These performances , combined with his own extraordinary readings , became one of the fashionable fancies of the day . I quote from Walter Scott 's review of Boaden 's life of my uncle the following notice of Le Texier : " On one of these incidental topics we must pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the readings of the celebrated Le Texier , who , seated at a desk and dressed in plain clothes , read French plays with such modulation of voice and such exquisite point of dialogue as to form a pleasure different from that of the theatre , but almost as great as we experience in listening to a first-rate actor . We have only to add to a very good account given by Mr. Boaden of this extraordinary entertainment , that when it commenced , Mr. Le Texier read over the dramatis persona ? , with the little analysis of character usually attached to each name , using the voice and manner with which he afterwards read the part ; and so accurate was the key-note given that he had no need to name afterwards the person who spoke ; the stupidest of the audience could not fail to recognize them . " Among the little actors of Le Texier 's troupe , my mother attracted the greatest share of public attention by her beauty and grace , and the truth and spirit of her performances . The little French fairy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snatched up into their society , where she was fondled and fooled and petted and played with ; passing whole days in Mrs. Fitzherbert 's drawing-room , and many a half-hour on the knees of her royal and disloyal husband , the prince regent , one of whose favorite jokes was to place my mother under a huge glass bell , made to cover some large group of precious Dresden china , where her tiny figure and flashing face produced even a more beautiful effect than the costly work of art whose crystal covering was made her momentary cage . I have often heard my mother refer to this season of her childhood 's favoritism with the fine folk of that day , one of her most vivid impressions of which was the extraordinary beauty of person and royal charm of manner and deportment of the Prince of Wales , and - his enormous appetite : enormous perhaps , after all , only by comparison with her own , which he compassionately used to pity , saying frequently , when she declined the delicacies that he pressed upon her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed you with an appetite . " Of the precocious feeling and imagination of the poor little girl , thus taken out of her own sphere of life into one so different and so dangerous , I remember a very curious instance , told me by herself . One of the houses where she was a most frequent visitor , and treated almost like a child of the family , was that of Lady Rivers , whose brother , Mr. Rigby , while in the mm18Th. 1*3 // istry , fought a duel with some political opponent . Mr. Rigby had taken great notice of the little French child treated with such affectionate familiarity by his sister , and she had attached herself so strongly to him that on hearing the circumstance of his duel suddenly mentioned for the first time , she fainted away : a story that always reminded me of the little Spanish girl Florian mentions in his M*moires d'un jeune Espagnol , who at six years of age , having asked a youn* man of upwards of five-and-twenty if he loved her , so resented his repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be induced to speak to him again . Meantime , while the homes of the great and gay were her constant resort , the child 's home was becoming sadder , and her existence and that of her pareats more precarious and penurious day by day . From my grandfather 's first arrival in London , his chest had suffered from the climate ; the instrument he taught was the flute , and it was not long before decided disease of the lungs rendered that industry impossible . He endeavored to supply its place by giving French and drawing lessons ( I have several small sketches of his , taken in the Netherlands , the firm , free delicacy of which attest a good artist 's handling ) , and so struggled on , under the dark London sky and in the damp , foggy , smoky atmosphere , while the poor foreign wife bore and nursed four children . It is impossible to imagine anything sadder than the condition of such a family , with its dark fortune closing round and over it , and its one little human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glitter and become of hard necessity the single source of light in the growing gloom of its daily existence . And the contrast must have been cruel enough between the scenes into which the child 's genius spasmodically lifted her , both in the assumed parts she performed and in the great London world where her success in their performance carried her , and the poor home where sickness and sorrow were becoming abiding inmates , and poverty and privation the customary conditions of life : poverty and privation doubtless often increased by the very outlay necessary to fit her for her public appearances , and not seldom by the fear of offending or the hope of conciliating the fastidious taste of the wealthy and refined patrons , whose favor towards the poor little childactress might prove infinitely helpful to her and to those who owned her . The lives of artists of every description in England are not unapt to have such opening chapters as this ; but the calling of a player alone has the grotesque element of fiction , with all the fantastic accompaniments of sham splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the actor alone the livery of labor is a harlequin 's jerkin lined with tatters , and the jester 's cap and bells tied to the beggar 's wallet . I have said artist life in England is apt to have such chapters ; artist life everywhere , probably . But it is only in England , I think , that the full bitterness of such experience is felt ; for what knows the foreign artist of the inexorable element of Respectability ? In England alone is the pervading atmosphere of respectability that which artists breathe in common with all other men - respectability , that English moral climate , with its neutral tint and temperate tone , so often sneered at in these days by its new German title of Philistinism , so often deserving of the bitterest scorn in some of its inexpressibly mean manifestations - respectability , the preeminently unattractive characteristic of British existence , but which , all deductions made for its vulgar alloys , is , in truth , only the general result of the individual self-respect of individual Englishmen : a wholesome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many , where without it the recklessness bred of insecure means and obscure position would run miserable riot : a tremendous power of omnipotent compression , repression , and oppression , no doubt , quite consistent with the stern liberty whose severe beauty the people of those islands love , but absolutely incompatible with license , , 154 August , // or even lightness of life , controlling a thousand disorders rampant in societies where it does not exist ; a power which , tyrannical as it is , and ludicrously tragical as are the sacrifices sometimes exacted by it , saves especially the artist class of England from those worst forms of irregularity which characterize the Bohemianism of foreign literary , artistic , and dramatic life . Of course , the **25;627;TOOLONG , artistic temperament , which is the one most likely to be exposed to such an ordeal as that of my mother 's childhood , is also the one liable to be most injured by it , and to communicate through its influence peculiar mischief to the moral nature . It is the price of peril paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scope the exercise of the imagination through the senses , no less than for that crown of gifts , the poet 's passionate inspiration , speaking to the senses through the imagination . How far my mother was hurt by the combination of circumstances that influenced her childhood , I know not . As I remember her , she was a frank , fearless , generous , and unworldly woman , and had probably found in the subsequent independent exercise of her abilities the shield for these virtues . How much the passionate , vehement , susceptible , and most suffering nature was banefully fostered at the same time , I can better judge from the sad vantage ground of my own experience . After six years spent in a bitter struggle with disease and difficulties of every kind , my grandfather , still a young man , died of consumption , leaving a widow and five little children , of whom the eldest , my mother , not yet in her teens , became from that time the bread-winner and sole support . Nor was it many years before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fulfilling the promise of her childish years by performances of such singular originality as to deserve the name of genuine artistic creations , and which have hardly ever been successfully attempted since her time : such as The Blind Boy , and Deaf and Dumb ; the latter , particularly in its speechless power and pathos of expression , resembling the celebrated exhibitions of Parisot and Bigottini , in the great tragic ballets in which dancing was a subordinate element to the highest dramatic effects of passion and emotion expressed by pantomime . After her marriage , my mother remained but a few years on the stage , to which she bequeathed , as specimens of her ability as a dramatic writer , the charming English version of La jeune Femine cokre , called The Day after the Wedding ; the little burlesque of Personation , of which her own exquisitely humorous performance , aided by her admirably pure French accent , has never been equaled ; and a play in five acts called Smiles and Tears , taken from Mrs. Opie 's tale of Father and Dau0hter . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate musical ear ; she moved so gracefully that I have known persons wh&amp;went to certain provincial promenades frequented by her , only to see her walk ; she was a capital horsewoman ; her figure was beautiful , and her face very handsome and strikingly expressive ; and she talked better , with more originality and vivacity , than any Englishwoman I have ever known : to all which good gifts she added that of being a first-rate cook . And oh , how often and how bitterly , in my transatlantic household tribulations , have I deplored that her apron had not fallen on my shoulders , or round my waist I Whether she derived this taste and talent from her French blood , I know not , but it amounted to genius , and might have made her a preeminent cordon bleu , if she had not been the wife , and chef-fe , of a poor professional gentleman , whose moderate means were so skillfully turned to account in her provision for his modest table that he was accused by ill-natured people of indulging in the expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless supplies of potted gravies , sauces , meat jellies , game jellies , fish jellies , the white ranges of which filled the shelves of her store-room , - which 1875. 155 // she laughingly called her boudoir , - almost to the exclusion of the usual currant jellies and raspberry jams of such receptacles : for she had the real bon vivant 's preference of the savory to the sweet , and left all the latter branch of the art to her subordinates , confining the exercise of her own talents , or immediate superintendence , to the production of the above-named " elegant extracts . " She never , I am sorry to say , encouraged either my sister or myself in the same useful occupation , alleging that we had what she called better ones ; but I would joyfully , many a time in America , have exchanged all my boarding-school smatterings for her knowledge how to produce a wholesome and palatable dinner . As it was , all I learned of her , to my sorrow , was a detestation of bad cookery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesomer and more economical than any other . Dr. Kitchener , the clever and amiable author of that amusing book The Cook 's Oracle ( his name was a bona Jide appellation , and not a drolly devised appropriate nom de plume , and he was a doctor of music and not physic ) , was a great friend and admirer of hers ; and she is the " accomplished lady " by whom several pages of that entertaining kitchen companion were furnished to him . The mode of opening one of her chapters , " I always bone my meat " ( bone being the slang word of . the day for seal ) , occasioned much merriment among her friends , and such a look of ludicrous surprise and reprobation from Liston , when he read it , as I still remember . My mother , moreover , devised a most admirable kind of jujube , made of clarified gum-arabic , honey , and lemon , with which she kept my father supplied during all the time of his remaining on the stage ; he never acted without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining the voice and relieving the throat under constant exertion than any other preparation that he ever tried : this she always made for him herself . The great actors of my family have received their due of recorded admiration ; my mother has always seemed to me to have been overshadowed by their celebrity ; my sister and myself , whose fate it has been to bear in public the name they have made distinguished , owe in great measure to her , I think , whatever ability has enabled us to do so not unworthily . I was born on the 27th of November , 1809 , in Newman Street , Oxford Road , the third child of my parents , whose eldest , Philip , named after my uncle , died in infancy . The second , John Mitchell , lived to distinguish himself as a scholar , devoting his life to the study of his own language and the history of his country in their earliest period , and to the kindred subject of Northern Archteology . Of Newman Street I have nothing to say , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there my father was convicted , during an absence of my mother 's from town , of having planted in my baby bosom the seeds of personal vanity , while indulging his own , by having an especially pretty and becoming lace cap at hand in the drawing-room , to be immediately substituted for some more homely daily adornment when I was exhibited to his visitors . In consequence ( probably ) of which , I am a disgracefully dress-loving old woman of near seventy , one of whose minor miseries is that she can no longer find any lace cap whatever that is either pretty or becomin0 to her gray head . li my father had not been so foolish then , I should not be so foolish now , - perhaps . The famous French actress Mlle. Clairon , recalled , for the pleasure of some foreign royal personage passing through Paris , for one night to the stage , which she had left many years before , was extremely anxious to recover the pattern of a certain cap which she had worn in her young days , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat . The cap , as she wore it , had been a Parisian rage ; she declared that half her success in the part had been the cap . The milliner who had made it , and whose fortune it had made , had retired from business , grown old ; luckily , however , was not dead : she was hunted up // and adjured to reproduce , if possible , this marvel of her art , and came to her former patroness , bringing with her the identical head-gear . Clairon seized upon it : " Ah oni , c'est bien cela ! c'est bien Us le bonnet ! " It was on her head in an instant , and she before the glass , in vain trying to reproduce with it the wellremembered effect . She pished and pshawed , frowned and shrugged , pulled the pretty chiffon this way and that on her forehead ; and while so doing , coming nearer and nearer to the terrible looking - glass , suddenly stopped , looked at herself for a moment in silence , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed , " Ah , c'est bien le bonnet ! mais cc n'est plus la figure ! " Our next home , after Newman Street , was at a place called Westbourne Green , now absorbed into endless avenues of " palatial ' * residences , which scoff with regular-featured , lofty scorn at the rural simplicity implied by such a name . The site of our dwelling was not far from the Paddington Canal , and was then so far out of town that our nearest neighbors , people of the name of Cockrell , were the owners of a charming residence in the middle of park-like grounds , of which I still have a faint , pleasurable remembrance . The young ladies , daughters of Mr. Cockrell , really made the first distinct mark I can detect on the tabula rasa of my memory , by giving me a charming pasteboard figure of a little girl , to whose serene and sweetly smiling countenance , and pretty person , a whole book full of painted pasteboard petticoats , cloaks , and bonnets could be adapted ; it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image of rustic beauty and simplicity . I still bless the Miss Cockrells , if they are alive , but if not , their memory , for it ! Of the curious effect of dress in producing the sentiment of a countenance , no better illustration can be had than a series of caps , curls , wreaths , ribbons , etc. , painted so as to be adaptable to one face ; the totally different character imparted by a helmet or a garland of roses , to the same set of features , is a " caution " to irregular beauties who console themselves with the fascinating variety of their expresszon . At this period of my life , I have been informed , I began , after the manner of most clever children , to be exceedingly troublesome and unmanageable , my principal crime being a general audacious contempt for all authority , which , coupled with a sweet-tempered , cheerful indifference to all punishment , made it extremely difficult to know how to obtain of me the minimum quantity of obedience indispensable in the relations of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cried , I never sulked , I never resented , lamented , or repented either my ill-doings or their ill-consequences , but accepted them alike with a philosophical buoyancy of spirit which was the despair of my poor , bewildered trainers . Being hideously decorated once with a fool 's cap of vast dimensions , and advised to hide , not my " diminished head , " but my horrible disgrace , from all beholders , I took the earliest opportunity of dancing down the carriage-drive to meet the postman , a great friend of mine , and attract his observation and admiration to my " helmet , " which I called aloud upon all wayfarers also to contemplate , until removed from an elevated bank I had selected for this public cxliibition of myself and my penal costume , which was beginning to attract a small group of passers-by . My next malefactions were met with an infliction of bread and water , which I joyfully accepted , observing , " Now I am like those poor dear French prisoners , that everybody pities so . " Mrs. Siddons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in one day when I had committed some of my daily offenses against manners or morals , and I was led , nothing daunted , into her awful presence , to be admonished by her . Melpomene took me upon her lap , and , bending upon mc her " controlling frown , " discoursed to me of my evil ways in those accents which curdled the blood of the poor shopman , of whom she demanded if the printed calico she purchased of him " would wash . " The tragic tones pausing , in the midst of 1875. 157 // the impressed and impressive silence of the assembled family I tinkled forth , " What beautiful eyes you have ! " all my small faculties having been absorbed in the steadfast upward gaze I fixed upon those magnificent orbs . Mrs. Siddons set me down with a smothered laugh , and I trotted off , apparently uninjured by my great aunt 's solemn moral suasion . A dangerous appeal of a higher order being made to me by my aunt 's most intimate friend , Mrs. F- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fanny , why do n't you pray to God to make you better ? " immediately received the conclusive reply , " So I do , and he makes me worse and worse . " Parents and guardians should be chary of handling the deep chords upon whose truth and strength the highest harmonies of the fully developed soul are to depend . In short , I was as hopelessly philosophical a subject as Madame Roland , when at six years old receiving her penal bread and water with the comment , " Bon pour la di , estion ! " and the retributive stripes which this drew upon her with the further observation , " Boa pour la circulation ! " In spite of my " wickedness , " as Topsy would say , I appear to have been not a little spoiled by my parents , and an especial pet and favorite of all their friends , among whom , though I do not remember him at this early period of our acquaintance , I know was Charles Young , that most kindly good man and pleasant gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for little children . He was an intimate friend of Mrs. Siddons and her brothers , and came frequently to our house ; if the elders were not at home , he invariably made his way to the nursery , where , according to the amusing description he has often since given me of our early intercourse , one of his great diversions was to make me fold my little fat arms , - not an easy performance for small muscles , - and with *a portentous frown which puckered up my mouth even more than my eyebrows , receive from him certain awfully unintelligible passages from Macbeth ; replying to them , with a lisp that must have greatly hei*htened the tragic effect of this terrible dialogue , " My handth are of oo bier " ( My hands are of your color ) . Years , how many ! after this first lesson in declamation , dear Charles Young was acting Macbeth for the last time in London , and I was his " wicked wife ; " and while I stood at the side scenes , painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed the bloody-minded woman 's words , he said to me with a smile , " Ah ha ! My handth are of oo tolor . " Not long after this we moved to another residence , still in the same neighborhood , but near the church-yard of Paddington church , which was a thoroughfare of gravel walks , cutting in various directions the green turf , where the fiat tombstones formed frequent " play tables " for us ; upon these our nursery maid , apparently not given to melancholy meditations among the tombs , used to allow us to manufacture whole deligbtful dinner sets of clay plates and dishes ( I think I could make such now ) , out of which we used to have feasts , as we called them , of morsels of cake and fruit . Who knows what ancient funeral feasts we were unconsciously mimicking , or what imperial C*esar , dead and turned to clay , went to make up our soup tureens and salad bowls ? I remember a story of my brother John at this time , which was curiously characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male ragamuffins of the neighborhood had come to the knowled , , e that his weekly allowance of shirts assumed fictitious proportions by the " genteel " artifice of a fresh collar , undoubtedly of more frequent occurrence than the whole garment of which it was an outward and visible sign ; and they made the boy 's life troublesome with the clamorous outcry raised whenever he appeared , " Here comes the chap with the collar ! " My father , crossing the churchyard one afternoon , came upon a juvenile mob surrounding our favorite tombstone , on which stood his son John , who delivered in his hearing , with good emphasis and discretion , the following pithy oration : " Sirs ! whether I wear one or 158 August , // two shirts a week , or whether I wear one or two collars a week , is , I presume , no concern of yours . " And then , descending from the rostrum with much dignity , the eight-years old Cicero made his way through the small " sirs , " by dint of fists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was about five years old , and it was determined that I should be sent to the care of my father 's sister , Mrs. Twiss , who kept a school at Bath , and who was my godmother . On the occasion of my setting forth on my travels , my brother John presented me with a whole collection of children 's books , which he had read and carefully preserved , and now commended to my use . There were at least a round dozen , and , having finished reading them , it occurred to me that to make a bonfire of them would be an additional pleasure to be derived from them ; and so I added to the intellectual recreation they afforded me the more sensational excitement of what I called " a blaze ; " a proceeding of which the dangerous sinfulness was severely demonstrated to me by my new care-takers . Cambden Place , Bath , was one of the lofty terraces built on the charming slopes that surround the site of the Aqum Solis of the Romans , and here my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the favor which everything belongin , to , or even remotely associated with , Mrs. Siddons received from the public . It was a decidedly " fashionable establishment for the education of young ladies , " managed by my aunt , her husband , and her three daughters . Mrs. Twiss was , like every member of my father 's family , at one time on the stage , but left it very soon to marry the grim-visaged , gaunt-figured , kind-hearted , entleman and profound scholar whose name she at this time bore , and who , I have heard it said , once nourished a hopeless passion for Mrs. Siddons . Mrs. Twiss bore a soft and mitigated likeness to her celebrated sister ; she had great sweetness of voice and countenance , and a graceful , refined , feminine manner , that gave her great advantages in her intercourse with , and influence over , the young women whose training she undertook . Mr. Twiss was a very learned man , whose literary labors were , I believe , various , but whose Concordance of Shakespeare is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted himself , with extreme assiduity , to the education of his daughters , giving them the unusual advantage of a thorough classic training , and making of two of them learned women in the more restricted , as well as the more general , sense of the term . These ladies were what so few of their sex ever are , really well informed ; they knew much , and they knew it all thoroughly ; they were excellent Latin scholars and mathematicians , had read iramensely and at the same time systematically , had prodigious memories stored with various and well classed knowledge , and above all were mistresses of the English language , and spoke and wrote it with perfect purity - an accomplishment out of fashion now , it appears to me , but of the advantage of which I retain a delightful impression in my memory of subsequent intercourse with these excellent and capitally educated women . My relations with them , all but totally interrupted for upwards of thirty years , were renewed late in the middle of my life and towards the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural dwelling near Hereford , where they enjoyed in tranquil repose the easy independence they had earned by honorable toil . There the lovely garden , every flower of which looked fit to take the first prize at a horticultural show , the incomparable white strawberries , famous throughout the neighborhood , and a magnificent Angola cat , were the delights of my out-of-door life ; and perfect kindness and various conversation , fed by an inexhaustible fund of anecdote , an immense knowledge of books , and a long and interesting acquaintance with society , made the in-door hours passed with these quiet old lady governesses some of the most delightful I have ever known . The two younger sisters died first ; the eldest , 18Th. 159 // surviving them , felt the sad solitude of their once pleasant home at " The Laurels " intolerable , and removed her residence to Brighton , where , till the period of her death , I used to go and stay with her , and found her to the last one of the most agreeable companions I have ever known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , neither their own studies nor those of their pupils so far engrossed them as to seclude them from society . Bath was then at certain seasons the gayest place of fashionable resort in England ; and , little consonant as such a thing would appear at the present day with the prevailing ideas of the life of a teacher , balls , routs , plays , assemblies , the Pump Room , and all the fashionable dissipations of the place , were habitually resorted to by these very " stylish* ' school-mistresses , whose position at one time , oddly enough , was that of leaders of " the ton** in the pretty provincial capital of Somersetshire . It was , moreover , understood as part of the system of the establishment , that such of the pupils as were of an age to be introduced into society could enjoy the advantage of the chaperonage of these ladies , and several did avail themselves of it . What profit I made under these kind and affectionate kinsfolk , I know not ; little , I rather think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest either to them or myself at the time ; but painstaking love sows more harvests than it wots of , wherever or whenever ( or if never ) it reaps them . I did not become versed in any of my cousins* learned lore , or accomplished in the lighter labors of their leisure hours , to wit : the shoemaking , breadseal manufacturing , and black and white Japan , table , and screen painting , which produced such an indescribable medley of materials in their rooms , and were fashionahle female idle industries of that day . Of all the pursuits and processes of this sort , from the silk and satin shoemakiug of fine ladies then , to the marvels of modern point-lace achieved by them now , a certain invention of my mother 's has always seemed to me one of the most beautiful " lady 's works " I have ever seen . It was an idea of her own , and was never , to my knowledge , practiced by anybody but herself . She had certain single figures and groups of figures carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for woodcut engravings ; with these , and the ink usually employed for woo ( l- cuts , she stamped impressions upon cotton velvet of the most brilliant colors , and then with a solution of chemical acid ( oxalic , I suppose ) removed the whole color from the figure , leaving a pure white image , with all the lines of the wood-cut strongly defining the design , on the velvet surface , and producing the effect of a drawing on ivory , set in a ground of crimson , dark green , or dark blue . I have even known her execute figures of some of Raphael 's cupids on the palest rose and straw color ; a Greek or Italian scroll border executed in the same manner gave a finish to these tasteful articles , which were mounted as large screens , or made into cushion covers , and the smaller and more delicate ones into hand-bags , or hand-screens . I remember a beautiful figure of Mars , and one of Venus , taken from the Planets of Raphael in the Chigi chapel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so painted ; and a group of exquisitely . graceful figures from a sacrificial procession , also a composition of Raphael 's , which was made into an antique - shaped stool . There was one reason why this process should not have become generally popular as a mere lady 's amusement : it was expensive , as far as the necessary materials and implements were concerned , and of very uncertain success , for there was an extreme difficulty in confining the action of the acid within the exact lines of the design , and of course the least running of the white beyond the figure spoiled the whole . My mother often said that if she knew how to avoid that accident , she would take out a patent for her pretty device . Remote from the theatre and all details of theatrical life as my existence // in my aunt 's school was , there still were occasional infiltrations of that element which found their way into my small sphere . My cousin John Twiss , who died not very long ago , an elderly general in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant , studying to become an eno4neer officer , whose visits to his home were seasons of great delight to the family in general , not unmixed on my part with dread ; for a favorite diversion of his was enacting my uncle John 's famous rescue of Cora 's child , in Pizarro , with me clutched in one hand and exalted to perilous proximity with the chandelier , while he rushed across the drawing - rooms to my exquisite terror and triumph . I remember , too , his sisters , all three remarkably tall women ( the eldest nearly six feet high , a portentous petticoat stature ) , amusing themselves with putting on , and sweeping about the rooms in , certain regal mantles and Grecian draperies of my aunt Mrs. Whitelock 's , an actress , like the rest of the Kembles , who sought and found across the Atlantic a fortune and celebrity which it would have been difficult for her to have achieved under the disadvantage of proximity to , and comparison with , her sister , Mrs. Siddons . But I suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vivid pleasure was an experience which I have often remembered , when reading Goethe 's Dichtung und Wahrheit , and the opening chapters of Wilhelm Meister . Within a pleasant summer afternoon 's walk from Bath , through green meadows and by the river 's side , lay a place called Claverton Park , the residence of a family of the name of A- . Who , I wonder , survives of those kind and clever people , with whom for many subsequent years my family kept up the friendliest relations I I remember nothing of the house but the stately and spacious hall , in the middle of which stood a portable theatre , or puppetshow , such as Punch inhabits , where the small figures , animated with voice and movement by George A- , the eldest son of the family , were tragic in VOL. xxxvi. - NO. 214. 11 stead of grotesque , and where , instead of the squeaking Don Giovanni of the London pavement , Macbeth and similar solemnities appeared before my enchanted eyes . The troupe might have been the very identical puppet performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , were the first plays I ever saw ; they were Shakespearian , and doubtless directed my infant mind towards the genuine glories of that legitimate drama of which , in after years , I was destined to hear my whole family spoken of as among the foremost legitimate defenders . Those were pleasant walks to Claverton , and pleasant days at Claverton Hall ! I wish Hans Breitmann and his Avay in die Ewigkeit did not come in , like a ludicrous , lugubrious burden , to all one 's reminiscences of places and people one knew upwards of fifty years ago . I have been accused of having acquired a bad habit of punning from Shakespeare ! - a delightful idea , that made me laugh till I cried , the first time it was suggested to me . If so , I certainly began early to exhibit a result of which the cause was in some mysterious way long subsequent to the effect ; unless the Puppet Plays of Claverton inspired my wit . However that may be , I developed at this period a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at that age . Children have considerable enjoyment of humor , as many of their favorite fairy and other stories attest ; they are often themselves extremely droll and humorous in their assumed play characters and the stories they invent to divert their companions ; but punning is a not very noble species of wit ; it partakes of mental dexterity , requires neither fancy , humor , nor imagination , and deals in words with double meanings , a subtlety very little congenial to the simple and earnest intelli gence of childhood . I have known one clever child of four years make a pun that would not have disgraced Hood , but I think generally very few children so exercise their brains . A far more common childish tendency was that with which I about this time ( as I have been // told ) vexed the souls of my elders and betters , by a series of Socratic inquiries upon every family event that attracted my attention ; as on the occasion of their putting themselves in mourning for a little child : " Why have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Wis dead , and we are very sorry . - " What is dead ? " - " Gone out of this world . " - " Where ? " - " To heaven . " - " Has Mary W-gone to heaven ? " - " Certainly . " - " Is heaven a nice place ? " - " The nicest of all places . " - " Is Mary glad to be there ? " " Very glad . " - " Then why do you put on black frocks , and be sorry that she is dead ? " This and the like impertinent essays of thought may be met successfully enough , if elders and betters believe in truth ; but woe betide the elder and better who has not that sustaining faith in dealing with the demonish spirit of an imp such as I then was . A certain very handsome , dashing , " stylish " ( in the phrase of that day ) Miss B- , who worshiped my uncle John , adored my aunt Siddons , doated on my cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met me one day walking with Amelia Twiss , and , after various judicious observations with regard to me , wound up with the lines from Byron 's Giaour ( just then first intoxicating the young lady mind of Great Britain ) , declaimed with more emphasis than discretion at my mischievous black eyes , - " Her eye 's dark hue t were vain to tell , But gaze on that of the gazelle , And you shall know its lustre well ; " with which profitable remark the fair enthusiast left us . My cousin , mindful of the probable moral effect of this foolery on my small brain , but not careful enough as to the species of antidote she offered me against the pleasing poison of this poetical flattery , said with a grave face , " It was very good-natured of Miss B- to say those verses to you ; she did it because she thought it would please me . " " Oh , " said I with a face as grave as her own , " did she ? I thought she said them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lee enfans terribles say such things daily , and make their grandmothers ' caps stand on end with their precocious astuteness ; but the clever sayings of most clever children , repeated and reported by admiring friends and relations , are for the most part simply the result of unused faculties exercising themselves in , to them , an unused world ; only therefore surprising to worn - out faculties , which have almost ceased to exercise themselves in , to them , an almost wornout world . We have all heard abundance of curious and striking things said by quite unremarkable children , but the only really extraordinary observation I ever heard made by a child was one that indicated a power of reflection and perception of the nature of mental phenomena certainly uncommon in a very young mind . A little girl not eight years old , who had been reading the story of Hamlet , in Charles Lamb 's Shakespeare Tales , asked if it was true ; the reply was , " Partly true , perhaps ; there may have been a King of Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story you have been reading is a ghost story , and not likely to be true . " " I know that , " said the child , " but might not Hamlet have imagined that he saw his father 's ghost ? To be sure , " she added after a pause , " I suppose Horatio and Marcelins would not have imagined it . " This was really a remarkable observation for so young a child ; the lady grew up , much addicted to metaphysics . To the Miss B- I have just mentioned I was indebted for the first doll I remember possessing ; a gorgeous wax personage , in white muslin and cherrycolored ribbons , who by desire of the donor was to be called Philippa , in honor of my uncle . I never loved or liked dolls , though I remember taking some pride in the splendor of this , my first - born . They always affected me with a grim sense of being a mockery of the humanity they were supposed to represent ; there was something uncanny , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of babyhood , to me , // 163 and I had a nervous dislike , not unmixed with fear , of the smiling simulacra that girls are all supposed to love with a species of prophetic maternal instinct . I think dolls , when not indifferent , were rather hateful to me , and that whenever I looked attentively at one , I had a sort of feeling of " what is it ? " which would have tempted me to hunt for its soul in its sawdust , for " a satisfaction to my thoughts ; " not like Madame Sand 's wonderful little Venetian patrician , with hers , to see " se avevano II sangue blu . " The only member of my aunt Twiss 's family of whom I remember at this time little or nothing was the eldest son , Horace , who in subsequent years was one of the most intimate and familiar friends of my father and mother , and who became well known as a clever and successful public man , and a brilliant and agreeable member of the London society of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at Bath had but one memorable event , in its course , to me . I was looking one evening , at bedtime , over the banisters , from the upper story into the hall below , with tip-toe eagerness that caused me to overbalance myself and turn over the rail , to which I clung on the wrong side , suspended , like Victor Hugo 's miserable priest to the gutter of Notre Dame , and then fell four stories down on the stone pavement of the hall . I was not killed or apparently injured , but whether I was not really irreparably damaged no human being can possibly tell ; and I adjure all Christian people inclined to " do me justice , " to remember that from that time forward my brain may have been hopelessly cracked or concussed , a circumstance the moral and mental effect of which is quite beyond computation . My next memories refer to a residence which my parents were occupying when I returned to London , called Covent Garden Chambers ; now , I believe , celebrated as " Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is confidently affirmed that I was born , which I was not ; and where , I am told , a picture is showA that is confidently affirmed to be mine , which it is not . My sister Adelaide was born in Covent Garden Chambers , and the picture in question is an oil sketch , by Sir Thomas Lawrence , of my cousin Maria Siddons : quite near the truth enough for history , private or public . It was while we were living here that Mrs. Siddons returned to the stage for one night , and acted Lady Randolph for my father 's benefit . Of course I heard much discourse about this , to us , important and exciting event , and used all my small powers of persuasion to be taken to see her . My father , who loved me very much , and spoiled me not a little , carried me early in the afternoon into the market place , and showed me the dense mass of people which filled the whole Piazza , in patient expectation of admission to the still unopened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how impossible it was to grant my request . However that might then appear , it was granted , for I was in the theatre at the beginning of the performance ; but I can now remember nothing of it but the appearance of a solemn female figure in black , and the tremendous roar of public greeting which welcomed her , and must , I suppose , have terrified my childish senses , by the impression I still retain of it ; and this is the only occasion on which I saw my aunt in public . Another circumstance connected in my mind with Covent Garden Chambers was a terrible anguish about my youngest brother , Henry , who was for some hours lost . He was a most beautiful child of little more than three years old , and had been allowed to go out on the door-steps by an exceedingly foolish little nursery maid , to look at the traffic of the great market place . Returning without him , she declared that be had refused to come in with her , and had run to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him , to come and fetch authoritative assistance . The child did not come home , and all search for him proved vain throughout the crowded market and the adjoining thoroughfares , thronged with people and choked with carts and wagons , and swarming with the blocked - up traffic which had to make its way to and from the great mart through avenues far narrower // 164 Old lYoman 's Gossip . and more difficult of access than they are now . There were not then , either , those invaluable beings , policemen ( for whom be ever blessed the memory of Peel ) , standing at every corner to enforce order and assist the helpless : bluecoated heroes of the area railings , beloved of nurse - maids , kitchen - maids , house - maids , and maids of all work ; peacefuliest yet most efficient of gensdarmes and sbirri ; certainly combining the minimum of aggressive with the maximum of passive authority over the huge populace which they control , for the most part , so well , without unnecessarily provoking its dangerous ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry brought back any tidings of the poor little lost boy . My mother was ill , and I do not think she was told of the child 's disappearance , but my father went to and fro with the face and voice of a distracted man ; and I well remember the look with which he climbed a narrow outside stair , leading only to a rain-water cistern , with the miserable apprehension that his child might have clambered up and fallen into it . The neighborhood was stirred with sympathy for the agony of the poor father , and pitying gossip spreading the news tJ*rough the thronged market place , where my father 's name and appearance was familiar enough to give a strong personal feeling to the compassion expressed , a baker 's boy , lounging about , caught up the story of the lost child , and described having seen a " pretty little chap with curly hair , in a brown Holland pinafore , " in St. James Square . Thither the searchers flew , and the child was found , tired out with his self-directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door-step of one of the lordly houses of that aristocratic square . He was so remarkably beautiful that he must have attracted attention before long , and might perhaps have been restored to his home ; but God knows what an age of horror and anguish was lived through by my father and my poor aunt flail in that short , miserable space of time till he was found . My aunt Dali , of whom I now speak for the first time , was my mother 's sister , and had lived with us , I believe , ever since I was born . Her name was Adelaide , but the little fellow whose adventure I have just related , stumbling over this fine Norman appellation , turned it into Idallidy , and then conveniently shortened it of its two extremities and made it Dali , by which title she was called by us , and known to all our friends , and beloved by all who ever spoke or heard it . Her story was as sad a one as could well be ; yet to my thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , as well as one of the best . She was my mother 's second sister , and as her picture , taken when she was twenty , shows ( and it was corroborated by her appearance till upwards of fifty ) she was extremely pretty . Obliged , as all the rest of her family were , to earn her own bread , and naturally adopting the means of doing so that they did , she went upon the stage ; but I can not conceive that her nature can ever have had any affinity with her occupation . She had a robust and rather prosaic common - sense , opposed to anything exaggerated or sentimental , which gave her an excellent judgment of character and conduct , a strong genial vein of humor which very often made her repartees witty as well as wise , and a sunny sweetness of temper and soundness of moral nature that made her as good as she was easy and delightful to live with . Whenever everything went wrong and she was " vexed past her patience , " she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever knew that she was what is termed " out of sorts . " She bad found employment in her profession under the kindly protection of Mr. Stephen Kemble , my father 's brother , who lived for many years at Durham and was the manager of the theatre there , and according to the fashion of that time traveled with his company , at stated seasons , to Newcastle , Sunderland , and other places , which formed a sort of theatrical circuit in the northern counties , throughout which he was well known and generally respected . In his company my aunt flail found // employment , and in his daughter , Fanny Kemble , since well known as Mrs. Robert Arkwright , an inseparable friend and companion . My aunt lived with Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Kemble , who were excellent , worthy people , doing their duty in the very laborious and not very exalted vocation of country actors . They took good care of the two young girls under their charge , this linsey-woolsey Rosalind and Celia , - their own beautiful and most rarely endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suppose that a merrier life than that of these lasses , in the midst of their quaint theatrical tasks and homely household duties , was seldom led by two girls in any sphere of life . They learned and acted their parts , devised and executed with small means and great industry their dresses ; made pies and puddings , and patched and darned , in the morning , and by dint of paste and rouge became heroines in the evening ; and withal were well-conducted , good young things , full of the irrepressible spirits of their age , and turning alike their hard home work and light stage labor into fun . My aunt has often told me how , walking with her in the cathedral close , more than one inhabitant of which was then a grave and benign patron of the drama and a kind friend of the manager , it was her delight suddenly to tell his daughter that she would make believe that she ( Fanny Kemble ) was tipsy , and that she was being conducted home by her sober and considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no sooner was the mischievous intention announced and poor Fanny Kemble 's arm taken by my aunt with affectionately severe admonitions " to take care how she walked and not expose herself , " than the most uncontrollable laughter would seize upon the helpless victim , who inherited her father 's unwieldy and ungainly figure ; - she had also inherited the beauty of his family , which in her most lovely countenance had a character of childlike simplicity and serene sweetness that made it almost angelic . Far on in middle age she retained this singularly tender beauty , which added immensely to the exquisite effect of her pathetic voice in her incomparable rendering of th' ballads she composed ( the poetry as well as the music being often her own ) , and to which her singing of them gave so great a fashion at one time , in the great London world . It was in vain that far better musicians , with far finer voices , attempted to copy her inimitable musical recitation ; nobody ever sang like her , and still less did anybody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions of which I was speaking , when she was being " carefully taken home " by my aunt , the poor girl 's heavy figure , shaken with paroxysms of laughter , heaved and rolled about almost beyond the guidance of her perfidious companion , and her suffocating expostulations and entreaties , and streaming eyes and tottering , unsteady steps , would certainly have confirmed to any one who had met them the impression conveyed by my ' aunt 's words , that she was guiding home her helplessly inebriated friend . Practical jokes of very doubtful taste were the fashion of that day , and remembering what wonderfully coarse and silly proceedings were then thought highly diverting by " vastly genteel " people , it is not , perhaps , much to be wondered at that so poor a piece of wit as this should have furnished diversion to a couple of light - hearted girls , with no special pretentions to elegance or education . Another time they were driving together in a post-chaise on the road to Newcastle , and my aunt , having at hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farce , accoutred her upper woman in a soldier 's cap , stock , and jacket , and , with heavily corked mustaches , persisted in embracing her companion , whose frantic resistance , screams of laughter , and besmirched cheeks elicited comments of boundless amazement , in broad northcountry dialect , from the market folk they passed on the road , to whom they must have appeared the most violent runaway couple that ever traveled . Liston , the famous comedian , was at this time a member of the Durham com 1875. 165 // pany , and though he began his career there by reciting Collins 's Ode to the Passions , attired *n a pea - green coat , buckskins , top boots , and powder , with a scroll in his hand ; and followed this essay of his powers with the tragic actor 's battle-horse , the part of Hamlet ; he soon found his peculiar gift to lie in the diametrically opposite direction of broad farce . Of this he was perpetually interpolating original specimens in the gravest performances of his fellow-actors ; on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stood disheveled at the side scene , ready to go on the stage as Ophelia in her madness , a basket with carrots , turnips , onions , leeks , and pot-herbs , instead of the conventional flowers and straws of the stage maniac , which sent the representative of the fair Ophelia on in a broad grin , with ill-suppressed fury and laughter , which must have given quite an original character of verisimilitude to the insanity she counterfeited . On another occasion he sent all the little chorister boys on , in the lugubrious funeral procession in Romeo and Juliet , with pieces of brown paper in their hands to wipe their tears with . The suppression of that very dreadful piece of stage pageantry has at last , I believe , been conceded to the better taste of modern audiences ; but even in my time it was still performed , and an exact representation of a funeral procession , such as one meets every day in Rome , with torch-bearing priests , and bier covered with its black velvet pall embroidered with skull and cross-bones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , chanting some portion of the fine Roman Catholic requiem music . I have twice been in the theatre when persons have been seize ( l with epilepsy during that ghastly exhibition , and think the good judgment that has discarded such a mimicry of a solemn religious ceremony highly commendable . Another evening , Liston , having painted Fanny Kemble 's face like a clown 's , posted her at one of the stage side doors to confront her mother , poor Mrs. Stephen Kemble , entering at the opposite one to perform some dismally serious scene of dramatic pathos , who , on suddenly beholding this grotesque apparition of her daughter , fell into convulsions of laughter and coughing , and half audible exclamations of " Go away , Fanny ! I 11 tell your father , miss ! " which must have had the effect of a sudden seizure of madness to the audience , accustomed to the rigid decorum of the worthy woman in the discharge of her theatrical duties . Long after these provincial exploits , and when he had become the comedian par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art had alike qualified him by the imperturbable gravity of his extraordinarily ugly face , which was such an irresistibly comical element in his broadest and most grotesque performances , Mr. Liston used to exert his ludicrous powers of tormenting his fellow-actors in the most cruel manner upon that sweet singer , Miss Stephens ( afterwards Countess of Essex ) . She had a curious nervous trick of twitching her dress before she began to sing ; this peculiarity was well known to all her friends , and Liston , who certainly was one of them , used to agonize the poor woman by standing at the side scene , while the symphony of her pathetic ballads was being played , and indicating by his eyes and gestures that something was amiss with the trimming or bottom of her dress : when , as invariably as he chose to play the trick , poor Miss Stephens used to begin to twitch and catch at her petticoat , and half hysterical , between laughing and crying , would enchant and entrance her listeners with her exquisite voice and pathetic rendering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But among the merry Durham player folk the laughing had an end , and saddest tragedy of reality came crashing down into the midst of these poor foolish people 's mirth .
