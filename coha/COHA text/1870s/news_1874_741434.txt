txt The Secretary of War , in response to a resolution of the House , gives reasons in justification of the issuing of Army Order No. 32 . He quotes from judicial decisions and laws of Congress , arguing therefrom that the constitutional right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances has no applicability to the military service , because Congress has provided in the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth articles of war exactly how far an officer or soldier may obtain redress of grievances by individual application through certain military channels . Should officers or soldiers endeavor to assemble with a view to make a joint petition or application , such conduct would be a military offense , liable either as sedition or as conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline . Correspondence on official matters must be conducted through the proper official channels , except in cases of pressing necessity . The endeavor of any officer or soldier of his own motion to address Congress , or either House , or its memhere , soliciting , suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole army , is liable to be detrimental to the public service , and disrespectful to the President . Therefore , the order provides that all petitions to Con grew by officers relative to subjects of a military character should be communicated to the General of the Army , and the Secretary of War for their action and transmission . In view of the explicit and peremptory laws , the Secretary of War says he has invariably refused permission to any army officer to act as agent or attorney for any individual on the prosecution of any claim against the United States , or any claim in which the United States are a party . The officer who is recommended by a retiring board to be wholly retired from the service ceases , on the approval of the President , to be connected with the public service .
