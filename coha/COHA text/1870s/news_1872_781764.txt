txt While the various European expeditions are trying to get at the North-west Passage and . the Open Polar Sea by way of the Old World , an enterprising philosopher . M. PAVY , is going to try his fortune by way of the New . He has either started , or-is just about to start , from San Francisco for this purpose , and hopes to be able , before long , to demonstrate the truth of his cherished theories . M. PAVY believes that the polar centre is an open sea in . Summer and Winter , and . that it is surrounded . by a belt of ice . This belt , however , he conceives , is perforated by a channel traversed by a warm current from the south , and through this channel the Polar Sea is alone to be reached . Now , through Behring 's Straits a warm current flows to the north , and no such current can be found flowing in that direction anywhere else . Consequently , by way of Behring 's Straits alone the path to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we understand M. PAW 'S theories , he does not deny that there may be openings to the polar region other than the one north of Alaska ; but he affirms that those to the east , between the shores of this continent . Greenland , Spitzbergen , and Nova Zembla , are impracticable . The reason is , that beyond certain latitudes powerful currents are met , sweeping down from the north , and bringing drifts of ice through which no ship can be navigatea . Hence , explorers on that side have usually been led to believe that the polar centre is a solid field of ice , instead of . as M. PAVY would . have us believe , a huge basin of warm water . To support his singular theory , M. PAVY brings some highly-ingenious arguments . In the latitude of 80 ? , he says , and southward , land birds are seldom known to tarry , in consequence of the extreme cold ; but they have often been seen winging their way southward over this frigid belt . and . in higher latitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whale , in the northerly seas , passes further north instead of south at the approach of Winter . It is ' incapable of living beneath a frozen surface. , and hence its habit of migration-argues the existence of an open sea about the Pole . ' If it be asked , admitting these and cognate facts to be true , why it should be warm and . open at thePole , any more than there should be a mountain of ice-cream in the middle of South Africa , M.* PAVY is . ready with an answer . It is our old friend , the . Gulfstream , again . That extraordinary current , our philosopher declares , sinks as it expands , and . meets the current from the north . The latter being colder , heavier , and more powerful , slips quietly over the Gulf-stream , which , nevertheless , keeps obstinately on its course , and , having taken a " header " somewhere about Labrador , comes up in the neighborhood of the Pole . Thus the moderate temperature and open sea claimed for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the explanation of most points touching the circuit , or ultimate destiny , of the Gulf-stream . From theory M. PAVY proceeds to practice . His intention is to pass through Behring 's Straits and then take a northeasterly course to Wrangle 's Land , north of the coast of Siberia . This land . he believes to be a continent which stretches away toward the Pole and thus merges into the warmer climate he expects to find . It will be remembered that the Russian Government undertook to explore Wrangle 's Land in 1812 . First , the expedition wont as far as practicable in their ships . They then tried to reach the coast by sledging over the ice ; but on each occasion the progress was interrupted by the ice growing thinner as they went north until they came to open water . M. PAVY thinks that he has provided for all emergencies . He hopes to get to Wrangle 's Land by the 1st of September . He then , with his party , will resort to sledges drawn by dogs , and reckons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1873 , in crossing the continent which he supposes what we call Wrangle 's Sound in reality to be . On reaching the open sea he expects to find , he will launch his india-rubber raft  --  an affair specially constructed for the purpose  --  bend his sails ? and make straight for the Pole . Having attained it . and triumphantly vindicated his theories , M. PAVY will pass . with the great polar currents , as he expects them to flow , south-east for Cape Alexander , through Smith Sound , down Baffin 's Bay , and so out into the Atlantic . M. PAVY succeeds in establishing the truth of his ideas , it will be a splendid addi tion to geographical and scientific - knowledge ; and if he succeedain carrying out his plan , the achievement will hardly be short of miraculous . But , alas ! the history of Arctic exploration , so ' full of magnificent endeavor , of sanguine aspiration , of bitter mistakes , of cruel suffering and . of untimely death , warns us not to be too hopeful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronicle .
