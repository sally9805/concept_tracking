txt A half-minute is not Much in a man 's lifetime , but it is a great deal when he is on the scaffold , ready to be hanged . In Mauch Chunk , yesterday , two men were hanged thirty seconds before a reprieve arrived from the Governor of Pennsylvania . Usually , all hopes of a reprieve are dead long before the hour for the execution arrives . In old times it was not unfrequently the ease that , just as the rope was being adjusted around the neck of the condemned man , a stir was heard on the outer edge of the throng , and a horseman urged his foam-flecked steed , waved a white handkerchief over his head as he sped toward the scaffold , and shouted , " A reprieve ! " cry which was taken up by the sympathetic crowd , as strong men wept like children and women fainted . The lawyers and the telegraph have changed all that . The official intrusted with pardon and reprieve is besieged as soon as a man is condemned , and the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hangman into instantaneous communication ? with each other . Nevertheless , two men who committed ' a murder in 1863 , and were tried and condemned last April , would be alive to-day if their reprieve had not been thirty seconds late in Mauch Chunk . It is not certain who is to bo blamed for this unhappy miscarriage of justice . If the men were entitled to a , day 's delay in their execution , they were entitled to receive it immediately . It is a failure of mercy to bring a reprieve too late . And in this case , it appears there was ample time to take all the steps needed to postpone the execution . GEORGE SMITH was murdered in Audenreid , Penn. , Nov. 5 , 1863 . The gang who slew him were " Mollie Maguires . " One or two of the murderers had already met their just desert ; several died lawless and violent deaths , and the gang was so far broken up that , when its ? members began to make haste to inform upon each other , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure from them evidence enough to convict SRARPE and MCDONNELL of the murder of Snarl . These two men , after so many years , were tried and convicted in April , 1878 . They were sentenced to be hanged yesterday . From this sentence there was one appeal  --  to the State Supreme Court . But the law provides that such an appeal must be taken within twenty days after sentence has been passed . In this case the legal limit of time was allowed to expire , and then the counsel for the condemned men began Jo urge that the law fixing the limit of time of appeal was unconstitutional . They went to Harrisburg on Monday , the day before the execution day , to ask , the Governor to reprieve the men until the Supreme Court should examine the law and decide whether it was constitutional . The Governor was in Washington , and the men were to be hanged on Tuesday , at 10:30 A. M. , or thereabouts . Finally , the counsel saw the Governor on his return at 1 o'clock Tuesday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Governor consented to grant the reprieve , and a dispatch to the Sheriff was sent from Philadelphia . at 10:35 A. M. , Philadelphia time . The operators of the telegraph line did their best , but the order for the Sheriff to stay his proceedings reached Mauch Chunk . a half minute after the men had been hanged . SHARPE and MCDONNELL undoubtedly deserved hanging , if any men ever did . The crime which they committed was a coldblooded and brutal assassination . SMITH was murdered in his own house , in the presence of his wife , and in the most deliberate manner . The ben who were hanged yesterday were fairly tried and justly convicted . Nobody need waste sympathy on these ruffians . Nevertheless ; they were entitled to humane treatment . It was as cruel to deprive them of the few days in which they might have lived as it would have been to put them to death by a Sheriff 's invention which would have substituted slow torture for speedy death . It is not creditable to the administration of justice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried and sentenced nearly a year ago , should have been put off until the wretched convicts were on the scaffold . Those Who are responsible for this delay are the counsel for the condemned . It seems incredible that a last resort should have been put off until next to the last . day , or even to the last week , of a condemned man 's life . Gov . HARTRANFT has , by this tardy granting of a reprieve , impaired his reputation for firmness and decision . It is said that the law whose constitutionality was to be tested before the Supreme Court ; was enacted at the request of the Judges of that court , who sought to be relieved in this way of applications on writs of error in just such cases as this . . The Governor must have known this , and he knew the futility of the proposed appeal . But it does not help the ease that the ineffectual reprieve would have only given the condemned men a few more days of life . " Only a few days more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they could , give " millions of money for an inch of time . " The evil of this whole case is that the gallows in Pennsylvania is invested with great uncertainty . " While there 's life there 's hope , " is an old and cheery saying . But ? from this time out the condemned man at the foot of the gallows may not only hope that a reprieve may arrive for him at any moment , but he may take off his thoughts from the certain doom before him and be agonized with the reflection that the boon which he waits for may come when his life has gone past recall . If a stay of proceedings is to be granted at all , it should be granted while the condemned man 's life may be said to keep the case open . It is a refinement of cruelty to keep hope alive and quivering at the foot of the gallows . If a criminal condemned to die has any rights at all , he has a right to know when he must prepare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not have postponed their wiredrawn objections until the eleventh hour . Gov . HA RTRANFT should not have considered a reprieve at a point of time when , under all precedents , the case should have been considered closed .
