And so you are the victim of that insatiable deity  --  the god of marriage . Embraces . Von A. Von Armin I am . Behold me . Rein . Von Reinwald It is incredible . Rie . Riedel Reclining on sofa . They say your mother-in-law that is to be  --  the Countess Dalberg  --  is so remarkable for her austerity and piety , that she is almost considered a saint in her part of the country . Rein . Von Reinwald And I hear that she intends to make a pious husband of you . You , the soul of the Jockey Club  --  the Alcibiades of the park . Leaning on Von A. 's shoulder . Rie . Riedel Yes  --  and that your honeymoon is to be spent in a monastery . Rein . Von Reinwald And that you will be compelled to pay particular attention to devotional exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more than an ordinary sacrifice . Von A. Von Armin And , therefore , I need all the support you can give me . Rein . goes to table . For this purpose I assemble my friends for the last time in these halls  --  so soon to be deserted ; and Blaswitz has prepared for us a melancholy farewell repast . Behold him even now ! BLASWITZ is seen at the back giving directions to Stobel ; he has on white tie , and is dressed primly . He turns and comes down . Von A. Von Armin Good evening . Blaswitz . R. C. Ah , sir ! Good evening . Von . A. Von Armin Let me present you to these gentlemen . My friends  --  the best manager  --  the best factotum  --  the best cook in Europe . Rein . Von Reinwald Cook ! How 's that ? Blas . Blaswitz Ah , my dear Mr. Reinwald  --  you seem surprised . When I last saw you  --  Rein . Von Reinwald At Hamburg . Blas . Blaswitz At Hamburg . I was assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Riedel Do n't I remember you in Berlin ? Blas . Blaswitz Sir , you are very kind  --  and very correct . Those were my happy days . I was leader of the orchestra in the summer garden , and musical critic of the " Gazette . " Von . A. Von Armin Next to Rie . And these before I found you at Very 's  --  Blas . Blaswitz Waiting on the guests . From which abyss  --  if I may dignify the position by such a name  --  you rescued me and installed me as major domo and steward of your bachelor establishment . Rein . Von Reinwald Why you 're a jack of all trades . Editor , correspondent , musician , critic , cook , waiter  --  the deuce . Blas . Blaswitz My dear sir , I expect to be the one man who , in his time , plays every part . And yet I do n't succeed . No complaint is ever made as to my ability , but I do n't stick . Rein . Von Reinwald Stick ! Rie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blas . Blaswitz Stick . Whatever I do , I do for . The newspapers I edited burst up . The summer garden whose orchestra I led went into bankruptcy . My musical criticism provoked an excoriated cornet soloist to horsewhip the publisher , and I was discharged . Why , would you believe it , a customer on whom I waited , when I served at Very 's , got a bone in his throat and choked to death . Did you ever hear of so much misfortune ? All . Laughing . Never . Blas . Blaswitz Now I am in the service of the Baron , I live in daily dread of one fatal event . Von . A. Von Armin And that is  --  Blas . Blaswitz Marriage , sir ! The destroyer of bachelor households . My sole enemy . Von . A. Von Armin Rises . Then it is with inexpressible regret , Mr. Blaswitz , that I have to announce to you  --  Blas . Blaswitz Stop , sir . Pause for one moment , sir . You are about to break something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rie . Riedel A chair for his excellency . Rein . Von Reinwald Brings chair forward and forces Blas. into it . Compose yourself . Rie . Riedel Have a glass of water . Blas . Blaswitz Thanks . You are very kind , gentlemen . I knew it would come to this . But not so soon . Von . A. Von Armin This is my last bachelor entertainment . In three days I am to be married . In a month my lease here expires , till then  --  Blas . Blaswitz C. I must look about . Very well . Von A. Von Armin My friend indicating Rein. has considerable influence . I will endeavor to solicit it for you . Rein . Von Reinwald Certainly . What would you like to do , Blaswitz ? Blas . Blaswitz Everything . Rein . Von Reinwald Suppose I get you the place of porter in a bank . Blas . Blaswitz I think I 'd rather open a theatre . Rein . Von Reinwald Seated on table . But there are so few opportunities for indulging that pastime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blaswitz True . I did think of emigrating to America and getting a railroad . By the time it smashed up I might be rich enough to retire . Von . A. Von Armin L. C. , leaning on sofa . I 'm afraid you are too ambitious . Rie . Riedel R. You 'd better marry an heiress . All laugh . Blas . Blaswitz Ah , gentlemen , I 'd descend to anything to earn an honest living . But in the meantime  --  a porter in a bank is a beginning . May I call on you to-morrow , sir ? To Rein . Rein . Von Reinwald Laughing . At twelve . Goes up . Blas . Blaswitz You are very kind , sir . To Von A. And if I have permission to retire . Bows profoundly and goes up . Porter in a bank  --  and I have been president of three . Aside , end exits , C. R. Von A. Von Armin To Rein . An original . I hope you may do something for him . Rie . Riedel But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your marriage . You kept it quite a secret . Von A. Von Armin Sits , L. When one marries in the country and settles down  --  Rein Von Reinwald So you mean to settle down  --  with your sainted mother-in-law ? Von A. Von Armin That is no jest . The countess is indeed a saint , if ever one lived on earth . She is no hypocrite . Rein . Von Reinwald So much the worse . One could manage a hypocrite  --  but a real saint is absolutely impracticable . Von A. Von Armin And her daughter  --  my intended  --  Rein . Von Reinwald Is an angel . Von A. Von Armin Yes . Rein . Von Reinwald So are all brides . After marriage the wings drop off . Von A. Von Armin That 's the husband 's fault . She changes only when he changes . I confess that the one thing which causes me uneasiness in entering this new life is the fate of so many couples I have seen . Rein . Von Reinwald Seated , R. The deuce ! you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I allude to those married couples whom the world believes happy . Rein . Von Reinwald Oh , certainly ! Von A. Von Armin This is my thought : when we buy a piece of land , we satisfy ourselves first , that it is worth what we give for it ; next , that the title is clear , the past satisfactory and the future without annoyance . But when a girl marries , she takes everything on trust . I am to wed the beautiful Lotte . Rein . Von Reinwald Laughing . Poor Lotte ! Von A. Von Armin Look of surprise at his laugh , then turns away . She has never inquired as to the past , and has only my promise for the future . Now , what do men 's promises amount to in our days . Does it restrain them ? does it control their acts ? Rie . Riedel Laughing . I do n't know . Ask Reinwald . Rein . Von Reinwald Do n't ask me anything of the sort . What a sermon for a bachelor 's supper  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riedel Delightful  --  that 's the word ! Merope , of the Theatre Royal , and Phoebe , of the Varieties  --  and then Pervenche . Rein . Von Reinwald Will Pervenche come ? Von A. Von Armin I have a bet with Durley on it . I invited her  --  staked a hundred she would accept  --  and he took it . Rein . Von Reinwald He 's an Englishman  --  and they do n't make foolish wagers . Von A. Von Armin Oh ! he 's deeply smitten in that quarter . But , win or lose , to-night I put a dash through my past life and start a new set of books for the matrimonial venture . Yet , one last deep draught from the cup of youth  --  of independence . To-night I am still this side the line . Rein . Von Reinwald And you mean seriously to give all this up ? Von A. Von Armin I shall adore my wife , educate my children  --  live like a steady citizen  --  and if , in the course of years , I come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park , I shall close my eyes . Rein . Von Reinwald One eye , you mean  --  in fact , wink at her . These sentiments do you honor . But you wo n't have a chance . Pervenche will go on the stage  --  make a hit  --  and be carried off to England by Durley . Von A. Von Armin How I should envy Durley  --  if I were not going to be married . Rein . Von Reinwald Not at all  --  envy him ! You are still this side of the line . Rie . Riedel L. I saw her driving in the Park with Merope . The group suggested Iphigenia being carried by Diana into the clouds . Von A. Von Armin Who knows where Pervenche came from ? Rein . Von Reinwald Conundrum ! Von A. Von Armin Rises and goes to Rein . I wish it were and I had the answer . What does Durley say ? Rein . Von Reinwald Like all Englishman  --  nothing  --  not like us  --  we tell all we know . Von A. Von Armin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announces . Stobel . Lord Durley ! Rein . Von Reinwald The wolf in the fable ! He comes ! DURLEY enters , C. L. STOBEL takes his hat and coat and exits , C. R. Durley . R. C. Good evening , gentlemen ! Von A. Von Armin L. C. Welcome , happy England ! All advance and shake hands with him . Dur . Durley Happy ? I lost a thousand last night at the Club . Von A. Von Armin L. C. And spent all the afternoon with the pretty little Pervenche ! Dur . Durley Of course the account of the day is balanced . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Rein . Von Reinwald R. Come , now , Arthur , how far have you got in that quarter ? Dur . Durley As far as a skating party , to which I am to take her . Rein . Von Reinwald As you 've got so far  --  do n't slip up . Honestly , they say Pervenche is in love with you . Dur . Durley I always find her very amiable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  eh ? Dur . Durley I am not vain enough to believe it  --  nor indiscreet enough to ask her . Rie . Riedel There 's an example for you , Otto . Rein . Von Reinwald By jove , Arthur , you speak of these matters as if they were international treaties . I only ask , because if your diplomacy has not accomplished anything with her  --  we others , as allied powers , might help you . Dur . Durley I only ask a strict neutrality . Rein . Von Reinwald Neutrality ? Peaceful ? Dur . Durley Seriously . Or armed  --  just as you like . Crosses to R. Von A. Von Armin Between them . Peaceful , for gracious sake . Bell heard . Hark ! the tidings of peace ! The ladies are coming . My pulse quickens as it did on the occasion of my first adventure  --  and this is to be my last . BLASWITZ appears , C. L. , giving directions to Stobel . Let us be merry to-night . To Blas . The ladies have come ? Blaswitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , it is only a trunk . Von A. Von Armin A trunk ! All turn and look at Blas . Blas . Blaswitz And a porter who plumps it down in the hall , with the statement that the gentlemen will soon be here . Von A. Von Armin The gentlemen ! But no one was asked to bring his trunk . Blas . Blaswitz Gentlemen from the country . I think he said Count Dalberg and the Abbe Valmont . Rein . Von Reinwald Aha ! Your new relations . Von A. Von Armin Lotte 's brother , and the old Abbe here , now of all times in the world . Stage , L. C. Dur . Durley Your future brother-in-law . Rein . Von Reinwald It 'll spoil our fun . Send them back . I say , Blaswitz , send them off  --  invent some excuse . Blas . Blaswitz But they 've brought their trunk . Von A. Von Armin How can I send away the brother of my wife ? Rein . Von Reinwald And the son of a saint . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good old priest . Bring ' em in . Introduce them to Merope , the actress , and Pervenche , her companion . Von A. Von Armin No , no . His mother intends him to marry a noble lady in their part of the country . Rein . Von Reinwald So , of course , you ca n't tempt him . Von A. Von Armin The supper must be put off . The ladies must be told  --  Rein . Von Reinwald What ? Von A. Von Armin Anything . Blaswitz , you must invent something . Blas . Blaswitz Certainly , sir . What shall I invent ? Von A. Von Armin The young count and his old friend must be received  --  the ladies must be dismissed . Rein . Von Reinwald Slapping his forehead . A brilliant idea  --  and a sure road to fortune , besides  --  All . What is it ? Rein . Von Reinwald Did not the father of Count Julian  --  this young man  --  declare in his will , that if his son contracted a marriage beneath his rank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him in  --  let the ladies come up  --  introduce him to Merope . He falls in love , of course , as everyone does with her , they marry . She is only an actress  --  and there you are . Von A. Von Armin Crosses to him , then gets R. I do n't like jests of this kind , Otto . In family matters , I am always serious . Rein . Von Reinwald Oh , very well  --  but I thought you were still on this side of the line . Von A. Von Armin Yes . But the line appears to be drawing pretty close . Confound it , how unfortunate . Bell rings . Blas . Blaswitz There 's the bell , sir . Owner of the trunk 's come . Dur . Durley To Von A. I 'll help you out of this . I 'll take the ladies to supper at Chevot 's , and you can join us in an hour or so . Von A. Von Armin No  --  no  --  I may still manage to get out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julian . The baron is at home ? Blas . Blaswitz There 's only one coming , sir , and he 's a young one . Von A. Von Armin If the Abbe would only call on some religious acquaintance in town to-night . Dur . Durley A young brother-in-law can be made to understand these things better . Von A. Von Armin You do n't know him . Rein . Von Reinwald He 's not another saint , is he ? Oh ! JULIAN enters , C. L. Julian . Oh ! My dear cousin ! Von A. Von Armin Crosses to him . Julian ! They embrace . Jul . Julian That 's from Lotte . Sees others . But I beg pardon . I 'm making a family scene before strangers . Von A. Von Armin Strangers ! Not at all ! My best friends  --  Mr. Reinwald  --  Lord Durley  --  Mr. Riedel  --  Count Julian Von Dalberg . Introducing them . Rein . Von Reinwald Crosses to Jul . Delighted . Shakes him warmly by both hands , and then aside to Rie . Deuce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Blas. , and gives directions . BLAS. exits . Jul . Julian Continuing . I am most happy to meet so many friends of my cousin . I already know Mr. Reinwald by name , although I come to the city so seldom . Your-mother-in-law is an old friend of our family . Von A. Von Armin Coming down . This is your first visit to town , is n't it ? We must show you about . Jul . Julian You are very kind , but my stay will be occupied with business rather than pleasure . Ah ! Throws himself in chair , C. Von A. Von Armin You are tired . You need rest . Rein . Von Reinwald Aside to Von A. Good idea  --  get him to bed . Dur . Durley The journey was very fatiguing , of course . Rie . Riedel L. And one unaccustomed to traveling . Jul . Julian You are joking , gentlemen  --  if it were my old friend , the Abbe , now  --  but even he is fresh as a primrose after the cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughing it in the country , that  --  do n't I detect the odor of a delicious supper ? If you are about to sit down with your friends , cousin , without any ceremony , why  --  All exchange looks of consternation. and if you 'll excuse my traveling dress  --  why , I 'll join you , and show you what we call a country appetite . Rein . Von Reinwald Aside . Oh ! by jove ! Rie . Riedel Same . We 're dished . Dur . Durley Aside to Von A. Better let me carry the ladies off . Von A. Von Armin Aside to Dur . Stop , do n't be in a hurry . Let me see . Aloud . Do you smoke , Julian . Offers cigarettes . Rein . Von Reinwald Aside to Von A. That 's it . Make him sick . Jul . Julian Smoke  --  oh , yes  --  we 've all the bad habits down there , too . Why , I 've walked six hours at a time through fields accompanied only by my dog and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian My mother says a man only loves his property when he knows it , and I know every tree on the estate . Ah , cousin , we 'll take many a stroll together through our woodlands , and sometimes Lotte and the good Abbe will come with us . Rein . Von Reinwald Leaning back , mockingly . How delicious ! Jul . Julian Looks at him comically for a moment . Indeed , but it is  --  then in the winter . Rie . Riedel With curiosity . Ah , in the winter . Rein . Von Reinwald I 'm anxious to hear what you make of your winters . Jul . Julian We spend our evenings reading aloud . Rein . Von Reinwald Intoxicating pastime . Jul . Julian Ha ! ha ! The outside world is given up to pleasures . At home we ought to seek for repose . Rein . Von Reinwald Ah , yes . Prayers , meditations , and all that . Jul . Julian Oh , well , we read some serious literature , you know  --  our last book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went along . Rein . Von Reinwald Strolls over to where Von A. sits , and as he takes a cigarette , aside to him . How do you feel now ? Lacordaire 's Sermons ! I congratulate you . Dur . Durley And you have never longed for the bright life in the city ? Jul . Julian Certainly I have . As I love a strong man putting forth his strength  --  or a beautiful woman amid her triumphs . Rein . Von Reinwald Bravo ! Count ! Hold to that , and we 'll show you life yet . Leaning over Von A. Von A. Von Armin Aside , impatiently nudging Rein . Do n't ! Jul . Julian I 'm afraid I have much to see of the city , and that it 's worst side . Von A. Von Armin What do you mean ? Jul . Julian I forgot to tell you . You know I did not come up alone . Von A. Von Armin The Abbe Valmont ? Jul . Julian He will be here at almost any moment . Von A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REIN . gets up and strolls up stage with Rie . At any moment . Jul . Julian He has gone to the office of the Minister of Police . All turn toward Jul. interested . Von A. Von Armin And why ? Jul . Julian To get certain information . For a month past all of us  --  mother included  --  have been prosecuting the most rigid inquiries through the medium of the different officers of justice . Rein . Von Reinwald Aside to Rie . Aha  --  into his past career  --  they mean to examine his titles . Von A. Von Armin You surprise me more and more . On what undertaking have you entered ? Jul . Julian Rising . One you may call Quixotic , but which we call  --  an act of justice . Von A. Von Armin I should never laugh at the sentiment that inspired such an act . But why should the Abbe go about it so late at night ? Jul . Julian Because he would not rest until the first steps were taken to right this wrong . Von A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julian Rather by our family . Von A. Von Armin It is a secret ? Jul . Julian No , but it so nearly concerns us . Bell . Von A. , Dur. , Rein. , Rie . Von Armin , Durley , Von Reinwald , Riedel Clustering R. and L. The ladies ! Whisper . BLASWITZ enters , C. L. , and announces . Blaswitz . The Abbe Valmont . All . Ah ! Each gives different expression to this exclamation . JUL. one of joy , others of relief . Von A. Von Armin Hurriedly to Blas . If the ladies come  --  Blas . Blaswitz Breathlessly . Yes , sir . Von A. Von Armin Same . Detain them at the door by any means . Blas . Blaswitz Same . I will try , sir  --  but I think it will be a tough job for one . Exits , C. L. Jul . Julian Now , my dear cousin , here is one you will learn to love . The ABBE VALMONT enters , C. L. , stops , C. , with a gentle smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von Armin Advancing . Welcome , sir  --  and enter . Jul . Julian Introducing . My cousin , and brother that is to be . Abbe Valmont . I am most happy to take your hand , sir . You are to become a member of the happiest home , I believe , that exists on earth . Von A. Von Armin R. C. Let me present my friends . Mr. Reinwald  --  Lord Durley  --  Mr. Riedel . Rein . Von Reinwald After shaking hands with the Abbe . Gad ! I have n't the heart to wish the old boy away , now he 's come . Jul . Julian But tell us quickly , my good sir , what your news is ? Abbe . None yet . But in an hour a message for you will be delivered here . Jul . Julian Then the police think they have a clue ? Abbe . They hope so . But these gentlemen seem surprised . Have you not told them ? Von A. Von Armin As you came in  --  Jul . Julian I was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search . VON A. reaches a chair and places it C. ABBE sits . JUL. stands beside him . VON A. sits facing him , R. , DUR. and REIN . on L. DUR. nearest Jul . RIE . on R. Abbe . It is shortly done , gentlemen . The point is as soon reached in tales that are sad , as in those which set the circle in a roar . Jul . Julian To Von A. Have I never spoken to you , cousin , of a former secretary and steward of my father , who was called Jacques Morel ? Von A. Von Armin Not that I remember . Abbe . This M. Jacques Morel  --  for he was of good family  --  was a reserved and moody man . Although he was an excellent manager , the old count , Julian 's father , quarrelled constantly with him . One day an error was discovered in Morel 's accounts . The countess , who usually acted as peacemaker , was absent at the time . The count had Morel 's Books examined  --  and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable deficit was discovered . Von A. Von Armin I remember now the circumstances . Jul . Julian It was the summer we were boys at Weimar . VON A. nods . Rein . Von Reinwald I hope the precious steward got his deserts . Abbe . He was driven from the place covered with shame , and the news of his ignominy was published far and wide . He stole away , taking with him his daughter  --  a child four years of age . Von A. Von Armin And this was  --  Abbe . Fourteen years ago  --  from that time Morel 's name was never mentioned in the old Count 's presence . The new steward , a plausible fellow , pretended to find other evidences of embezzlement in searching the books . A year ago , as you remember , the Count died . Then the Countess , who never ceased to believe in Morel 's honesty , called her son to her , and together they investigated the old accounts . The task was tedious , but sustained  --  she by hope  --  he by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  Dur. , Von A. , Rein. , Rie . Durley , Von Armin , Von Reinwald , Riedel Together . Well ? Abbe . The entire vindication of Morel . The discovery of accounts imperfectly kept , but not a florin abstracted . Rein . Von Reinwald So you sent for the steward and installed him again in his place . Abbe . Sir , it was fourteen years since he and his little daughter had been driven from the door . Unjustly  --  unkindly driven  --  with shame so heaped upon him that he had to fly the country . The feelings of the Countess may be guessed . She said to me , " I hear the sobs of these poor outcasts sounding through the castle . I fancy the fruit of our fields are stained with their tears  --  where shall we find them to make reparation . " Von A. Von Armin You made search , then , at the office of the Minister of Police . Abbe . Yes , but up to this day in vain . We have offered rewards , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Madelaine . Dur . Durley I can well understand the good lady 's regret . But there was no fault on her part  --  nor yours . Jul . Julian I , sir ! I inherit my father 's wealth . I must undo his injustice and right those he has wronged . Rein . Von Reinwald Aside to Dur . A pretty good story  --  do very well for the theatre in a modified form . Abbe . From the police we have learned that some three years ago there died in the public hospital a man whose appearance agrees with our description of Morel . He left a daughter  --  but all traces of her have been buried beneath the waves of life that break over great cities like this . And yet she must be found  --  we are here to exhaust every means in the power of men to discover some clue to this unfortunate girl  --  this poor Madelaine  --  so young  --  so helpless  --  alone  --  unfriended  --  exposed to every harm that can befall the body or attack the soul . Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dur . Durley Command me as you think best . Rie . Riedel And me ! Rein . Von Reinwald Musing . Madelaine ! eighteen years old  --  or thereabouts ! It seems to me  --  Jul . Julian L. C. You believe that you know . Rein . Von Reinwald I know several Madelaines ! All about that age . Perhaps I can assist a little . Von A. Von Armin Aside to Rein . Do n't jest about it , Otto . Rein . Von Reinwald Jest ! Pooh ! Takes out note-book . I 'll take down the name : " Madelaine Morel , 18 years . " Blonde or brunette ? It do n't matter ; they change so as they grow up . I 'll make a little voyage of discovery . Let 's see  --  the first place to inquire is in the ballet . Jul . Julian Is it possible you will find her there ? Rein . Von Reinwald What ? Afraid of the ballet ? That comes of reading serious literature . I 'll make the search . You may look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll roam through the ballet . Bet you fifty I find her first . Abbe . I have always had a nameless fear for her fate , and I yet dread to think that when we find her  --  Covers his face with his hands . Jul . Julian Putting Abbe on shoulder . Let us rather hope for the best , good friend . I 'm afraid , gentlemen , we have wearied you with our gloomy story  --  so important to us , but indifferent to others . But you will excuse me , I know . Laughs gently . It 's all owing to the serious literature . Rein . Von Reinwald ' Pon my word , I 'm in earnest about helping you . Jul . Julian To Abbe , after bowing thanks to Rein . In an hour , you said , the police are to send a message . Abbe . Yes , in an hour . In an hour we must know everything . Rein . Von Reinwald To himself . Where shall we begin ? There 's a ballet at the Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens full of them all over town . Three or four sharp bells . All start . Aha ! To Von A. , Rie . and Dur . We forgot that we were standing on the brink of a precipice . These voices heard outside quick and lively . Merope . Not at home . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Pervenche .

You make a furor , engagements pour in from all quarters , and we all accumulate fortunes and retire . Mer . Merope A splendid plan  --  I can see the first night , now . Tremendous excitement ! Debut of Mademoiselle Pervenche ! Ticket speculators wild with joy , and making five hundred per cent . on front seats . Per . Pervenche Do you think I would consent to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

I am embarked in the venture . I call on you first , because I feel that you are the party to make the success . But there are other young ladies of no talent , who are equally destined for success , on whom I must call , if you refuse . Takes hat , as if to go . Per . Pervenche I fear I must decline . If I go on the stage , it must be under the guidance of Mademoiselle Merope . Going to Mer . Blas . Blaswitz Not to commence at the foot of the ladder ? Per . Pervenche Rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go up step by step , and your friends will get tired of watching you crawl to the top . I offer to tie you to the top , and then raise the ladder . Per . Pervenche Laughs . Really , I 'd better think over that , but for the present my humility  --  Blas . Blaswitz Do n't be humble . Do n't , I beg . Humility never yet enabled an actress to accumulate a fortune and retire . Clock strikes eleven . Mer . Merope Hullo ! why it 's eleven o'clock already . I forgot all about rehearsal . But then they can wait . It 's only the little people of the theatre who ought to be punctual . We , in the leading ranks , can afford to be late  --  and if the manager dares to fine us  --  Blas . Blaswitz Aha , what do you do then ? Mer . Merope We threaten to leave the theatre . Blas . Blaswitz Eagerly . Permit me to see you to your carriage . Mer . Merope With pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good spirits now I can leave you alone for a few hours . Remember  --  no love  --  it is not for us .

It 's a certain plan by which you may accumulate a fortune and retire . Exeunt MER. and BLAS. , L. 3 E. Per . Pervenche Who has paid no attention to Blas . She is right . Love is not for us .

I have been very anxious about you . Per . Pervenche About me ? Pray sit down . Mar . Martha Oh ! no , no . The lady might come and not like to see a friend of her servant 's sitting down in her parlor . But let me see  --  yes  --  you must know that day before yesterday a man came to our house and asked all about your father ; his age ; what he was like , and whether he had a daughter , and what she was like , and her age and her name .

How , Madelaine , do n't tell Mademoiselle Pervenche what I have said , for of course if she is kind to you , what have we servants to do with her character . PER . turns away . " Go , " says the man to me , " for we should like you to identify the girl . " But I came to warn you , not to trust him . He may mean well , but there are plenty of wicked people in the world .

After all , we may find she is not the one we seek . Abbe . L. We can but make the inquiry . Jul . Julian Yet here is the memorandum from the Minister of Police . " When you enter the house , do not inquire for Madelaine Morel , by name ; she is living there under an assumed title , and may deny herself . When you are face to face with the young woman , you can surprise her into an admission of her identity . " Very mysterious all this  --  what should we do first ? Abbe . Here is a person  --  I say , my good creature . To Wil Wil . Wilhelmina I wonder what they want here  --  a subscription for some church , no doubt . These people take money even from actresses .

Wil . Wilhelmina Certainly , sir  --  more friends  --  well , she must have a very mixed family . Exits , R. Jul . Julian Why not send my card ? Abbe . Because I do n't like the look of this place . Madelaine Morel , the poor orphan , with a house  --  impossible . It must be some adventuress , and if you announce your errand to her , she may take advantage of the situation to impose upon us . Remember , we can not recognize in a woman , the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Jul . Julian My heart is almost bursting with anxiety and dread . To stand face to face with the victim of my father 's unjust anger  --  to make atonement so late  --  I feel like a criminal before his judge . Abbe . Be calm , Julian . Jul . Julian I hear the rustling of a woman 's dress . Stay , would it not be better that I speak with her alone , while you at a distance observe her closely , and if you suspect  --  Abbe . A good thought . I will step into yonder balcony . But remember  --  let her speak first . Exits , C. Jul . Julian She is here ! PERVENCHE enters , R. Starts . Pervenche ! Pervenche . It is you . After a pause . Oh , sir ! Why have you come to seek me ? Jul . Julian Bewildered . Can it be ? No  --  no  --  I did not think to find Pervenche  --  Sorrowfully . Per .

Speak now  --  I listen . My heart vibrates with emotion at every tone of your voice . Speak , if you will , of the past . Your future shall be happy  --  it shall be my care . Per . Pervenche My past !  --  ' t is the history of thousands like me . A father suspected of wrong  --  dishonored and driven from his home  --  with me , his only child , his sole remaining treasure . We came to the cruel city ; but the story of his guilt had traveled before us , and none would employ him . After months of search and struggle , he fell sick of despair and grief . Jul . Julian ' T is she ! ' t is Madelaine . Aside . Alas ! Poor Morel . Per . Pervenche I grew up to labor for us both , yet I was not unhappy  --  it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I carried home my work at night , I pushed through the thronged streets in timid haste , hiding my face and pressing my lips together , lest they should smile an involuntary encouragement to passers by . Then I soon hurried back to our little garret , with the bread I had earned in my hand and  --  for it was all I could afford  --  a tiny bunch of the humble plant whose name I bear . Jul . Julian And this was your girlhood ! Per . Pervenche And yet it grew darker . My father 's malady grew worse  --  and they carried him to a hospital . I was allowed to stay by him until he died  --  and I followed his coffin to a nameless grave . Jul . Julian Poor child ! Per . Pervenche Somewhat wildly , after a pause . Then I was alone ! Who can fathom the meaning of that dreadful word but the utterly deserted . Alone ! The wife of the hospital attendant gave me shelter . Her husband was a rude man , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my strength . But my poor hands were not used to the rough task , and the man abused me . I bore all , till one night he came home frenzied with drink . Oh ! the terrors of that moment ! I fled , shrieking , from the house . I ran to the bridge  --  the river sang to me in a bewildering voice : " Come , come ! " In a moment I was battling in its cold embrace  --  then the sound of many voices , the flashing of waters near my deadening ears  --  strong arms reaching forth to grasp me  --  and then the air  --  the stars in the sky  --  the city lights and sounds about me  --  Sinks in chair , L. I was saved ! Jul . Julian Heaven be thanked ! Per . Pervenche Presently came the noise of carriage wheels , and then a kind woman , who alighted and came to see me ; she knew me not , but pity nestled in her breast . She claimed me from the crowd of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the past seemed to me all a fairy dream . Jul . Julian And this kind fairy , this friend  --  Per . Pervenche Was Merope . With her began a new life  --  bright , dazzling , intoxicating , a whirl of giddy pleasure . Rich , titled and distinguished men thronged to our side to bow , to speak , but always to flatter and to praise . At last came one whose tones were more tender  --  Lord Durley . They told me I should listen to him . New scenes of folly were open before me . More and more agitated ; she rises . Last night you saw what they were , and all the rest you know . I speak to you as I would make a confession . It is for you to despise me , to crush me with your contempt . Falls on her knees before him . Jul . Julian Raising her . Crush you ? No ! on me alone lies the guilt . Per . Pervenche On you ! Jul . Julian You have not guessed who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Per . Pervenche Starting back . Madelaine ! Jul .

Pervenche Clutching at back of chair . My brain reels ! What do you say ? My father proved innocent ! I again Madelaine Morel  --  and you ? Jul . Julian I come to make good the wrongs done you . My mother waits eager to clasp you in her arms . Heaven has , in its own time , righted you . ' T was heaven directed our steps , it was heaven made me love you from the first moment I  --  Per . Pervenche Recoiling . No ! no ! I beg of you  --  forget ! forget ! Jul . Julian Clasping her around the waist , she gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not turn from me , Madelaine , nor hide those tearful eyes , but look on me with forgiveness , with love ! Per . Pervenche Tearing herself away . No , I must not  --  I must not ! Jul . Julian Do you then refuse to forgive , to accept our reparation ? Oh , Madelaine ! hasten with me ! fly from this house , this life ! And when I tell you that your happiness , your future is now mine , can you doubt me ? Per . Pervenche But the past  --  the past  --  Jul . Julian Taking her in his embrace . As the summer cloud floats swiftly by the blue sky , so shall those memories pass away . To you no more regrets  --  to me no more fears . The veil of love shall cover all with its sweet and holy mystery . During the last words the ABBE has appeared at back , and , leaning on his stick , regards them sadly , but motionless and silent .

Do you not share her delight ? Mar . Martha Oh ! I 'm delighted enough , your reverence , but I ca n't help thinking there are many people just as deserving as she is in our village , who might be sought out . Why , she do n't look a bit as if she were in want . Abbe . It is none the less our duty to protect her . Mar . Martha I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in rags . See now , your reverence , what good does it do to help a person who do n't need it . Abbe . It is a debt we discharge . You would not refuse to pay what you owe because your creditor is rich ? Mar .

Aloud , taking a seat at back of table . Madame , have you not told me that you had chosen for Julian a wife . Or have you renounced the idea of a union between him and Mademoiselle Lengfield ? Count . Countess No ; I am certain Julian will love her yet  --  though at present , he is wholly indifferent ; so I will not press him on the subject . Why do you ask ? Abbe . Reflectively . Nothing  --  nothing  --  but I agree with you , it is better not to press him on the subject for the present . Rises and gets back of table . Count .

Lotte Oh , but I did n't let her see it , for I remembered that to the unhappy the gladness of others gives new pain , and I showed her no more . Count . Countess You think then she is unhappy ? Lot . Lotte She did not say so . Yet one can tell . But , mamma , how different she is from what I expected .

Julian Do n't weep , mother . I only wish to make you happy . Count . Countess It is joy that brings these tears . And so  --  Jul . Julian You have guessed it  --  the time is come . Count . Countess The fairy princess is found , then ; rescued from the dungeon ? Jul . Julian Yes , it has all come to pass . I need not tell you when and where I found her , but the first moment I saw her , a new sense in my heart told me there was sympathy between us . Count . Countess Tenderly . My son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Abbe could not fail to see it . Count . Countess You have taken the Abbe into your confidence , too . This is well . How sure I was of your good heart  --  tell me the name of  --  my daughter . Jul . Julian All in a little while . But first  --  you know her . Count . Countess I know her ! Then your choice is worthy of your name and rank . Jul . Julian It was not for that I chose her , mother ; it was because the first glance of her eyes lit the sacred fire in my heart  --  it was because she created in me  --  love . Count . Countess My son , I have no wish but to see at your side a good girl who loves you . Jul . Julian It was your lessons  --  your teachings  --  that encouraged me . How often you have said , " Rather marry the gentle girl who loves you , than the haughty beauty who suffers your adoration as her due . " Count . Countess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julian You love her already . She looks at him wonderingly , then turns away thoughtfully . And you do not guess  --  you have not suspected ? When we left home to seek her  --  COUNT . turns suddenly and looks into his eyes . How little did I dream the reparation we should make would be so sweet and so complete . And when we found her  --  Count . Countess Amazed and interrupting . Julian , you do not mean  --  Jul . Julian Yes . Madelaine . Count . Countess Rising . Madelaine . Pointing off where Per . went off . Jul . Julian Yes , she . The victim  --  the unhappy one  --  over whose tender years our cruelties  --  Count . Countess Stay , Julian  --  it is not possible .

Julian Impossible ! About to rise ; she draws him back . Count . Countess Let us speak calmly . We owe this  --  Shudders , then at a gesture from Julian We owe Madelaine a great debt , and we must pay it , but not with our honor  --  not with the honor of our race  --  we have a duty  --  Jul . Julian Rises . Duty , mother ! you taught me there was no honor save honesty and good faith . No family but mankind . Count . Countess Rises . Your passion has conquered your reason . Jul . Julian It is not passion . My love flows unrestrained from my very heart . Oh , mother , in this very crisis of my life , do not let me think your teaching was an empty sound , and that when the time has come to test it , it must give place to a selfish and unworthy pride . Count . Countess I do not ask that . I only ask that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indignantly . Mother ! Count . Countess Let me finish . A word dropped from Madelaine has told me volumes  --  an indelible stain rests upon her name . Jul . Julian Intensely and taking her hand . Mother , who is the cause of it ? Who drove them forth from these doors and left her to the fate of the homeless and the fatherless  --  was it not we ? COUNT . turns away . Now that she rises from her fatal past  --  rises to lean upon the pillar of a pure love  --  shall we thrust her back and once more take our fatal part in the work of ruin ? COUNT . sinks in chair near table , JUL. kneels beside her . Have you not humbled yourself to Madelaine  --  asking to be forgiven ? Have you not told her it was divine to forgive , and when she asks forgiveness , what do you say ? Count . Countess My son you are better than I. Jul . Julian I am only what the best of mothers has made me . All I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is all I beg to-day from my mother 's love . Count . Countess Aside . What can I say ?

Jul . Julian I promise it . Count . Countess And you will say nothing to Madelaine ? Jul . Julian Not a word  --  neither to her , nor to any one till you yourself tell me she is worthy of you . Count . Countess Aside . If I have but time to speak with her . To tell her that she must  --  must what ?  --  heaven forgive me . Is she again to be driven from our doors ? MARTHA enters , C. R.

I had got a list of twenty-seven Madelaines for you  --  blondes , brunettes , pretty and homely . I made the most minute researches too into their past . I 'll tell you all about it after dinner . Von A. Von Armin But where is Lotte ? Count . Countess With her new friend , unless , indeed , hearing your voice  --  LOTTE enters , dressed newly with flowers and ribbons . Lotte . Oh ! Frederic .

What is the meaning of this ? My intended and Pervenche together ? Jul . Julian Resenting the tone . Frederic ! Rein . Von Reinwald Gaily . Oh ! I see how it is . This is your revenge for the joke we passed on you . But it 's a bold play to bring her where your mother is . Oh , rustic innocence ! Oh , disciple of Lacordaire ! Ha , ha !

Am I to look upon this in a serious or a comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you . Von . A. Von Armin Well , at first it seemed as if you were about to offer me an insult  --  bringing this girl into the house with my future wife . You intend to have her at dinner , too . A good offset for my little supper . Jul . Julian I entreat you not to speak in that mocking vein . Von A. Von Armin Mocking ? Oh , by Jove ! which of us has the best right to reproach the other . You bring Pervenche here . Jul . Julian Do not repeat that name . I bring Madelaine Morel here . Von A. Von Armin As you please  --  Madelaine Morel . Is she any the less Pervenche , the town talk , whose acquaintance you made at my supper ? and is it any the less scandalous to conduct her into the bosom of your  --  in fact , my family . Jul . Julian Scandalous ? when may duty imperatively demanded it . Von A. Von Armin Now do n't . Do n't let us argue about duty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man about town , to tell you , the son of my good aunt , that in bringing this  --  this Mademoiselle Morel here , you compromise your sister and me . Jul . Julian I am justified in everything I have done . Let us say no more ; we can not see the matter in the same light . Let us each go our way until your marriage . I beseech you to do nothing  --  say nothing , until you have taken Lotte away . VON A. turns angrily . Beware how you trifle with the happiness of my whole life . Von A. Von Armin Oh ! I see it ! You are in love , actually , seriously in love . Throws himself in chair , smiling . Jul . Julian Frederic ! Von A. Von Armin Oh , come , be frank . Confess , now , if Madelaine Morel had not been the beautiful Pervenche , you would have had other ideas of duty respecting the poor orphan . Jul . Julian Frederic ! Von A. Von Armin But , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jul . Julian What do you mean ? Von A. Von Armin Laughing . Why , that you are not responsible for your acts . Do you know what love is ? What it can do ? Shakespeare has given us an instance  --  Titania becomes enamored of a clown with an ass 's head . Jul . Julian Peace , peace , I beg of you . Sinks in chair . Von A. Von Armin Oh , come , I 'm a good-natured fellow , and when a man tells me his whole happiness hangs on thread and all that , why I 've no more to say , of course . Rising . I wo n't interfere with your little matter . JUL. looks up . Instead of playing the part of the villain in the drama , I 'll play that of the confidant in the comedy . I 'll dissemble . I 'll even suppress the indiscreet smile and the aside of the real stage confidant . Ha ! ha ! ha ! I 'll tell you how it shall be . My aunt is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotte . We depart and leave the field to you . Your mamma can exercise upon the unfortunate Madelaine the virtue of Christian charity , and you can console her with the virtue of Christian love . Seriously and emphatically . But , mark me , in a month you will come to me and say : " Brother , you were right , " while Pervenche will be again beside Merope driving through the park . Come , it 's all arranged . Shall we go to the drawing-room and chat with Lotte ? Jul . Julian Aside . Oh , to be forced to listen and say nothing . Aloud . Yes , I will go , and if your eyes are but opened , you will see how your thoughts wrong her and me . Von A. Von Armin My eyes opened ? Did n't I promise to close them ? Ha , ha , ha !

Merope Oh , yes , of course . If things had been as they ought to be I should never have disturbed you . Yet it was a little shabby to run off and leave only a mean little letter . But I 'm ever so glad of your good fortune , my dear . Of course your lover must be a good fellow  --  Per . Pervenche But I told , you nothing  --  Mer . Merope Of course you told me nothing .

I went from you to rehearsal , and Blaswitz went with me . Blas . Blaswitz To still further press my views as to the starring tour . Mer . Merope Wretched man , you did , and to such an extent , my dear , that he quite turned my head . I got to the theatre and met the company  --  we rehearsed . I got the idea somehow that I was indispensable to the theatre and the manager , and gave him some sharp answers in reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to him hot as pepper , and right before all the company , too . But , my love , my illusions about being indispensable were dispelled in an instant . I was discharged on the spot . I flounced out of the theatre . I was frantic with rage . I abused everybody . I abused Blaswitz . Blas . Blaswitz And then she listened to me . I modified my plan . I suggested we should open a theatre . I had opened three banks and the want of capital did n't annoy me . Mer .

You have had a visitor  --  Merope , the actress . Are you so much at home here already that you receive such people in this house ? PER . turns on him . It was an accident , I suppose you would say . Do you think I believe that ? Per . Pervenche You may have the right to call me Pervenche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no right to accuse me of intending falsehood . Yet , I expect no mercy from you . You have already laughed at my tears  --  trampled on my name . May heaven forgive you ! Von A. Von Armin My dear girl , if this family is blinded by a romantic enthusiam , I am not . I can not lose sight of the past . I am sorry to say this , because it was through the last of my follies that you became acquainted with my cousin . And I am , of course , a man who has no pretense to lecture anyone . But I have changed all that . I am about to marry . And to find you here  --  in the bosom of my family  --  at the side of my future wife  --  and not only you . but your friends , also , is a little too much . MER. comes forward , Mer .

Merope Do n't distress yourself  --  I only stay where I 'm welcome . I merely wish to say that my coming was as much a surprise to Pervenche as to you , and if my acquaintance is contamination , it ends with to-night ! Von A. Von Armin Perhaps not . Mer . Merope I think I may safely say , too , that Pervenche did not intrude here , and has accepted with embarrassment the kindness which has been thrust upon her . Von A. Von Armin And by accepting it she has laid herself open to certain reproaches .  --  Mer . Merope Which you should be the last to heap upon her . Von A. Von Armin Coldly I ? Mer . Merope You ! Dare you condemn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , have sacrificed without a thought ? Von A. Von Armin A sermon from Merope , the actress . Mer . Merope I have spoken a few truths while acting  --  let me utter some in real life . You men , feel the sanctity of virtue in your own homes , in the persons of your wives , in the hearts of your daughters . But when your eyes rest upon the defenceless and unfortunate , you forget the sanctity of family . You are about to take leave of your past life  --  that is easy , is it not ? But to forget her past is a different thing . You are fit to marry the daughter of this house , but for her to love the son , that is dishonor , is it not ? I tell you , my pious young friend , these good people here may humiliate Pervenche by their generosity , but your disdain will raise her up again . That 's my sermon . Think it over . Good-bye , Pervenche , and remember , if the day shall come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mine are open . Exits , C. After a pause Von A. 's manner changes . Von A. Von Armin There is justice in what she says . Before I came here to speak with you , I had much the same thoughts . Holding out his hand . Let there be peace between us , Madelaine . We will leave all as Julian has arranged it . I will go away immediately after my wedding , and will let fall no imprudent word about your love and his . The good Countess will still continue to believe that his interest in you arises solely from the fact that you are the daughter of the unfortunate Morel . Per . Pervenche Do you think me base enough to insult her by a deception so gross  --  of betraying her kindness  --  her confidence . The Countess already knows that her son has brought me here as his future wife . Von A. Von Armin Drawing back . His wife ! And she ? Per . Pervenche I await her decision . If it be a condemnation , she can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she can not separate our hearts . Von A. Von Armin Sternly . So , then , these are the amends which this family is to make you  --  the son repays his father 's fault , by laying the honor of his ancestors at your feet . Psh ! It shall not be . With indignation . Per . Pervenche Aroused . What mean you ? Von A. Von Armin This  --  that in me you find one who has a slight interest in your bargain . You are not aware that Julian 's title and property revert to me in the event of his contracting a degrading alliance . These are the terms of his father 's will . Judge for yourself , whether his marriage with you would be a degradation . Per . Pervenche You are deceiving me ! Von A. Von Armin Satisfy yourself . More warmly . If I permit this , I shall be branded with shame , for it will be said that I enriched myself by my cousin 's folly .

Pervenche Barring the way . No  --  No  --  you shall not ! Von A. Von Armin Shall not ? Per . Pervenche Since you are resolved to crush me , you shall find that I can battle for my life , and deal you blow for blow . Von A. Von Armin What do you mean ? Per . Pervenche To denounce you as you would denounce me  --  to tell these people that if I am what you say , it is because the first tempter of my wretched heart stands before them . Von A.

Honor is above every consideration . Rather than your marriage with Julian , my own happiness shall be sacrificed . If you will not stand from the door  --  call them all  --  for I must speak . Per . Pervenche Bewildered . Honor ! Honor above all else ! Oh , sir , that word casts me at your feet . If I can not force you to be silent  --  Kneels. let my tears  --  my prayers entreat you .

Per . Pervenche L. , kneeling . But it is not your duty to kill . Think of the time when age and infirmity creep upon you , when you will lie down to rise no more , and friends will come about your bed . How will it be with you , when your thoughts go back to this night and dwell upon the fate of Madelaine Morel ? Of her whom your cruel words have killed , but whose memory your remorse will never permit to die . Von A. Von Armin Gently waving her from the door . I pity you from the bottom of my heart . But hope not against your reason , for that must tell you that even were my life to be the sacrifice , I must give it to save my honor and my friend . Exits , C. L. MUSIC . Per .

So if you would only  --  Lot . Lotte Oh , we will ! To the others . Wo n't we ? To Blas . Something like this , I suppose . To the others . Let me unfold the precious fabric spreading veil and talking with affected tones designed to conceal your blushes from the curious gaze of the world . All laugh . Fran . Frances Same , R. Oh , charming ! And tell me , breathes my coiffure a spirit of poetry sufficient to rouse the genius of the artist ? Lot . Lotte Same . Oh , delicious ! I almost expire with the soft influences of this inspiring hairdresser . All burst into laughter . Marg . Marguerite Girls , girls ! Do n't , or you 'll ruin my prospects . Remember , I am in the hands of Mr. Blaswitz . All laugh . Blas . Blaswitz Ladies , this is treating with levity a very serious subject . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a hairdresser angry .

It is not possible ! Blaswitz  --  and a barber ? Blas . Blaswitz Industriously working . Blaswitz , Baron , but not a barber . Artist in hair ! constructor of coiffures . Von A. Von Armin But this is a fall from being president of three banks and a manager ! Blas . Blaswitz On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many bank presidents do you know who are able to dress a lady 's hair ? Von A. Von Armin Except yourself  --  none . Blas . Blaswitz I am one of those deities , sir , who preside over fashion . Fashion rules women , and women govern the world . One of my brother gods makes dresses , another pearl powder , another boots , and so on . Our Olympus is the boudoir and our thunderbolts are our bills . Von A. Von Armin Very destructive to the race of husbands . Blas . Blaswitz Oh , we can ruin the peace of families by our simple nod . Just let us send a lady an ill-fitting dress , and where are the comforts of your home then ? Von A. Von Armin Oh ! we are at your mercy , I admit it . Blas . Blaswitz And we enjoy the consciousness of absolute power . I have been in business five months . The greatest ladies bow their heads before me . Energetically . Marg . Marguerite Oh ! do n't pull my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , Baron , poets rave about golden locks and raven tresses . Pulls out a bottle from his pocket and holds it up . We make them . Lovers sigh for a lock of hair . Pulls switch of hair from his pocket . We sell them . Lot . Lotte Silence , slanderer ! Advancing to him . Blas . Blaswitz Ah ! Baroness , he 's a husband ! Of course I never mention these matters to single men . Finishes and comes away . There ! my lady , a triumph of art , and my work is done . Takes off apron and arranges himself . He is very elegantly dressed , evening costume ; pulls on gloves , picks up opera hat and natty cane , places glass in eye . I have only to take my leave and ask permission to be present at church this morning at the ceremony . Von A. Von Armin R.

You are in as much of a hurry as if it were your own wedding . Von A. Von Armin Affectionately taking her hand and embracing her . Ah ! that was the time you were nervous too . Lot . Lotte Pretending to be annoyed , releasing herself . Do n't , we 're old married people now . Von A. Von Armin To Marg . Just listen to the old lady . Marg . Marguerite What does she say ? Von A. Von Armin Calls us an old married couple . Marg . Marguerite And you 've only been wed three months . Von A. Von Armin Do n't you talk to Julian that way after you are married , Marguerite . We men love to think the honeymoon is never to end . Marg . Marguerite Where in Julian ? cruel fellow . He has not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stage , R. Von A. Von Armin Oh ! but there is so much to think about . Marg . Marguerite And yet when I was Lotte 's bridesmaid we could not keep you on the other side of the door . You were continually looking in to hurry us , you said ; but I knew you could n't bear to lose eight of her a moment . Von A. Von Armin But then I 'm a different sort of a fellow . Now Julian  --  Marg . Marguerite Is an indifferent sort of a fellow , you mean . Von A. Von Armin Oh ! by Jove ! Jealous already ? Take care , little lady . Marg . Marguerite Crosses to him . I was only in jest . Lot . Lotte He is the most devoted bridegroom I ever saw  --  so serious , so gentle  --  not like you  --  rattle-brain . To Von A. You were laughing and singing all day long . Marg . Marguerite Because he was so happy . Lot . Lotte And after we were married  --  Von A. Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were the silent partner , Madame Baroness . Marg . Marguerite Silent . I wonder who would n't be silent when she 's married . Von A. Von Armin Why ? Marg . Marguerite Ah , why ? What do you giddy men know of a young bride 's hopes and fears ? Von A. Von Armin Laughs . Well , I declare , and what , may I ask my little oracle , do you know of the thoughts of a young bride ? Marg . Marguerite Taking his hand , gently . They are like those of the sailor who bids adieu to the shores he knows so well , and ventures in his frail bark upon the trackless seas . Many have gone before him , but left no path to guide his course . His trust is in his compass , his hope in the steady hand that directs his helm . So the young bride 's compass is duty and her husband must guide her on the way . Von A. Von Armin But , my dear girl , this is not experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , and what a charming bride you will be , my dear , if you can speak in poetry after three months of marriage . JULIAN enters , L. 1 E. Von A. Von Armin What , Julian ? Julian . Crosses to Marg. as she runs to him . Dear Marguerite , so soon to be my wife . LOT . and VON A. go up . Marg . Marguerite Pouting . I thought you were neglecting me . Lot . Lotte Do n't let her scold you , brother . Von A. Von Armin On the contrary . Let her scold as much as she likes before marriage . That was my plan . Remember only ten minutes . Exits with LOT. , L. 1 E. SLOW MUSIC . Marg . Marguerite Do you know I sometimes think you do not love me . Jul . Julian Not love you ; what makes you fear ? Marg . Marguerite Oh ! I am not afraid , for after we are married you can not help loving me . I will be so gentle , so attentive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marguerite shall have all my heart , for she has given me all her soul . " Jul . Julian Your future shall be as cloudless as this bright morning of our wedding . For your devotion , your unselfish constancy deserves all the gratitude of my life . Marg . Marguerite Leaning affectionately on his shoulder . I loved you since we were children , did I not ? And you never knew it . How many times I cried in secret because you were so cold and strange . JUL. turns his face away . But then there came your sickness , that long fever from which I watched your recovery with a joyful heart . Jul . Julian Turning away to L. That fatal illness . Marg . Marguerite Only think , three whole months you knew not the faces of those that loved you . It was so sudden , too , and no one knew the cause , but I think I knew it . Jul . Julian Starting . You ! Marg . Marguerite It was a little superstition of mine that heaven sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; up to that time I had no hope . But when you became better , so that I could sit by your side and read and sing to you , and brought fresh flowers for your room , and you could see everywhere the tokens of my presence , then you began to think of me . Turns to him . Jul . Julian And the dreams that haunted me began to vanish in the sunlight of your smile and the hopeless passion which  --  Stops . Marg . Marguerite Hopeless passion ? What passion ? Jul . Julian It was but my dream . COUNTESS enters , R. 1 E. Marg . Marguerite Runs to her . Oh , mother ! I am happy at last , am I not ? You have always been my confidant . See how all has happened for the best . Countess . Dear child and Julian . He kisses her hand . Twice have you blessed me , my only son .

Julian Oh , mother ! could I but be sure that the love of this young creature were not misplaced  --  that I could be worthy of it , and that I carried to the altar no traitor 's heart , Places her in chair . Count . Countess Be calm , my son . All before you is full of peace , the past forever blotted from your life . Jul . Julian But not from my remembrance . Do what I will , I can not fly the thought of Madelaine Morel . Count . Countess Hush ! You may be heard . Jul . Julian Yes  --  there it is . I bear a guilty secret with me , and must speak in whispers . Count . Countess A secret , Julian . But not a guilty one . Jul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count . Countess There is no wrong in cherishing a kind remembrance of the dead . Jul . Julian But if she be not dead  --  think of it , mother  --  what proof have we ? Count . Countess What proof , my son ? Fruitless yet incessant search since the night she disappeared . All traces lost after her return to the city . And then those lines from her , traced in a trembling hand , " Farewell ! To-night I end my life ! " Jul . Julian True , and her despair  --  her broken heart  --  her young life  --  flickering for a moment with a ray of hope  --  then plunged into a misery beyond redemption . All these would incite her to the deed . Count . Countess And did you not tell me that once before she attempted self-destruction ? Jul . Julian Oh , mother ! are you certain there is a blessing for us yet  --  here or hereafter ? Twice was this poor creature driven from our doors . What hope have we of mercy , who pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were not to blame , my son . Jul . Julian Was my passion of love less to blame than my father 's passion of anger ? Count . Countess Destiny , which is the hand of Providence , guided all . I believe her now to be happy with her father in that home where there is no exile . Crosses to R. Come , my son , think with me that she watches you with radiant eyes and blesses you , for the little happiness she knew on earth was your love . See how fair is the morning  --  how glad are your friends . Wedding chimes heard . And hark ! those gladdening sounds . Crosses to L. Jul . Julian ' T is a sound of peace and good will , indeed . More cheerful . Mother , I will try to think as you do , and this I promise  --  my life shall not be mine to spend  --  but her 's , who will bless it evermore . Count . Countess Come , my son . Exeunt , L. " Amen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  A cathedral . Interior and view of nave and small shrine . The altar is supposed to be hidden behind a large monument which occupies C. Morning service is just about ended . The sun streams in from the stained glass windows on either side . At the change of scene , the chair are concluding the final chant of a mass . Robed acolytes are passing at back in procession to R. The congregation discovered kneeling , one or two aged ones are crossing from extreme R. U. E. to exits at L. 1 E. A Beadle , in gold lace and with staff , is at door , L. , regulating the passing crowd . During the chant , the congregation all depart by twos and threes , leaving finally three nuns kneeling up stage near altar . Two rise and go off , R. 1 E. , and as the ABBE VALMONT enters from R. U. E. , the third nun , who is PERVENCHE , rises and is about to follow the others . He gently touches her on the shoulder . She looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He raises her and they come forward . MUSIC stops . Abbe . To-day , my daughter , your first noviciate expires , and new vows are to be assumed . Do you yet falter in your purpose ? Pervenche . No , my father . Abbe . There is no lingering wish , no hope , no disquietude in your heart ? Per . Pervenche I have asked myself all this , and the answer is  --  none . Abbe . Ponder well , child , and as you hope for eternal mercy , hide nothing from me . A heavy responsibility rests upon my heart in this . Per . Pervenche Upon you ? Abbe . It was I that followed you that night you fled , and ere the desperate resolution you had taken could be affected , I made you my prisoner by gentle entreaty and gentler promises . Per . Pervenche You saved me from a dreadful crime . Abbe . Dreadful , indeed , for the self-murdered must ever despair of forgiveness . By the side of the dark river , I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , hide yourself from the world , and without a sin , be dead to earth forever . Per . Pervenche Yes , yes . I listened , and was convinced I had but one duty  --  to save him , to save them all from shame ; to bury myself where neither love , nor hope , nor fear should come forevermore . I wished for the grave . You showed it to me in this cloister . I followed you . Abbe . And thus on me falls the consequences of your act . If in your inmost soul you suffer one regret  --  you hesitate ; if one thought of earthly things remain , turn back . This is the hour for deliberation , to-morrow it will be too late . Per . Pervenche Tremulously . Have no fear for me . Abbe . The world is still beautiful , it tempts the young , and you have yet many years of dreadful solitude and pain before you . Per . Pervenche Moved . I welcome them all . Give me penances severe enough to blot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me tasks beneath whose weight the last blossom of my short spring-time may be crushed . I will bless you . Abbe . You can surrender all , then ? Per . Pervenche All . My happiness and my misery , for I was most happy even when I should have been most wretched . Abbe . There is still left in your heart emotion at the thought of those days . Per . Pervenche Do what I may , pray as I will , the root of the vine is not killed ; it struggles to put forth new leaves . Oh ! my father , daily I commit a sin , daily my heart drags me down to earth , daily comes back the wish to know if they  --  if he be happy . ABBE starts back . Do not draw back , do not reproach me . But for this all of life and love would be dead within me . Abbe . Let it suffice then . Julian is happy . He believes you dead . Per . Pervenche And he has forgotten me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sways as if about to fall . He touches her on the arm as if to support her . She recovers . Per . Pervenche Forgotten me . Vacantly . Forgotten me . In tears . Ah , my heart , my heart ! Abbe . Is this your firmness , your courage , your resolution ? Per . Pervenche Forgotten ! and so soon . It is just . I fled from him , when he would have sacrificed everything for me . Love will be avenged , and I must be the victim . Abbe . Forget him , daughter , or take not the sacrilegious vow . Per . Pervenche I will try ! I will try . Solitude , prayer , a living death . These will help me . I must not draw back , for now that I am no more remembered , I have no right to live . Wedding chimes . Abbe . Hark ! You must not linger now . Hasten , daughter . Prepare for the ceremony that makes you one of that holy sisterhood in whose arms you must henceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbe . A wedding ceremony is about to take place . Per . Pervenche A wedding here ? Abbe . How much more glorious will be the sound of those bells , when they announce that you have become the bride of Heaven . She buries her face in her hands . A nun approaches from the R. and takes her hand . See , they come for you . Per . Pervenche Ah ! just Heaven , have pity on me , and bless the happy hearts that beat in gladness with those holy sounds . I bow to Thy will and accept the punishment Thou dost decree . Exit with nun , R. Abbe . Following them to door . May the blessing of the penitent be thine now and forever . Goes up , C. MUSIC , wedding march . BEADLE enters , directing people to seats , MEROPE following in . Merope . As I live , I 'm sure I saw the Baron Von Armin in one of those carriages with the bridal party . Goodness mercy on me . I said to myself , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only three months since he  --  Beadle . Madame  --  Mer . Merope Well , my good creature . Beadle . If you are a friend of the family , you may go over to the left . The wedding will take place in the vestry . Mer . Merope And why not at the great altar ? Beadle . You see they have lit it for another ceremony . A novice is about to take her vows just after the wedding is over . Mer . Merope Then I 'm very fortunate to happen here in time for both . Where can I get a good seat that commands a view of the whole performance  --  I mean ceremony ? Beadle . Over there , madame  --  at the left , as I said . BLASWITZ enters , L. E. Mer . Merope Not Blaswitz ? Blaswitz . Mademoiselle Merope , here ! Mer . Merope Why not ? Blas . Blaswitz It 's the wedding of the young Count , you know  --  Dalberg . Mer . Merope Then the Baron is not going to commit bigamy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blas . Blaswitz Remember you 're in church . Mer . Merope Poor Pervenche ! and so he 's forgotten her already . Well , she should have taken my advice . Blas . Blaswitz And that was  --  Mer . Merope To leave love to those people who marry  --  we have no business with it . But the bride , who is she ? Blas . Blaswitz The one his mother always intended should be . Mer . Merope I must see her . She will not be so handsome as our poor Pervenche . Blas . Blaswitz Laughs . I 'm not so sure . I dressed her hair . Beadle . Coming down . I must beg you to take your places . Mer . Merope Come , Blaswitz , let us bless the young people . They stand aside as the wedding party enters , L.

Merope Coming forward and down , R. He looks pale enough . They say he has been ill . Blas . Blaswitz Yes . After Pervenche ran away ; I heard it all from the servants . Mer . Merope I wonder if he ever thinks of her ? Blas . Blaswitz I 'll warrant he does . He 'd never look so guilty if he did not . REINWALD enters , R. Mer . Merope Why , Otto ! Reinwald . Good morning , mademoiselle . Mer . Merope And so your young friend marries ? Rein . Von Reinwald We all do . It 's romantic at his age . Mer . Merope Poor fellow ! He has had his romance . Do you know yesterday was the anniversary of  --  Rein . Von Reinwald Of Pervenche 's death ? Mer . Merope I felt so gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ha ! ha ! Her voice trembles , and her laugh dies away . There was one little grave with a plain headstone  --  of course it was not her 's . But I said to myself , some poor forgotten one like her , lies here , and so I laid a little bouquet upon the grass . Rein . Von Reinwald Depend upon it , there is not one of us who knew her , but has a sad heart now and then . MUSIC changes . Blas . Blaswitz The wedding is over . The wedding party enter at R. and down to L. Rein . Von Reinwald And here comes another procession . Mer . Merope MUSIC louder . Yes . A young novice about to take the veil . Heigho ! Rein .

Both processions moving at the same time , and as JULIAN comes down , L. , with Marguerite on his arm , he sees Pervenche . He makes a step from Marguerite 's side , cluches the Abbe 's arm , and in a whisper , cries : Jul . Julian Father ! father ! Look there ! Is it possible for death to surrender its victims . Aloud . ' T is Madelaine . All stop . Abbe . Coming forward . Forbear , my son ! Interrupt not this holy ceremony . He restrains Jul . Jul . Julian In the name of Heaven , answer me ! Is it not Madelaine Morel ? Pervenche . Slowly raising her veil . Yes ! Jul . Julian Can the grave release its own ? Looking round upon the others . What trick  --  what falsehood have you practiced on me ? Stand away ! I will speak to her ! Per . Pervenche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jul . Julian You ? You deceived me ? Me ? to whom you promised so much  --  to whom you swore eternal love ! Abbe . Do not assail her ears with vain remembrances . Think on what she is about to become : the bride of Heaven ! Jul . Julian ' T is false ! Heaven will not accept a heart stained by treachery . Per . Pervenche Oh ! spare me your reproaches ! Jul . Julian What evil counsel tempted you to forsake me ? In this sacred temple I charge you , speak the truth ! Per . Pervenche It was my love for you . Jul . Julian Bitterly . You loved me ? Per . Pervenche Too well to dishonor you . Jul . Julian And , no doubt , you love me still ? Per . Pervenche Do not tempt me beyond my strength . Jul . Julian Go , then ! take to the cloister , where so many stained with crime have sought repose , your own evil heart  --  and try what penitence there can wash out the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I would have died for you . To have given you happiness I would have yielded my blood , drop by drop . I learned the shame that you would suffer in wedding me  --  Jul . Julian And rather than share my shame  --  you fled . Per . Pervenche No , no ! I swear ! here in this holy place , I swear  --  it was to save you . Jul . Julian What signify your oaths ! One act of fidelity would have been worth them all . Per . Pervenche What shall I say  --  what do to prove it ? Julian ! leave me not in anger ! send me not to my living grave covered with your reproaches and borne down by your contempt ! Lifting her arms to heaven . Merciful Heaven , spare me this last agony . Show me how to prove my love . See , for you I sacrifice my last hope of peace , and by a sacrilege at which all men will shudder , prove my faith ! Tears her veil from her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that covers my sins with Heaven 's mercy ! I call down on my guilty soul the thunders of a curse that none can hear and live ! All start back appalled . For you  --  for you I close the gate that opened for my redemption ! With you I will fly from all hope , forever more ! Julian ! my heart 's love ! call me once more to your side . I will die , but it shall be in your arms . I can not give thee up ! Falls on , her knees before him . Jul . Julian As MARG. runs to his side and clasps him round the neck ; he gazes wildly at both . What have I done ! Oh , Madelaine ! rise ! rise , I beseech you ! It is too late ! Per . Pervenche Too late ! Rising and looking wildly round . Too late ! Jul . Julian I believed you dead . I buried in your grave the love I had sworn to bear you all your life ! Per .

For you I fled ! And now  --  for you  --  shrinking back at sight of her veil on the ground I have insulted Heaven ! Abbe . Advancing gently . Unfortunate woman ! Per . Pervenche Shrinking from him . Touch me not ! Call me not ! Already I hear a voice that condemns me to despair . Let me hide ! Cowering . I am not fit to die ! Suddenly throws up her arms . JUL. seizes her . She suddenly becomes calm . Jul . Julian Unhappy one ! hope yet for forgiveness and life ! Per . Pervenche Dreamily . For happiness and life ! Who spoke those words ? You  --  you , my Julian ? You are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this horror ? Shuddering and close to him , but looking away . I thought ! but it is too dreadful to utter . Take me away . Speak to me in your fondest voice , then I will be happy . ORGAN low . Abbe . Leave her to me . Takes her hand . She falls at his feet and presses her head against his hand . Jul . Julian What new terror is this ? Abbe . Beckons Mer. to Per . MER. goes and kneels by her . Heaven , whose mercy knows no bounds , has bereft her of reason . Come to her , for she is forgiven . Per . Pervenche Seeming to recognize Mer. , as glad smile lightens her face , and she says , in a happy , girlish tone of confidence , nestling to her friend 's bosom .
