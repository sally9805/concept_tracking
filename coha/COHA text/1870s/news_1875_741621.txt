txt Hundreds of persons remained at the scene of yesterday 's railroad catastrophe until daylight this morning , watching the operations of the wreckers in removing the shattered cars and locomotives . and supposing that there were bodies of victims in the rains yet to be discovered . All who were seriously wounded , however . had been carried to their homes or the Providence Hospital soon after the accident . In addition to the names of the injured persons given in last night 's dispatch are the following : Hugh Kernan , of Baltimore , formerly proprietor of the " Comique.

One old gentleman who was on the same train when the collision took place , was knocked from his seat , and after he recovered himself made a dive for a window and reached the ground with no other injury than a few cnts. from the broken glass . In the north-bound train was a gentleman sitting quietly smoking a cigar , with his legs crossed , and be did not know anything of the collision until he picked himself up on the outside , and looking around , exclaimed ; Where lies my cigar gone 1 " Christopher Buchanan , the conductor of the outgoing train , known as the Philadelphia Express , received a cut on the right side of the head , severing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no danger except in case of secondary hemorrhage , of which there is no indication . . STATEMENT OF CONDUCTOR BUCHANAN . Buchanan gives the following account of the aceddent : He left the depot with his train at 4:53 P. M. on time , George , engineer , being in charge of the engine , and Harry BeChtel fireman . As the train apprOached the Navy-yard station , near the west did of the tunnel , it was slacked down and stopped to take on a passenger . It was then started through the tunnel and continued to gain headway until it was moving at the rate of fifteen miles an hour , which was about the rate of speed when the collision occurred . It is customary for the outgoing train at this hour to make a halt at the upper end of the double track , which terminated a short distance east of the tunnel , and wait fifteen minutes , if necessary ; for the incoming New-York and Philadelphia Express , due here at 5:15 P. M. If , at the expiration of that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance the train moving north is entitled to the right of way , and the down express from New-York must be watchful and give a clear track to it . Mr. Buchanan noticed that the train was traveling along pretty sharply for the short distance it had to go , and with plenty of time and distance for the train to halt on the double track . pulled the bell-rope for the engineer to " down brakes " and stop . The signal was not heeded , and the rope was pulled a second time for the stoppage of the train , and again not properly responded to . At this time Buchanan was in the rear passenger car looking after the tickets . When he fonifd his directions were neither noticed nor obeyed , and that his train was increasing its speed ' and zettio g off the double track , he became alarmed at the consequences that would ensue if the engine was not immediately chocked . Thinking the rope in passing through the car or over the tender had become fast , and thus prevented the bell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give a verbal order for the returning of the train to the double track . The failure of the gong to sound or the engineer to hear and obey it caused the accident . Before Mr. Buchanan could leave the car the two engines met . Mr. Buchanan had just reached the car door and was about opening it when the collision jammed his head through the glass window , inflicting wounds . He feels satisfied that if the signal had been properly and promptly answered by the engineer the catastrophe would have been averted . The time between leaving the double track and the accident Ras scarcely a minute and if the road bad been straight , instead of curved at that point , the down express would have been seen in time for the Northern-bound train to get back oat of her way . He wondered that the engineer , if his bell failed to ring , did not take the responsibility on himself to halt and wait the usual time , knowing it was the order for that train to wait fifteen minutes at that switch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . ESCAPE OF THE BAGGAGE MAN . A narrow escape was made by Norris Langton , better known among railroad men as " Nip . " He has been railroading for the past eleven years , and bas experienced many accidents and mishaps , but always got off without injury . This time he was baggage-master on the incoming New-York express , and at the time of the collision was among the trunks and boxes , preparing for their discharge on reaching the depot in this city . The first indication he had of the accident was a terrfic jar , the rolling and tumbling of the boxes , the raising and breaking of his car in the middle and the driving of the truck bolt with lighting swiftness from its socket . This was quickly succeeded by the telescope process . In addition to all this the stove was upset . " Nip " succeeded in digging his way from under the debris and escaped with a few slight scratches . Engineers and Fay and fireman Bechtel , and passengers George W.
