txt The Lyceum Theatre , once known as the Theatre Francais , but so remodeled by Mr. Pechter that recognition of the cad edifice , without or within , would be impossible , was formally opened for the season last evenings The audience gathered was exceedingly large and critical , and there were no desertions between the outset and the close of the rehearsal of " Notre Dame . " It will be inferred from this that the entertainment was successful ; in spite of the rather doubtful impression of some passages of the representation , the inference is a correct one . ' , The view of the auditorium seemed in itself repayment for the visit . The Lyceum has been so often described in this place that it need not again be pictured . Last night the spectators must have admitted that the praises sounded in relation to its magnificence were not undeserved . It is not a large house , but with its beautiful proscenium , on which tropical vegetation is beheld stretching to the skies ; with its splendid curtain of lace and silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich crimson seats , and , over all , its superb dome , in which is set a huge chandelier , bright with diamond-like effects of light , it is certainly the most elegant theatre in the City . In a great many respects the performance was worthy of the stage . " Notre Dame , " a three-act drama by Mr. Andrew Halliday , commended for production at the Lyceum by a run of upward of 300 nights in London , is a rather monochromatic play , but it affords scope for a fine raise en seine and for several forcible personation . We do not purpose to recount the story , with which most readers are familiar from a perusal of Victor Hugo 's novel on which " Notre Dame " is founded , but will merely note that the action is divided into three parts . The first reveals the love of the priest , Claude Frollo , for Esmeralda , and the mad passion of Quasimodo , the deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral , for the same fascinating zingara , the act culminating in an attempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second act shows the machinations of the priest against Esmeralda , whom he consigns to death on her refusal to yield to his desires ; and it terminates in the rescue of the gypsy by Quasimodo . Act the third brings Claude Frollo and his intended victim face to fate once more , and ends in the death of Quasimodo , the hunchback , however , before succumbing , sacceeding in effectually freeing Esmeralda from her persecutor by hurling him from the towers of Notre Dame . As implied above , in the illustration of these incidents by handsome scenery and dresses , and appropriate pageants , lay last night the special success of the representation . The eight views of Paris , painted expressly for " Notre Dame , " are , one and all , of remarkable ? truthfulness and beauty , and the set by means of which the cathedral is literally put before the footlights in all its massiveness and architectural detail , as well as the final tableau , in which the twin towers rise into the heavens with the grandeur , almost , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly-creditable achievements of the artist . The costumes in " Notre Dame " axe fresh , and they are as numerous apparently as the Bands of the sea . The rare spectacle of a mob , actually entitled by its magnitude and behavior to that name , is offered throughout " Notre Dame " by the care of M. Espinosa , the skilled " master of the ballet and of groupings , " and thus , it will be understood , the picturesque dresses are seen to particular advantage . Several pageants are looked upon besides the frequent gatherings of the people of median al Paris , and many striking tableaus aie so secured . In act the first a carnival ballet , a chores of zingari , and a bacchanalian dance , and in act the second a fine procession , are admirable and wholly legitimate means of giving prominence to the valuable and tasteful stage-attire bestowed upon " Notre Dame . " We shall not , however , attempt to deal exhaustively with the incidents of yesterday 's performance , which was concluded not at a very late hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to render a careful resume of impressions difficult of accomplishment . We have said already that in " Notre Dame " two personation of exceptional excellence might be expected . Mr. Charles Wheatleigh , who is not merely a member of the company , but who discharges also the onerous duties of stage manager , was evidently so weary from his exertions in the last-named capacity that it would have been unfair to await from him the finished portrayal of Claude Frollo we can claim a few evenings hence . Mr. T. C. King , an artist new to the United States , but well known in England , filled the other role , on the adequate assumption of which so much in " Notre Dame " depends , and bore off the honors of the repreertation . Mr. Ring has a fine voice , a peifect knowledge of his art , and he acts with an intense but ever repressed power more eloquent than wild declamation or lavish gesture . The attributes of Quasimodo , it will be understood , are not of a kind to deeply interest an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of Caliban , was not suited to excite much sympathy . But there were genuine earnestness and real sentiment in his acting , and while his vigorous delivery and deeds in the second net , when he bears Esnieralda into the cathedral , and defends Notre Dame from its besieger 's foes , brought about an unanimous call be . fore the curtain , his love-passages in act the third were fraught with a pathos which caused one to for . get for a moment the uncouthness of the monster who could express his adoration in each touching tones . Of the other performances , a notice must be reserved . Miss Jeffreys-Lewis , also a newcomer , was received with favor . She played Esmeralda with sweetness and delicacy , but suffering , clearly , from nravonsness . Both she and Mr. King were twice summoned before the foot-lights at the conclusion of the performance , and Mr. Mansell , the manager , was complimented in a like manner . The same programme  --  to which we shall surely revert hereafeer ? is to be interpreted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ST .
