txt We have frequently taken occasion to point out some of the many advantages which may be expected to be derived from the Centennial Exposition , but we have by no means enumerated all , or nearly all , of them . We are happy to believe that the nubile mind is awakening to the importance of the subject , and that there is a steadily-growing appreciation of the significance of the occasion to our own country . The Exhibition will be in fact the renewed introduction of the United States to the markets of the world . To whatever we may ascribe the fact , it is , we believe , not anywhere denied that our position with reference to foreign markets is relatively not so strong as it was fifteen years since . We have had a long and costly war , diverting much of the labor of the country from its ordinary channels , and closing many of the avenues of trade ; we have had heavy taxation , hastily and crudely levied , not only on imports but on domestic industry , and resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we have had a paper currency which raised formidable barriers between us and foreign nations , and imposed a very important tax on all commercial transactions ; and with these obvious sources nf difficulty and embarrassment we have had many minor ones , which , combined with those wo have mentioned , have handicapped us very seriously in the great competition for the trade of the commercial world . Many of these causes have ceased or are ceasing to operate , and though the country may yet have to submit to great strains , the time is not far distant when we shall ho not only ready but compelled to enter the lists again . Nor this alone . We shall not only find ourselves impelled to compete for foreign markets , but we shall be obliged to meet constantly-increasing competition ' by foreign nations for the control of our own markets . In this we can not long call to our aid a system of extreme protective taxation . The tendency of public opinion , and of events which shape public opinion , is to rather moderate than extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not very marked , and it may not operate very strongly or rapidly , bat it is unmistakable in its character , and it is steadily , though slowly growing in force . The most radical Protectionists recognize this fact , and are prepared to act in accordance with it . We must depend , then , upon our resources as they are , and as we can make them , and must be prepared to meet the manufacturers of foreign countries upon their own ground . If this view of our situation is correct ; if we are approaching a period in the history of our material interests when we shall have to make a strenuous contest for our own markets , and when we must be prepared for a contest for foreign markets also , then the Centennial Exhibition is iu that connection a very important event . It is , in reality , a friendly ? measuring of strength with our competitors , in which it is clearly to our interest to make the best possible presentation of our case . To this end two things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Centennial Commission shall be furnished promptly and in liberal amount . ' Phis is requisite iu order that the commission may provide satisfactory buildings and other arrangements for the exhibition of goods . In the plan which has been adopted the United States will have their fair share of room , and it is important that this plan shall not be curtailed , or its full execution be embarrassed in any way . A timely supply of money to enable the commission to carry out all the details of the project , and to secure commodious , convenient , and advantageous display of goods , is au absolute condition to reaping the full advantage of the Exhibition . In the second place , it is important th at our manufacturers and dealers should lie amply represented . This as a matter that each trade and each prominent . house in every trade can not take up too soon . Everything , so far as our own country is concerned , will depend on it . There might , to great advantage , be an organization in each line of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it is plain that the interests of each member of any branch of trade will be served by the fullest representation of that branch . The greater Jim competition , the greater the value of any honors that may be won to those who win them , while even those who do not win special honors will be benefited by ' the credit which American goods may gain in his particular line . On a grand scale , and with certain limitations , the Exhibition is , after all , a method of advertising , and in that character its importance can not be exaggerated , and is fully appreciated by other nations . We have noticed some talk of the " apathy " of England in the matter . There is nothing of the kind , and for the simi reason that England is never apathetic to its own interests . The English =nag turers are a comparatively compact , highl orgamzed , alert , and energetic body trained business men . If our own peop let slip any advantages which the Expel tion offers , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English will be among the who will have done precisely the opposite .
