txt Viewed by separate sections , there is nothing very imposing in the advance of Russia into Central Asia . It is seven years ago since the battle of hjar compelled the Ameer of Bokhara to cede a large slice of his territory to Russia , to pay a round sum as a war indemnity , and . to conclude a commercial treaty highly favorable to his conquerors . Since then the boundaries of the Russian Power in Turkistan have remained unchanged ; and the latest advices from St. Petersburg reiterate the declaration made before the Khivan expedition had started , that the chastisement , not the annexation of the Khanate , was the object of that expedition . But go back for a third of a century , and the general result of the various extensions of the Russian Power becomes imposing . The interval between Orenburg , on the border of the great Kirghiz steppe , and Samarkand , only 500 miles from Peshawur , on the frontier of British India , represents the vast stride made by the Russian Power since 1839 . The diagonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the territory through which it passes has an average breadth of 500 miles . Moreover , the extent of the country actually placed under Russian administration does not fully represent the growth of Muscovite influence in Central Asia . The Ameer of Bckhara and the Khan of Khokand now hold the territory that remains to them simply at the pleasure of the Czar . Neither of them could ever be induced to face a Russian cannon again , and a detachment from the garrison of Samarkand could . occupy the capital of either potentate after an easy and unresisted march of ten days . The Khan of Khiva has been taught just such a lesson as his brother of Bokhara learned in 1866 . It may be safely assumed that MuilAmmEn RACHIM KHAN will never again be likely to disregard the logic of Russian discipline and . rifled guns , and . whether the Russians leave him his territory , intact or not , he and his successors have become for all time the obedient dependents of the Czar . The line of the Oxus , about which there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of the present Russian frontier . The capture of kniva enables Russia to occupy that line all the way from Badakshan to the Sea of Aral . This would involve the annexation of Bokhara and the absorption of all the cultivated portion of Khiva . It would also involve the nearest approach of Russian and British power in Asia which is possible without an armed struggle between the two countries . Khiva and its ruler form but very trifling elements in the world 's history , but the fact of their subjugation securing the removal of the last obstacle which prevents the Oxus from becoming a Russian stream , gives them a real importance in the politics of the immediate future . Count SCHOUVALOFF gave what the British Government considered au explicit assurance that the punishment of the Khan would be followed by the withdrawal of the Russian troops . There is every reason to believe the assurance which is now repeated , that this will be done . The impulse of trade is behind the Russian policy in Central Asia , but to command the trade of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve in towns and villages built of mud , can hardly be considered inducement enough to break implied pledges given to a powerful rival , and to occupy a country about three-quarters of which are barren deserts . North of the Persian and . Afghan frontier Russia is now virtually supreme in Central Asia . Whatever may be the ultimate consequences of her advance , its present results are on the side of civilization and peaceful progress . Every Turcoman tribe that is brought within the line of Russian outposts is put in the way of being changed from a set of thieves and murderers into law-abiding and industrious citizens . Already there are Russian silk factories and sugar refineries at Tashkand , and the caravans which cross the great steppes are protected by lines of Russian sentinels . In redeeming Central Asia from being the alternate prey of plundering vagabonda , ge and bloodthirsty fanaticism , the generals of the Czar are doing a service to humanity . If they can make the work pay for itself , no unprejudiced observer will grudge them the reward .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
