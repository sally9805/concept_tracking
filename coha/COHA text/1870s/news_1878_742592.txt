txt Within the present century vast progress has been made in the study of the nature and applications of electricity . From the first sparks drawn from the back of the primeval cat by her cave-dwelling mister , to the discovery of the phonograph , there is an immense distance . Nevertheless , it is believed by many scientific persons that we are as yet merely on the threshold of electricity , and that in the future we shall make discoveries infinitely more important than those which the ablest electricians have hitherto made . It is only just beginning to be understood that the electric currents of the earth have an intimate connection with a great quantity of things . The aurora-borealis is believed to be in some mysterious way connected with spots on the solar disk , and those spots in their turn have au influence upon our climate , and upon the spread of pestilential diseases , Recently it has been asserted that no man can sleep well unless the major axis of his bed , and consequently his personal major axis corresponds with the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the currents of earthly electricity flow in the direction of the earth 's axis ; or , in other words , from pole to pole . If they enter a recumbent human being at his feet , and pass out at his head , he becomes sleepy , while if , owing to the wrong position of his bed , they enter him from one side or the other , their struggles to get out again produce such a derangement of his nervous Fystem , as to render it impossible for him to sleep . These are but a few of the hosts of facts which might be mentioned to prove the influence of earthcurrents upon man and - his surroundings , and w o shall yet make discoveries in this particular field , which no one outside of an insane asylum will be capable of believing . The reason why the cats whose howls disturb our nocturnal slumbers are uifonnly found on back fences running in a direction perpendicular , or nearly perpendicular , to the axis of the earth , has never yet been ascertained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the great majority of fences are built parallel to the equator , but this explanation is ' glaringly. at variance with well-ascertained ft ! CtS . BUFFON suggested that cats are mysteriously influenced by the moon , and that hence they prefer fences which no built in the general direction of the plane of the moon 's orbit . This is certainly . a plausible ex : ) 1anation , but it has yet to be proved that moonlight is the cause , rather than a mere incident , of nocturnal. cat concerts . The other explanations which have been hazarded by lesser authorities are scarcely worth mentioning . All that we really know is the single fact that nocturnal cats are distributed around the earth ' in belts parallel to the equator . Fully ninety-three per cont. of the cats that bring us from our midnight couches with bootjaeks in our hands'and rage in our hearts , are found perched upon the east and west fences , and to the truth of this assertion every Now-Yorker will readily agree . In examining this very interesting and important problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Superficial observers have alleged that howling is the natural expression of the tender passion among cats , and that the intensity of a cat 's admiration for the female of his species may be accurately measured by the hideousness of his howls . This is an insult to human intelligence and feline self-respect . Would any young man , desiring to plead his suit with the lady of his heart , place himself under her window and yell as if he were undergoing the severest torments f Of course he would not , and equally of course , no intelligent cat would be guilty of a like folly . The yells of the midnight cat bear every sign of being the expression of the keenest suffering , and only the most perverse ingenuity can regard them as the voice of love . ' We have thus learned that the cat perched on a back fence perpendicularly to the axis of the earth , and to the direction of the earth currents of electricity , howls because lie  --  or she , as the ease may be ? is undergoing acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to south quite as frequently as they do ? over fences running in the direction of the ? equator , but in the former case they experience no pain , and hence do not attract attention by their outcries , The moment , however , that a cat finds himself on an east and west fence he is racked by internal pains ; he tries to relieve his mind by howls and profanity , and he thereby excites the rage of his human audiences . Now , if we ascertain what produces these pains , we shall have found the true answer to the question under discussion . May it not be that electricity is really at the bottom of the whole affair f The cat , lie it remembered , is more addicted to electricity than any other animal , except the electrical eel , and hence is peculiarly susceptible to the influence of the earth currents . So long as the cat walks over fences running from north to south his axis is coincident with the direction of these currents . They pass smoothly through his spinal column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have no perceptible effect upon him . When , however , he tries to walk on a fence built parallel to the equator , his private axis becomes perpendicular to the earth-currents . They penetrate into his vitals and wrench him all to pieces in their efforts to force their way through him . Filled with anguish , he stops , clings fiercely to the fence , and lifts up his voice in frenzied agony . To some extent the muscles of his legs are paralyzed , and he is unable to move until the unfeeling boot-jack comes hurtling through the air and stimulates him into action . He then springs from the fence ; his pains vanish , and his voice is silent , Is notthis a complete and scientific explanation of the question which has so long defied the ablest scientific minds We thus see how beautiful are the reasoning processes by which true science investigates abstruse questions . We also see that one of the most common incidents of every-night life is due to the electricity of the earth . Let us , then , be thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more uses for electricity that any one has yet dreamed of .
