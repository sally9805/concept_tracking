Report of Committee of Ways and Means of the Assembly of the State of New York , 1874-5 ; Special Investigation on the Subject of Taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of the war in 1861 there was no one class of subjects which claimed in so small a degree the attention of the people of the United States as those of a politico-economic character , - more especially such as pertained to the fiscal administration of the State , the methods and objects of taxation , the distribution of wealth , banking and currency , and the like . That this should have been so is not , however , a matter to he wondered at . The nation , and the several States composing it , were at the period // referred to comparatively free from debt . All taxation was li*'lit . Direct taxation by the Federal Government was unknown . Pauperism was mainly restricted to persons of foreign nativity ; while to all who were willing to practise both industry and economy , the ability to command a good subsistence , if not an ultimate competence , seemed comparatively easy . Why should the nation trouble itself about vexing and intricate fiscal and social problems before there was occasion ? And taking counsel accordingly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof , " the nation did not trouble itself . But with the advent and continuance of the war , the creation of an immense national debt the suspension of specie payments , the resort to irredeemable paper money , and the re-enactment of extreme protective tariffs , the condition of things above depicted rapidly changed ; and the questions and problems which in popular estimation were before insignificant , have rapidly become so important , as to constitute not only the theme of never-ending public discussion , but also the certain issues , on which are to be built the national political parties of the future . And as illustrating in some degree the nature and strength of what may be termed the motor or impelling influences which have forced these changes in public opinion , what could be more pertinent than the statement recently made by the Governor of New York ( message of May 11 , 18Th ) , that in 1874 less than two millions and a half of the inhabitants of the cities of New York paid in taxes , nearly as much ( $ 50,429,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - including interest on the public debt - in 1853 , namely , $54,577,000 ? And he might to our profit and instruc tion have further added that , taking the aggregate of taxation as the basis of estimate , it cost more by nearly twenty millions to govern the entire State of New York in 1872 than it did to govern the whole Federal Union - war , navy , Indians , interest and all - in 1849 . The general public , like the tortoise , is naturally sluggish in its disposition ; but as a coal of fire placed on the back of the latter wonderfully accelerates its movements , so the material influence of facts , like those above referred to ( in contradistinction to any moral influence ) , gradually penetrating the hard shell of popular indifference , have // quickened in an amazing degree the interest of the American public in all manner of fiscal and economic subjects . And as a further illustration of how comparatively great the present interest in such subjects is among a people , who ten years ago read few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none at all , it may be also mentioned , that on the subject of specie resumption and currency alone , probably not less than two hundred separate pamphlets - exclusive of Congressional speeches - have been issued from the American l ) ress since 1870 . The various subjects of a politico-economic character which since the close of the war in 1865 have commanded public attention have not , however , come up simultaneously for consideration ; but have been evolved , as it were , gradually , from the changing condition of affairs , and somewhat in the following order : First . The national debt and its transition from a miscellaneous and temporary to a more permanent and consolidated character , - a work the magnitude and delicacy of which , as well as the skill with which it was executed by the then Secretary of the Treasury , Mr. McCnlloch , - has never been properly appreciated . Second . The readjustment of the war system of internal taxation . Third . The questions of currency , specie redemption , and the retroactive application of the enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protective question , - the interest in which was temporarily smothered by the paradoxical results of the Cincinnati Convention of 1872 . Fifth . The relations of the State to common carriers , and the methods of intercommunication . Sixth . The extent to which the complicated system of import or customs taxes were to be administered through the agency of espionage , special agents and moieties ; and latterly , and as yet to a small extent , the subject concerning which it is here specially proposed to treat , - local taxation . In fact , it is one of the curious incidents of our times , that this particular subject , which exclusively embraces within its scope the methods of raising annually a sum for public purposes ( $ 280,000,000 , estimated ) nearly double that at present derived annually from our customs or import taxes ( $ 155 ,  - -  000,000 for 1874- 5 ) ; and nearly three fourths of the total // revenue derived by Great Britain from all imperial taxes (  |p77,000,000  = $385,000,000 , in 1874 - 5 ) , * should up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold whatever on the attention of the American people , and no place of any account in economic literature , - the only treatise or work of any importance , treating of local taxation in detail , published prior to 1870 , of which we have any knowledge , being " A Report on the State Assessment Laws , " by a joint select committee of the legislature of ' New York , in 1863 , to which was appended " A Digest of the Mode or Method of Taxation in the several States , " by Alfred B. Street . In 1870 , however , the very great importance of the subject having impressed itself upon the attention of Hon. John T. Hoffman , then governor of the State of New York , he induced the legislature of that State to authorize the appointment of a select commission ; which commission after an examination of the whole field of inquiry submitted two reports* ( in two successive years , 1872 and 1873 ) , embodying in addition to a draft of a code of laws and a digest of court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in the United States , a discussion of the fundamental principles involved in local taxation , and the theory of ' their more harmonious application to the anomalous condition of thirty-seven contiguous , sovereign States , embraced under one over-ruling and greater sovereignty . These reports also for the first time in this country created any thing approximating to general public interest in the subject . The report for 1872 was immediately reprinted by private parties for sale as a matter of business , - a circumstance most unusual as respects a public legislative document ; while to meet the demands of several constitutional conventions of other States then in session , special editions were ordered and distributed by the State authorities of New York . In Europe , also , both reports were * The aggregate amount annually raised by local taxation ( state , county , city and town taxes ) for all purposes in the four States of Massachusetts , New York , Pennsylvania , and Ohio , is about $ 150,000,000 , apportioned approximately as follows : Massachusetts , $28,000,000 ; Ncw York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $27,952,000 . The amount raised by local taxation in all the other States of the Union can not be estimated at less than $ 130,000,000 additional ; *making an annual aggregate of about $280,000,000. // reprinted and extensively circulated under the auspices of the Cobden Club of England . In one sense the work of the New York Commission was a failure , but in another it has been a success . It was a failure in the sense . that none of its recommendations nor its code have been adopted , and that successive Legislatures in New York have not even so much as proposed to consider its recommendations . It has been a success in the sense that it was the incipient agency in creating a permanent public interest in the principles it discussed , and of the present extent of which the partial list of recent publications constituting the preface of this article affords some indication . Another agency which has also powerfully contributed within th' last few years to make local taxation an independent economic issue of interest before the public , and is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Courts . So long as the aggregate taxation of the several States was comparatively small , as before the war , and so long as the spirit of patriotism engendered by the war regarded no burden designed to aid in the preservation of the Federal Union as too heavy or unreasonable , there was little disposition to criticise closely or to complain at the methods locally adopted for obtaining revenues by taxation . But when , after the war , this special burden by reason of increased debts and expenditures assumed the character of a continually increasing strain unrelieved by anything approximating to sentiment , then men became both critical and querulous , and very soon cases involving funda. mentally the principles and constitutionality of the tax methods resorted to by the several States began to come before the highest Federal Courts for review and determination . The result has been that while as yet little or nothing in the way of reform in local taxation has been effected through the action of State Legislatures , a progress rapid , continuous , and complete to an extent which neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehended , has been made in this same department of fiscal science through a series of decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court ; not a few of the most intricate questions involved , and concerning which it would have been hopeless to have expected early and concurrent agreement on the part of // the States , having , since 1858 , by re-adjudication , or original decisions , been settled beyond the possibility of controversy . These in their proper order it is proposed to notice hereafter ; but prior to doing so , it seems essential to a clear and fall comprehension of the reforms already effected and of those which through all agencies are to be struggled for in the future , to go back and present a review of the whole subject as it were ab initio . The general idea or principle which has thus far been made the basis of nearly all the law and administration pertaining to local taxation in the United States has been founded on a popular assumption , that in order to tax equitably it is necessary to assess everything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense so indefinite as to embrace not merely things in the nature of physical actualities other than persons , but also persons , income , rights , representatives of property , titles , trusts , conclusions of law , debts , and in short any act of assessing capable of resulting in the obtaining of revenue . As a logical sequence of this idea , the exemption of anything from taxation is furthermore held to be not only impolitic but unjust , and if made necessary by circumstances , as something to be regretted . Equally popular and plausible is the argument by which this assumption , and the administrative system based on it is upheld and defended . " Is not all property , " it is asked , " either directly or through its owner protected by the State or Sovereignty ? " " Do not all persons owe allegiance to the State ? " And if so , " Why should not all persons and property contribute to the requirements of the State for revenue , in proportion to their ability ? " But popular and plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of local taxation has been built up , made operative over the persons , property , and business of more than forty millions of people , and fortified by a vast amount of adjudication , it will require but little investigation and analysis to satisfy any one who can divest himself from the influence of old prejudice , of the truth of the following propositions : First . That the assumption that it is necessary to assess everything in order to tax equitably involves an impossibility , // and therefore unavoidable inefficiency , injustice , and inequality in administration . Second . That as popularly used in respect to matters pertaining to taxation , the term property is made to apply equally to entities and to symbols , or non-entities , which in itself is an absurdity ; and , finally , that the outcome of all this is a system which powerfully contributes to arrest and hinder natural development , to corrupt society , and is without a parallel in any country claiming to be civilized . And as further illustration of this latter point it may be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet so unfamiliar to the people of the United States that probably nine out of ten of our best informed readers , and even of the members of the bar , take it for granted that the method of assessing and collecting taxes for local and municipal purposes is substantially the same all the world over , and would be greatly surprised to find on investigation that the American system is one of the things exclusively American and so little esteemed by the people of other countries as to be for this reason strictly " non-exportable . " These assertions may appear unwarrantable to some men , and as testifying of conceit rather than of knowledge ; but whether this be so or not , a consideration of the following facts will help to determine . In the incipient stages of society , where property consists almost or quite exclusively of things tangible and visible , lands , buildings , slaves , cattle , ships , household effects and implements , the theory that equality of taxation requires the assessinent of everything was not impracticable in application , and under most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to arbitrary discriminations in assessing . But its full execution must , nevertheless , even in the most simple condition of society , have been always attended with great difficulties . There is nothing which men more abhor in government than personal inquisitions , and in the language of a committee of the French National Assembly of 1789 ( of which Talleyrand and Larochefoucauld were members ) , the recognition and practice of such inquisitions by any government is something inconsistent with and antagonistic to the maintenance of a free people . Again , had nothing // come down to us in English history from the time of Edward III . other than one of the assessment rolls of the period ( when there was little or no property capable of taxation but what was visible and tangible ) , the evidence would be complete that the mass of the English people were but little better than slaves , for the mere inspection of such rolls shows that their preparation involved such an inquisitorial scrutiny into domestic life , such a seeing , handling , and valuation of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the furniture of the bedchamber , as to make personal freedom or a sense of personal self-respect on the part of the tax-payer who submitted to such a scrutiny , almost an impossibility . And in this connection it is also pertinent to call attention to the circumstance that the famous insurrection of English yeomen and peasants under Wat Tyler in the reign of Richard II . ( the successor of Edward III. ) , originated directly in the attempt of a tax-gatherer or assessor to ascertain by brutal personal examination whether a daughter of Wat Tyler had attained the age of puberty , and in consequence had so become liable to enrolment for capitation ' assessment . But to whatever extent simplicity in the elements of property simplified the original methods and ideas in respect to local taxation , the problem involved rapidly changed , and l ) ecame more and more intricate as increasing population and increasing commerce and intercommunication between States and communities required that property should to a great extent be put into a condition to admit of being readily mobilized , in order to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion of what is to-day popularly termed " personal property " in every highly civilized State is of the most intangible character , and in great part invisible and incorporeal ; such , for example , as negotiable instruments in the form of bills of exchange , State , municipal , and corporate bonds , and the multiplied forms of evidence of indebtedness * A copy of an assessment roll of the time of Edward III . 1329 - 1376 , given by Lingard in his History of England , contains a list of articles down to a towel and a bench ; and the historian notes that in the returns are carefully mentioned the very rooms in which the articles were found , and that there were no exemptions except one suit of clothes for each person , which were supposed to be included in the tax levied on the polls , or the person . // all of which , if entitled to the name of property , is through a great variety of circumstances , constantly fluctuating in value ; is offset by other indebtedness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy of transfer , and by simple delivery is , in fact , transferred continually from one locality to another , and from the protection and laws of one State to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of some other . In the absence of the power of clairvoyance , therefore , any atteii*pt on the part of an assessor to obtain independent cognizance of such commercial and financial instrumentalities for the purpose of valuation and assessment is , on its face , an impossibility ; and if the co-operation of the person to be assessed is to be invited or relied on , two of the most powerful influences that can control human action , love of gain or the unwillingness to part with property , and the desire to avoid publicity in respect to one 's private affairs , immediately unite to oppose and prevent such co-operation . A resort to personal inquisition , with an accompanying machinery of oaths , " dooming , " and penalties is next in order ; under which the State , ignoring all rules enacted for the protection of debtors in the ordinary collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it claims to be a debt , with no better result in nine cases out of ten than the impairment of the public sense of both justice and morality . * But this statement very far from embraces all the difficulties inherent to this popular theory of the necessity of taxing everything in order to insure justice and equality . A further very large proportion of the so-called personal property of the country , which is not invisible or intangible , and which requires * " It is claimed that each individual owes the State annually a certain sum of money ' in the way of taxes proportioned to his entire property . If he voluntarily pays , he escapes arbitrary measures . If he declines to pay or tries to avoid payment , he has no just cause to complain if he is regarded in the light of a criminal , or if the same arbitrary measures are used to collect his tax as if it were a debt owing by one citizen to another . " But let us examine this averment . If the defaulting tax-payer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the worst possible light , he certainly ought not to be deprived of the privileges of a criminal ; which are a right to a public investigation according to the rules of evidence adopted by free and enlightened cominunities ; a right to be heard before condemnation ; and the right to be presumed innocent of having property subject to taxation until the fact is ascertained otherwise by legal proof . But under the existing tax laws , we do not accord to the tax-payer // only ordinary perception for recognition , is in the nature of instruments or subjects of commerce between States and nations ; such as railroad cars ; ships , steamboats , immense stocks of raw or manufactured products accumulated in store for the sole purpose of movement . What shall be the 8itU8 of all these things for assessment ? If actual location is to bc determinative , then a product of grain or merchandise , which , in movement for a market or conversion into other forms , may happen to be in Illinois in April , in Ohio or Massachusetts in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August , and in Connecticut in October , will be liable to five separate taxes in one and the same year ; for the laws of each of these States the privileges of a criminal ; for no tax can be assessed on a large proportion of the personal property of the State , according to any rules of legal evidence that any common law court would adopt . No assessor , under the laws of New York , in assessing personal property can act judicially . The law gives him no power to obtain legal testimony of a character that is admissible in a court ; he must act the part of an arbitrary despot against an inculpated tax-payer , or not act at all , and his conclusions for acting must be reached at best by the testimony of those who have no means of knowing anything , in a legal sense , about the subject-matter under investigation . It seems clear , therefore , that any attempt to tax without legal evidence , is an act of usurpation or despotism , wholly antagonistic to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to characterize such acts as , in any sense , judicial proceedings . " Nor does the right to reduce or regulate the assessment by the oath of the taxpayer relieve the law in any degree of its unequal and despotic character ; for every individual holding public office in the United States knows that oaths as a guarantee of truth in respect to official statements have ceased to he of any value . The assessments made according to the oaths of parties , furthermore , are not made according to legal evidence , upon examination and proofs ; hut according to the will and secret caprice of each tax-payer , instigated by his selfishness , and the natural depravity of human nature . Each tax-payer , undcr the present rule , becomes therefore the interpreter , not only of the law , but of the fact , and makes a secret interpretation of both , and we have as many interpreters of the law as there are numbers of tax-payers ; and also an indefinite multiplicity of assessors ; for each person who unfairly reduces his own assessment arbitrarily assesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could or would any people apply the same rules for the collection of debts2 Is there any one who has so much confidence in human nature that he will propose a law , that a person who is sued shall he discharged from all claims of indebtedness if he will make oath , interpreting both the law and the fact himself , that he owes the claimant nothing ? Is it believed , that under tariff laws , the government could get sufficient revenue to pay for its collections , if the importer was permitted to offset debts against the value of his goods ; or if the law was peremptory that his oath alone should be given , and that there should be no legal examination , inspection or proof of the value or character of the importations ? " - Second Report Uornrnissioners of New York , 1873. // require their assessors to return for taxation all such property as at the periods mentioned may be actually within the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the taxing authority . On the other hand , if the fiction of law that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such property may be taxed where it is not , and where no expense has been incurred by the locality for its protection , and be exempt from taxation in the place where it actually is , and where it shares in the benefits that flow from the protective expenditures , - police , fire department , etc. , - which are incident and necessary to the locality . And in proof that such a supposition , which seems on its face to be an absurdity , is a matter of constant experience under our so-called American system , it may be stated that at present , as for some years past , Houghton &amp; Co. , the well-known publishers , are regularly taxed in Cambridge , Mass. , the place of their residence , for so much of their stock in trade as is kept in store and permanently employed in business in New York City , although it is admitted that the same tangible , visible property is at the same time regularly taxed by the New York authorities ; and furthermore , that when an appeal against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision rendered was , that under existing Massachusetts laws , the plundered tax-payer could have no remedy , except by change of business or change of ( State ) residence . Reference may be also made to the reports of the Commissioners of Taxes for New York City , which admit that cases are continually occurring in that city where of two separate but corresponding and contiguous lots of merchandise , one will be taxed and the other exempt from taxation according as their owners are respectively residents or non-residents of the municipality . Again , if a foreign banker subscribes to any of our State or municipal loans , the bonds or other evidences of indebtedness which he receives in exchange for his money are exempt from taxation by reason of his non-residence ; but if a resident widow , orphan , or maimed soldier , be moved by the desire for security to purchase a little of the same loan , the small ' rate of interest which such investments generally carry will be made still smaller , to all such persons , by reason of an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , or a greater percentage imposed // on the holders for the simple reason that they are residents ; although the protection afforded to the latter is in no degree different from or greater than that afforded to their more fortunate and rival foreign competitors , who reside where such taxes are not imposed ; all of which is equivalent to saying officially that whenever an American loan , particularly desirable for trust ii*vestments , is created , it shall be sacredly reserved for foreigners , or that bad portion of our own citizens who have no scruples about cheating the assessors . Local subscriptions to local indebtedness , with the increase of interest in the locality which would necessarily follow , are therefore discouraged , while to the American citizen residence is made an offence and coupled with a penalty . As a further help to reasoning on this subject , it is also important to call attention here to the circumstance , that the distinction between real and personal property is to a very great extent , an artificial and not a natural distinction . Thus , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as stock in the Bank of France ) , -instrumentalities which in the United States would be regarded as personal property in its most typical form , - may by French law be regarded as real estate , and as such administered upon . Again , before emancipation in the United States , slaves ( which by the Federal Constitution were recognized as persons ) were in some of the States declared by law to be real estate ; and to-day in Wisconsin , the one species of property which is especially typical of mobility , and is of no value apart from capability of motion , namely , the rolling stock of railroads , is also by law made real estate . Equally nice is the distinction in the case of machinery . Unattached or movable , it is personal property ; screwed or fastened permanently to the floor or wall , it becomes real estate . The attempt , therefore , to recognize in a system of laws a distinction which is purely arbitrary , and which the thirty-eight sovereign States of the Union may alter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With regard to the statute law on the subject of taxation , " it is , " says Mr. Hilliard , in the preface to his recent work , " Law of Taxation , " " as voluminous as the constitutional provisions are few and concise . With a general similarity , the laws of the different States are very diverse ; and so numerous and frequent are the statutory changes , that the author disclaims any responsibility for the implied statcmcnt , that the law of any particular State , however recent , is now in force . " // general result somewhat akin to that obtained by the artist , who in painting a landscape selected a cow as his fixed point of perspective . If the cow had remained quiet , the picture might have been satisfactory , but as it was , the details were not harmonious . Consideration is next asked to this point : To tax the instrumentalities or objects of commerce in one locality , and to exempt the same from all direct taxation iii another , will clearly not permit the former to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the latter . And yet this unjust discrimination is exactly what does result from the attempt of the majority of the States in the Federal Union to tax all such instrumentalities or objects under the general head of personal property , and the exernptioii of the same classes of property from any corresponding assessment in the State of Pennsylvania , in the British Provinces of North America , and in all foreign countries with which t e United States enter into extensive commercial intercourse and competition . Boards of trade and commercial conventions may pass " deploring " resolutions concerning the decay of American commerce , and committees of Congress may continue to investigate the same subject , but so long as ships engaged in the carrying trade on the free ocean , and owned in Montreal , Quebec , St. John 's , England , France , Germany , and Holland , are not directly taxed , and ships engaged in competition in the same business and owned in Portland , Boston , New York , Baltimore , New Orleans , and San Francisco , are taxed - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths which are made easy and profitable to it . " The difference in the cost of a single penny in laying down grain at Liverpool , " says the President of the New York Produce Exchange , " may determine the question whether millions of bushels shall be supplied by this country , or shall be drawn from the ample fields of Hungary or Southern Russia . " * And flutally , in regard to so much of the so-called personal property as is visible and tangible , and not included under any of the heads above mentioned ; such as articles of personal adornment , clothing , furniture , works of art , musical instru * Letter of Franklin Edson , President of the New York Produce Exchange , on the Reduction of Canal Tolls , April 17 , 1875. // ments , books , &amp;c. , shall we assume that we have here a class of articles on which it is desirable to levy taxes ? Of course the popular answer will be most decidedly in the affirmative ; for are not all these objects , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation , and are they not in great part also luxuries rather than necessities ? But how , it may be rejoined , are you going to tax them ? for it is reasonable to suppose that if they are to be taxed , it is to be by a system that works equitably , and not by a system which by taxing A , and letting B , 0 , and D escape , brings the law into contempt , and by making the sense of the commission of a wrong on the part of the State the excuse for the commission of another wrongon the part of the individual , gradually undermines the morality of a community that does not wish to be dishonest . Probably the advocate of the infinitesimal system will continue to answer , " Let a law be made which will compel every person possessed of such description of property to make and hand in to the assessors a schedule , and certify to its correctness in respect to items and value by oath . " But such substantially is already the law in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing . Thus in Ohio the law subjects to taxation all visible property above fifty dollars in value , without any offset of debts ; and yet the official reports of the auditor of the State show that the total number of annual assessments in Ohio do not amount to one tenth of the number of the adult 1 ) opldation ; or , what is the same thing , that only one person in ten of the adult population of this great and rich State of Ohio has any property whatever - real or personal - in excess of fifty dollars , which the eye of the law can discover ; although investigation will show that it is impossible for a person to dress respectably or live decently , outside of a poor-house , who has not always at least double this amount of property in his possession . Every intelligent assessor in Ohio , when questioned in respect to the law , will answer , that it can not be executed with even an approximation to exactness , and that a serious attempt to execute it would cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular prejudice , that any attempt to repeal this law would probably be unsuc .. // cessful . Some years ago a commission reported to the legislature of Illinois a new scheme of taxation , in which among other things they proposed that every woman of " full age and sound mind , " - either directly or by her representative , - should annually return to the assessors a statement of the value of all the jewelry , household furniture , and " all other property " in her possession ; but their recommendations never received any higher consideration from the public than that of being denounced and laughed at . And most naturally ; for what woman would tell her age , or the amount and value of her jewelry and finery , and more especially to a stranger , invested with a brief official authority as an assessor , and serving the State at the rate of two dollars per day ? In short , no people - men no more than women - can or will endure the vexing , impertinent , personal inquisition necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in order to tax equitably it is necessary to assess everything ; and yet unless such a system is carried out in all its details , what becomes of the equality claimed for it ? So much , then , for the almost insuperable difficulties having their origin in the nature of things growing out of the correlations of modern civilization , which always must be attendant on the attempt of any sovereignty to tax everything over which it has dominion or jurisdiction . Let us next consider how the situation in the United States in respect to local taxation , already thus made difficult by reason of natural causes , has been further hedged round as it were with embarrassments by the action of the Federal Courts . In the first place , we have repeated decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court ( Ale Culloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheaton , 451 ; Weston v. City of Charleston , 2 Peters , 449 ) , that all agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal government of every name and nature , are exempt from State taxation ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which specially makes applicable what the Supreme Court had before declared to be constitutional law , to a certain class of Federal instrumentalities , namely , all representatives of value , of whatever name or denomination issued under act of Congress , - bonds , coupons , national currency , U. S. notes , treasury notes , fractional currency , // certificates of indebtedness , etc. , etc . Here then , making allowance on the one hand for so much of the national debt as has passed into the possession of foreigners , and on the other for the circumstance that what of it remains in the possession of our own citizens is undoubtedly made the agency whereby at least an equal amount of other property - surplus of savings-banks , and assets of fire and life insurance companies , etc. ,  --  is successfully enabled to evade primary taxation , we have probably one sixth of the personal property of the country effectually placed beyond the reach of State assessmerit . There still lingers a feeling among the masses , that if Congress would so enact , this exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if any person will carefully consider the words of Chief Justice Marshall in passing upon this question , namely , " That the pou'er to tax involt'es the power to destroy , " and that if the right exists to tax at all " it is a right which in its nature acknowledgea no limits , " he will probably come to the conclusion that Congress could not delegate to the States this power of impairing Federal sovereignty if it would , and should not if it could. * Second . We have a denial to the States of the power to tax by direct assessment , license , or stamps , imported goods in their original packages . It took two decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court to restrain the Massachusetts tax officials from assuming and exercising this power . The first , made many years ago , in the case of Brown v. Afaryland , was regarded as * " In the celebrated case of MeCulloch v.

The American people have declared their Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof , to be supreme ; but this principle would transfer the supremacy , in fact , to the States . If the States may tax one instrument employed by the government in the execution of its powers , they may tax any and every other instrument . They may tax the mail ; they may tax patent rights ; they may tax the papers of the custom-house ; they may tax judicial process ; they may tax all the means employed by the government , to an excess which would defeat all the ends of government .

Yet , so reluctant were the Boston assessors to have the unlimited power necessary to enforce unlimited taxation abridged in any degree that they proposed to petition Congress to nullify the Court decisions , by enacting that the States might tax imported goods like general merchandise if they would ; unmindful of the fact that the tenth section of the first article of . the Federal Constitution expressly forbids Congress from making any such enactlnent. * Third . We have the fiction of law , " that personal property follows the owner " for purposes of taxation , broken in upon in respect to all personal property represented by ships , by the decisions of the U.

Pacific Mail Co. , 17 Howard ) , that the 8ilus of a vessel for State taxation is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not where the vessel or owners may happen to be . Fourth . The decision of the U. S. Supreme Court ( State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds , 18 Wallace ) , that public securities have a situs where found , and can not be elsewhere regarded as property subject to taxation , pretty effectually exempts from State taxation all negotiable instruments , - State , municipal , railroad , and other corporate bonds ; - inasmuch as to remove such property from the territory of a State , at the same time removes it for all purposes from the State 's jurisdiction ; as the tax laws of the State , " according to the Court , " can have no extra-territorial operation . " Fifth . In the case of Tappan v. Merchants ' National Ban/c ( 19 Wallace ) the U. S.

" // That the system is a success in the sense that it is effective for raising the required revenue must be admitted ; but the old Asiatic system , which limited its exactions to a few individuals , and sent the public executioner to keep company with the cob lector , was equally a success , and far more simple and ecoiomical . That the existing system has also many defenders and advocates must also be farther admitted ; but this plienomenon admits of expLanation , partially on the principle , that in all cases of fraud upon the public , it is only necessary to get up a qaantam sufficit of any wrong , to make it certain that the abomination will powerfully defend itself ; and partially for a reason similar to that which induces the Esquimaux and the Guinea negro , who have never known anything different from their natural surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be superior to any other . Oii the other hand it is undoubtedly a fact , - and one most encouraging , - that by almost all thoughtful men , who have felt sufficient interest in the subject of local taxation to examine it in the light of the recent reports , investigations , and court decisions , the conclusion has been arrived at that the American system as it exists at present in the majority of the States is too imperfect and too adverse to the general public interests to be either defended or allowed to continue for any great length of time without radical changes ; and yet at the same time this other fact is equally certain , that out of the very considerable number thus convinced ,  --  which within the knowledge of the writer includes many leading members of the judiciary , of the bar , and of the corps of local fiscal administrators in all parts of the country , - very few have made progress enough in their investigations and reasoning to come to any definite opinion , either as to what new plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in what gradual manner it is practicable or expedient to begin the work of reform . " If we were to commence de novo , " writes an eminent member of the bar of one of the New England States , " I would oppose most earnestly the adoption of any system of local taxation analogous to that which we have at present ; but in view of existing precedents , prejudices , and the stereotyped way of doing things , I hesitate about attempting radical innovations . " // An ex-chief justice of one of the leading States of the West , under date of December , 1875 , also thus expresses himself , " Our tax system , I was going to say , is as bad as possible ; but really we have no system . Our tax laws are mainly bad . Federal taxation , to a large extent , is laid for private purposes , and public offices and public sentiment is debauched by it . What can the courts do to better this condition of things ? They may punish a rascal now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of justice , incli*ding in some instances even the judges . On the other hand , if reformers are to address themselves to State Legislatures , what do they encounter ? 1st . A greedy hoard of leeches who would have the tax laws shaped to benefit themselves and not the country . 2d . A majority of the legislature with so little knowledge of the principles of taxation , that they willingly present the breasts of themselves and their constituents for the leeches to fasten upon , under the pleasing delusion that life blood is to be imparted by them instead of being drawn away . And these are not all the difficulties , for much of the legislation that is inspired only by correct motives is vicious because the subject is not understood by those who would deal with it . " Under such a condition of things one inquiry which naturally suggests itself is : Are there any precedents or examples in the past , of the removal or reform of national systems of taxation which had become oppressive , from the consideration of which any profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , that there are at least two examples , in which the historical details of experience , although not as yet specially gathered up and recorded , can be traced with undoubted accuracy ; iiamely , the experiences of England and of France . In the latter country , feudalism , previous to the revolution of 1789 , had come to find its expression almost exclusively in the claims on the part of the various and multiplied representatives of authority - nobility and clergy - to regulate taxation-in respect to both imposition and exemption . Taxation was , therefore , everywhere , in the highest degree arbitrary ; the infinitesimal , inquisitorial , dooming , penalty system , was carried out in perfection ; feudal personal services were compounded for frequent direct and indirect periodical taxes , // payable in money or commodities ; and the only rule of ' practice , which in different districts could prefer any claim to uniformity , was the rule of inequality of assessment and harshness and cruelty in collection . On nearly every estate or seigniory , in addition to a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations involved in production and consumption were as far as possible made the occasion for new and repeated assessments . The tenants , or vassals , were bound to grind their corn at the mill of the seignior only ; to bake their bread exclusively in his ovens , and press their grapes and apples exclusively at his presses , and for every such industrial conversion a toll or tithe was collected . Movements of persons and property from one town or district to another , always involved taxation ; * and every sale or transfer of property carried with it a fine , to the extent of oneeighth , and sometimes one-sixth of the entire equivalent received in consideration . Arthur Young , who travelled in France in 1787-89 , says that even at that time , the very terms used to designate the taxes imposed on the peasantry of France , were in many instances untranslatable into English ; and from a long list of such terms as he has recorded very few can be found defined in any ordinary French lexicon . Ill order , however , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these abominations , it may be mentioned , that one of the local taxes of Brittany , which remained in force down to 1789 , and was known as the " silence des grenonilles " was a money payment , in lieu of an ancient feudal obligation * In Massachusetts and other States , which adopt the fiction of law , that personal property can not be separated from its owner , visible , tangible chattels , as cattle and merchandise , etc. , are liable to be taxed successively in one and the same year ; first in the States where they actually are and by whose laws they are protected , and again where the owner resides , if such residence be in a different State . But in France , under the ancient r6qime , they improved on this , by holding that a man ( at least for a time ) , could not separate himself from a residence once adopted , hut remained there for taxation , although he might have actually and permanently left it . Accordingly , therefore , they taxed all persons leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their former abode , - namely , farmers and laborers for one year , and all other taxpayers for two years , provided the parish to which they removed was within the same district ; hut if otherwise , then farmers were to pay for two years , and all other persons for three years , so that a man under all circumstances in France , previous to 1789 , would have had to pay double taxes , for from one to three years , as a penalty for changing his dwelling . // incumbent on the residents of marshy districts , to keep the frogs still , by beating the waters , that the lady of the seignior , " when she lies in , " might not be disturbed ; while another exaction , even more outrageous , was the tax known as " cuzS8age , " which was paid to the seignior on the occasion of every marriage on his estates , as a substitute for his ancient and formerly acknowledged right to the single possession before marriage of the person of every female , the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such abuses the only possible issues were national death or radical reforms ; and the latter came in the form of revolution . And to what extent the grievances of taxation were the causes of the Revolution is indicated by the circumstance , that one of the very first acts of the National AssemNy of 1789 was to repeal and utterly wipe from the statute 1 ) 00k all inquisitorial taxes of every nature and character , as well as all " prescription of oaths " ; both being stigmatized in the report of the Committee as inconsistent with the maintenance of a free people . And so deep and lasting , moreover , has been the terrible lesson of past tax-experience to the French people , that from 1789 to the present time , - all through the financial embarrassments consequent on the wars of the first Napoleon , and more recently , on those resulting from the German invasion , - there has not been so much as a popular thought or suggestion of adopting any system for raising internal or local revenues , which in any degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system involving personal inquisition for its execution . What local taxation was in England in the time of Edward II . has been already indicated . But how thoroughly the governing classes , at least in England , had in the time of William and Mary , come to understand the nature and demoralizing influences of inquisitorial taxation , and how prompt they were to abate popular grievances , which in France were allowed to accumulate , is shown by the act passed by the house of Commons in 1698 for the abolition of what was known as the " hearth money " ( a tax of two shillings upon every hearth , first imposed in the reign of Charles II. ) , an extract from the preamble of which reads as follows : " Whereas , his Majesty // having been informed , that the revenue of hearth money was grievous to the people ; and whereas the Commons do find that the said revenue can not be regulated , but that it will occasion many difficulties and questions ; and that it is , in itself ' , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a badge of slavery upon the whole people ; exposing every man 's house to be entered into and searched at pleasure by persons unknown to him ; therefore , " etc. , etc . And as a further illustration of how early English freemen came to perceive the just limitations of the taxing power , and to abhor the exercise of inquisitorial and arbitrary proceedings , it may be mentioned that one of the earliest laws of the Massachusetts Colony was that " no man shall be rated for any estate or revenue he hath in England , or in any foreign parts , till it be transported thither , " thereby plainly recognizing the principle laid down by the United States Supreme Court nearly two hundred and fifty years afterwards , that " property lying beyond the jurisdiction of the State is not a subject upon which her taxing power can be legitimately exercised " ; and also , that in the first provincial codes of Pennsylvania , framed by Penn and his associates , special care was taken to confine taxation to land and a very few articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt from taxation merchandise and ships , and all representatives of property , as debts , bills and accounts , easy of concealment . During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , down to 1842 , reforms in taxation in Great Britain were very gradual , and in not a few instances the result of court decisions rather than of action by Parliament ; the tax on windows , imposed in 1695 , and which was advocated at the time on the ground that the assessor might determine the amount of the tax without passing the threshold of any house , remaining in force until 1851 . Since 1842 , however , reform in every department of British taxation has been rapid and intelligent ; and although the British system as it exists to-day is the subject of much domestic complaint - as all systems that can possibly be devised ever will be - it is nevertheless probably unequalled for simplicity , for efficiency in administration - all machinery of oaths , affidavits , listings and inquisitions ( as in France ) being wholly discarded , income // tax excepted ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrumentality for collecting enormous annual revenues from comparatively few objects ; and all this with an entire exemption of a very large portion of the population from any direct contact with the tax assessors and cob lectors. * What has already been effected , and what further may be expected in the sphere of tax reform in this country through the agency of the Federal Courts , i. e. in defining and limiting the powers of the States , and in making operative the 1st section of Article 4 , and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the ITnited States against the exercise of arbitrary power , has been already briefly pointed out . But beyond the action of ' the courts , which are naturally slow , conservative and unwilling even to appear to invade the province of legislation , no radical improvement in our existing local tax systems as the result of legislative action can be expected until the general public , and more especially that part of it which makes and administers the laws , in some way obtain more definite and intelligent ideas than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxation , and especially concerning the manner in which taxation once imposed , diffuses itself and becomes a real and ultimate burden on objects far other than those which primarily sustain it . And one of the first and most important things which it is desirable that the public in this educating process should be brought to clearly comprehend ( and which , absurd as the averment may seem ) , they certainly do not now comprehend , is , that nothing can not be something ; or , in other words , that property is a physical actuality , which has become valuable , * " The study of the subject leads us to the conclusion , that the taxation of the United Kingdom is the most scientific , the most economical in collection , and the least onerous to the people of any in Europe . The Englishman pays no poll tax , no land tax , no salt tax , no taxes on any of the necessaries of life , except it be on beer , on tea , and sugar . " Sugar is now exempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lower than those of France . Our customs are levied on five or six articles , our income tax chiefly affects those who possess realized property , our excise is a tax justly levied on the vices or indulgences of the people . We question , therefore , whether any country ever suffered less than England now does from the burden of taxation . " - Edinburgh Review , April , 1870 , p. 201. // or property , through the application of some form of labor ; and therefore , that a title to property , or a representative of property can no more be property than a shadow can be a substance . And if this be true , then it would seem to follow of necessity that " the act of making debts , bonds , contracts , verbal or written , notes , book-accounts , mortgages , warehousereceipts , titles , certificates of stock , or any form of saleable and transferable rights , is not a creation or production of any new property , but simply an exchange by contract or operation of law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that any tax on any of these rights or titles is only another form of burdening the property which is the subject of the rights or titles . " - Isaac Sherman . To which it may be furtlier added , that if the tax is levied on any of these representatives or titles in any other State than the one where the property is located , it would clearly seem to be an extra-territorial tax , and therefore , by the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court , unconstitutional ; and if levied on rights or titles within the same jurisdiction as the property itself , which is there also taxed , it is simply double taxation on one and the same thing , or an odious discrimination against property which may happen to be covered by such titles . On the other hand let us consider for a moment the converse of this proposition , namely , that title8 are property , and a8 such ought not to be exempted from taxation . If this is so , then it would seem to follow that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man mortgages his farm for ten thousand dollars , the community have ten thousand dollars ' worth of real estate , and ten thousand dollars ' worth of personal property , when before the execution of the mortgage there was only the specified value of the real estate . Again , if the title is the property , then either the actuality is not property where it exists , or else we have two things occupying the same place at the same time . And here another illustration may be given of to fact already referred to ; that without specific legislation , important reforms in the principles and methods of local taxation are being effected through the agency of the courts ; for while this article was in the course of preparation , the very subject // under discussion ( are titles and credits property , and as such proper subjects for taxation ? ) came up before the Supreme Court of the State of California for decision , and was decided almost unanimously - only one out of five dissenting - in accordance with the views above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitutions of most of the other States , provides " that taxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the State , " and " that all property in this State shall be taxed in ptoportion to its value , to be ascertained by law . " The Hibernia Savings and Loan Society of San Francisco resisted , under these constitutional provisions , the taxation of mortgages given to secure the loan of property , on the ground that to tax a certain property , and then to tax a mortgage on it , which mortgage is not in itself property , but like a deed or lease , is a species of conveyance or acknowledgment of a conditional interest or right in the property , was not equal and uniform taxation , but an unequal and double tax on the property mortgaged . The Court met the case fairly and squarely , the language of the Chief Justice ( Wallace ) being reported as follows : " Mere credits are a false quantity in ascertaining the sum of wealth which is subject to taxation as property , and in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addition of those credits , property taxation based thereon is not only merely fanciful , but necessarily the unconstitutional imposition of an additional tax upon a portion of the property already once taxed . " That the practical effect of the taxation of loans and credits is to impose a double tax on the debtor has never been disputed by any who have taken pains to investigate the subject , but as the point is one that even tax-officials and law-makers generally do not admit , if indeed they comprehend it , the following further language of the Chief Justice is worthy of attention . He says : " The taxation thus imposed nominally upon credits having resulted in the double taxation of the money , the additional tax must of course be paid by some one . And here all human experience , as well as the settled theories of finance concur that it is not the lender who pays , but the borrower . The borrower is the consumer . The interest which he pays to the lender is the prime cost of the delay for which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional // taxes , increase the cost , the borrower , being the consumer , must pay for it . " There is another portion of this California decision that should not be overlooked . The California code , in defining personal property as a subject for taxation , in common with the tax codes of most of the other States , specified " money , goods , chattels , evidences of debt , and things in action " as personal property , which definition would , at first sight , certainly seem to include mortgages as proper subjects for State taxation . But the Court , through Justice McKinstry , who delivered its opinion ( the Chief Justice 's opinion being in concurrence ) , referred to this clause of the code as " an attempt* ' merely to include choses in action in the definition of property , and declared that to make it the duty of assessors " to assess all things in action is to give a construction to the Constitution which must lead to the grossest absurdities . " He then enumerates at length many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and concludes by affirming it to be a princi * " Snpposing that the necessities of government required a tax of one hundred per cent on all values , or , what would be the result of such a tax , an appropriation of all the property in the State , - it is plain that the State would receive no benefit from evidences of debt due by some of her citizens to others , and payable out of the tangible property which the State had already taken . " " The legislature may declare that a cause of action shall he taxed , but a cause in action can not pay the tax ; and this because it has , tind can have , no value independent of the tangible wealth , out of which it may be satisfied . " " It may not be possible in every case to show that the debtor has paid the tax assessed to his creditor . But it admits of mathematical demonstration , - if other property in the State has been assessed at its value , - that the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied ) has paid the tax . If it were prac. ticable to assess all the property in the State at the same moment of time , it would be clear to every mind that an assessment of a credit was an attempt to transfer to it a value elsewhere assessed . If a debtor was found to be the owner of one thousand dollars , and is assessed for that sum , and his creditor is found to be the owner of his note for one thousand dollars , and is assessed for a like sum ; and if the day after the visit of the assessor to the creditor the debtor shall pay his note , it is clear that this same value has been , twice taxed ; since the debtor has parted with his money , and received only that which is certainly not taxable property in his hands , and which can never afterwards be assessed . When a debtor pays his debt , he does not abstract or destroy any portion of the taxable property of the State ; the aggregate of values remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose , " were such a thing possible , that the entire tax-rolls exhibited nothing hut indebtedness . Taxation under such circumstances would of course be wholly fanciful , as having no actual basis for its exercise . " - Opinion of Ghief Justice Wallace . // pie in taxation , that " it *s property in poSsession , or enjoyment , and not merely in right , which must ultimately pay every tax . " California , therefore , in this decision leads off in a matter of tax reform , which every other State sooner or later must adopt , if it would give to its citizens the maximum advantage to be derived from the obtaining and employment of credits . Another point preliminary to reform , in respect to which it is important that there should be a clear understanding on the part of the public is , that there is a broad and philosophical distinction between " taxation " and " arbitrary taking . " It is often assumed that a State , because of its sovereignty may , through form of law and delegated authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may see fit ; and repugnant as is this assumption to the principles which are assumed to constitute the foundation of all free government , it is not to be denied that previous to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , it would be difficult to show what restraint existed upon the complete sovereignty of the States of the Federal Union over persons and property within their unquestioned jurisdiction ; the right to hold a certain class of their population in slavery , and the right to take private property for public purposes without making any compensation ( Baron v. Mayor of Baltimore , 7 Peters , p. 243 : 1833 ) , being illustrations of the exercise of such arbitrary powers in the utmost extreme . But the most recent expression of opinion of the U. S. Supreme Court on this point , as given in the case of Loan Association : v. Topeka ( 20 Wallace , 658 ) , is as follows : " There is no such thing in the theory of our government , State or National , as unlimited power in any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial departments , are all of limited and defined powers . There are limitations of power which arise out of the essential nature of all free governments , implied reservations of individual rights , without which the social compact could not exist , and which are respected by all free governments entitled to the name . Among these is the limitation of the right of taxation . " An inquiry now as to the nature and extent of this limitation in the case of free governments ( for the court further added in the above case , that " a government which held the // lives , liberty , and property of its citizens subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power is but a despotism " ) may be answered ( at least in part ) by saying , that from the time of Montesquien down to the time of the Report of the Massachusetts Tax Commissioners in 1875 , no writer of repute ( jurist or economist ) has ever taken any other ground , than that taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection , or in other words , that taxatiou is the correlative ct protection ; and that the act of a State , in levying upon that which its processes can not reach - persons or property - and which , therefore it can not protect , is not entitled to the name of " taxation , " but is simply arbitrary taking or spoliation . Taxatiou , to quote from only one recent law writer , " is in any view taking private property for public use ; and it can not be so taken without an equivalent , both as to the government or the citizens . It is not competent to convert private property to public use , by way of taxation , and without compensation , any more than by any other mode . " - Redfield . That the principle as thus stated is the supreme law of the laud , so far as the U. S. Supreme Court can make it so , must be further apparent from the following extracts from its decisions , which in substance have been again and again repeated - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and the expenses of the protection may very properly be apportioned among the persons protected , according to the value of their property protected . " - Chief Justice Waite7 Thppan v. Merchants ' Bank , 18 Walace . " Where there is no protection , there can be no claim to allegiance or obedience . " - . Justice Story , United States v. Rice , 4 Wheaton , 246 . " It is an eternal princil ) le of justice , that jurisdiction can not be justly exercised by a state over property not within the reach of its process ; that is , property which it can not protect . " - Miles v. Duryee , 7 Cranch , 481 . And if these citations in the way of authority are not sufficient to establish the principle in question , we have the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution , which prohibits any State from depriving any person of property " without due process of law " ; and taxation without jurisdiction , and therefore without the possibility of the correlative // April , return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , an arbitrary exaction on property , and not " due process of law " ; and also not giving that full faith to the public acts and judicial proceedings of other States required by a previous clause of the Constitution . It must , however , be stated , that by many this reasoning is not regarded as conclusive ; and more especially is this the case in Massachusetts , which taxes her citizens in respect to visible , tangible property , acknowledged to be within the territory and jurisdiction of other States . In the recent report made by the commission appointed by the legislature of Massachusetts to inquire into the expediency of revising the tax-laws of that State , the corn missioners at the outset evidently felt impressed with a feeling that they must vindicate the practice of their State in this particular , and that unless they succeeded in doing so , the whole theory of arbitrary , infinitesimal taxation , of whose continuance they are advocates , might be seriously broken in upon . They accordingly set about it in the following amusing manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the nature of a self-evident truth , that " all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights " ; and " that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " the commissioners gravely announce that " the individual person " ( in Massachusetts ) " has no inaliena6le rights except that to his own righteousness . " * They next * That Massachusetts assessors in practice really act on the theory of Massachusetts State Tax Commissioners , that a man in Massachusetts has no inalienable rights except " to his own righteousness , " has found a striking illustration in a communication recently made to the Boston public by one of its leading capitalists . In this the writer makes known the following extraordinary facts . In 1872 -3 , the writer ( Nathan Mathews ) purchased a large amount of mortgages of an incorporated company , known as the " Water Power Company , " supposed at the time to be a good investment . In 1873 the company failed , and put off their creditors with mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , in order to make this arrangement work , for Mr. Mathews , who was a heavy indorser of these notes , to give new notes and the bonds as a collateral for them . No interest is now paid on the mortgage bonds , and the property is taxed tkree times . First , the lands are taxed for more than they will sell for ; second , the creditors are taxed on the mortgage of the property ; and Mr. Mathews , who only passed over the bonds to these creditors as collateral , is taxed as the owner of them . In view of such a state of things , it may not be impertinent to suggest , that stimulus to any other kind of righteousness than that of self-righteousness is not as great in Massachusetts as would seem to be desirable . // scout the existence of any theory - expressed or implied - of contract between the State and the citizen , " whereby the subject is bound to render some service to the State , as a recompense for the service which the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , which may be supposed to have been also before them , recognizes this contract in the following explicit language : The legislature shall have power " to impose and levy proportional and reasonable taxes upon all the inhabitants of , and estates lyinq within the Commonwealth , for the support of the government of said Commonwealth , and the protection and preservation of the subjects thereof . " The ground having been thus cleared of obstructions , the commissioners next advance to what in their opinion is the true theory of taxation , namely , that " a man is taxed not to pay the State for its expense in protecting him , and not in any respect as a recompense to the State for any service in his behalf , but because his original relations to society require it . " It is somewhat difficult to consider such reasoning from any other standpoint than the ridiculous ; but as the original relations of man to society are unquestionably the relations which come into existence when society is incipient or in process of formation , - when the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets what he can and keeps what he gets , - it may be remarked that the Massachusetts commissioners have at least been logical and consistent in making the reference they have made for the origin of such an arbitrary system as they advocate . Laying aside , however , all subtleties of reasoning , all appeals to court decisions , and all reference to the " original relations** of society , the plain , simple questions which it is desirable under this head to bring before the public are : " Is it consistent with the principles of equity ? Is it conducive to public morality ? Is it worthy of a high civilization for a State or a community to tax directly or indirectly property not within their territory or jurisdiction , and which their laws are unable to reach or protect ? " And when the public have been induced to give them intelligent consideration , there can be no question that a further long stride in tax reform will be made most speedily . Finally , as a further precedent to radical reforms in local // taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension of the principle , that in order to burden equitably and uniformly all persons and property , it is not necessary to tax primarily all persons and property within the taxing district . The experience of Philadelphia , Montreal , England , and France , where personal property is excluded from taxation , and the burden of the expenses of the State is made to fall primarily and almost exclusively upon realty , is aui absolute demonstration , " that any complicated and inquisitorial system of separate taxation of goods and chattels is wholly unnecessary , an obstruction to trade , an injury to production , an unnecessary invasion of the privacy of human affairs , and a self-torment inflicted on land itself . " The Massachusetts Coinmissioners , however , in their recent i'eport , before referred to , contend that the doctrine that taxes tend " to equate and dif* fuse themselves , " " is condemned by facts and justified by no sound economical theory " ; and that on the contrary " the tendency of taxes is , that they must be paid by the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time quoting from British writers to prove that the incidence of British taxation falls with crushing severity upon the poor , and prophesying that the same result will follow the adoption in this country of the simple system recommended by the New Yoik Commissioners . But the reasoning of the Massachusetts Commissioners confutes itself . For if taxes do not diffuse themselves , and " stay where they are laid , " how can the poor be crushed , and made to bear " disproportionate burdens " under a system like that of Great Britain , which taxes directly no actual necessary of life , nor indeed any article of consumption with the exception of tea , coffee , spirits , beer , and tobacco , which exempts all incomes under ? 100 ( $ 500 ) ; and finally all houses renting for less than ? 20 ( $100 ) per annum , an estimated exemption ( from imperial taxation ) of six-sevenths of all the dwellings in the kingdom ? * What , furthermore , do such reasonings and assumptions as those of the Massachusetts Commissioners on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the most significant fact , that in // Philadelphia , containing over fifty thousand small houses built under the auspices of loan and building fund associations , and mainly owned by their occupants ; where the infinitesimal system of taxation is not recognized , where real-estate is almost the only thug subject to primary assessment , and where the current rate of taxation for the present year ( 1876 ) is in excess of two per cent ( 2.15 ) on a basis approximating market value , there is little or no complaint against the method of taxation , but only against the amount ; while the contentment and general prosperity of the poorer and middle classes are admitted to be greaier than in any other city of the country ? * Another illustration to the same effect and equally striking is found ii the fact , that during the past year , the city of Montreal revised its system of taxation , and as preliminary to doing so , submitted to popular judgment through an official circular , prepared in the Auditor 's Office , five different statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be raised by various forms of taxation ; but in all of these the only items of personal property , which it was even sue ested should be made subject to direct assessment , were the items of pleasure horses and carriages4 The frat ures of the proposed revision were in the direction of furthec simplification , - making the system to consist mainly of a taxation of one and a quarter per cent on all real property ; an annual tax ( to be called a business tax ) on all tiales , manufactories , occupations , professions , etc. , not exceeJ n*- seven and a half per cent on the annual value * In 1 84 the real estate of Philadelphia was assessed at $539,003,602 , claimed to be ful vdua ; ion .

In considering this question of the diffusion of taxation it is essential to correct reasoning that the distinction between taxation and spoliation be kept clearly in view . That only is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of taxation ; which does not of itself exempt any part of the property of the same class which is selected to bear the primary burden of taxation , or by its imperfections to any extent permit such exemptions . Such taxes if not so excessive as to become a prohibition on the use of the thing taxed , become a part of the cost of all production , distribution , and consumption , and diffuse and equate themselves by natural laws in the same manner and in the same minute degree as rents , wages , cost of material , waste , and all other elements that constitute the expenses of production . " We produce to consume , and consume to produce , and the cost of consumption , including taxes , enters into the cost of production , and the cost of production , including taxes , enters into the cost of consumption , and thus taxes uniformly levied on all things of the same class , by the laws of competition , supply , and demand , and the all-pervading mediums of labor , will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they finally fall upon every person , not in proportion to his consumption of a given article , but in proportion to his aggregate consumption . Mr. Astor bears no greater burden of taxation ( and can not be made to bear more by any laws which can properly be termed tax-laws ) than the proportion which his aggregate individual consumption bears to the aggregate consumption of all others in his circuit of immediate competition . As to Mr. Astor 's other taxes he is a mere tax-collector , or conduit , conducting taxes from his tenants or borrowers to the State or city treasury . A whiskey distiller is a tax-conduit or tax-collector , and sells more taxes than the original cost of whiskey ; // a dealer in imported goods , like Mr. Stewart , keeps a stock of accumulated imports , foreign and domestic , for sale ; the farmer charges taxes in the price of his product ; the landlord iii his rents ; the laborer in his wages ; the clergyman in his salary ; the lender in the rate of interest he receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goods . " * The general principle governing the diffusion of taxes is also thus happily set forth by a recent anonymous writer iii the New York Tribune , and is here quoted for the reason that it is of the utmost importance to the future enactment of proper tax laws , that the popular fallacy adhered to and reenunciated by the Massachusetts commissioners , that " the tendency of taxes is that they must be paid by the actual persons on whom they are levied , " should be thoroughly exploded , as it can be , by illustrations and arguments which are the farthest removed from abstract reasoning : - " Taxation is a question of interest to all , for in a civilized community every man , woman , and child is taxed . The owner of real estate pays his tax and increases his rent to a proportionate extent . The tenant must counterbalance this increase in some way , and so he increases his profits on goods sold .

The man who evades a tax robs his neighbors . The thief pays taxes indirectly , for he is a consumer and must pay the advanced price caused by his own roguery for all he consumes , although he does steal the money to pay with . Idlers , and even tramps , pay taxes , but the amount that they indirectly pay into the fund is much less than that which they take out of it .

" Exclusive Taxation of Real Estate . Remarks of Isaac Sherman before the Committee of Ways and Means , New York Assembly , 1875. // On the other hand any law or system , which by its provisions exempts , or by its imperfections allows to go unburdened , any part of the property of the same class , which is made the sul ) ject of taxation , is spoliation on that part which is discriminatingly burdened ; and it is not contended for one moment that such discriminating burdens uniformly diffuse and equate themselves , any more than the loss by robbery of one man in a crowd , or by the destruction by fire of one house in a town , is equally diffused over the whole crowd or community , any further than a diminution or waste of the aggregate abundance of any community makes that community as a whole poorer . Thus , if of two persons , one is taxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same class of property , it will be obviously impossible for the former to add his taxes to whatever of such property , or tl ) e results of its employment , lie may desire to sell , if lie is to meet the latter in direct competition in open market , where all persons seek the lowest prices , offering to sell the same things which have not been burdened by taxation . In such cases " the surcharged tax-payer , according to the amount of the favored competition , becomes the victim , not of taxatioii , but of an arbitrary exaction , and can not diffuse it , but must pay it , or retire from the unequal competition . " And it is just here that the immorality of the infinitesimal system of local taxation - of which the Massachusetts system is a type - especially manifests itself , it starts out with a theory ( of the necessity of taxing everybody and everything ) which at the best can only be carried out most imperfectly ; and so creates inequality , or a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage ; next ( and can there be a greater absurdity ? ) it calls upon the individual to enumerate and value his own property , for the purpose of taxing him ; or as it has been pithily expressed , " It calls for a lie , and gets it . " Here is a premium offered , and generally accepted , for further inequality . And finally , it obliges men who naturally incline and desire to be honest , to become dishonest , in order to protect themselves against unfair competition , and avoid being crushed . The result of all this does not especially show itself in any popular outcry against inequality , for fraud balances fraud to such // an extent that the advantage of fraud is in a great degree netitralized ; but it does manifest itself in something which everybody is coming to recognize , and against which religious and moral teachings seem to avail little ; namely , a general impairment of the standard of private and of public morality . " Give me good finances , " says a recent continental writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you good politics . " * He might have added with equal truth and propriety , Show me an individual or a State , whose finances are bad , either as respects administration or resources , and I will show you one whose morality rests upon a very insecure foundation . We ought , therefore , to find at no distant day , the special guardians and teachers of morality who earnestly desire to be true to their trust , enlisted also as the special advocates of local tax reform ; and a little investigation and study of the philosophy of the diffusion of taxes will furnish them in common with the public , with the basis for constructing a system of taxation which will fortify the State alike in respect to its morality and its revenues . Any account of the present state of public opinion and of progress in respect to local tax reform would , however , be imperfect , which omitted to call attention to a pamphlet on this subject recently published at Memphis , Tennessee , which is remarkable alike for its strength of argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonism to the theory and reasonings of the Ma*sachusetts commissioners ; and , finally , for the quarter from which it emanates . Its author , Enoch Ensley , is a citizen of Tennessee ; an exconfederate ; an extensive and ( since the war ) successful planter , - one of the first to organize and profitably use free labor at the South , - and who , earnestly desiring the rapid material development of his section of the country , has felt especially solicitous that this development should not be retarded by the adoption and enforcement at the South of an unsound system of State and municipal taxation . In furtherance of this desire he has accordingly published , in the form of a letter addressed to the . Governor of Tennessee , a little pamphlet of twenty-seven pages , in which he asks the people of * Comte de Miilinen. // that State to consider with him , from the standpoint of their common material interest , " What should be Taxed , and how it should be Taxed ? " If the people of Tennessee would read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , difficult to obtain elsewhere , in a small compass , and possibly prove to their State the inception of a period of great prosperity . Mr. Ensley commences by proposing this rule , or motto , as the basis for a Tennessee system of taxation : " Never tax any thing that would be of value to your State , that could and would run away , or that could and would come to you . " Mr. Ensley then lays down the proposition , that property naturally divides itself in two classes , - movable and immovable , - and that the former has no value until movable property is directly created or employed upon it , or until the former has a value reflected upon it from the employment of movable property in proximity ; citing in proof and illustration the fact that the best acre of land in America has no value until some one goes on to it with movable capital , instruments , animals , &amp;c. , to cultivate or use it , and that from that time its value increases steadily in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly employed or connected with it , until it may finally attain the value of the lots covered by the leading stores and banking institutions of our large cities . In all this , however , there is nothing of novelty ; but in the homely , clear illustrations which Mr. Ensley employs for impressing his fellow-citizens with the truth of his fundamental propositions , novelty is not wanting . Thus , for example : - " I hold that , of all men , the real estate or fixed property man is most interested in the rule or motto I have adopted . To illustrate , I will say , there is an acre of ground in Memphis - say in front of the Overton Block that is worth $200,000 ; while the writer has an acre six miles below the city , quite as good naturally , and even better ( because it will produce more corn , cotton , pumpkins , peas , potatoes , cabbages , etc. , than the Overton lot will , or ever would ) , and my acre is not worth one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax Question . Important Letter to Governor Brown . What should he Taxed , and how it should he Taxed ? Suggestions for the People of Tennessee to consider . " By Enoch Ensley , of Memphis . Nashville , Teun. , 1873. // why is it that the Overton acre is worth $ 200,000 per acre , and mine not worth $ 100 . The reason is , that there is employed on the Overton acre profitably several hundred thousand dollars of movable property , whilst upon mine there is employed the sixteenth part of a negro , the sixteenth part of a mule , plough , hoe , etc . Now , if you will manage in any way , either by taxation or otherwise , to drive from this Overton acre the two , three , or four hundred thousand dollars , and render it so that this capital can not be employed upon it with a profit , it will not be worth more than my acre , - in fact , not so much , for there is nothing so valueless as ground covered with houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And further , if you do anything to make the two , three , or five hundred thousand dollars pay less profit , you will damage the ground , or lessen its value , more rapidly than you will decrease the profits , - not in the same ratio , but more rapidly . Suppose , for instance , the profit has been ten per cent net on the capital employed , and the property is paying a rental on $ 300,000 ; if you reduce the profits permanently , in any way to five per cent net , the property would not pay a rental on $ 150,000 ; in fact , it would hardly pay any rent at all , for five per cent would be too small to induce a business at all in this country . " " Movable property always seeks and locates on immovable property , where it thrives and multiplies most rapidly . A spot of ground , a city , a state , or a nation that offers the greatest thrift will be sought and located upon by the greatest quantity of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrift will the land have . Any tax levied upon it lessens its thrift , and consequently is in violation of the correct principle . " " Here I wish to state a truism which , perhaps , many owners of real estate in Tennessee may never have thought of , to wit The renter or lessee of real estate must always prosper before the owner of the real estate can expect to prosper . This is certainly true as a rule , when taken for a series of years , in a country like ours , where the land is abundant and the people free to go where they please . I do n't mean he must have greater prosperity , but that he must prosper first . " " In the city of Nashville ( 1873 ) the rate of taxation for all purposes is about three per cent , and in Memphis it is about four and a half per cent . All property in these cities is sought to be taxed at these respective rates , and trade and merchandise is sought to be taxed even higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make the tax on merchandise about three and one half per cent in Nashville , and about five per cent in Memphis . The tax in Nashville is // April , three per cent on money , and by the laws of the State , not exceeding ten per cent interest can be charged ; three per cent from ten leaves seven . United States bonds pay six per cent annually in gold , which is fully equal to seven per cent currency , and taken into consideration that they can be realized on at any time , they are far more desirable than money loaned at seven per cent currency . The result is that there are millions of dollars in the city of Nashville invested in bonds which pay no tax whatever , which ( money ) , if there was no tax sought to he put upon it would be turned loose , and enter the industry , trade , and development of the resources of the State . " " A further result of the tax at three per cent is , that it offers inducement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rely upon deposits for capital ; in other words , to undertake to do banking business without capital . The result is , that in Nashville now there is only about one million dollars banking capital , when before the war there was nearly or quite five millions . If you will give her five millions of banking capital now ( and she would surely get it but for the tax on money ) , and not impose the high and oppressive taxes on her trade , it is an absolute certainty that her population , trade , manufactures , and general industry would increase one hundred per cent in the next ten years , and perhaps in the next five or seven years . If you double her population , trade , etc. , which must be accompanied by general thrift and go-ahead , you will quadruple the value of real estate or immovable property , thereby add largely to the wealth of the State , and enable the State , less oppressively to the citizens throughout the State , to pay her interest and debt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sought to be collected in Memphis to-day , on the money , trade , etc. of New York , and charge no tax in Boston , Philadelphia , or Baltimore , I will guarantee to transfer , in a short time , hundreds of millions of the trade , money , etc. of New York to those cities , and if ( New York ) will continue it five or ten years , I will guarantee to show you , in either of these cities , more trade , more money , and more people than in New York . I will guarantee to depopulate her more effectually and more l ) ermanently than a plague ever did a city , and impoverish her more effectually than war ever did . Yes , I will hurt her infinitely worse than a fire , and I will make it entirely safe for women and children to cross Broadway at City Park without the protection of policemen . And who would be the injured party in New York by the enforcement of such a law ? Would it be the merchants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great real estate owners ? or would it be the great real-estate owners ? In other words , would it be the movable // property-man , - with his goods , money , etc. - who can take it and go elsewhere , or would it be the immovable property or real-estate man who has to stay where he is , and pay his city and county debt , without tenants or rentals from his property I Hence I say , that of all the men who should object to oppressive , and to follow the principle , I will add , any taxation at all on money , merchandise , or trade , ruanufactories , etc. , it is the man who owns the real estate or immovable property . His position should be this : He should say to the thousands of men with money in their pockets , looking out a favorable locality to go to banking , merchandising , manufacturing , or farming , Come , locate on me ; I will not oppress you . Come to me , for I ca n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am worth nothing ; and , knowing this , I will not tax and oppress you . Other localities make you pay a tax ; I will not , and consequently I offer that advantage over other localities . Heretofore , it has been the merchant who has done the complaining about the tax levied on him . He is not the one to do it . It is the real estate man , and the writer being one of these men , owning real estate almost entirely , and not owning a dollar 's worth of merchandise of any kind for sale , and not being a lender of money , but on the contrary a borrower , and not being the owner of machinery , except a steam saw-mill and a steam cotton-gin , but being a plain farmer or planter by profession , thinking he sees his interest in the system he is advocating , consequently therein is to be found the moving cause of this letter . " " I contend that this system will lighten the burdens of taxation on real estate , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A short time ago , a prominent real-estate owner of Memphis said to me : Do you say , that a merchant or banker shall make from ten to sixteen per cent on their capital , and pay no tax , and I make only six or eight per cent on the houses they are occupying , and pay all the tax I Yes , said I ; you seek to tax them , and that is the reason you get no larger per cent on your property . Says I , if they make one hundred per cent per annum on their capital , you should not want them to pay a copper of tax . Why I because if they made it , you would have forty applicants for the house they are doing business in , and if you should , you would certainly get a full rent for it , more than the extra tax , as only one of the forty could get it , and the other thirty-nine would be unaccommodated ; and if your tenants should be making this large per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something near it all over town . But as only the present tenants , or their number , could be acconimodated with houses , the result would be that you would not only // get exorbitant rents for all the houses in town , but you would have demand for the hundreds of thousands of vacant lots throughout the city to build store-houses on ; they would buy them , or offer you such enormous rents as would induce you to build them houses on ulots that you have been paying taxes on for years , and received no rental from . Soon there would be houses going up all over the city , block after block . The brick-maker , the lumberman , the carpenter , bricklayer , and all descriptions of mechanics and laborers would have more than they could do , so that the builders would have to send elsewhere for mechanics . All these new-corners in turn would want residences , and thus you would bring into demand and make pay rental thousands of lots that have never paid anything , give active employment to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . " " Let us go a little further , and see how it ( this policy ) affects all and everybody in the city . These new-corners get their houses , and then they want furniture , and they patronize the furniture-man ; they want a carriage or wagon for family use , and they patronize your carriage-man ; and then horses , and patronize the horse-man ; and then the blacksmith , to shoe them ; and then the retail dry-goods houses , mautna-makers , milliners , grocery-men , butchers , and in short every kind of retail establishment throughout the city , thereby giving vigor , life , and thrift to all ; and thus it would go on , until before you are aware of it , you would have a city of thousands of people , and be worth and pay a rental on hundreds of millions of dollars . Then where would be your city and county debt , and a necessity for a high rate of taxation ? and where would be the oppression , when you have got four times as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature came to fix the rate of taxation for the State , it would discover that a spot of ground down here in West Tennessee , called Memphis , which heretofore has been worth and paid a tax on only $ 25,000,000 , is now worth , and can pay a tax on $ 100,000,000 , just as easily as it did some years ago pay on $ 25,000,000 . Consequently , the tax to pay current . expenses , interest on the State debt , etc. , need not throughout the State be put so high . " " Of course , no general trade would pay one hundred per cent per annum , but I have adopted it ( this rate ) to illustrate the principle , which is the same . " All this , as before intimated , is sound , clear , homely talk ; hut it is safe to predicate that it will make no material impression on the public opinion of the section to which it is specially // addressed , or much anywhere . Nations and communities , as well as individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly school of experience . To round out and complete . Mr. Ensley 's picture of American taxation as it might be , and its results , he should have further added and illustrated , that by the adoption of a system of taxation based mainly on realty and rentals , the latter to be assessed directly against the occupier , a much larger number of citizens than now can probably be induced to take an active interest in municipal politics , and watch all proceedings involving municipal expenditures ; for under such a system nearly every citizen would pay a direct tax , proportioned to the scale of his residence . Under the existing popular systems of taxation on the contrary , the taxes on realty are assessed against and collected of the real estate owners , who in turn collect it of their tenants , not in the form of taxes , but of rents . The tenant , however , rarely if ever discriminates in such matters , and so becomes generally indifferent to municipal politics , and not unfrequently through a feeling that increased taxation can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English cities , and in London more especially , where taxation falls mainly on rentals and occupiers , this watchfulness of the individual citizen and rate-payer over the proceedings of their municipal authorities in all matters of expenditure has been particularly observed and its beneficial influence recorded . Finally , while we are discussing what we shall tax , and how we shall tax , and speculating on what future courts and legislatures are likely to do in settling these questions , it should not be overlooked that there is another element all the time working for reform , which puts courts and legislatures in a great degree at defiance ; and that is , the quiet , unorganized , never-ceasing , but in the end all-powerful and all-subduing spirit of popular resistance which , especially in all free and highly intelligent communities , always puts itself in opposition to the effectual carrying out of bad laws . The smuggler has been called " the knight-errant of civilization , " because in disregard of law , and sustained in a high degree by popul*r opinion , he compels the letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to isolate nation from nation , and re // strict commerce . When every member of the House of Commons had a silk handkerchief of French manufacture in his pocket , the importation of which was forbidden under heavy penalties , the law establishing such a prohibition , although unrepealed on the statute-book , was dead , and only waited for burial . And so in respect to that feature of the generally accepted American tax system which relates to personal property . The law says , that all such property shall be taxed at its full and true value . Individual , if not public , sentiment says it shall not . How stands the conflict ? In New York city , out of a population of over one million , only 8,920 names , or less than oneper cent of the population had , in 18Th , any " household furniture , money , goods , chattels , debts due from solvent debtors , whether on account of contract , note , bond , or mortgage , public stocks , and stocks in moneyed corporations , " or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizance for taxation ; although at the same time the assessors estimate that of the property defined and described by law to be personal property , there is in New York city an amount approximating $ 2,000,000,000 in value. * In the State of New York , the State assessors for 1873 report that , of the personal property of the State , " less than 15 per cent liable to taxation finds a place on the rolls of the assessors , " t while in Ohio , under laws similar to thQse existing in New York , not one person in ten has any visible property which can be made subject to assessment . In New York and Ohio , the basis of taxation has therefore practically got down to a real estate basis , because the people , acting individually , will not have any other ; and yet , acting collectively , through their representatives in " legislature assembled , " these same people decide that the law , under which these proceedings can be possible , shall not be taken from the statute-book , and decently buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time keep up a system which neutralizes in great part the very work for which the churches and schools are established . And even in Massachusetts , which claims a better record , it would probably befound , if the facts could be ascertained , that under the * Report of the Tax Commissioners of New York City , 1875. t Report of the State Assessors of New York for the year 1873. // most stringent system which popular opinion can be made to tolerate , not fifty per cent of the personal property subject under law to assessment ever comes within the cognizance of the assessors .
