Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : TO JAMES WALKER , D. D. , ON HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY . from To James Walker , D. D. ( 1874 ) O full of years and of the stores Of tranquil wisdom years impart To him who , in their flight , adores The Eternal One with grateful heart ! O full of years , yet fuller still Of what no earthly years can give But He alone , whose mercies fill Pure hearts with love to all that live ! O full of years , with memories blest Of toil for God , and man , and truth , With hopes that calm and cheer the breast , And breathe a new , transfigured youth ! O full of years ! thy " fourscore years " Not " labor " bring , " and sorrow "  --  nay ! Thy peaceful sun , as evening nears , Points onward to still brighter day . Grateful we hail the blessed sight Of this thy tranquil eventide ; And would with thee , in its pure light , Thy guests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a festal day  --  Loved friend and father , we would bring Our debt of gratitude to pay The heart 's memorial offering . Its sculpture-language well may speak What tongue and pen in vain would say ; What the warm heart might vainly seek To breathe out in the tender lay . " The Cup of Blessing which we bless " Kindly accept ; and may it be An emblem of the happiness Life 's brimming cup shall keep for thee ! To us thy heart 's full , golden bowl Rich draughts of heaven 's pure wine hath brought , Nerving anew the jaded soul With quickenings of electric thought . We speak not for ourselves alone , But for a manly race , whose youth , Enkindled by thy thrilling tone , Woke to the majesty of truth ! Who , in that fresh and tender hour When luring passions dance their round , Thus felt Religion 's gracious power , And saw her brow with beauty crowned ! And thousands , too , who never heard Thy voice , have kindled o'er the page On which thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age . The pulpit was thy " joy and throne ; " No less in Harvard 's august chair , Thy manly , genial wisdom shone And breathed its blessed influence there . To-day , O loved and honored one ! What throngs rise up to call thee blest , And pray thy slowly sinking sun Long linger in the glowing West ! C. T. B.
