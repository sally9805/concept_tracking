THE RUNNING TURF IN AMERICA . *econb 3 ) a*et . THE oldest race-course in the West is that located at Lexington , Kentucky . The present association was chartered in 1828 , but raeing was carried on there long anterior to this . The great strip of country in Kentucky , where the rich blue grass grows so luxuriantly , for many years has been known as the " race-horse region of America . " Racing is one of the pastimes of the people ; and the love of racing led to the breeding of the thorough-bred . The colts mature rapidly in the genial climate and on the nutritious grass ; and , for nearly half a century , they have asserted their claims to pre-eminence . Kentucky stock is justly famous , arid breeding there is attended with less expense than in many other sections , for the reason that the colts thrive so well in grazing over the rich pasture lands . The Lexington Association has been singularly prosperous . Since 1828 , up to the present time , it has held two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1862 , when only a spring meeting was held , Kirby Smith 's army being camped on the course in the fall . This is something that can be said of no other association in America , and speaks to us of the intensity of the racing spirit in that section of Kentucky ; for it must be borne in mind that Lexington , like many other cities south of the old Mason and Dixon line , suffered much by the late civil war . Its streets sometimes were patrolled by the Grays , and at other times guarded by the Blues . Still the association maintained its organization ; and racing was kept up , no matter what flag floated from the staff . Many of the most celebrated horses that have graced the American turf made their de*6ut on the Lexington course ; and the brilliant leading men of the State , such as Clay and Crittenden and Marshall , have watched the trials of speed from the grand stand , and mingled with their fellow-citizens on the quarter stretch . For a number of years Kentucky and Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred in one State being selected to run against one owned or bred in the other . But the most memorable races ever witnessed in the commonwealth were those between Wagner and Gray Eagle , decided at Louisville in the antuma of 1839 . Wagner , a son of Sir Charles , was a handsome chestnut , with a blaze in his face , standing fifteen and a half hands . As a four-year-old , in the summer of 1838 , he had defeated many competitors , and won proud distinction . Gray Eagle , perhaps , was one of the finest-looking horses that ever charmed the eye . He was sixteen hands high , a beautiful gray , with flowing silver main and tail . He was sired by Woodpecker , and he by Bertrand . He was a game and fleet horse , and the idol of Kentuckians . On the first of January , 1839 , a stake for all ages , four-mile heats , closed with ten subscribers at $2000 each , half forfeit ; and among the entries were the Louisiana horse Wagner , five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . The race came off Monday , September 30 , four only of the nominations starting . During the spring and summer the chances of Wagner and Gray Eagle in this stake had been widely canvassed , and the feeling between the partisans of each horse was most intense . For months , all over the South , the coming struggle was the topic of earnest discussion . And , on the day of the race , a more brilliant assembly was never seen on any course than was gathered on the course at Louisville . The crowd was immense , and the excitement at fever point . In that nodding sea of human forms were the blue-eyed belles from the North , and the brown-eyed queens of beauty from the South ; were men distinguished at the bar , on the bench , the press , in the senate , and in the army and navy . Senators Clay and Crittenden and Porter were there , and so were Governor Poindexter , General Atkinson , Judges Rowan and Woolley , and Letcher and Menifee , and Slidell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long to be remembered . As an indication of the strength of the rivalry , it is stated that not a Kentuckian on the ground laid out a dollar on Wagner . Gray Eagle was the champion of the State , and they would not bet against him , even after he had lost the first heat . Wagner was better managed than Gray Eagle , and he won , after a terrible contest , the first and second heats , and the race . The finish is thus eloquently described by the late William T. Porter : " From the Oakland House home it was a terrible race . By the most extraordinary exertions , Wagner got up neck and neck with the gallant gray , as they swung round the turn into the quarter stretch . The feelings of the assembled thousands were wrought up to a pitch absolutely painful . Silence the most profound reigned over that vast assembly as these noble animals sped on as if life and death called forth their utmost energies . Both jockeys had their whiphands at work , and at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried to the rowelhead . Gray Eagle , . for the first hundred yards , was clearly gaining ; but , in another instant , Wagner was even with him . Both were out and doing their best . It was any body 's race yet ; * now Wagner , now Gray Eagle , has the advantage . It will be a dead-heat ! See , Gray Eagle 's got him ! ' No-Wagner 's ahead ! ' // A moment ensues  --  the people shout-hearts throb-ladies faint  --  a thrill of emotion , and the race is over ! Wagner wins hy a neck iii 7.44 , the best race ever run south of the Potomac ; while Kentucky 's gallant champion demonstrates his claim to that proudtitle hy a performance which throws into the shade the most brilliant ever made in his native State . " The friends of Gray Eagle were not satisfied with the result . They were anxious to have the race run over ; and , five days after the first battle , the two horses again met in a race of four - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitement great . Gray Eagle , amidst the wildest applause , won the first heat , Wagner the second , and in the third heat the beautiful gray broke down , thus surrendering the victory to the game chestnut . These contests are remembered with pride by Kentucklans . Ask the silver-haired man to-day of the turf , and , with flashing eyes , he will tell you the story of Wagner and Gray Eagle . In 1833 , at the farm of John Wickham , Esq. , near Richmond , Virginia , a colt was foaled who , as the years matured his form , won imperishable fame . He was the son of Timoleon , and the sister to Tuckahoe . His lineage was pure , the richest of blood flowing in his veins . He grew up into a magnificent-looking horse , a beautiful chestnut , with a white strip in his face , and two white stockings behind . He was coinpact in form , made up of bone and substance , and combining speed with immense power . He was called Boston , named after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Boston , as many have supposed . The 20th of April , 1836 , he made his debut on the turf at Broad Rock , Virginia  --  a debut which was mortifying to his friends , as he bolted and lost the race . But he was not long in* wiping out this disgrace . During a long and memorable career on the turf he ran forty-five races , thirty at four miles ; and when he retired to the stud , at ten years of age , he was sound as a young horse , . his legs* absolutely being free from blemish . This is a remarkable fact , for it is upon the legs that severe work most generally tells . Boston 's most famous race was with that wonderful little mare , Fashion , at the Union Course , Long Island , the 10th of May , 1842 . It was a race of four-mile heats , for $20,000 a side . The match was made in the autumn of 1841 , and during the winter and early spring it was canvassed on all sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated Bonnets o ' Blue , was foaled 26th of April , 1837 , being bred at Madison , New Jersey , by William Gibbons , Esq . She was a satin-coated chestnut , with a star , and a ring of white above the coronet of the left hind foot . She was 15j hands high , withers prominent , head and neck light , suggesting lines of grace , faultless legs , and capacious chest . She was built and innscled much like the greyhound , and her speed was marvelous . Her turf career , though brief , had been brilliant , and she was regarded as the nonpareil of her day . She had defeated Boston in 1841 , and the partisans of the stallion were anxious to fight the battle over again . There was a great rush to the Union Course on that bright 10th day of May . It is estimated that there were seventy thousand people on the ground , drawn there by the fame of the two racers . The proudest and most influential in the land occupied positions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more than a quarter of a mile the spectators ranged on the side of the course and of the field , thus forming a gauntlet through which the horses ran . Senator Barrow , of Louisiana , Hon. John M. Botts , of Virginia , and J. Hamilton Wilkes , Esq. , were in the judges ' stand . Fashion represented the North , and Boston the South . It was a great race , a contest full of excitement , a battle courageously , fiercely fought , ending in the defeat of Boston . Fashion won the first heat in 7 minutes 32* seconds , and the second heat in 7 minutes 45 seconds-wonderful time . Though defeated , Boston was not dishonored , since he ran a game race , and carried fifteen pounds more weight than the mare ; and it is weight that tells in a four - mile contest . " Though beaten , " writes the turf historian of that day , " it is conceded on all hands that Boston has acquired a more vast renown by this wonderful race than by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he was before the match . " And every where in the sporting world this aphorism was quoted : " All that can be said is , that Boston has beaten himself , and Fashion has beaten Boston Boston was no less successful in the stud than on the turf . lie made his first season at Spring Grove , hanover County , Virginia , in 1843 ; and in the winter of 1846 he was taken to Kentucky and placed under the care of Colonel E. M. Blackburn , in Woodford County . The horse contracted a severe cold on the trip , from which he never fully recovered . He continued to revel in the delights of the harem until the fall of 1849 , when he grew feeble and died . A struggle , and the spirit was free , the cords of the limbs unstrung . When Boston died the breeding world suffered an irreparable loss . He won great fame himself ; but since the winds have been wailing over his humble grave , his descendants have kept green this fame , lie sired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Lexington and Lecomte . The turfman judges a horse by his blood , his form , his deeds , and his produce ; and judging by such , Boston is pronounced the greatest race-horse that America ever produced . Lexington enjoys world-wide fame . lie was bred by Dr. E. Warfield , near Lexington , Kentucky , and was foaled March 17 , 1850 . He was got by Boston , and his dam was Alice Carneal , by imported Sarpedon . He commenced his turf career at Lexington , under the name of Darley , May 23 , 1853 , being then three years old . He met the most promising // colts of Kentucky , and distinguished himself by winning the race in two straight heats . May 28 he was purchased by Mr. Ten Broeck for $2500 , who changed his name from Darley to Lexington . At New Orleans , April 1 , 1854 , twenty thousand people assembled on the Metairie Course to witness the great struggle for superiority in the Post stake , four-mile heats , for all ages . The subscription to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mississippi becoming the subscribers . Each State had the privilege of naming a horse to contend for her honor in the race . Kentucky named Lexington , Mississippi Lecomte , Alabama Highlander , and Louisiana Arrow . Among the distinguished gentlemen in the judges ' stand was ex-President Fillmore . The course was heavy from previous rains , and the strong wind which prevailed had so hardened the mud as to make it stiff and unyielding . The chief contest was between Lexington and his half-brother Lecomte , the former winning the race in two straight heats . The victory was a brilliant one , especially when we remember that accident alone led to the training of the white-legged son of Boston . He was not regarded as a promising colt , and his dam was unknown to fame . In fact , the purity of her blood was questioned . His success in the great Post-stake race placed his star in the ascendant . The swift-footed Lecomte had been beaten ; but the friends of that horse were not satisfied with the result . They were eager to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two horses came together for the second time . Lexington was out of condition , was badly ridden , and was defeated , Lecomte in this race making the then fastest time at four miles on record in the United States . He finished the.first heat in 7 minutes 26 seconds , and the second in 7 minutes 38* seconds . The rivalry between the half-brothers was now greater than ever . Each had his partisans , and each was claimed the superior of the other . Mr. Ten Broeck , whose subsequent career in Europe attracted so much attention determined to settle the question by a bold adventure . lie issued a plucky challenge , proposing to run Lexington over the Metairie Course , a single four miles , against the fastest time , at that distance , on record , for the sum of $20,000 ; or to run him against any named horse a race of fourmile heats . The publication of this challenge led to a long , and somewhat bitter , newspaper controversy between Colonel Wells and Mr. Ten Broeck ; but the wordy letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lecomte . The proposition , however , to run Lexington against time was accepted by Colonel Calvin Green and Captain John Beicher , of Virginia , their acceptance being published June 17 1854 . The race was run over the Metairie Course , New Orleans , on Monday , April 2 , 1855 . The track had previously been carefully measured and found to be a full mile ; therefore there could be no quibble in regard to distance . The day was the loveliest of the season , the track in superb order , and the concourse of people immense . Lexington was ridden by the able jockey , Gilbert W. Patrick , whose name has been abridged to Gilpatrick . The excitement attending the progress of the race was very great . Briefly yet clearly is the running described : " Gilpatrick , upon Lexingtion , now prepared for action ; and as he started up the stretch , on his proud courser , to do that which no other horse had ever attempted , the man and horse formed a beautiful and perfect picture . He turned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges ' stand , where the drum tapped , he was at a pace it was intended he should run . To our mind he was run too fast the first mile , which was accomplished in 1.47k ; the first half in 0.53 . Upon reaching the stand it was intimated to him to go slower , which he did . Joe Blackburn was started behind him at the beginning of the first mile , but the respectful distance he kept in his rear must certainly have done him an injury rather than a benefit , for at no time was he near enough for Lexington to hear the sound of his hoofs . The pace in the second mile visibly decreased ; Arrow , who was started before its commencement , waiting about thirty yards behind Lexington . In the third mile Arrow closed the gap , and Lexington , fearing him , was a little more anxious , and slightly increased his pace . Upon entering the fourth mile Arrow was stopped , and Joe Blackburn went at him again , but , as in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no benefit . Lexington darted off in earnest , running the last mile in l.4S* . He reached the head of the front stretch in 6.55 , running its entire length in 24* seconds ; the whole time of the four miles in 7.19* , carrying 103 pounds , Gilpatrick being three pounds overweight . " This was a wonderful performance  --  a something that no horse had ever done before , and a feat that no horse has been able to equal since . The world now rang with applause for Lexington . And yet , great as his triumph was , it is claimed by observing turfmen who witnessed the race that , had it been necessary , the four miles could have been finished on that day in at least 7 minutes and 10 seconds . Though the accredited hero of the fastest four-mile time on record , Lexington was called upon , April 14 , to meet once more his old rival , Lecomte . The race attracted much attention , and it ended in the defeat of Lecomte . This concluded Lexington 's career on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started seven times in all , and won six races , his total winnings amounting to $56,000 . His triumphs in the stud , in addition to his triumphs on th' turf , stamp him as the greatest of living horses . In 1856 , the late H. A. Alexander , well known as the largest breeder in the world , while in England , purchased Lexington of Mr. Ten Broeck for $15,000 . On Mr. Alexander 's return to the United States the stallion // was removed to Woodburn Farm , in Woodford County , Kentucky , where he has remained ever since , with the exception of a temporary visit to Illinois in 1865 . Shortly after his withdrawal from the turf he went blind , in consequence of filling himself at the corn-bin , just before a severe trial race . For neither man nor horse can perform great physical feats , without injury to himself with a stomach overburdened with food . Lexington is a blood bay , with fore and hind feet and pasterns , and a small portion of his hind-legs above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . As the incomparable trotter , Dexter , is similarly marked , we may safely infer that there is not much truth in the old nursery jingle : " Four white feet And a white nose , Throw him to the crows . " Lexington stands 15 hands 3 inches high ; his back is of medium length , and his loin wide , slightly curved , and very powerful . His body is well ribbed , and his limbs strong and well proportioned . We are thus particular in the description of him , for he has proved the greatest of modern sires ; for the past six years the fields on our principal race-courses have largely been made up of the get of Lexington . In one year alone he sired the great triumvirateNorfolk , Asteroid , and Kentucky . Fifty thousand dollars were refused for Asteroid , Kentucky sold for $40,000 , and Norfolk , in his racing prime , could not be bought for less than the latter amount . Lexington 's great fame and his infirmity have thrown a sad romance around his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , representing him led by black Jarret , his groom . The head is turned outward , and we have a full view of the dull , sightless eyes . The right fore-foot is thrown out haltingly , as if feeling for clear and firm ground upon which to place it . The whole form of the horse speaks blindness , and one can not gaze upon the picture , and recall the brilliant triumphs of the past , without a shade of sadness stealing over the face . The foundation for the improvement of the blood-horse in Tennessee was laid by Barry 's Gray Medley , a horse of beauty , spirit , and gameness , who made his first season ten miles north of Nashville , in the year 1800 . He was got by imported Medley , and was the sire of the dam of the famous brood-mare , Madam Tonson . Barry 's Medley was bred in Virginia , and ridden from that State to Tennessee by a colored boy , Altamont , raised by General Washington ; this faithful black was then the servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Virginia with Medley , his master heard nothing of him . He presumed that slave and horse were lost to him forever ; and , therefore , at the end of twelve months , was surprised by the report that came to him from the banks / of the Cumberland . Altamont had made a successful season with the stallion , and , as the profits of the season , placed $2000 to the bank credit of his master . This son of Africa afterward trained Polly Medley , and run her , for Mr. Barry , against Indian Queen , owned and run by General Jackson . The race was contested in 1803 , and it resulted in the defeat of Old Hickory , who , in gracefully acknowledging defeata thing he was not wont to do-paid a high compliment to Altamont . Mr. Barry was a generous master , and he was so well pleased with the conduct of Altamont that he gave him his freedom in the shape of a pass for ninety-nine years . After Medley came Wilkes 's Wonder , a son of Diomed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood stock of Tennessee ; and this rich infusion of blood aided in making the State one of the race-horse regions of America . Truxton , got by Diomed , large , muscular , and a powerful strider , in early days was the favorite race-horse and stallion of General Andrew Jackson . He was good at any distance , winning from a quarter to a race of four-mile heats . Mr. Catton was the owner of a very fleet mare , Greyhound ; and this mare was matched against Truxton , a mile dash . Each racer had its friends , and betting on the result was quite lively . Truxton won the race , and droves of horses  --  the spoils of victory-were turned over to General Jackson and his party . The memorable duel between Jackson and Dickinson grew out of the defeat of Irving 's Plowboy , in a race of two-mile heats , for $5000 , by Truxton . Among the old and prominent breeders of Tennessee may be named Judge Barry , General W. G. Harding , Hon. Bailie Peyton , the Cockerills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Leonidas Polk , who was killed in the Confederate service . Almost every turfman is familiar with the name of Colonel E. M. Blackburn . He was a remarkable man , somewhat eccentric , but pleasant in manner notwithstanding . He was one of the first children born in Woodford County , Kentucky ; and for more than fifty years was conspicuous on the turf . At different times he had in his possession such renowned horses as Whip , Kosciusko , Goode 's Arab , Lance , Shark , American Eclipse , and Gray Eagle . He was eloquent in praise of his J*orses , each , of course , being the " best " in the country . Though a plain farmer , statesmen and polished gentlemen frequently enjoyed the hospitality of his roof . It was in 1836 , at his own house , that he offered the delicate complimentary toast to the pleasant banter of Henry Clay . Blackburn had nearly exhausted the vocabulary in sounding the praises of various horses under his charge , and when the great competitor of the Southern horse Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by asking him what he could say new of American Eclipse . The table was surrounded by convivial souls , and all eyes were turned upon the farmer . He bowed his head , as if in painful silence , while the glasses were being filled ; then proudly rising to his feet , with a triumphant smile on his face , and as the wine bubbled in the crystal // goblet in his hand , he said : " Eclipse among horses as Henry Clay among men I " The words were electrical . " Harry of the West " bent his eyes upon the table in confusion , the scarlet mounted to his face , while the guests cheered and drained their glasses . Colonel Blackhnrn died the 17th of March , 1867 , at a greatly advanced age . Hon. John Minor Botts was one of the most distinguished of Virginia turfmen and breeders . He gave much study to the horse , bred on a large scale , and forgot questions of State to participate in the excitements of the race-course . Though courteous , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contradicted or corrected . He was wrapped up in the horses bred by himself ; fondly believing they had no superiors . Colonel M'iDaniels , also a prominent Virginia turfman , was a warm , personal friend of Mr. Botts . But the friendship existing between them did not prevent them from sayimg sharp things to each other when their blood was afire . A number of years ago Mr. Botts had a young mare entered in a valuable stake at Petersburg . The mare had distinguished herself in her maiden performance , and she was a great favorite over all others in the race . Colonel M'Daniels had a filly , comparatively unknown , engaged in the same stake . Mr. Botts was so confident of achieving victory that , when his mare was led on the course , just before the start for the first heat , he boastingly exclaimed : " There is a racer for you ! It is a pity that there is uothing here to run against her today . Why , I would back her to the extent of $60,000 against any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be more prudent in speech , but he would not listen to them . Colonel M'Dauiels bit his lips , but said nothing . The word for the start was given , and Mr. Botts 's entry won the first heat ; carrying nine pounds overweight , not as a penalty , but simply to gratify the vanity of the owner . He felt confident that she could win and pack the extra weight ; and if she did so , the performance would be all the greater . Colonel M'Daniels 's filly cooled out well , and when called for the second heat , she was in superb condition . She got a good start , and ran so gamely that she could not be headed . To the great surprise of Mr. Botts she won the heat . lie watched the finish in blank amazement ; his confidence in his mare was shaken , and he ordered that the extra weight be taken off . Colonel M'Daniels and Mr. Botts , when the horses were being saddled for the third heat , met on the quarter stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Mr. Botts , you have heard the story of the hawk and the blue jay ! " " No ; tell it to me , wo n't you ? " " Briefly , then , the hawk set upon the blue jay , and pursued the frightened bird with great swiftness . When almost within the clutch of the deadly talons , the blue jay darted into a brushheap , where the hawk could not follow . The bird , so badly frightened a moment before , now turned , in its safe retreat , upon the disappointed hawk with its mocking cry of c-ter gl-a , c-ter gl-a . The application is easy , Mr. Botts . You are *oo late in taking the extra weight off your mare . " The manner in which this was said , and the circumstances which gave rise to the speech , so exasperated Mr. Botts that he quarreled with his old friend . Colonel M'Daniels won the race ; and , after what had passed , Mr. Botts refused to be reconciled to him . Years passed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was an end to turf sports . The outspoken Unionism of Mr. Botts was not pleasing to the Confederate government . In 1861 he was arrested , and , for a short time , confined as a political prisoner in Castle Godwin , Richmond . This prison was the property of Colonel M'Daniels , and at its door the two old turfmen met , after an estrangement of years , a tear in each eye , and a clasp of hands that plainly said , " Forgive and forget ; " and they remained firm friends until the one crossed to the far , flowery banks of the silent river , to be soon followed by the other . Revenue , perhaps , was the greatest horse that Mr. Botts ever owned . lIe was a stallion of singular beauty , symmetrical in form , and proud in his carriage ; was successful both on the turf and in the stud . The last two years of Revenue 's life were passed at Major Homer 's place , Belle Air , near Warrenton , Virginia . He grew very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 16 . For a fortnight before his death he had refused his food , and was so weak that he could scarcely stand . The very day that he died , and but two hours before the last terrible convulsion , the worn and weary old stallion was led out into the bright sunshine . He tried to nip the green grass , but the effort was too great for him . Standing there , stupid and tottering , in the dreamy September air , his eyes wandered to where a mare was grazing in all of her youth , health , and glorious physical beauty . The sight moved the heart of the dying stallion . He gazed in admiration , and there was a thrill of the old passionate fire in the thin blue veins . The picture of beauty charmed him ; he proudly straightened himself ; the light flashing from his eyes , and looked as if he had renewed his youth . A feeble neigh , and the whirl of passion was gone ; the head dropped nerveless , the glassy film again gathered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in less than two hours , Revenue had laid himself down and breathed his last . The gallant old racer was buried in a sequestered nook at Belle Air , with all the honors due a horse of his fame . No horse since the importation of Diomed played a more important part in the turf history of America than Ghencoe . He was got by Sultan , his dam Trampoline , by Tramp ; and he was bred in England , by Lord Jersey , in 1831 . After a successful career on the English turf , he was imported to this country by James Jackson , of Alabama . Glencoe was a beautiful chestnut , a large star in the forehead , and both // qwq day was beautiful , one of the softest of gloriously tinted autumn . Kentucky was badly ridden , was out-paced in the first two miles , and he lost the race by eleven and three-quarter seconds . The only time that the people ever saw him show signs of distress on the turf was coming down the home stretch , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courage failed him . Had he been properly managed , on that lovely October day , we do not think that he could have been successful . The task was too great for him-he was overmatched . He carried too much weight ; and every ounce tells upon the speed and endurance of a horse , especially in a struggle of four miles . By weight you can reduce the fleetest and gamest racer in the world to the level of the most common hack . Kentucky is not a stronger horse than Lexington was , and Lexington , when he ran four miles in 7 minutes 19* seconds , carried but 103 pounds . The rivalry between Norfolk , Asteroid , and Kentucky , though exciting a little unpleasant feeling between men of different sections , was a good thing for the turf . The war had swept away the racing institutions of the South ; the hreeding studs were broken np , and the bloodhorse bridled and made to do service in the army . When the sounds of strife were heard throughout the land , life currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people hAd no heart for the pastimes of the turf ; racing was abandoned , horses of royal lineage scattered ; and , when the war closed , the old jockey clubs were disorganized-bankrupt . The performances of the three great sons of Lexington roused sinking courage , and directed attention to the turf . It was a theatre on which men of all political opinions could meet in social enjoyment ; it called the thoughts from the harrowing scenes of the past , and gave a silver lining to the dark cloud which overhung the future . The people were sick of war and the wrangles growing out of it , and they turned to the turf with eagerness . It was the only practical means of reunion at the time . Men who , a few months before , had faced each other on the battle-field , stood side by side on the race-course , enthusiastically applauding the silken-coated thorough-breds . Where the horses ran , there the men from the South and the men from the North met to exchange cordial greetings . The rivalry between Asteroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the racing fever grew hotter day after day . The fever spread , and the glory of the turf was revived in the North . Men of capital came to the support of racing , and the management of the parks was made above reproach . Fashion smiled upon each enterprise , and the shame of the past  --  the disgrace which attended the decline of the Long Island courses - was forgotten . At Paterson , at Secaucus , and at Saratoga , crowds assembled to witness the speed contests ; and when Jerome Park was constructed , and the gates thrown open to the public , Fashion erected her throne on the club-house balcony , and from it sent forth her imperial edivts . As the South prospered anew she began to reorganize her jockey clubs , and to-day the turf is in a flourishing condition . Mobile has her Magnolia Course , New Orleans her Metairie Course , Memphis her Chickasaw Jockey Club , Nashville her Blood-Horse Association , Louisville her Woodlawn Course , Lexington her Association Course , St. Louis her Laclede Jockey Club , Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilicothe the same , New York her Jerome Park , and Saratoga her popular course . In addition to these , running meetings , since the war , have been held at Chicago , Narraganset Park , Springfield ( Massachusetts ) , Boston , Columbus , Ohio , and other places . The two New Jersey courses , Paterson and Secaucus , were unable to stand up against the powerful rivalry of Jerome Park , and for two years they have been under a cloud ; but a magnificent racing park is in course of construction at Long Branch , which will be thrown open to the public in the summer of 1870 . At nearly all of the well-established courses two meetings , spring and fall , are held every year ; and , owing to a diversity of climate , they are so arranged as not to conflict with each other , in addition to making the turf games as regular and eternal as the roll of the seasons . When the parks are deserted in the North , the courses in the South ring with the clatter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn from the wealthiest and most influential ranks of society . The American Jockey Club is the wealthiest of all the clubs . Such prominent gentlemen and capitalists as Messrs . Belmont , Sanford , Duncan , Jerome , and Morris , are leading controllers of racing at Jerome Park . Racing is the most expensive amusement in the world . To keep up a first-class stable of runners requires a vast outlay of money-from $50,000 to $100,000 a year . The owners of race-horses generally are men of fortune , who go upon the turf for pleasure , not profit . It is a royal sport , beyond the reach of modest incomes ; and , as wealth is inclined to be ambitious and arrogant , racing is adopted as a pastime by those who have riches and leisure , and who aspire to lead where the vulgar crowd can not follow . It has received the patronage of kings and the support of the nobility in Europe , and neither its origin nor its history is humble . This is the pride and boast of turfmen . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being so renders it all the more attractive to men of fortune . They make it their amusement , spend money lavishly , and , through trials of speed and a spirit of emulation , direct thought to the problem of breeding , and encourage the improvement of the horse . To breed successfully , one must understand the principles of blood . The horse is judged by pedigree , speed , endurance , and form . A single obscure cross is a taint in lineage that // the well - advised turfman can not overlook . The blood that flows in the animal 's veins must be as pure as the water that gn*hes from the crystal spring . An uncontaminated pedigree for five generations makes the horse thoroughbred . It is the great study to keep the blood pure , and to so combine the crosses as to blend the highest rate of speed with the greatest endurance and the most graceful form . The largest and most successful breeder in the world was the late Robert Aitcheson Alexander . He was born in Kentucky , was educated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir William Alexander ; and , on his return to this country , he gave his attention to breeding . He was possessed of large fortune , and was able to carry out his ideas on a grand scale . He made his Kentucky farm , Woodburn , the largest breeding estate in the world , not even excepting that wealthy corporation , the Raweliffe Stud Company of England . In 1856 his colors , blue and white , first appeared upon the turf , lie was unsuccessful for a time , but perseverance secured to him the most formidable racing stud in America . He established annual sales , in which his yearling colts were sold at auction . These sales at Woodburn farm were , and still are , popular . At one of them , in the bright month of June , you meet gentlemen from all parts of the United States and Canada . R. A. Alexander never married ; the thorough-bred claimed his warmest love . Still , though modest and unassuming , he was polished in society . He died December 1 , 1867 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was strong , and the cares of his great breeding estate told upon the worn machinery . The fuel burned out , the motive-power was exhausted , and then there was a tremble of the feebly revolving wheel , followed by a silent clog . Mr. Alexander did more in his short life for the improvement of the blood-horse than any other man in America . Woodburn is still a vast breeding estate , carried on by A. John Alexander , the successor of his brother , and , like him , a bachelor . Of the men of fortune who recently have established breeding farms , we may mention August Belmont , Esq. , Mr. M. H. Sanford , the most liberal of American turfmen , and R. W. Cameron . Lewis G. Morris , Esq. , is one of the oldest of Eastern breeders . Kentucky at this time takes the lead as the " blood-horse region " of America , although the breeding of thorough-breds , to greater or less extent is carried on in Maryland , Virginia , the Carolinas , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois , Iowa , Wisconsin , Ohio , New York , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey . The war opened the eyes of the people to the superior qualities of the blood-horse , especially his powers of endurance . The Confederate cavalry was most often successful because it was better mounted than the Federal , the Northern States , as a mass , having given but little attention to the breeding of thoroughbreds . As the Federal army penetrated the Southern States , horses of unquestioned pedigree fell into the hands of the officers ; and when Lee surrendered to Grant , a great many of the purest bred stallions in the country , heretofore the exclusive'property of the South , were disseminating their blood throughout the North . While the war broke up many select breeding studs , it scattered noble sires and aristocratic dams in such a manner as to lead to the general improvement of the horse in America . Time is regarded as a test of merit ; but it is not infallible , since atmosphere alone has a marked effect upon the flight of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The changing elasticity of tracks also influences time . A horse capable of making fast time may run in fields where he is not forced to put forth his greatest effort , and he may score victory after victory without astonishing the world with a performance that renders necessary the revision of the time record . When some horses are forced to their mettle they surprise us by the rapidity of their flight , and play havoc with the seconds . It is safe , however , to assert that none but a good horse can go so fast as to claim special mention . Therefore a table of the fastest time is not without interest , or even value : Three-quarters of a mile , in 1 minute 17% seconds , by Narraganset , at Narraganset Park , August 25 , 1868 . One mile , in 1 minute 44 seconds , by Legal Tender , at Buckeye Course , Cincinnati , June 25 , 1865 ; track thirty feet short of a mile , and horse carried 18 pounds less than his proper weight ; track has since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 minute 44% seconds , b*y Revolver , second heat , at Buckeye Course , May 110 , 1866 . One mile , in 1 minute 44% seconds , by Mammona , first heat , at Lexington , Kentucky , 1862 . One mile , in 1 minute 43% seconds , by Herzog , three years old , at Buckeye Course , May 25 , 1869 . Herzog 's time , up to this date , is the best on record , since he carned the proper weight , and ran two heats same race1 minute 45 seconds ; 1 minute 43% seconds . One mile , in 1 minute 45% seconds , by Versailles , Herzog 's half-brother , three years old , at Buckeye Course , September 21 , 1869 . Full weight up . One mile , in 1 minute 44% seconds , by Pompey Payne , Herzog 's half-brother , three years old , at Lexington , Kentucky , second heat , carrying 90 pounds , May 17 , 1869 . One mile , in 1 minute 45% seconds , by General Duke , two years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1867 . One mile , in 1 minute 45 seconds , by Hamburg , two years old , proper weight , at Buckeye Course , September 23 , 1869 . One mile , in 1 minute 48% seconds , by Climax , aged nine years , carrying 148% pounds , a crushing weight , at Jerome Park , July , 1868 . One mile and a quarter , in 2 minutes 10 seconds , by Narraganset , at Saratoga , Au* , nst 4 , 1869 . Two miles , in 5 minutes 54% seconds , by Hegira , catch weight , at Metairie Course , New Orleans , November 23 , 1850 . Two miles , in 5 minutes 55% seconds ; 3 minutes 38% seconds , by Lancaster , proper weight , at Lexington , Kentucky , September 12 , 1867 . Two miles , in 3 minutes 36% seconds ; 5 minutes 58 seconds , by Asteroid , at Woodlawn Course , Louisville , Kentucky , June 6 , 1865 . The first mile of the second heat was run in 1 minute 44 seconds . Two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kentucky , at Saratoga , August , 1865. // Two and a half miles , in 4 minutes 37*f seconds , by General Yorke , at Narraganset Park , August 26 , 1868 . Three miles , in 5 minutes 27*4 seconds ; 5 minutes 29f seconds , by Norfolk , at Sacramento , California , September 23 , 1865 . Four miles , in 7 minutes 26* seconds , by Idlewild , full weight , on Long Island , June 25 , 1863 . Four miles , in 7 minutes 191f seconds , by Lexington , five years old , carrying 103 pounds , at Nietairie Course , New Orleans , April 2 , 1S55 . Lexington also ran in 7 minutes 23*f seconds , at New Orleans , April 14 , 1885 , defeating Lecomte . By the above table we see that Herzog 's one mile in 1 minute 434 seconds is the best mile performance on record , since the track was the proper length , and he carried the full weight allotted to three-year-olds . It is claimed that the French horse , Gladiateur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1865 , ran a mile , at Newmarket Course , in 1 minute 38 seconds ; but as in England time is not accepted as a test , and is not officially taken , the record is questioned . Saunterer , it is also asserted , ran a mile in England in 1 minute 404 seconds . Be this as it may , it is our opinion that neither Gladiateur nor Saunterer , in best form , could have finished a mile quicker at Cincinnati than Herzog did on the 25th of May , 1869 . This most promising three-year-old , we regret to write , has died since he placed 1.434 on the time record . The genius of Troye has preserved to us the forms of nearly all the prominent racers since the memorable struggle of Henry and Eclipse . His name is linked with the stirring events of half a century ago . his portraits grace the walls of cultivated homes in all parts of the New World , and are found in many of the galleries of the Old . Mr. Troyc , though advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . He is emphatically the Landseer of America . His face and figure are striking . Tall , well-proportioned , and no stoop in his shoulders , notwithstanding he verges on fourscore years . He wears his hair long , and it falls in gray masses down his back . He is eccentric , both in dress and manner , and has a contempt for that portion of mankind having no sympathy with aristocratic institutions . The wealthiest and most cultivated men of the last decade were his warm personal friends ; and , if you talk with him long , he is very apt to remind you of the fact . His speech is affected , inclining to a drawl . Those who know him well admire his genius , while smiling at his eccentricities ; and they often ask themselves why the gifted should be peculiar . When Kentucky was prominently on the turf , Troye painted the horse in three different positions . These portraits were much admired ; and one day a well-known turfman , for whom the artist had no particular liking , met Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paintings , and then endeavored to draw the old man into a conversation . Troye listened with an expression of annoyance on his face , then abruptlyasked : " Mr.- , if Imistake not , you are weliversed in the.art of training horses ? " The truth was modestly admitted , and the artist was forced to listen to a glowing eulogy of a famous horse owned by the turfman . In a few minutes Troye cut short the stream of eloquence by coolly glancing over the morning paper that he had recommenced reading , and speaking in his most affected drawl : " Re-ally , vary fine ! Do you know , Sir , that you have a wre-markable appreciation of the fine arts ; that is , wremarkable for one who was brought up in a stable ? " The conversation abruptly ended here , and from that day to this Troye has had one more enemy in the world . The inauguration of Jerome Park gave brilliance to the new era of the turf . This course , fitted up with all the elegance that wealth could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police kept the rough element in check , and fashion daunted her skirts in the bright , cheery sunshine . And now there is no place on the American continent where such regal display is seen as on a race day at Jerome Park . The belles of New York , apparently , are never so happy as when promenading the Club-house balconies , or flirting on the Grand Stand . They dress for a race with the same elaborate care that they dress for an opera . The drive from New York to the Park is a lovely one ; and , when the colors of the American Jockey Club float in the breeze , it is crowded with the most stylish equipages-carriages , tandems , and fourin-hands . We remember seeing on the Grand Stand at Jerome Park , at one time , General Grant , Admiral Farragut , and Madame Ristori . To join in the promenade on the greensward in front of the stands , look up at the crowd , dazzling in dress and beauty , listen to the strains of music that come surging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze upon the thorough-breds on the quarter stretch , aglow with excitement and mounted by the gayly-dressed jockeys , is to feel a grand thrill in the veins , to dream of enchanted land . The picture is a beautiful one ; for we have the poetry of sound , the poetry of form , and the poetry of motion blended into one harmonious whole . The fame of the meetings at Jerome Park spread over the country , stimulating the organization of new jockey clubs , and leading to the revival of the old clubs . At Saratoga the race days are almost as brilliant as at the aristocratic Park located in the beautiful suburbs of New York city . The prodigals who wander to the Springs during the summer solstice regard race week as an important event in the flow of their fashionable lives . Those who follow the turf as a profession have a good deal of hard work to perform-a work colored here and there , however , by the rosy hues of romance . To be a trainer of horses one must have a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer and a clear reasoner . The horse is difficul.t to understand , and to prepare him for a severe race is a delicate operation . Too much work is debilitating , and too little fails to clear the veins and lungs , and to strengthen the innsdes. // A successfnl trainer must graduate in the rough school of experience . The stableboys-employed as riders , rubbers , etc. - are generally drawn from the humblest ranks of life . They most frequently are orphans , street Arabs in our great cities , who are fascinated by the glitter of the turf ; and , when connected with a racing stable , they lead a nomadic life . The stable travels from park to park-roaming from the Atlantic to beyond the Mississippi , and from the great chaia of lakes to the Gulf of Mexico ; and the boys , as a part of the stable , have no settled home . They grow up among the horses , sleep with them , and bestow upon them the pure affection of the heart . The defeat of their favorite depresses them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face radiant with joy . During the running of a race they may hear the murmurs of the crowd , but they do not see the brilliant throng ; they have eyes alone for the horse that carries the colors of their stable in the contest . It is a rough school in which to live ; but rude contact with the cold , practical world sharpens the wits , develops the kcen faculties of the brain ; and almost invariably you find , in weighing the jockey , an old head on young shoulders . Some of the boys grow up into prosperous men ; but most of them remain true to their early instincts , and rush through the world indifferent to the smiles or frowns of fortune . The turf is what General B. F. Butler would call a law unto itself . Its rules are carefully drawn , and provision is made for almost every possible contingency . The racing code is broad and technical and it is more closely observed , and more ably expounded , than is the civil code in many sections of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turf congress , in which each association is represented ; and this congress frames and adopts rules for the government of all the associations included within the congressional district . The Eastern associations , thus far , have not organized a congress ; but there is an understanding between them which gives general scope to the law and preserves harmonious action . For instance , an offense against one association is regarded an offense against all ; and if a trainer , jockey , or horse is placed under ban by one association , he is denied the privileges of the other courses until the association that inflicted the penalty grants him full pardon . The law is strict and being general in character , but few who follow racing as a profession care to openly violate it . The law is definite , and so long as it is rigidly , impartially administered , the turf will remain pure . But neglect to enforce it , and disgrace and ruin are sure to follow . Unfortunately , it will not do to be tolerant to those who make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break beyond all restraining influences , and they have a confused idea of the true meaning of forbearance . The temptations to override the law are many ; the tempter is strong , while the tempted are weak , and , therefore , we generally find that shame is the fruit of tolerance . The best interests of the turf demand that those who are appointed to interpret and enforce the law at every meeting shall be firm and just . We do not want justice tempered with mercy , but justice in its naked , stony , heroic form . This is an absolute necessity now , for the reason that the turf has been invaded by men who are devoid of a nice sense of honor . They have purchased stables , not to race for pleasure , but to make their horses a means of speculation . Such men may be excluded from membership in the jockey clubs , but the privilege of entering and running their horses under the law can not well be denied them . When they nominate a horse for an event they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law is carefully guarded , speculation is nothing more or less than downright robbery . Men of this character aided in breaking up the old jockey clubs , and in making the turf a by-word in the North . Charity folded them under her wing , and then the glory of Long Island departed . Surely the present should profit by the story of the p* st . It is plain to those who have studied recent events that danger again threatens the turf , and prompt action is required to avert the danger . Frail humanity always has manifested a strong disposition to speculate . We can not keep down speculation , but we can throw restraining influences around it , and prevent it from running to crazy extremes . The racing code encourages speculation by legalizing betting . And for what ? It is safe to say , to gratify the depraved appetites of about one hundred and fifty men of questionable character . Watch at Saratoga , or Jerome Park , where you please , the crowd that gathers around the pool stand . Meeting after meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pools are professional gamblers . A gentleman of respectable business connections does not like to be seen in that wrangling crowd . If he wants to back a horse , he quietly lays the wager with one or more of his friends , or he sends an agent to operate for him around the pool stand . Who was it that excited the storm of passion in front of the judges ' stand at Saratoga , at the close of the Yauxhall-Bayonet race last summer ? Certainly not those gentlemen whose names are respected on Change , are honored in literary , scientific , or commercial circles . These men went to the Springs for recreation , for pleasure , and they are not wont to forget themselvns , to stoop from the true dignity of a gentleman . They were pleased spectators of the tourney , and had little interest , aside from personal feeling , in the defeat or success of any horse . Who , then , were the brawlers ? Who but the professional gamblers that follow from meeting to meeting , and live upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of professional men that the law legalizes betting . Carefullyanalyze the question , and soberly weigh it , gentlemen of the jockey clubs , and then tell us if the benefit derived from such // a law is worth more to you than the scandal which grows out of it . We do not claim that speculation can he abolished from the race-course ; hut we insist that the deciding of hets should not he made one of the duties of the official judges . Legalizing hetting encourages promiscuous gambling ; and promiscuous gambling excites passion , and points the way to fraud . The people who fill the grand stands and give refinement to turf gatherings are indifferent to the gains or losses of the hetting ring ; if they speculate at all , it is amorrg themselves , and on a small scale . They do not make a business of hetting , hut have just enough at stake to give them keener interest in the running of the horses ; and , result as the race may , they part with or accept the trifle at hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people give prosperity and glory to the turf . They delight in the games that call forth qualities of speed and endurance ; and racing will remain a popular pastime with them until the scandals drive them from the course . The surest way to keep down scandal is to aholish the betting rules , and to firmly enforce the law , no matter who is at fault . Danger threatens to hring the new and brilliant era of the turf to a disgraceful close ; hut if the jockey cluhs are wise the danger will he averted .
