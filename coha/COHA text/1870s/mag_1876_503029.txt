FROM WEST POIXT TO THE BATTLEFIELD . I K June , 1857 , I entered the Military Academy at West Point as a cadet , having received my appointment thereto through the kindness of the Hon. John A. Biugham , then representing in Congress the district in Ohio in which I was born , and in which I had spent almost my entire boyhood . The first official notification received by me of my appointment to the Military Academy bore the sigaature of Jefferson Davis , then Secretary of War in the cabinet of President James Buchanan . Colonel Richard Delafield , one of the ablest and most accomplished officers of the Engineer Corps , occupied the position of superintendent of the Academy , and Lieutenant-Colonel Win . J. Hardee , of the cavalry , afterward lieutenant-general in the Confederate army , was the commandant of the Corps of Cadets . During the four years spent by me at West Point there were stationed there , either as officers in the capacity of instructors , or as cadets , several who afterward became more or less distinguished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant James B. Fry , post adjutant ; Lieutenant John Gibbon , post quartermaster ; Lieutenants George L. Hartsuff and Charles L. Griffin , instructors of artillery ; Lieutenants John M. Schofield and Cyrus B. Comstock , instructors of natural philosophy , etc. ; Lieutenants Gouv . K. Warren , 0 . 0 . Howard , Alexander Webb , and Absalom Baird , instructors of mathematics ; Lieutenants Win . B. Hazen and Alex . MeD . MeCook , instructors of infantry tactics ; Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel , instructor of engineering . These all achieved , a few years later , the rank of major-general in the Union armies , and commanded either armies or corps , or filled equally responsible and honorable . positions . Of . those whom I remember as instructors , and who , casting their fortunes with the forces of the South , afterward attained high rank , and who were then captains or lieutenants , were Charles W. Field , John Pegram , Fitzhugh Lee , Cadmus Wilcox , and John Forney . Of those who were cadets with me between the years of 1857 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less distinguished during the war . Of those who fought for the Union were Hardin , Merritt , Kilpatrick , Ames , Upton , and McKenzie , each of whom within less than three years from the date of his departure from the Academy won by bravery and distinguished conduct on the field of battle the star of brigadier-general . Most of these attained before the termination of the war the high grade of major-general . Among those joining the Confederate force who rose to distinction were Wheeler , Rosser , Young , Robertson , and Kelley , all of whom became general officers and rendered highly important service in the cause for which they battled . It is somewhat remarkable that these five general officers held commands in the cavalry , as did also three of the sixMerritt , Kilpatrick , and McKenzienamed on the Union side  --  to which list I might add my own name-thus showing that the cavalry offered the most promising field for early promotion . A few months prior to the breaking out of the war , Beauregard , then a major of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Academy ; but whether because he foresaw the events of the near future , or from other motives , he applied to be relieved from the effect of the order . His application was granted , and he took his departure after a sojourn of but a few days . // Among the noticeable features of cadet life as then impressed upon me , and still present in my memory , were the sectional lines voluntarily established by the cadets themselves ; at first barely distinguishable , but in the later years immediately preceding the war as clearly defined and strongly drawn as were the lines separating the extremes of the various sections in the national Congress . Nor was this fact a strange or remarkable one . As each Congressional district and territory of the United States had a representative in Congress , so each had its representatives at the Military Academy . And there was no phase of the great political questions of the times , particularly the agitation of the slavery question as discussed and maintained by the various agitators in Congress , but found its exponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule reflected the political sentiments of the particular member who represented in Congress the locality from which the cadet happened to hail . Of course there were exceptions to this rule , but in the absence of any clearly formed political sentiment or belief of his own , it seemed to be the fashion , if nothing more , that each particular cadet should adopt the declared views and opinions of his representative in Congress . Hence it was no difficult matter to find exponents of the greatest political extremes ; from the sturdy and pronounced abolitionist , hailing from New England , or perhaps the Western reserve in Ohio , to the most rabid of South Carolina nullifiers or Georgia fire-eaters . While the advocates for and against slavery were equally earnest and determined , those from the South were always the most talkative if not argumentative . As the pronounced abolitionist was rarely seen in Congress in those days , so was his appearance among the cadets of still rarer occurrence ; besides it required more than ordinary moral and physical courage to boldly avow oneself an abolitionist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadet who had the courage to avow himself an abolitionist must be prepared to face the social frowns of the great majority of his comrades and at times to defend his opinions by his physical strength and metal . The John Brown raid into Virginia stirred the wrathful indignation of the embryonic warriors who looked upon slavery as an institution beyond human int*rference ; while those of the opposite extreme contented themselves by quietly chuckling over the alarm into which the executive and military forces of an entire State were thrown by the invasion led by Brown , backed by a score or two of adherents . The Presidential campaign which resulted in the election of Abraham Lincoln was not more hotly argued and contested by the regular stump speakers of either party than by the Northem and Southern cadets in their efforts to re-echo the political sentiments of their respective sections . The Republicans of course espoused the cause championed by Lincoln and Hamlin and the extreme Democrats announced themselves as under the banner of Breckenridge and Lane . A son of the latter was a member of my class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democrats declared for Douglass and Johnson , while a few neutrals from the border States shouted feebly for Bell and Everett . The Breckenridge army of Southern Democrats did not hesitate to announce , *s their seniors in and out of Congress had done , that in the event of Lincoln 's election secession would be the only resource left to the South . So high did political feeling run among the cadets , or a portion of them , that Mr. Lincoln was hung in effigy one night to a limb of one of the shade trees growing in front of cadet barracks . The effigy was removed early in the morning-so early that few of the cadets or professors even knew of the occurrence . It seemed to have been a part of the early teach.ing of the Southern youth , that the disruption of the Union was // an event surely to be brought about . As an illustration of this I remember that Congress had appointed a committee in 1859 , I believe , to visit West Point , and determine whether the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to four . This committee was composed of two United States Senators , two members of the House , and as many officers of the Army . Jefferson Davis , then a Senator from Mississippi , and a member of the Military Committee of the Senate , was a member of this special committee . The cadets , anxious to render their detention at the Academy as brief as possible , were warmly interested in the result of the committee 's labors and investigation , and hoped ardently that the report would induce Congress to shorten the term of study from five to four years . To their great disappointment , however , it was soon after announced that the committee had reported in favor of a continuance of the five-year system of instruction . It was believed by the cadets that this conclusion had been reached through the great influence of Jefferson Davis in the committee ; an influence which his military ability , and particularly his experience and high reputation won while filling the office of Secretary of War , had properly given him . Whether justly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in groups by themselves . In one instance when the subject was being discussed a Georgia *badet , afterward distinguished in the war , indulged in the most bitter invectives against Davis , whom he charged with being the person responsible for detaining us an additional year in the Academy , concluding his execration by verbally consigning the object of his youthful ire to a locality hotter even than his native State . The next moment , however , he corrected himself in the most solemn manner by remarking , " No , I 'll take that all back ; for I believe the day is coming when the South will have need of Mr. Davis 's abilities . " In looking back over the few months and years passed at West Point immediately preceding the war some strange incidents recur to my mind . When the various State conventions were called by the different States of the South with a view to the adoption of the ordinance of secession , it became only a question of time as to the attempted withdrawal of the secediWg States . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that war would not necessarily or probably follow , this opinion was not shared in even by persons as young and inexperienced as the cadets were . War was anticipated by them at that time and discussed and looked forward to as an event of the future with as much certainty as if speaking of an approaching season . The cadets from the South were in constant receipt of letters from their friends at home , keeping them fully advised of the real situation and promising them suitable positions in the military force yet to be organized to defend the ordinance of secession . All this was a topic of daily if not hourly conversation . Particularly was this true when we assembled together at meal time , when , grouped in squads of half a dozen or more , each usually found himself in the midst of his personal friends . I remember a conversation held at the table at which I sat during the winter of 00-,61 . I was seated next to Cadet P. M. B. Young . a gallant young fellow from Georgia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate and valued friend  --  a major-general in the Confederate forces during the war and a member of Congress from his native State at a later date . The approaching war was as usual the subject of conversation in which all participated , and in the freest and most friendly manner ; the lads from the North discoursing earnestly upon the power and rectitude of the Nation . al Government , the impulsive Southron holding up pictures of invaded rights and future independence . Finally , in a half jocular , half earnest // manner , Young turned to me and delivered himself as follows : " Custer , my boy , we 're going to have war . It 's no use talking : I see it coming . All the Crittenden compromises that can be patched up wo n't avert it . Now let me prophesy what will happen to you and me . You will go home , and your abolition Governor will probably make you colonel of a cavalry regiment . I will go down to Georgia , and ask Governor Brown to give me a cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other during the war . You will probably get the advantage of us in the first few engagements , as your side will be rich and powerful , while we will be poor and weak . Your regiment will be armed with the best of weapons , the sharpest of sabres ; mine will have only shotguns and scythe blades ; but for all that we 'll get the best of the fight in the end , because we will fight for a principle , a cause , while you will fight only to perpetuate the abuse of power . " Lightly as we both regarded this boyish prediction , it was destined to be fulfilled in a remarkable degree . Early in the war I did apply , not to the ab.olition Governor of my native State , but to that of Michigan , for a cavalry regiment . I was refused , but afterward obtained the regiment I desired as a part of my command . Young was chosen to lead one of the Georgia cavalry regiments . Both of us rose to higher commands , and confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1860 , South Carolina formally led the way by adopting the ordinance of secession ; an example which was followed within the next few weeks by Mississippi , Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas , in the order named . As soon as it became evident that these States were determined to attempt secession , the cadets appointed therefrom , imitating the action of their Senators and representatives in Congress , and influenced by the appeals of friends at home , tendered their resignations , eager to return to their homes &amp;nd take part in the organization of the volunteer forces which the increasing difficulties and dangers of the situation rendered nec essary . Besides , as the Confederate Congress was called to meet for the first time at Montgomery , Alabama , February 6 , 1861 , and would undoubtedly authorize the appointment of a large number of officers in the formation of the Confederate armies , it was important that applicants for positions of this kind should be on the ground to properly present their claims . No obstacle was interposed by the Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it seemed to me then , as it does now , strange that the Government did not adopt measures which would prevent the opponents of the national authority from availing themselves of the services and abilities of those who had been educated at the public expense . They knew the purpose of these cadets , like that of the many officers of the army who resigned , was to serve against the Government , and had a just and unquestioned claim , according to the terms of their oath of office , upon their loyalty and faithful service until freed from their allegiance by the acceptance of their resignation or their discharge . They could have refused to accept the resignations of all persons in the military service when there was reason to believe that such persons intended to aid the public enemy . Without the exercise of any greater or more questionable authority than that frequently exercised at a later period of the war , the Government could have promptly arrested and confined every person , of whatever rank in the military service , who tendered his resignation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming conflict . Thus the South would have been shorn of its chief military strength by being deprived of all its great military leaders . A few rash , thoughtless men might have fled to the seceded States , but the vast majority , being bound to the National Government by the solemn obligations of their oaths , would have rendered obedience , // even if distasteful , to the demands of the national authority , until that authority should consent to release them from their obligations of duty , as it did by accepting their resignations . To have done otherwise would have been to commit the double offense of perjury and desertion ; and I have too high an opinion of the sense of honor which governed the men who afterward became the gallant but mistaken leaders of the Confederate armies , to suppose them capable of this . One by one the places occupied by the cadets from the seceding States became vacant ; it cost many a bitter pang to disrupt the intimate relations existing between the hot-blooded Southron and his more phlegmatic schoolmate from the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate regard for each other than were some of the cadets about to separate for the last time , and under circumstances which made it painful to contemplate a future coming together . Those leaving for the South were impatient , enthusiastic , and hopeful . Visions filled their minds of a grand and glorious confederacy , glittering with the pomp and pageantry which usually characterizes imperial power , and supported and surrounded by a mighty army , the officers of which would constitute a special aristocracy . Their comrades from the North , whom they were leaving behind , were reserved almost to sullenness ; were grave almost to stoicism . The representatives of the two sections had each resolved upon their course of action ; and each in a manner characteristic of their widely different temperaments , as different as the latitudes from which they hailed . Among the first of the cadets to leave West Point and hasten to enroll themselves under the banner of the seceding States , were two of my classmates , Kelley and Ball of Alabama . Kelley became prominent in the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rank , and is now a prominent official in one of the most extensive and well-known business enterprises in this country . They took their departure from the Academy on Saturday . I remember the date the more readily as I was engaged into adopt the cadet term- " walking an extra , " which consisted in performing the tiresome duties of a sentinel during the unemployed hours of Saturday ; hours usually given to recreation . On this occasion I was pacing back and forth on my post , which for the time being extended along the path leading from the cadets ' chapel toward the academic building , when I saw a party of from fifteen to twenty cadets emerge from the open space between the mess hall and academic building , and direct their steps toward the steamboat landing below . That which particularly attracted my attention was the bearing aloft upon the shoulders of their comrades of my two classmates Ball and Kelley , as they were being carried in triumph from the doors of the Academy to the steamboat landing . Too far off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they caught sight of me as step by step I reluctantly paid the penalty of offended regulations , and raised their hats in token of farewell , to which , first casting my eyes about to see that no watchful superior was in view , I responded by bringing.my musket to a " present . " The comrades who escorted them were Southerners like themselves , and only awaiting the formal action of their respective States on the adoption of the secession ordinance to follow their example . It was but a few weeks until there was scarcely a cadet remaining at the Academy from the Southern States . Many resigned from the border States without waiting to see whether their State would follow in the attempt at secession or not ; some resigned who had been appointed from States which never voted to leave the Union ; while an insignificant few , who had resolved to join the Confederate forces , but desired to obtain their diplomas from the academic faculty , // remained until the date of their graduation . Some remained until long after the declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transport them to Washington , tendered their resignations , and were dismissed for doing so in the face of the enemy . Happily the number that pursued this questionable course did not exceed half a dozen . At no point in the loyal States were the exciting events of the spring of 1861 watched with more intense interest than at West Point . And after the departure of the Southern cadets the hearts of the people of no community , State , town , or village beat with more patriotic impulse than did those of the young cadets at West Point . Casting aside all questions of personal ambition or promotion ; realizing only that the Government which they had sworn to defend , the principles they had been taught from childhood , were in danger , and threatened by armed enemies , they would gladly have marched to battle as private soldiers , rather than remain idle spectators in the great conflict . As the time for the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln approached , rumors prevailed , and obtained wide belief , to the effect that a plot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made the occasion on the part of the enemies of the Government , of whom great numbers were known to be in Washington , for seizing or making away with the executive officers of the nation , and taking possession of the peepie 's capital . Whether or not such a scheme was ever seriously contemplated , it was 4eemed prudent to provide against it . The available military resources of the Government amounted to but little at that period . Lieutenant-General Scott , then commander-inchief of the army , issued orders for the assembling at Washington of as large a military force as circumstances would permit . Under this order it became necessary to make a demand upon the regular military forces then employed *at West Point . A battery of artillery 29 was hastily organized from the war material and horses kept at the Academy for the purpose of instruction to the cadets . The horses were supplied by taking those used by the cadets in their cavalry and artillery drills . The force thus organized hastened to Washington , where , under the command of Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then followed the firing upon Sumter , the intelligence of which waked the slumbering echoes of loyalty and patriotism in every home and hamlet throughout the North . It is doubtful if the people of the North were ever , or will ever be again , so united in thought and impulse as when the attack on Sumter was flashed upon them . Oppoucuts in politics became friends in patriotism ; all differences of Qpiniou vanished or were laid aside , and a single purpose filled and animated the breast of the people as of one man  --  a purpose unflinching and unrestrained  --  to rush to the rescue of the Government , to beat down its opposers , come from whence they may . In addition to sharing the common interest and anxiety of the public in the attack upon Sumter , the cadets felt a special concern from the fact that among the little band of officers shut up in that fortress were two , Lieutenants Snyder and Hall , who had been our comra4es as cadets only a few months before . As already stated , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was five years , in the determination and fixing of which no one had exercised greater influence than Jefferson Davis-first as Secretary of War , afterward as United States Senator and member of a special Congressional committee to consider the question as to whether the course should extend to five years or 0nly include four . There was no single individual in or out of Congress , excepting perhaps the venerable Lieutenant-General at the head of the army , whose opinions on military questions affecting the // qwq // my detail to perform the duties of officer of the guard in camp , at a time when the arrival of the order from Washington officially transforming us from cadets to officers was daily expected . I began my tour at the usual hour in the morning , and everything passed off satisfactorily in connection with the discharge of my new responsibilities , until just at dusk I heard a commotion near the guard tents . Upon hastening to the scene of the disturbance , which by the way was at a considerable distance from the main camp , I found two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in blows . Quite a group of cadets , as friends and spectators , had formed about the two bellicose disputants . I had hardly time to take in the situation when the two principals of the group engaged in a regular setto , and began belaboring each other vigorously with their fists . Some of their more prudent friends rushed forward and attempted to separate the two contestants . My duty as officer of the guard was plain and simple . I should have arrested the two combatants and sent them to the guard tents for violating the peace and the regulations of the Academy . But the instincts of the boy prevailed over the obligation of the officer of the guard . I pushed my way through the surrounding line of cadets , dashed back those who were interfering in the struggle , and called out loudly , " Stand back , boys ; let 's have a fair fight . " I had occasion to remember , if not regret , the employment of these words . Scarcely had I uttered them when the crowd about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents . Casting about me to ascertain the cause of this sudden dispersion , I beheld approaching at a short distance two officers of the army , Lieutenants Hazen and Merrill ( now Major-General Hazen and Colonel Merrill of the Engineer Corps ) . I sought the tent of the officer of the guards promptly , but the mischief had been done . Lieutenant Hazen was the officer in charge on that particular day , whose duty it was to take cognizance of violations of the regulations . Summoning me to his presence , near the scene of the unfortunate disturbance , he asked me in stern tones if I was not the officer of the guard ; to which I of course responded in the affirmative . He then overwhelmed me by inquiring in the same unrelenting voice , " Why did you not suppress the riot which occurred here a few minutes ago ? " Now , it had never been suggested to me that the settlement of a personal difficulty between two boys , even by the administering of blows , could be considered or described as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tent of the commandant ( Lieutenant-Colonel John F. Reynolds , afterward General Reynolds , killed at Gettysburg ) . Of course no explanation could satisfy the requirements of military justice . I was ordered to return to my tent in arrest . The facts in the case were reported to Washington , on formal charges and specifications , and a court-martial asked for to determine the degree of my punishment . Within a few hours of my arrest the long-expected order came , relieving my class from further duty at West Point , and directing the members of it to proceed to Washington and report to the Adjutant-General of the Army for further orders . My name , however , did not appear in this list . I was to be detained to await the application of the commandant for a court-martial to sit on my case . The application received approval at the War Department , and a court was assembled at West Point , composed principally of officers who had recently arrived from Texas , where they served under General Twiggs , until his surrender to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Ben*t* now Brigadier-General and Chief of the Ordnance Corps . I was arralgued with all the solemnity and gravity which might be looked for in a trial for high treason , the specifi // cation setting forth in stereotyped phraseology that " He , the said cadet Ouster , did fail to suppress a riot or disturbance near the guard tent , and did , fail to separate , etc. , but , on the contrary , did cry out in a loud tone of voice , - Stand back , boys ; let 's have a fair fight , ' or words to that effect . " To which accusations the accused pleaded " Guilty , " as a matter of course , introducing as witnesses , by way of mitigation , the two cadets , the cause of my difficulty , to prove that neither was seriously injured in the fray . One of them is now a promising young captain in the Engineer Corps . The trial was brief , scarcely occupying more time than did the primary difficulty . I dreaded the long detention which I feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butthe subsequent action of the authorities at Washington to whom the case must by law be submitted . My classmates who had preceded me to Washington interested themselves earnestly in my behalf to secure my release from further arrest at West Point , and an order for me to join them at the national capital . Fortunately some of them had influential friends there , and it was but a few ilays after my trial that the superintendent of the Academy received a telegraphic order from Washington , directing him to release me at once , and order me to report to the AdjutantGeneral of the Army for duty . This order practically rendered the action and proceedings of the court-martial in my case nugatory . The record , I presume , was forwarded to the War Department , where it probably lies safely stowed away in some pigeonhole . What the proceeding of the court or their decision was , I have never learned . I left West Point on the 18th of July for Washington , delaying a few hours that afternoon on my arrival in : &amp;e# York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm of Horstmann 's , my lieutenant 's outfit of sabre , revolver , sash , spurs , etc . Taking the evening train for Washington , I found the cars crowded with troops , officers and men , hastening to the capital . At each station we passed on the road at which a halt was made , crowds of citizens were assembled provided bountifully with refreshments , which they distributed in the most lavish manner among the troops . Their enthusiasm knew no bounds ; they received us with cheers and cheered us in parting . It was no unusual sight , on leaving a station surrounded by these loyal people , to see matrons and maidens embracing and kissing with patriotic fervor the men , entire strangers to them , whom they saw hastening to the defence of the nation . Arriving at Washington soon after daylight , Saturday morning , the 20th of July , I made my way to the Ebbit House , where I expected to find some of my classmates domiciled . Among others whom I found there was Parker , appointed from Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point for years . He was one of the few members of my class who , while sympathizing with the South , had remained at the Academy long enough to graduate and secure a diploma . Proceeding to his room without going through the formality of announcing my arrival by sending up a card , I found him at that early hour still in bed . Briefly he responded to my anxious inquiry for news , that McDowell 's army was confronting Beauregard 's , and a general engagement was expected hourly . My next inquiry was as to his future plans and intentions , remembering his Southern sympathies . To this he replied by asking me to take from a table near by and read an official order to which he pointed . Upon opening the document referred to , I found it to be an order from the War Department dismissing from the rolls of the army Second Lieutenant James P. Parker , for having tendered his resignation in the face of the enemy . The names of two others of my classmates appeared in the same order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter have since sought and obtained commissions in the Egyptian army under the Khedive . After an hour or more spent in discussing the dark probabilities of the future as particularly affected by the clouds of impending war , I bade a fond farewell to my former friend and classmate , with whom I had lived on terms of closer intimacy and companionship than with any other being . We had eaten day by day at the same table , had struggled together in the effort to master the same problems of study ; we had marched by each other 's side year after year , elbow to elbow , when engaged in the duties of drill , parade , etc. , and had shared our blankets with each other when learning the requirements of camp life . Henceforth this was all to be thrust from our memory as far as possible , and our paths and aims in life were to run counter to each other in the future . We separated ; he to make his way , as he did immediately , to the seat of the Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion against the Government that had educated him , and that he had sworn to defend ; I to proceed to the office of the Adjutant-General of the Army and report for such duty as might be assigned me in the great work which was then dearest and uppermost in the mind of every loyal citizen of the country . It was not until after two o'clock in the morning that I obtained an audience with the Adjutant-General of the Army and reported to him formally for orders , as my instructions directed me to do . I was greatly impressed by the number of officials I saw and the numerous messengers to be seen flitting from room to room , bearing immense numbers of huge-looking envelopes . The entire department had an air of busy occupation which , taken in connection with the important military events then daily transpiring and hourly expected , and contrasted with the hum-drum life I had but lately led as a cadet , added to the bewilderment I naturally felt . Presenting my order of instructions to the officer who seemed to be in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to give some directions to a subordinate near by to write out an order assigning me to some duty , when , turning to me , he said , " Perhaps you would like to be presented to General Scott , Mr. Custer ? " To which of course I joyfully assented . I had often beheld the towering form of the venerable chieftain during his summer visits to West Point , but that was the extent of my personal acquaintance with him . So strict was the discipline at the Academy that the gulf which separated cadets from commissioned officers seemed greater in practice than that which separated enlisted men from them . Hence it was rare indeed that a cadet ever had an opportunity to address or be addressed by officers , and it was still more rare to be brought into personal conversation with an officer above the grade of lieutenant or captain ; if we except the superintendent of the Academy and the commandant of the corps of cadets . The sight of a general officer , let alone the privilege of speaking to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . In those days the title of general was not so familiar as to be encountered on every hotel register . Besides , the renown of a long lifetime gallantly spent in his country 's service had gradually but justly placed General Scott far above all contemporary chieftains in the admiration and hero worship of his fellow countrymen ; and in the youthful minds of the West Point cadets of those days Scott was looked up to as a leader whose military abilities were scarcely second to those of a Napoleon , and whose patriotism rivalled that of Washington . Following the lead of the officer to whom I had reported , I was conducted to the room in which General Scott received his official visitors . I found him seated at a table over which were spread maps and other documents which plainly showed their military character . In the room , and seated // near the table , were several members of Congress , of whom I remember Senator Grimes of Iowa . The topic of conversation was the approaching battle in which General McDowell 's forces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Congressmen the position , as shown by the map , of the contending armies . The AdjutantGeneral called General Scott 's attention to me by saying , " General , this is Lieutenant Custer of the Second Cavalry ; he has just reported from West Point , and I did not kno*V but that you might have some special orders to give him . " Looking at me a moment , the General shook me cordially by the hand , saying , " Well , myyoung friend , I am glad to welcome you to the service at this critical time . Our country has need of the strong arms of all her loyal sons in this emergency . " Then , turning to the Adjutant-General , he inquired to what company I had been assigned . " To Company G , Second Cavalry , now under Major Innes Palmer , with General McDowell , " was the reply . Then , addressing me , the General said , " We have had the assistance of quite a number of you youngmen from the Academy , drilling volunteers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you prefer to be ordered to report to **30;708;TOOLONG , or is your desire for something more active I " Although overwhelmed by such condescension upon the part of one so far superior in rank to any officer with whom I had been brought in immediate contact , I ventured to stammer out that I earnestly desired to be ordered to at once join my company , then with General McDowell , as I was anxious to see active service . " A very commendable resolution , young man , " was the reply ; then , turning to the Adjutant-General , he added , " Make out Lieutenant Custer 's orders directing him to proceed to his company at once " ; then , as if a different project had presented itself , he inquired of me if I had been able to provide myself with a mount for the field . I replied that I had not , but would set myself about doing so at once . " I fear you have a difficult task before you , because , if rumor is correct , every serviceable horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged by citizens who have gone or are going as spectators to witness the battle . I only hope Beauregard may capture some of them and teach them a lesson . However what I desire to say to you is , go and provide yourself with a horse if possible , and call here at seven o'clock this evening . I desire to send some dispatches to General McDowell , and you can be the bearer of them . You are not afraid of a night ride , are you ? " Exchanging salutations , I left the presence of the General-in-Chief , delighted at the prospect of being at once thrown into active service , perhaps participating in the great battle which every one there knew was on the eve of occurring ; but more than this my prideas a soldier was not a little heightened by the fact that almost upon my first entering the service I was to be the bearer of important official dispatches from the General-in-Chief to the General commanding the principal army in the field . I had yet a difficult task before me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery stables , but received almost the same answer from each , the substance of which was , that I was too late ; all the disposable horses had been let or engaged . I was almost in despair at the idea that I was not to be able to take advantage of the splendid opportunity for distinction opened before me , and was at * loss what to do , or to whom to apply for advice , when I met on Pennsylvania avenue a soldier in uniform , whom I at once recognized as one of the detachment formerly stationed at West Point , who left with those ordered suddenly to the defence of Washington at the time of Mr. Lincoln 's inauguration , when it was feared attempts would be made to assassinate the President elect . Glad to encounter any one I had ever seen before , I approached and asked him what he // was doing in Washington . He answered that he belonged to Griffin 's battery , which was then with McDowell 's forces at the front , and had returned to Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with him an extra horse left by the battery on its departure from the capital . Here then was my opportunity , and I at once availed myself of it . It was the intention of this man to set out on his return at once ; but at my earnest solicitation he consented to defer his departure until after seven o'clock , agreeing also to have the extra horse saddled and in readiness for me . Promptly at seven o'clock I reported at the Adjutant-General 's office , obtainedmy dispatches , and with no baggage or extra clothing to weight down my horse , save what I carried on my person , Irepaired to the point at which Iwas to find my horse and companion for the night . Upon arriving there I was both surprised and delighted to discover that the horse which accident seemed to have provided for me was a favorite one ridden by me often when learning the cavalry exercises at West Point . Those who were cadets just before the war will probably recall him to mind when I give the name , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossing Long bridge about nightfall , and taking the Fairfax C. H. road for Centreville , the hours of night flew quickly past , engrossed as my mind was with the excitement and serious novelty of the occasion as well as occasionally diverted by the conversation of my companion . I was particularly interested with his description , given as we rode in the silent darkness , of a skirmish which had taken place only two days before at Blackburn 's ford , between the forces of the enemy stationed there and a reconnoitring detachment sent from General McDowell 's army ; especially when I learned that my company had borne an honorable part in the affair . It was between two and three o'clock in the morning when we reached the army near Centreville . The men had already breakfasted , and many of the regiments had been formed in column in the roads ready to resume the march ; but owing to delays in starting , most of the men were lying on the ground , endeavoring to catch a few minutes more of sleep ; others were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled did I find the road with soldiers that it was with difficulty my horse could pick his way among the sleeping bodies without disturbing them . But for my companion I should have had considerable difficulty in finding my way to headquarters ; but he seemed familiar with the localities even in the darkness , and soon conducted me to a group of tents near which a large log fire was blazing , throwing a bright light over the entire scene for some distance around . As I approached , the sound of my horse 's hoofs brought an officer from one of the tents nearest to where I halted . Advancing toward me , he inquired who I wished to see . I informed him that I was bearer of dispatches from General Scott to General McDowell . " I will relieve you of them , " was his jeply ; but seeing me hesitate to deliver them , he added , " I am Major Wadsworth of General McDowell 's staff . " While Ihad hoped from ambitious pride to have an opportunity to deliver the dispatches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so placed the documents in Major Wadsworth 's hands , who took them to a tent a fewpaces distant , where , through its half-open folds , I saw him hand them to a large , portly officer , whom I at once rightly conceived to be General McDowell . Then , returning to where I still sat on my horse , Major Wadsworth ( afterward General Wadsworth ) asked of me the latest news in the capital , and when I replied that every person at Washington was looking to the army for news , he addcd , " Well , I guess thuy will not have to wait much longer . The entire army is under arms , and moving to attack the enemy to-day . " After inquiring at what // hour I left Washington , and remarking that I must be tired , Major Wadsworth asked me to dismount and have some breakfast , as it would be difficult to say when another opportunity would occur . I was very hungry , and rest would not have been unacceptable , but in my inexperience I partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer who gave the invitation , that hunger and fatigue were conditions of feeling which a soldier , especially a young one , should not acknowledge . Therefore , with an appetite almost craving . I declined the kind proffer of the Major . But when he suggested that I dismount and allow my horse to be fed I gladly assented . While Major Wadsworth was kindly interesting himself in the welfare of my horse , I had the good fortune to discover in an officer at headquarters one of my recent West Point friends , Lieutenant Kingsbury , aide-de-camp to General McDowell . He repeated the invitation just given by Major Wadsworth in regard to breakfast , but I did not have the perseverance to again refuse . Near the log fire already mentioned were some ser vants busily engaged in removing the remains of breakfast . A word from Kingsbury , and they soon prepared for me a cup of coffee , a steak , and some Virginia corn bread , to which I did ample justice . Had I known , however , that I was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty hours , I should have appreciated the opportunity I then enjoyed even more highly . As I sat on the ground sipping my coffee , and heartily enjoying my first breakfast in the field , Kingsbury ( afterward Colonel Kingsbury , killed at the battle of Antietam ) informed ma of the general movement then begun by the army , and of the attack which was to be made on Beauregard 's forces that day . Three days before I had . quitted school at West Point . I was about to witness the first grand strug. gle in open battle between the Uniom and secession armies ; a struggle in which , fortunately for the nation , the Union forces were to suffer defeat , while the cause for which they fought was to derive from it renewed strength and encouragement .
