FALSEHOOD IN THE DAILY PRESS . Br JAMES PARTON . IN the early days of journalism there was of necessity a very large ingredient in it of falsehood , because both writers and readers were ignorant and credulous . A London paragraphist of the year 1653 favored his readers with this item : " A perfect Mermaid was by the last great wind driven ashore near Greenwich , with her comb in one hand and her looking-glass in the other . She seemed to be of the countenance of a most fair and beautiful woman , with her arms crossed , weeping out many pearly drops of salt tears ; and afterward , she gently turning herself upon her back , swam away without being seen any more . " Probably the writer believed the substance of this paragraph , and only exercised his journalistic talent in decorating his fact with tender and romantic incidents . Men could believe any thing then , except the demonstrable truths of science . The writer of that mermaid item had seen from his childhood occasional advertisements in the gazettes announcing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scrofula by a toucla of his royal finger . Here is one of them , issued by command of Charles I. : " Whifehall , May 14,1644. - His Sacred Majisty having declared it to be his Royal will and purpose to continue the healing of his people for the Evil during the mouth of May , and then to give over till Michaelmas next , I am commanded to give notice thereof , that the people may not come up to town in the interim , and lose their labor . " What were mermaids and men-fish to this ? But Charles II . touched ninety-two thousund people for the king's-e*vil-twenty a day for his whole reign  --  and even poor Louis XVI. , at his coronation in 1774 , was so good as to touch twenty-four hundred . So , at least , Voltaire informed King Frederick . The word " touching " gives us a most inadequate idea of the deliberate solemnity of this ceremonial in the days of the Stuarts . Imagine the king seated in a chair of state upon his throne , under a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each surgeon leads his patients in turn to the foot of the throne , where they kneel , and while a chaplain in full canonicals intones the words , " He put his hands upon them and healed , *7 the king strokes their faces with both hands at once . When all have been thus " touched , " they come up to the throne again in the same order , and the king hangs about the neck of each by a blue ribbon a golden coin , while the chaplain chants , " This is the true Light who came into the world . " And the whole concludes with the reading of the epistle for the day and prayers for the sick . Such was the credulity of our ancestors of yesterday ! Such was the public which the press addressed in the first century of its existence ! In the early time , too , it was a thing of most imminent and deadly peril to have to do with printer 's ink . In the reign of the same Charles a respectable father of a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down while still alive , disemboweled , beheaded , and quartered , for merely printing a // piece disagreeable to the royalists . Editors took the hint . The great fire of London , which swept over four hundred and thirtysix acres , was chronicled iu two short paragraphs , but the narrator devoted several lines of the same in assigning the glory of putting out the fire to the king , and to his brother , who was to be king . Amidst the hush of all thoughtful England a deed was done in the same reign which the timorous journalism of the time recorded thus : " This day Aigernon Sidney , Esq. , was brought from the Tower to the place appointed for his execution on Tower Hill , where he was beheaded on a scaffold erected for the purpose . " No details , no comments . The monarchy , which was not strong enough to bear the simplest true narrative of . heroic Sidney 's murder , was strong enough to disembowel a printer and set up his head over Temple Bar . It were vaiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost the writer his estate , the printer his entrails , and the carrier his ears . And long after the brutal Stuarts had fled from the kingdom which they had polluted , editors were denied access to the sources of important news , while remaining always subject to the iron necessity of being interesting . Hence writers for the press resorted to inventions more or less innocent . Defoe would never have wrttten fictitious accounts of the London fire and the great plague if the newspapers had supplied true ones ; and Benjamin Franklin would not have amused the readers of the Pennsylvania Gazette with the " Speech of Polly Baker " if winds and tides had not retarded vessels bringing later news fromover the sea . " To amuse our customers , * ' Franklin once said , " I used to fill up our vacant columns with anecdotes and fables and fancies of my own . " But , like Defoe , he gave his fables and fancies such an air of truth as to deceive . The Abb6 Raynal quoted " Polly Baker " in his History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened justice of Massachusetts courts ; and as to Franklin 's descriptive catalogue of the packages of scalps taken by the Brit*ish Indians during the Revolutionary war , it was done with such particularity and naturalness that to-day it will deceive nine readers in ten who do not know the secret . So , in our own day , the first letter in the Cleveland Plaindealer that was signed " Artemus Ward " was accepted as the genuine epistle of a coming moral showman . The " local " editor in a quiet interior city often finds himself in the situation of a writer for the press in the infancy of the art . Journalism deals in the extraordinary , but nothing extraordinary has happened . Not the less -- nay , all the more-is his public hungry for local news ; and if he permits his readers to suffer the pangs of inanition , it is either because he is less or more than editor . And here we have the origin of that new school of " American humor " which for ten years past has enlivened the newspapers of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Franklin began it a hundred and forty years ago , between arrivals of ships , in the P nsylvania Gazette ; wherein , besides such tales as " Polly Baker , " lie would write fictitious letters to himself ( the editor ) , and in following numbers insert fictitious and comic replies . Artemus Ward only gave the practice a new impulse and a wider celebrity through the happiness of his conception of the moral showman , and the remarkable fertility of resource which lie displayed in carrying it out . There are now afloat in the newspapers many thousands of amusing tlree-line fictions which lia4 no other origin than the invention of a local itemizer , within whose sphere of observation nothing unusual had happened . What we to-day think of as journalism began when young Samuel Johnson first composed Parliamentary speeches for *2ave 's Magazine , in 1740 , which is equivalent to saying that it began in systematic falsehood . Johnson avowed the fact a few years later at Foote 's table , and avowed it with a feeling that seemed nearer akin to exultation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt , being highly commended , one of the guests took down the magazine and read it aloud . When the company had given full vent to their admiration , Johnson , who had saf silent during the scene , startled them all by saying , " That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeter Street . " Responding to their amazement , he explained : " I never was in the gallery of the House of Commons but once in my life . Cave had interest with the door-keepers . He and the persons employed under him hind admittance . They brought away the subject of discussion , the names of the speakers , the side they took , and the order in which they rose , together with notes of the various arguments adduced in the course of debate . The whole was afterward communicated to me , and I composed the speeches in the form they now have . " Here , perhaps , we have the origin of Dr. Johnson 's aversion to newspapers ; for we all abhor our sins when another commits them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an embassador may be defined as a person who lies abroad for his country 's good , an editor is one who lies at home for his own . It was in Johnson 's day , too , that ministers began to think writers for the press worth buying ; and curious it is to note the vast difference between the emoluments of corruption and the wages of honesty . It is so in the politics of the present time . In the good old times when George III . was a young king there were still newspapers that bought items at sixpence a dozen . Journalism was a vagabond , and had been a vaga // bond always . " All Grub Street is dead and gone , " wrote Swift , when the first half-penny stamp was imposed . " No more ghosts or murders for love or money . " Almost within the memory of living persons Lamb supplied amusing paragraphs at sixpence each ; Campbell received two guineas for a poem in the poet 's corner of a newspaper ; Hazlitt wrote criticism that is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Burns refused an engagement upon the Morning Post at a guinea a week . That Burns should decline this offer appeared to the proprietor a piece of " insolence . " This proprietor was the individual who once said to a writer , " I wish I had you in a garret without a coat to your back , as I once had Coleridge . " But Coleridge did not enjoy the situation , in which , how ever , he expended his best years , his manhood 's prime , and all that we now like to think of in connection with his name . But it was during that long reign of bigotry and ignorance that a single article of fulsome flattery of the king or reckless defense of the Prince of Wales could get a rake a rich living in the church , and when a pamphlet was often rewarded with a valuable place or liberal pension . A pleasant thing it was , and a comfortable , to be an English editor during the American Revolution , if you were discerning enough to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal of the Tory papers betrays their imperfect sincerity . An extra of 1777 , which chronicled the retreat of General Washington from the Harlem River , flamed with extravagant headings denouncing " the most wicked , darincr and unnatural rebellion that ever disgraced the annals of history , fomented and abetted by a junto of republicans on this side of the Atlantic . " The exultant editor appended a little lying go*-sip to his news : " Mr. Washington , notwithstanding his amour with Mrs. Gibbons , is , we hear , married to a very amiable lady , but , it is said , Mrs. Washington , being a warm loyalist , has been separated from the General since the commencement of the present troubles , and lives very much respected in the city of New York . " Thus early in the life of journalism began the exploits of those twin calumniators , " It is 8aid " and " They say . " They have worn various disguises since , only to become more mischievous . " It is perfectly notorious ; " " It was stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one here doubts ; " " At first we were inclined to question the story , hut we have had it from so many sources that really ; " " This is only the gossip of the street , but where there is so much smoke " - are only variations of the old familiar " They 8ay , " which in the most ancient known languages played precisely the same part it does in ours . Journalism had no chance in the early day , and its sins are not to be laid at its own door . It was not until within the meniory of living men that Defoe 's famous utterance ceased to be strictly applicable to the case of writers for the press : " If a writer tells the crimes of great men , they fall upon him with the iron hands of the law ; if he tells their virtues , when they have any , then the mob attacks him with slander . But if he regards truth , let him expect martyrdom on both sides . " I am not sure that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one to-day presume to defend in public any of the persons whom a considerable number of writers for the press regard in the light of established targets for vituperation , he will be likely to become a target himself . Mr. G.W. Curtis , in the columii*s of Harper 's Weekly , ventured a few months ago to defend a Senator from an accusation . He was promptly warned off the premises : " If Mr. Curtis keeps this up , he will be suspected of being an accomplice . " Until the development of the telegraph had completed the resources of the daily press , the mere tumult of haste in which the vital part of its work was done was the cause of numberless errors . The exploits of the special - express riders thirty years ago were wonderful indeed ; but what they gained in time the ne*vspaper often lost in correctness . A trifling accident would delay a rider long enough to deprive the editor of the most momentary opportunity of revision . In a file of the New York T*ibune of 1841 we rend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who used to accomplish the distance between New Haven and New York , seventy-four miles , iu four hours and a half . This was creditable enterprise , but the system kept an editorial corps in a whirl of excitement , and accustomed writers to headlong haste . The news was written as fast as the pen could be driven over the paper , and in many instances editorial comments were executed not less rapidly . I have heard the late Horace Greeley say that , in the earlier years of the Tribune , he thought nothing of writing a column in an hour , and that often he had kept on at this furious rate so long that he was obliged at last to wind a wet bandage round his arm to reduce the swelling and the ache to the bearable point . His excitement at the reception of news by special express is inconceivable by those who never witnessed it . Mr. Augustus Maverick has recorded the events of an evening when one of the primitive locomotives brought to New York special election returns from Patchogue , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cry of joy which the enthusiastic editor uttered when he saw the returns " might have been heard a quarter of a mile . " But the necessity for this tumultuous and exciting haste has ceased to exist . The an- // qwq lug the simple truth is the hardest thing done either by tongue or pen . How easy it was to represent Napoleon Bonaparte galloping over the Alps on a robnst charger , gorgeously caparisoned , his cloak flying in the breeze , and compact legions pressing up the steep acclivity ! This lie was imagined in a moment ; but it cost M. Thiers much painful toil and long travel to ascertain that his conqueror crossed the Alps on a mule , muftle ( l to the eyes in his cloak , and attended by one guide on foot . In the press , as in literature , falsehood has the additional advantage over truth of being much the less expensive . Your raw hand will bring you in an account of a finance meeting which shall be of necessity a mere tissue of misconceptions und @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred , without verbatim reports , you must send three persons of trained intelligence ; but a full and exact report , with the requisite descriptive matter , demands the intense labor of twelve trained men . Now the account stands thus : tissue of green falsehood , two dollars ; vivid narrative strongly resembling the truth , thirty dollars ; verbatim report , eighty dollars . In every department of a newspaper , from the most commonplace reporting to the most important criticism , we find that lies are very cheap and truth is very dear . We must also bear in mind that if lying is easy , it may also be for the moment highly effective . That tawdry falsehood of Bonaparte bounding over the mountains adorns at this hour hundreds of barber shops in all countries , as the tale , equally groundless , of Lincoln and the Scotch cap figures in many histories of the late war . Some men of very ordinary abilities do succeed , after long practice , in purging their conversation of the usual exaggerations and credulities ; but . even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased by the loss of vivacity . Their conversation is as dull as it is correct . But the journalist lies under an inexorable necessity of not being dull . Incorrect he may be , to a certain extent , and live ; but if he is dull , he dies . And , unhappily , there are three ways open to the journalist of avoiding dullness ; two wrong , and one right . The right way is vigilance , tact , and hard labor in the gathering and utterance of truth proper to be told . The two wrong ways demand vastly inferior powers . One is the invention or repetition of falsehood , and the other the revelation of matters not proper to be told . A fertile and sympathetic mind , capable of l ) ublic spirit , finds the material for stirring and delightful journalism in a village ; but there are dull dogs that , even when posted in Washington , the most interesting capital in the world , are compelled to eke out their daily dole of routine by calumnious inven tion . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exploits of some of those young gentlemen who are dispatched every summer to write Saratoga letters  --  a task demanding knowledge of the world , knowledge of human nature , a very extensive knowledge of America , and a nuind capable of discriminating between what may and what may not be printed . Bewildered by the pageant , not kno*ving a soul in the place , having access to no circle , they soon exhaust the reputable topics , and have no resource but to dilate upon the imaginary splendors of a gambling-house . Most readers , as Mr. Ruling remarks , know nothing whatever of this branch of industry , and hence a writer is safe in giving free play to his inventive powers . " I must send something , " says the young journalist , " that something must go to-day , and it must be interesting . " We must all allow that here is sore temptation to a young man of the best intentions , unless he has an exceptionally endowed mind . It is far from an ordinary intellect to feel the superior interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther from his inclination to take the prodigious amount of trouble which the presentation of truth compels . Hazlitt , who lived in the iron age of journalism , used to lay the blame of newspaper falsehoods to the Editor , who was then a mysterious and awful being , despotic and capricious . He had his satellites , his court , his favorites , who flattered his whims amid intrigued for his favor . A sensitive and brilliant writer like Hazlitt had no rights which this dull potentate felt himself bound to respect . He erased the contributor 's happy epithets , and converted his strongest passages into prudent inanity . " There are editors , " said Hazlitt , " who , if you insert the name of a popular actor , strike it out , and in virtue of their authority insert a favorite of their own-as a dextrons attorney substitutes the name of a friend in a will . " Some editors , he adds , will let you praise nobody , others will let you blame nobody . Some dine with lords , and scrutinize every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of invitations . " An editor , " he continues , " takes a turn in St. James 's Street , and is congratulated by the successive literary or political groups on all lie does not write and when the mistake is found out , the true Simon Pure is dismissed . " Editors are still human ; but it is safe to say that no Hazhitt of the present time could be subjected to such treatment as this . A potentate has taken the place of the capriciomis editor in *oune newspaper offices , wlmo may be styled the Incongruous Proprietor . The time was when almost every editor owned his paper . The time is at hand when scarcely any editor will do so ; for a complete newspaper establishment at present absorbs an amount of capital which a high- // ly intellectualized person has never possessed unless by accident or inheritance , and which he could not efficiently wield if he had it . In conducting the prodigious establishments of modern days , there must be a division both of labor and responsibility ; and when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and efficiency never possible before . No body of learned men could produce such a work as the American Gyclopo*dia unless they had behind them both the capital and the business talent of a great publishing house ; and no newspaper up to the demands of this age can exist unless there is a great man in the counting-room , as well as a great man in the editorial chair , each keeping to his sphere , but working in harmony , neither of them wholly subjeut or wholly lord . It takes time , however , to get these huge things in running order , and meanwhile there is frequent dislocation . We occasionally see an odd reversal of what would seem to be the natural order : the capitalist every thing , the writer nothing ; the countingroom commanding , the editorial rooms obeying . It is not yet so clearly seen as it will be that neither of these two centres of force can work successfully an engine which is at once a complicated business and an in - tellectual influence . By the chances of business the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one may fall by inheritance to the most incompetent individual . A lucky operator has taken a newspaper , or part of one , for a gambling debt . A corrupt Ring might acquire in a newspaper a silencing interest ; and a moneyed dunderhead has occasionally bought one outright as an investment . John Taylor , the witty author of Mon8ieur Tonson , one of the best-known humorous poems in the language , who was editor for some years of the Morning Po8t of London , had an ignorant savage for proprietor . " Among other complaints , " Mr. Taylor records in his Memoirs , " he told me that the paper was wholly confined to politics , and had none of those little antidotes which had before diverted the readers . " It has lately been disclosed that the owner of another London paper , the Morning Chronicle , " made an arrangement with the government of Louis Napoleon to become the strenuous and daily supporter of the imperial re'gime , " the French government agreeing to give in return a " concession " for a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . So says Mr. James Grant , to whom this high-spirited individual twice offered the editorship . I wonder how the proprietor announced the new line of politics to his corps of writers . Not , we may presume , with the off-hand candor which sometimes marks similar events in free-and-easy America . " Boys , " said the proprietor of a newspaper in Western New York to his corps , as he pre sented a stranger to them- " boys , this is Mr. Smith from Smithton , who has come down here to write up the new railroad . Whatever he writes , print just as he writes it , but not a word on the other side . " And they obeyed . Every mail brought remon* strances against the scheme , all of which went into the basket unread . The convict Tweed was well aware of this new fact in newspapers , the supremacy of the counting-room , though the poor man could not know that newspapers unduly controlled by the counting-room are powerless over public opinion . The number of newspapers upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so depended upon this plunder for subsistence that when the Ring was broken they gasped and died . In those halcyon days of roguery people used to glance in their morning paper over a mayor 's message of six or eight columns , innocently supposing it part of the news of the day , while book-keepers were at the same moment charging it to the city as an advertisement at a dollar a line . Petty evening papers received a thousand dollars a month ; and after the newspapers had been bought and silenced at this rate for five years , and the Ring had no longer the control of the treasury , the unsettled " claims " of the various counting-rooms amounted to more than two millions of dollars . The writers for the press got little of this . They were put off with a ridiculous gratuity of two hundred dollars a year , voted by the aldermen to the reporters who omit-ted twice a week to tell the public what the aldermen had done . There never was a period during the thirty years ' reign of thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have brought them to naught , if its counting-rooms had been disinterested or its editors in command . I wish it could be said that an interested counting-room is the only disturbing influence in the daily press , because in that case the remedy would not be difficult . The body of working journalists , in which there is a great mass of ability and force , could control the situation if they husbanded their strength and stood by one another . The men and women who produce the material of which newspapers are made are surely among the most important members of a free state . The most obscure paragraphist in the most remote and insignificant village of the Rocky Mountain States may drop into the tide of journalism an item which shall do good or do mischief wherever the English language is spoken , and remain afloat in newspapers for generations , always working beneficially or injuriously upon the minds of men . Their antipathies and preferences , their opinions and principles , mould or tinge every thing they write , and constantly enter into that atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to which all but the dullest and the strongest minds are subject . And it often falls to them to decide what shall appear , what shall be omitted , what shall be prominent , and what obscure . By indulging a personal preference , seizing every chance to insert a favorite name , they can create renown ; and by being on the watch to erase allusion to persons they dislike , they can keep them long in the shade . There is mighty power wielded in merely leaving things out . And though a writer may have his task distinctly assigned him , he can not but infuse a portion of his personality into every sentence that he pens . If he is a man of honor and public spirit , those qualities tell in every line ; if he is frivolous and dissolute , all that he does is low , small , or false . Until within a few years past our colleges and higher schools did not contribute their fair proportion to the ranks of this difficult profession . Mr. Greeley seemed prejudiced against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , of course , a student has much to unlearn , as well as much to learn , before he can efficiently fill the easiest place upon the staff of a daily paper . But the graduate of ' a college usually has qualities that come into play advantageously when , after practice , he has acquired the rudhuents of his profession . He is apt to have character and a sense of responsibility , to say nothing of the knowledge which he acquired at college , and which has its value even in the lowest grade of reporting . Of late the newspaper offices have been oftener recruited than formerly by young graduates , to the manifest improvement of the service . But there is still a residuum of the original vagabond element in some departments of journalism , which leads to egregious falsehood , often reckless , sometimes intentional . One example will suffice to show . how important it is to intrust the lowest duties of journalism to persons who respect themselves and the public . There was a poor Italian to be executed a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban towns-Morristown , New Jersey . Never was a quiet and decorous village more astounded than Morristown was on this occasion with the conduct of the representatives of the New York press . The first to appear on the scene was the artist of the Graphic , who arrived two or three days before the execution , and employed himself in making drawings of the various objects to which the execution would impart a momentary interest . He took no part in the scenes about to be described . During the afternoon before the event reporters kept coming by every train , until they numbered fifteen , including the representative of the Associated Press . Early in the evening the whole body strolled from their hotel to the jail , the morning paper men to get the material for immediate telegrams , and the evening paper men to procure the means of beginning the minute narrations which they expected to finish in the cars the next day in time for second editions . But , to their disappointment and disgust , they discovered that the worthy sheriff of the county had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exigencies of a band of enterprising reporters . I-Ic would not permit the prisoner to be interviewed . No admittance to the jail till to-morrow morning . The young gentlemen condemned the sheriff both on an ascending and descending plane ; but as hard words do not break locks , they remained outside . There was now a company of reporters in a country place , with an evening before them all their own . No one acquainted with newspapers needs to be informed how some of them spent that evening . One of the oldest members of the New York press divides his brethren with regard to their drinking habits into several classes . One-third he calls hard drinkers , men who are always under alcoholic influence , and often get drunk . One-third drink too much , but rarely exceed their allowance , and are seldom intoxicated . Some of this class go upon a reckless debauch occasionally , and afterward drink nothing for a considerable period . Of the remaining third a very few are teetotalers on principle , a few are teetotalers because they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely small number ( about onetwelfth of the whole ) drink a little wine or malt-liquor daily , but never to help them out with their work . In short , several of this gallant band of reporters , as soon as they found that nothing could be done in the way of business that evening , began a carouse , which lasted till past midnight , and some of them , it is supposed , kept it up till daylight . Drinking is the blight and bane of the literary class in all countries . More than two of the brightest lights literature has known during the last twenty years as truly died from the effects of alcohol as Edgar Poe did , who was picked up insensible in the streets after a wild drink of many hours ' duration . But of all the men who live by writing , it is journalists to whom alcohol is most deadly . Other men are lowered and perverted by drink , but to journalists it is ruin and death . Some men , it is true , of iron constitutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions to lower , and finally wander from office to office offer lug with palsied hand their manuscript to editors who were once their assistants and inferiors , and are still young enough to be their sons . But to most young men in the press who drink freely the practice is death within seven years . The shore is // strewn with the bodies of promising youths , who came to the city furnished only with the unscientific , baby morality with which so many children are sickened , and thought it a fine thing to be called Bohemians , and to end a hard night 's work with , a deadly supper in a cellar . They did not suspect that it was only a low and mean kind of suicide until they had lost the power to withdraw . Alcohol , among other pernicious effects , renders the mind inexact , disposed to exaggerate , and reckless of the consequences of what it utters . Watch a man who is going down this steep decline to ruin , and yon will observe , as one of the symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a growing insensibility to the claims of truth , and a growing inability to discern truth . The Coming Journalist will not , if only for reasons of policy , have a writer in his corps who is not temperate ; and in this climate , in that profession , there is only one man who is safely temperate : it is the teetotaler . Such a night as those reporters passed in rural Morristown was the proper prelude to their next morning 's exploits . Their behavior was , indeed , a marvel to the inhabitants ; for in a country town they do not hang a man oftener than once in a generation or two , and the people in their simplicity supposed that the deliberate putting to death of a human being was an event that had in it an element of seriousness . A certain solemnity hung over the town . The children went to bed hushed and timorous . But to these carousing reporters the affair was merely a country hanging , which they regarded very much as medical students do the arrival of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-four dollars out of one little murder , " I heard a perfectly respectable and worthy reporter say , with an amazing sincerity of nonchalance . Occasionally there would circulate a report that the jail was open , or that some one had come from the cell , and then the whole body would plunge headlong into the street , and go off roaring to the gate , only to return and drink anew , and curse an imbecile sheritl an obstinate warden , and a rustic county , insensible to the importance of gentlemen representing the Metropolitan Press . Soon after the dawn of day they began to assemble at the jail and knock for admittance . The warden came to the door , evidently impressed with the gravity of the occasion , and moved with the scene passing within . He spoke politely to the clamorous crowd . He told them that the man was awake , but engaged with the priest and the Sisters of Charity , and must not be disturbed . They demanded to be at least admitted into the jail . This , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff to admit no one until nine o'clock . More reporters kept coming up , and every few minutes some of them would give thundering knocks at the door , at which the warden would re-appear , and repeat his explanation . They argued , threatened , stormed , and swore , with a defiance of decency of which young men at 6 A.M. demoralized by alcohol alone are capable . Next they trooped off to the abode of the sheriff , a gentleman of staid respectable character , who had been for weeks dreading the duty of that day , but had nerved himself tip to perform it with decorum and every humane precaution . Of him the infuriate band made a new demand . They wanted the man executed at ten o'clock instead of eleven , so that they could catch the train at half past eleven . " In New Jersey , " replied the sheriff , " we do not hang people to suit the convenience of reporters . " On leaving the sheriff 's house they held an informal " indignation meeting , " at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the sheriff fits . " The execution occurred soon after the appointed hour , and it was managed with so much forethought and skill that the man died almost immediately , and apparently without pain . Nothing marked the execution , except the extraordinary suddenness and painlessness of the prisoner 's death ; and this fact was noted in the report of the attending physicians , in that of the Associated Press , in that of the Herald , and in several of the New Jersey papers . But it was not so reported by the festive youths who had vowed to give the sheriff " fits . " Here are some of the " fits " they gave him : " An officer knocked the soap-box from under the convict ... . For seven and a half minutes did the wretch suffer the horrors of asphyxia , for the knot had slipped under the chin , and the neck was not broken . " " The knot had been arranged in the most bungling manner .... Of course the wretched criminal was strangled to death . For seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to the bungling manner of conducting the execution . " " The knot had been arranged in a most bungling manner , and shifted to a position beneath the chin of the dying man . Of course the wretched criminal was strangled to death . " " Owing to a bungling arrangement of the knot , which the sheriff was advised in whispers several times to adjust , it slipped almost under his chin , and the wretched man began those repulsive struggles of agony which are shocking to behold . " " The haste and bungling made the execution seem almost like butchery . " " At the last moment the rope was found to be too short , and a box having been brought and stood on end , the culprit , an Italian , only twenty-four years of age , half crazed with excitement , leaped upon it , while the noose was attached by a series of jerks that finally caused the knot to slip around under his chin , so strangling him instead of breaking the neck . " None of these statements has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no series of jerks , no excessive excitement , no slipping of the knot , no seven // minutes of anguish . These interesting I ) articulars were merely the threatened " fits " - the preconcerted vengeauee of reporters who could not have their hanging adjusted to the time-table of the railroad . One of the reporters , who did not show any haste to get away after the execution , explained his indifference by remarking that he had telegraphed his account half an hour before the criminal left his cell . He did not however omit to mention the sheriff 's " bungling " and tho prisoner 's " seveu minutes " ' needless agony . Such are the possibilities of falsehood and of riotous indecency to brains weakened and crazed by the fumes of alcohol ! In all the press there is no disturbing influence like the whisky in the brains of journalists . A thing which strikes an observer of the press with most surprise is the little knowledge which its conductors have of the human mind and of the arts by which good work can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editor of a great newspaper should have little to do but acquire that knowledge and practice those arts . The successive John Walters who have conducted the London Times for nearly a century iippear to have been the only men in the profession , until recently , who knew that the secret of great journalism lay in the gradual formation of a great corps by treating men with justice and consideration . It appears that they adopted the system seventy years ago of never paying the " market price " for a kind of work so exceptional and , I may add , so unnatural as writing , but made it a rule to pay more than others , and more than the writer would himself demand . Abundant honor also awaits the performance of excellent work , as well as the needful pause and retreat after extraordinary exertions . It is always thus that men who are horn to coin- ' mand treat the persons whom they select to execute their plans . The consequence is that the Times , though not exempt from the liability to error which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all changes , the first of European newspapers . There are other journals on both sides of the Atlantic which have the will to employ the system of the Times , but few have the power ; and so vast is the revenue required to sustain a really superior newspaper that , perhaps , there can never be more than two or three in any country possessing an income entirely and always adequate . Are there five now existing in the world ? Probably not more than five . The suppression of half our daily papers would greatly advance the art of journalism in the United States . Five , six , seven daily papers in a city of less than a hundred thousand inhabitants ! Some of these have a corps consisting of one individual ; and where there are three persons employed , the paper feels itself entitled to some rank in the world of journali*n . One consequence is that two-thirds of all the working journalists in the country receive less than the wages of good mechanics ; and another consequence is that the daily press , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daily miracle of calumnious inanity . Falsehood aud folly in daily papers are , Irepeat , not so much an evidence of depravity as of poverty . Intelligence and character are costly ; frivolity and recklessness are cheap . The incessant abuse of individuals is one of the few reaources of an empty mind . It can not discuss principles ; it can not communicate knowledge ; it can not enliven by wit and good humor : nothing remains to it but to assail character . And even where the decorums of the press are strictly observed , we find in the columns of newspapers which are struggling for life amazing exhibitions of helpless ignorance . The nauseating trail of fifteen dollars a week is seen all over them , a sign of that agonizing contest for existence which goes on wherever ten are trying to subsist upon means insufficient for five . And really , when I look down the long pay-roll of a complete newspaper establishment , I am inclined to wonder that such a large niimher of daily papers acquit themselves creditably without being able to afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , where alone in the United States newspaper offices exist in which poor-devilism has been extirpated , the editorial force of a daily paper , fully equipped , consists of about fifty individuals , of whom at least twelve receive compensation which approaches that of the lower grades of the other liberal professions . The press has advanced so far in this one city of the Western continent that a competent and well-trained journalist receives as large a compensation as a lawyer , doctor , or clergyman of the fourth rank , and nearly enough to pay the rent of a small house in a second-rate neighborhood . This is a considerable advance from the time when Horace Greeley let Mr. Raymond leave the Tribune rather than add five dollars to his weekly stipend of twenty . The editor-in-chief of a New York daily paper of the first rank receives from four to eight thousand dollars a year , with the assistance of a short-hand reporter , and the use of a cab . His leading assistants receive about half as much . In London , as Mr. James Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morning paper-always excepting the princely Times - is a thousand guineas a year . There is not likely to be for some time to come more than one newspaper in any country that can safely go much beyond this scale of compensation . And , indeed , it is almost high enough to admit of the gradual formation // of a corps capable of holding its own against the dense swarm of lies always struggling or scheming for admittance into the press . In every service under the sun the rank and file must of necessity work hard for little pay . It is only necessary to have a few great prizes to stimulate the whole body by rewarding the excellent few . Let us by all means be just to this most difficult , most exacting , and least developed of all the liberal professions , for we all have an interest in its honor and in its prosperity . The press can not long be much better or much worse than the people to whom it ministers ; and he must be blind indeed , or of most defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country has signally improved in all leading particulars during the lasI thirty years . The mere fact that a daily newspaper is the result of fifty men 's work serves to show how many apertures there are by which errors both of fact and judgment can find their way into it . And each of the members of an editorial corps is an imperfect human being , using an imperfect medium of communication , and having also his special credulities , prejudices , vanities , ambitions , timidities , sympathies , antipathies , grudges , animosities , friendships , and alliances , all more or less misleading . Some men are naturally credulous of evil , others of good . Some able and worthy journalists are cursed with a bad temper ; and there may be members of the press who , as Mr. Disraeli insinuates , look with jaundiced eyes upon the victor in fields where themselves have suffered defeat . There are minds , too , which seem loosely constructed , and have little intuitive sense of probability . The latest historian of the English press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he tells us , the Morning Chronicle of London for twenty years upon a salary of a thousand guineas , possesses a mind of this description . In his chapter upon the American press he pauses to explain the marvelous growth of Chicago , which he attributes to the easy divorce laws of Illinois . " Persons , " he says , " whether men or women , intending to get rid of their wives or husbands flock to it from all parts of the United States . " This accounts at once for the increase of population and the great number of newspapers published : for " almost every husband and wife in Chicago takes in every paper published in the town , lest the husband should unknown to her have made the declaration necessary to get rid of her , or she secretly have given it to get rid of her husband . " Imagine 8uch a Mrs. Partington sweeping out the torrent of falsehood that comes rushing into a daily newspaper ! He also records that " five-sixths " of our newspapers are sold in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do shipping intelligence , and that an American editor in some parts of the country has less chance of escaping assassination than an officer in the late war had to escape death in the field . There is a mind to control a newspaper ! There are also natural liars , inventors of falsehood , as there are kleptomaniacs . Here and there in the press , as out of it , there are persons like the actress Rachel , of whom her brother reports : " If she liked people , she imagined and related a thousand agreeable anecdotes about them ; and if she hated them , she invented any number of enormities to illustrate their evil qualities . " Others there are who believe falsehood easily , and repeat without thought any tale they chance to hear . During the period when Mr. Williams was a candidate for the place of Chief Justice , probably as many as five thousand paragraphs were printed reflecting upon his character and abilities , of which it is doubtful if five were the expression of real knowledge of the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select few of our race never join in a hue and cry because it is a hue and cry , a very large number are only too willing to do so . And what easier way is there to hide our ignorance , and give our readers the impression that we know the inside truth of things , than to borrow a sneering paragraph , give it a sharper sting , and send it forth to make the unskillful laugh and its unseen victim writhe ? The journalistic triumphs that have been won by the exposure of corruption will not be an unmixed blessing if they give newspapers too strong a bias toward such exploits . The great f*ame of Junius , too , is a misleading circumstance . Junius was not a well-informed person in politics ; his sounding denunciations of public men , whose motives we now know that he misinterpreted , have given a sort of license to anonymous writers to abuse any man if only he is so unfortunate as to hold a public office . And unhappily events have occurred which incline the people to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls and bears in politics as well as in Wall Street-people whose party feelings dispose them to believe or to disbelieve evil of present holders of power . At this moment , as all readers know , the bear interest is powerful in the press , and it is not weak among the press 's readers . It is evident that multitudes enjoy their morning villain . The very easy rOle of Cry-aloudand-spare-not appears to be almost as popular as it is easy ; for let a newspaper publish a slashing leader assailing some anxious drudge in a Washington bureau , no matter how false the charge , how cruel the calumny , a dozen subscribers will send in letters applauding the heroic exposure of " men in high places . " The editor hears little of the indignation which his vague censure excites // in considerate minds , and knows nothing of the wide-spread sorrow that this daily outcry of wolf ! wolf ! should render the press so little able to raise an effective alarm when at last a wolf is in the fold . What government but the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure enough to stand the fire of indiscriminate vituperation to which it has been of late subjected ? Our daily bears have really terrified innocent readers beyond measure . They call to mind Daniel Webster 's humorous remark upon the crowds of excited people that came to Washington to witness the inauguration of Andrew Jackson : " People have come five hundred miles to see General Jackson , and they really seem to think that the country is rescued from some dreadful danger ! " It would be amusing now , if it were not significant of possible peril in the future , to observe the embarrassment of a worthy citizen who finds himself for the first time in Washington . lie has been reading for years of the appalling state of things in that metropolis of shabby boarding-houses , one-horse cars , and impecunious clerks longing for pay-day . He has been informed by his daily bear that in that centre and focus of pollution he might see " families of secretaries and other high officers of state riding about in bretts and landaus purchased with the contingent fund ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and the only brett with whom he bad any previous acquaintance was Bret Harte . A vague horror filled his soul upon reading of these mysterious vehicles paid for out of a fund not less mysterious . " Here , " continued his much-trusted daily , " is the engraving bureau of the Treasury Department turning out bushels of visiting-cards for the ladies and gentlemen of the court . Here are perquisites and allowances to the value of *5O , OOO a year going to the White House , and pickings and stealings of every kind in the inferior departments of the government . The footman who waits on you when you dine with Mr. Secretary So-and-So is paid by the United States as an extra clerk . ' The coachman who drives the secretary 's wife when she shops or visits draws his pay from the department as a laborer ' or a fireman , ' and the gardener 's name appears , perhaps , on the rolls as a messenger . ' " This is terrible indeed . Our innocent friend goes forth from Willard 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that foretell the downfall of his beloved country . He does not find them . If lie visits the departments , he can discover nothing but a large number of busy clerks , male and female , moderately paid , who work from nine to four , and go home to boardinghouses that do not , at the first glance , seem sumptuous or inviting . There does not ap pear to be any card-printing going on . At the Capitol he finds three hundred gentlemen who , to the finite mind of persons not connected with the bear interest seem tobe diligently and honestly employed in serving their country . He may succeed in discovering what a brett is , and also a landau , but he must look long before he catches a " high officer of the government " in one . The only thing he can find in Washington that gives color to the statements I have quoted is that several correspondents of newspapers eke out their slender incomes by serving as secretaries to Congressional committees . Shall I ever forget the long breath of relief I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' vigilant search for the iniquities of which I had read so much , I cried out , in despair , to the genial and veteran " Perley , " " Where is the Lobby of which the papers tell us such dreadful things 7 " " The Lobby ! " he replied , with a twinkle in his eye , and a smile upon the rest of his face ; " the Lobby is a gigantic myth ! " OLir innocent wanderer returns to his native haunts , not satisfied , indeed , with all that he saw at his country 's capital , but well pleased to think that there is no evil there as great , nor as difficult to remedy , as the exaggerations of the press that sent him thither in consternation . But if he attempts to moderate the anxiety of his neighbors , he may chance to hear one of them say , as he rises froni the perusal of his morning bear , " Did n't they pull the wool over the deacon 's eyes in Washington ! " How much easier it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bretts and landaus " than to reduce " bretts and landaus " down to their infinitesimal origin in the brain of an itemizer who must send something piquant over the wires ! To become pecuniarily strong is the first step toward the extirpation of falsehood in a newspaper . The great and durable successes , during the last century , have been won by journals which conquered , by hard knocks and gritty persistence , their independence of the chief lie-compellers-poverty , class , and party-journals which can snub subscribers , offend advertisers , defend Congress , change parties , disgust the rich , admonish the poor , or spend an extra thousand dollars a week for six months at a time , and still go on in triumph . Such papers have not always used their power aright ; but they generally have ; for it belongs to the very nature of the Strong to speak the truth . First , catch your hare . The acquisition of the power to utter truth must precede its utterance . A weak paper , like a weak man , can hardly choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two generations Christendom has witnessed events that have sensibly lessened the general regard for truth . There was an editor of the AIoniteur of Paris , Napoleon Bonaparte // by name , whose bulletins were a positive advance in the art of lying , and there was scoffing Talleyrand at his side to reconcile Europe to the practice by repeating that speech was given to man to enable him to conceal his thoughts . Two such men , in such places , were enough to lower the sense of the sacredness of truth in a whole generation . And what have we of the present generation seen ? We have see this : the queen of the country that values itself above all other things for its love of truth paying a public visit to the perjured usurper of the French throne , n*nd submitting to be kissed by him on both cheeks ! Ga the last celebration of Washington 's birthday the press afforded us a curious illustration of the lasting harm that may result from a kind of falsehood which most people would think innocent . Scarcely any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington to the recollection of their readers , but a hundred paragraphists exercised their powers in jesting upon the story of the hatchet and the cherry-tree-the invention of Parson Weems , in 1800 , to make his little peddler 's Life of Washington more acceptable . That absurd fiction covers the name of Washington with a certam ridicule in perhaps a million minds . It is we , the public , the readers of newspapers , the people of the United States , mankind in general , who need to relearn the lesson which the ages reveal to us , that truth is ill itself a sacred and a precious thing . It is only the truth-revering races and men that ever long hold their own . Much of this outcry against the liars of the daily press is unjust , for there is but one liar in the daily press : it is Man .
