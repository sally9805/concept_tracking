txt In the Providence Journal of May 6 is printed a letter from Lincoln to Gen. Hooker , written just after the latter had taken command of tho Army of the Potomac . The letter was penned in January , 1863 , and , while the President yet retained it in his possession , an intimate friend chanced to bo in his cabinet one night , and the President read it to him ; remarking , " I shall not read this to anybody else , but I want to know how it strikes you . " Daring the following April or May , while the Army of the Potomac lay opposite Fredericksburg , this friend accompanied the President to Gen. Hooker 's head-quarters on a visit . One night , Gen. Hooker , alone in his tent with this gentleman , said : " The President says that he showed you this letter , " and he then took out that document , which was closely written on a sheet of letterpaper . The tears stood in the General 's bright blue eyes as he added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written to his son . And yet it hurt me . " Then , dashing the water from his eyes , ho said : " When I have been to Richmond , I shall have this letter printed . " This was more than 16 years ago , and the letter has just now seen the light of day . There are in it certain sharp passages which , after this long apse of time , can not be verified by the memory of any who heard it road in 1863 . There are others which seem missing . Nevertheless , the letter , which is herewith reprinted , must have been written by Lincoln : EXECUTIVE MANSION , WASHINGTON , D. C. , Jan. 26 , 1863 . MajorlGen . Booker : GENERAL : I have placed yen at the head Of the Army of the Potomac . Of course , I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons , and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skillful soldier , which , of course , I like . I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession , in which you are right . You have confidence in yourself , which is a valuable , if not an indispensable quality . Your are ambitions , which , within reasonable bounds , does good rather than harm ; but I think that during Gen. Burnside 's command of the Army yon have ? taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could , in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer . I have heard , in such way as to believe it , of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a dictator . Of course , it was not for this , but in spite of it , that I have given you the command Only those Generals who gain successes can set up dictators . What I now ask of yon is military success , and I will risk the dictatorship . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders . I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the Army , of criticising their commander and withholding confidence from him , will now turn upon you . I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down . Neither you nor Napoleon , if he were alive again , could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it . And now beware of rashness . Beware of rashness , but with energy and sleepless vigilance , go forward and give us victories . Yours , very truly , A. LINCOLN .
