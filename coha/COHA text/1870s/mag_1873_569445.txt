AnncLE i-THE SCIENTIFIC DEMOLITION OF PRAYER . TIrE proposition for what has been popularly termed The Tyndall Prayer Guage , which appeared in the Contemporary Review a few months since , has already excited considerable discussion . Though baptized by Mr. Tyndall 's name , it will be well remembered that he was rather its sponsor than its parent In an age less accustomed to startling propositions , this , clashing as it does with the oldest and most universal sentiments of man , would have occasioned more than a transient ruffle upon the surface of popular thought The belief that there is a Power above which controls the happening of events in this world , is moved by the intercessions of men , averts catastrophes , and dispenses favors in answer to their prayers , is not a distinguishing feature of Christianity . It is not peculiar to any religion or any era . Its impress is indelibly stamped on all history . It is written in unmistakable characters on all mythology . Laying aside the Christian revelation , arid judging in the light of the histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , we might not unreasonably pronounce it the common starting-point from // which all religious systems have diverged , the grand central principle from which all religious thought and faith have sprung . It would then be a remarkable indication of either the candor or the indifference of the age , if this belief ; so long established , so widely prevalent , and so interwoven with the thoughts and convictions of men upon subjects of the deepest and most enduring interest , had been dispelled in so short a time and with so meagre a struggle as that which has followed the proposition to which we have referred . We have then been surprised at the frequency with which it is assumed by contributors to our current literature , that the result of this discussion has been to compel all intelligent men , in and out of the churches , to renounce that belief so far as it pertains to the physical world . It is intimated that only those who are grossly ignorant of facts , culpably indifferent to them , or possessed of an obduracy which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity has been so completely demonstrated . We are congratulated on having at last discovered , that the legitimate objects of prayer are found alone in the mind and soul . These expressions do not come from the materialist or the skeptic alone , but are apparently , to some extent , the expression of sincere conviction from those who would shudder at the thought of denying God all personal and conscious existence in the world . Some have even seemed to experience relief in the thought that prayer has at last found a retreat where the remorseless hand of science can not reach it . During ages of ignorance it found a safe abode among the mysterious agencies of the physical world , but as science has robbed these agencies one after another of their mystery , prayer has been compelled to flee before it . Its territory has become more and more circumscribed , till at last there has not been left shade enough to cover it . Abandoning all claim to a place in the world of matter , it must betake itself to the more inscrutable world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an extraordinary extent engaged in the natural sciences . It is but reasonable to suppose that bye-and-bye metaphysics and psychology will have their turn . Will prayer receive more indulgence in their province ? Will not a similar course of reasoning to that which now causes it to withdraw its preten // tions before the investigations of science force it from its last citadel ? We propose to question the validity of the distinction which has been assumed in the application of the arguments , urged against prayer , to the physical and moral world , and afterward to test those arguments by applying them to phenomena most within our observation . This we think must be admitted to be an eminently scientific test . They are substantially these . The phenomena of the physical world are determined by fixed and invariable laws . Throughout all , extends an inevitable chain of causation which is never interrupted . Nothing ever happens without a cause traceable to natural law . This connection between cause and effect is essential to our security , since if it were liable to be broken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the result . The same cause might fail to produce the same effect . To suppose any change in the happening of events in answer to prayer , is to assume either that those laws established by the Supreme Being are imperfect and need the amendment of man , or that being perfect they are to deviate from their perfect working to gratify his petty caprice . The universal order whose maintenance is the security of a world is to be disturbed , convulsed to gratify the foolish and whimsical aspiration of a man , or of a community7 dissatisfied with the laws Omniscience has made . The magnificient system of government which His wisdom and beneficence have established , is to yield to human ignorance and folly . The humble man , mindful of the narrow range of his own vision , will reverently bow to whatever Eternal Wisdom may appoint , and shrink with awe from advancing any pretensions to interference in His government . To urge upon Him any change in His eternal decrees is the most impious presumption . No man prays for a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit . Why not these as well as lesser variations in the order of nature ? There will often be a conflict of prayer . While one asks for rain , another asks for sunshine . While one asks for the triumph of an army or principle , another asks for their defeat . Both can not be answered . // These arguments are accepted as conclusive and urged with vigor by those who earnestly contend for the efficacy of prayer in the mental and moral world . Let us first inquire in what sense it is understood to operate in this sphere . Some answer that it is purely subjective or self-operative . They confine its efficacy in producing distinct objective results to its influence in stimulating to such exertions as shall contribute to these results . Beyond this its principal virtue consists in awakening lofty desires and cherishing noble emotions . But to assert this is , in effect , to say that there can be no answer to prayer even in the moral world . So far as prayer produces objective results by stimulating to exertions after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical and moral world differs . Prayer for an abundant harvest may stimulate to diligent husbandry , as legitimately as prayer for purity of character to a virtuous life . But if the operation of prayer is purely reflexive , it must be understood to be such when offered , for the scientific thinker can not admit ignorance or obliviousness to the truth to be an element of success in any divinely-ordained institution . Are we to understand that men are to be profited by petitioning the Almighty to deliver them from dishonesty and hypocrisy , when conscious all the while that He never interferes to modify the working of their natural impulses ; or by asking Him for strength and wisdom when fully realizing that these qualities are to be granted or withheld in accordance with fixed law , which He never allows to be affected by the request of any of His creatures ? It has been said that it is in this sense that the prayer of the righteous " availeth much . " We believe it is " the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rational man as urging with genuine fervor a petition to a Being whom he is thoroughly convinced can not be affected by that or any petition . Those who accept this position and yet profess to recognize to . some extent the authority of Scripture , should explain in what sense faith is constantly represented as an essential element in prayer . If men are shocked by the presumption of those who address their petitions to God , confiding in what they recognize as His // promise to answer them , with what feelings mast they regard the awful mockery of those who urge Him to do what they openly profess to believe He can not and ought not to do ? If it is an insult to ask of Him what we believe Him willing to grant , what is it to ask of Him that which we are fully satisfied He is not willing to grant ? Superstition and idolatry have no mnmmery to be compared with this . It has been intimated in this connection that we shall learn more and more to give our addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to rise as a grateful tribute to the Creator , or is intended merely as a healthy exercise for the creature , we are not told . We apprehend that those who are able to conceive of mankind as lifting songs and ascriptions of praise to a Being , whom they are conscious can not be moved by any yearning or entreaty on their part , would yet expect them to do so under the conviction that their tribute would be recognized by Him . But to what purpose ? Not that He should be favorably affected toward them , for this could avail nothing . There is no instrumentality by which he can make His favors felt . Is it then for His gratification ? Is every thing else determined by fixed law , and the gratification of Deity alone dependent on the caprice of man ? Must we not suppose His mind , too , so immutable as to be unaffected by either the conduct or the emotions of man ? But our theme is prayer , not praise , and we can not pause to query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplates the Creator of this world as entirely outside of it except for the purpose of receiving the adulations of its inhabitants , adulations to which He can in no wise respond*-than that which regards him as the great Father responding to the cry of His children and governing the universe as we govern that part of it which is subordinate to us ; by our wills moving upon and through the intellectual and material agencies which He has made subject to them . We pass to tfrose who , while restricting the operation of prayer to our mental and moral nature , believe it may secure the direct interposition of the Deity . Such do not restrict it to the mind of the individual offering the prayer . To escape the argument by which it is excluded from the physical world , // they must assume that the chain of causation is less perfect in the spiritual sphere . The connection of sensation with thought , of thought with will , or of will with action , is determined by no fixed law . There is an arbitrary clement which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , courage or fear , virtue or depravity , discernment or dullness , do not come as the inevitable result of a pre-existent cause . There is here no established order of sequence that may not be broken . The nexus so infractible in the physical world , may here be severed . The interruption can not be in the sensations , for these come through the physical organs , nor in the will , for when this becomes subject to arbitrary interference it ceases to be wilL Is it , then , in the action of the will upon the mind ? If precisely the same impulse of the will is liable to produce a different impression on the mind , in what sense are we responsible beings ? But one objection to divine interference in the physical world was , that if the chain of sequence were not invariable we could act with no certainty of the result . If an interruption in this chain were disastrous at all , it would seem that the nearer the source of action it is brought the more widely must the disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know that the same motion of the hand will produce the same effect in the external world , what must be our condition when we do not know that the same impulse of the will will produce the same motion of the hand ? In both cases our control over the external world is uncertain , but in the latter our control over our own bodies is equally so . Whereever the variable element is introduced , it must affect all that lies beyond it . Moreover , we apprehend some unscientific minds will find a difficulty in understanding just how it is that this element of invariability in natural forces , is equally indispensable to their use by men and fatal to their use by God ; how the very element which carries them beyond the reach of the Enfinite , brings them under the control of the finite . We have been speaking of the individual mind , but if the varied forces of the physical world form a part of one vast physical system , each having its place to fill and part to perform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual minds to form a part of a vast moral system , each having its place to fill // and part to perform in the same economy , and that any variation in one must disturb the universal harmony and convulse the entire system ? We can hardly regard the moral system as less sacred and inviolable than the physical . Yet this is to be invaded by our selfish and capricious desires . Are the plans of Omniscience less completely developed here ? We are told that it is monstrous presumption for us to ask any change in the action of physical forces , which are ordered by divine wisdom and working out the divine purposes . It is to impugn the wisdom of the Infinite , to set up our finite knowledge against Omniscience , to ask Him to revise His plan of government at our suggestion . But are the forces of the external world , the laws which govern the wind and the rain , more the work of the Eternal Wisdom than the mind and moral nature of man , arid the laws which govern their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making the one what they are , than in making the other what they are ? Is the presumption which suggests improvement in the divine plan more flagrant in one sphere than in the other ? If we may not counsel Omniscience in the physical world , of which we know little , are we more competent to counsel Him in the moral world , of which we know less ? But it is said the operations of physical law are perfect , while there is imperfection in the moral world . Are we to understand that the moral world is imperfect as part of the universal plan , or that the imperfection is a quality of the individual and consistent with the perfection of the plan ? If the former , the very hypothesis of Omniscience upon which these reasoners base their argument is invalidated . Even then , before prayer is relieved of its appearance of presumption , it must be assumed , not only that the moral plan is imperfect , but that man is more willing or more competent to improve it than the Supreme Ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality of the individual and part of a perfect plan , how shall man presume to modify that plan ? Do we less challenge the wisdom and goodness of the Ruler , when we suppose Him to withhold from us moral and spiritual blessings which would be beneficial to us , and at the same time consistent with his moral plan , and only bestow them at the request of ourselves // or our fellow mortals , than when we attribute precisely the same conduct to Him in the physical world ? But on what authority do we assume perfection in the physical world ? What is our criterion ? How do we determine that to be perfect which we can test by no standard but our knowledge of itself ? It would seem as difficult to reconcile pain and disease with the perfection of the physical world as sin with that of the moral , and pain and disease have been treated as so far physical as to lie beyond the reach of prayer . Tornadoes , earthquakes , and volcanic irruptions , malarious swamps and barren wastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , how many animals , reach what we term perfection ? The naturalist answers , not one . Deformity greater or less is seen on every hand . Shall we be told that these apparent evils are the result of laws which are on the whole beneficial ? The same language applies with equal reason to the moral world . But the question still remains , might not the laws of both have been so harmonized as to accomplish the good without the evil ? Must we not conclude then , that we predicate perfection of the physical world , too , only with reference to its place in the universal plan , and this because we believe it the work of a perfect Being rather than because of any demonstration of our own ? Without confidence in His wisdom , should we not be compelled to admit that evil is equally prevalent in both ? If this is the method of our reasoning , it is equally conclusive as to the perfection of the moral world since we suppose them the work of the same Being . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom and blossom and bear fruit , because He has made them barren , how shall we pray that the babes in our homes may have developed within them the beauties and graces of a noble character ? Will it be said that the souls of the babes are more precious than the fruit of the garden ? Is this a reason why they should be more exposed to our meddlesome folly ? We now ask , how it is possible to so isolate the moral sphere from the physical that God may work *n. one without disturbing the phenomena of the other ? Every change in our minds and dispositions must affect the happening of events in the physical world . Every movement of our // bodies , every breath we breathe , have their influence on the phenomena of the physical world . Every thought we think has its effect on our own physical system , and ultimately on the world without . Every moral antecedent must have a physical consequent . The premises now become , everything that causes a change in the moral nature of man causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and the interposition of God in answer to prayer causes a change in the moral nature of man . If these premises are admitted , the conclusion is inevitable . Is any one prepared to traverse them ? Let it not be answered that the change is accomplished by the use of means . The question is not whether God acts upon the physical world with or without means , but whether the means respond to prayer . The prayer need not interrupt a chain of causation , if it is able to determine what chain shall be set in motion . Suppose , then , the prayer thus launched into the physical world . Has the harmony been disturbed ? Has the system been convulsed ? Has God been insulted ? It is not against the extent to which prayer may operate in the physical world , but to its having any operation , that the arguments we are considering are directed . They are as completely broken over the slightest exception as over the most thorough ( lemonstration . A writer in the Contemporary Review , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter , having started out with the statement that " No one , even slightly acquainted with scientific methods and results , can for a moment brook the idea of any interference with the laws of external nature produced by human prayer , " afterward speaking of the efficacy of prayer in the moral world tells us that it is " simply immeasurable . " He admits that prayer for the sick may be answered by such a direction given to the mind of a physician as shall lead him to administer a healing remedy . How the interruption of the physical forces which are consuming the body , is less disastrous than an interference through some other instrumentality , we do not understand . Nor do we understand how it is less an imputation on divine wisdom for us to suggest such an interference . In the same manner , we suppose it would be admitted that an impulse given to the minds of men in answer // to prayer , may lead them to dig water courses , drain lakes , hew down forests , and level mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains may occasion an increase in the sweep of the winds , and the frequency and severity of the storms , and thus in time an entire revolution in the climate . The power of prayer over the physical world becomes very considerable */ we only allow it sufficient time to o , perate in . It is perfectly legitimate for the Almighty to interfere even with the winds and rains , if he only do so in a manner sufficiently circuitous . The extent to which He may make Himself felt is constantly increasing . It is now much greater than before the days of powder and steam . It will continue to increase so long as man continues to bring the powers of nature into subjection to his will . It will be measured by man 's knowledge . Is it not dangerous to let prayer into the physical world even through so small a loop-hole as this ? Once in , it threatens to burst all restraint , over-leap all barriers , and rushing to every corner of the earth , carry havoc and confusion throughout the realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now reduced to this . God only modifies the happening of events in the physical world in answer to prayer by operating through the mind of man ; a ' proposition exposed to every objection he has urged against a more extended view of prayer , and imposing on him the burden of proving the limitation . But why operate alone through the mind of man ? Because mind can not operate on matter except through the medium of other minds ? This is manifestly absurd . Because mind can only act upon matter through the medium of nerves and muscles ? No , for our minds do not act on matter alone through this medium . They have already acted on matter before the nerves and muscles began to move . These are themselves matter . If there is a distinction between mind and matter , the one must somewhere act directly upon the other . Thought must pass directly into physical force , unless we presume a medium which is neither mind nor matter . If such a medium exist , we may as well suppose it subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why may not the thoughts of that mind pass as directly into physical force as our // thoughts ? Must we presume it less perfectly attuned to the forces of the external world than the mind of every living creature of which we have knowledge ? If the mind of the Deity does not by its present working affect physfcal phenomena , it is certainly the only mind of which we have any knowledge of which this is true . But the argument does not stop here . He who created the universe has sometimes acted upon physical force without our intervention . Can we suppose Him less capable now ? Again we ask , if God does accomplish results in the physical world in answer to prayer , what is the logic which circumscribes the means by which he does it ? We have thus far endeavored to show that every argument and every satire with which men have thought to banish prayer from all operation in the physical world apply with cumulative force to its operation in the moral world . We have pointed to the further difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other that the distni7bing element in the one shall not affect the phenomena of the other . We shall now endeavor to show that the same logic , followed to its legitimate and inevitable conclusion , deprives our wills of both the right and the power to effect any change in the phenomena of either . Every action of our wills , if it effect anything , must effect a change in the phenomena of both . Science tells us there can be no action without effect . Every such action implies a dissatisfaction with the order of events as they would happen without our interference . It assumes that the result which would follow the working of natural laws , if left to themselves , is capable of being improved upon , and that we are capable of discerning the improvement and accomplishing it . We see forces which Omniscience has caused to flow in fixed channels , and we divert them from those channels . We assume that there is a wiser use to which they may be put than He , without our interference , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obstructed by deposits which have been swept through long ages down the stream . Government proposes to remove these obstructions . But stay ! They were placed where they are by the forces of nature acting precisely as Omniscience designed them to . The same forces , acting in obedience to the laws Re has established , will continue to move them along in their slow // course toward the Gulf . This is a part of the divine plan . Shall fallible man presume to interfere and interrupt their course ? Shall he set up his feeble judgment against infinite wisdom ? Let science intervene and save us from the awful sacrilege . A laborer enters a forest in quest of fuel , but just as he raises his ax to fell a tree , he hears the ominous voice of science . " Stop , presumptuous man ! know you not that tree was placed there by a wisdom far beyond yours ? How dare you lift your insolent arm against His handiwork ? Think you in a moment to destroy what it has taken Him long years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my family must have fuel . " " If it were consistent with His universal plan that your family have fuel , He would have provided it , and not left it contingent on your feeble wisdom . Besides , you can not suppose He would allow His entire plan to be interrupted for the sake of a single family , " is the calm rejoinder of science . His ax falls by his side , he can not lift it to his shoulder , he can not raise his foot from the earth , he can not move , he can not think , without encountering some of the awful forces of nature and interfering with their action . And this is the condition of us alL But the proposition was not only that we must not , but that we can not interfere . For the demonstration is complete that the purposes of the Almighty can not be thwarted except by a power greater than His . Ours is admitted to be incomparably less than His . No interference on our part is possible . Let it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Science can not accept a proposition 50 irrational and demonstrably false on the authority of divine revelation , much less on that of our deceptive senses . We have thus followed to its logical ultimatum the system of reasoning by which prayer is assumed to be demonstrated out of the physical world , a system whose advocates have arrogated to themselves a monopoly of scientific knowledge and philosophic reasoning . But we apprehend that many who contemplated it with indifference or positive satisfaction , when it only banished Deity as a present working power from the world of matter , will falter , when they find it completely isolating Him from all // communion with His creatures , and at the same time ruthlessly annihilating self as an efficient power in either sphere . No reasoning , however accredited under the name of science , will convince them that we are not constantly planning and accomplishing changes in the happening of events in the physical world , and doing so , too , without any infringement of divine law or imputation upon divine wisdom . They will insist that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageous to us ; that it is not an interruption of physical laws but a use of them , and a use we were designed to make ; that it does not presume an effect without a cause , for the impul*e of will is a cause ; that it does not exhalt our wisdom above the Creator 's , since His wisdom gave us this means of indefinitely varying physical phenomena , and taught us to use jt , and that it is not a disturbance of the divine plan but a part of that plan . This answer throughout is precisely as applicable to any effort we may make to change the happening of events by an appeal to Him who controls all the forces of nature , as by an appeal to our muscles which can control but a small part of them . When it is said that nature 's laws are perfect , it surely is not meant that they can be put to no wiser use than they would be without our interference . If the results accomplished by the same forces can be varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which govern them , a belief in a change wronght in the physical world in answer to prayer does not necessitate a belief in a change either of their nature or the laws which govern them . Water is converted into flame and heat into motion simply because we desire them to be so . We have already intimated that we may effect a very considerable change in the climate , so that winds shall blow and rains fall where but for our intervention they would not . Yet in all this we find no presumption to horrify and no collision with the divine plan to excite apprehension . If there is presumption or collision , it does not prevent our accomplishing the desired result . It may be answered , all this is done in accordance with natural law . But what is meant by accordance with natural law ? The undisturbed action of physical forces in obedience to invariable law ? No , for if will had not intervened , the // action of these forces would have been very different . Is it then meant that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but another way of saying that it is in accordance with the established order that the happening of events in the physical world would be varied in response to our desires , and because of our desires through the intervention of will . But the moment this is conceded , every objection to prayer on the ground of arraigning the divine government , of presuming that we are wiser than Omniscience , of disturbing His plan or the invariability of natural laws , vanish . Our desires have become a most important element in determining the happening of events . No theory of the divine plan which leaves this fact out of account can withstand a moment 's scrutiny . The objection must now be to the method in which these desires are supposed to accomplish their object . But why object to the method ? Because we can not understand how it is ? First explain how it is that mind operates on matter at all . Because we can not explain why it is ? First explain why we are allowed to interfere with the physical world at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification of physical forces in answer to prayer is not as much a part of the divine plan as a modification similar in kind , in answer to a desire acting directly through our will , or the will of a fellowbeing , let us have at least the show of a reason why this distinction exists . It will be observed that our desires are not carried into effecf alone through the direct action of our own physical powers , but we are able to invoke and obtain the assistance of those who by reason of greater strength or wisdom exercise a control over the agencies of the physical world which we can not . Not only do we search in vain for the inherent improbability that prayer has a place in the divine plan , but the presumptions arising from analogy are in its favor . But lest we seem to misrepresent the advocates of the theory we are considering , we allow them to present their case in their own language . We quote from the Article in the Gon temporary Review , to which we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer says : " Let us grant that the invariability is not in the nature of things , the calm rejoinder of the physicist is , We have no scientific experience // to warrant the belief that nature 's sequences ever are variable . " ' If by this he means that nature 's sequences can only be varied by an impulse from independent will , the proposition is entirely irrelevant and immateriaL If he means more than this , it is false . " A spiritual antecedent can not produce a physical consequent . " So far as our experience extends , spiritual antecedents are constantly producing physical consequents . We may reasonably suppose this has been true ever since the grand spiritual antecedent in the mind of Deity produced the grand physical consequent in the creation of the material universe . " *IIt is in vain to reply that we are constantly interfering with the seeming fixed laws of the universe and altering their destination by our voluntary action or scientific appliances , for in all such cases we simply make use of existing forces . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish a change in physical phenomena , without interfering with fixed laws , and that such use in answer to our desires is a legitimate one . " But we can never escape from the domain of fixed law . " If our desires can be gratified within that domain , we have no occasion to . " Our act , were we to attempt it , would itself be a link in the chain of phenomenal sequence . The very moment we put it forth as agents in a phenomenal world , that instant the energy we exert ( itself determined by prior influence ) enters as a new element into the vast chain of physical causation . In short , we only change the existing order by a power which is a part of that order , and whose every movement is regulated by law . " This language is precisely as applicable to prayer as part of that order as to any other action of the will or expression of the desire , and if it proves anything , proves that prayer not only may have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for the very moment we put it forth , that instant the energy we exert enters as a new element in the vast chain of physical causation . " To insist that prayer is not a part of the existing order is to assume the very matter at issue . " It is supposed that the destination of a physical force can be arrested , and the otherwise inevitable results prevented by an act of the divine volition , but the antecedent force must expend itself and determine some // consequent It simply can not be arrested or lifted out of its place amongst the links of physical causation without the whole chain falling to pieces . Its efficiency in giving rise to a new sequence *s involved in its very existence , while the discovery of the correlation and transmntation of forces proves that the prior agent is still present and operative under an altered form . " We can not understand why this is not as applicable to the action of the human mind upon physical forces as to that of the divine . Nor do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral phenomena , upon which this Article asserts prayer does have an effect . is it not admitted that " the destination of a physical force can be arrested and the otherwise inevitable results prevented by an act of " human " volition ? " " The antecedent force must expend itself and determine some consequent . " Yes , but the human volition may within its limited sphere indefinitely vary that consequent . Is not the efficiency of a motive or an idea in giving rise to a new sequence " involved in its very existence ? " Yet the act of divine volition is admitted to be felt here . The writer objects to the vague manner in which those who believe prayer can alter the sequences of nature state their case as in the last degree unscientific . They should explain just how the result is accomplished , trace the prayer through all its course up to and through the mind of the Infinite , and thence back through all the physical agencies called into play , till it arrives at the result proposed . Will the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some action on his part from our mind to his ? Will he explain just how the impression on his ear or eye is transmitted to the immaterial mind , just how it affects the reason or emotions , produces a resolution to respond , and determines the manner of response ; how the impression is again transmitted to the physical organs , and how it here effects a change in the action of physical forces within the limited range in which man is permitted to act ? Will he even explain how our individual desires , originating in some circumstances first perceived through the physical organs , act upon our own mind and through that upon the external world to accomplish the desired result ? Or if the chain of causation // should in some part of its course , from the request to the result , elude his vigilance , will he stubbornly deny that the request has operated to secure the result ? If we are unable to trace the mysterious laws h*y which the mind of man acts upon the mind of his fellow , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process by which the mind of Deity perceives our request , determines its action upon it , and communicates its impulse to the physical agencies which shall accomplish the result , be exposed , that the entire chain of causatiou be laid bare and made intelligible to us , and till this is done assume as axiomatic that any such process can not exist ? If the relations of mind and matter , and the action of one upon the other , baffle us when we limit our investigation to our own minds and the narrow sphere under our immediate observation , shall we think it strange if we sometimes find ourselves in obscurity when the subjects of our investigation are God and the universe ? Again , the writer objects to reasoning from unverified hypotheses . Speaking of the theory that while the chain of physical sequence remains unbroken , certain changes may be effected by a hyperphysical energy transmitted along the entire line from the fountain-head , he says : " Suppose there be no such fountain-head , but an endless cycle of recurrent energy , and what becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a class who undertake to demonstrate on scientific principles not only the efficacy of prayer but the manner and means through which its results are accomplished , in all their details , the question is well put . If that class have a single representative in the world , it is for him to answer it , which perhaps he would do by applying the question to the sphere in which the writer does recognize the efficacy of prayer , or by referring to that part of his argument where he assumes the existence of a reserve of communicable ife within the divine essence . Those who believe in prayer on the authority of revelation would not presume to prescribe the instrumentalities through which the Almighty must work . They believe the purpose of revelation to be to communicate truth that would not otherwise be known . If the writer 's position is that nothing can be received on the authority of revelation which can not be affirma // tively proved without it , we leave him to combat this and all the facts of history . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on whatever authority it rests , it is for him to show that the hypotheses of his opponents not merely may be but must be false , or insufficient . We quote once more : " That it should be in the power of any creature thus to launch a new agency , almost at will , into the pre-arranged system of nature and thereby begin a series of changes which are absolutely interminable in their effect , is simply incredible . " That every creature that has ever lived has by its action varied the happening of events in the physical world , and thus " launched a new agency " into it , and that every creature that has had a will has done so not only almost but altogether at will , is quite as indisputable as it is increditable . This , to use the writer 's own language , " is involved in its very existence . " That this has begun a series of changes absolutely interminable in their effect is , upon his own theory , equally indisputable , for he leaves us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unbroken chain must be so . We are obliged to pass over the writer 's remarks on the policy of prayer as somewhat aside from our subject The position to which our attention has been mainly directed we have considered as the stronghold of science in its assault upon prayer . There are a few outposts which we can not pass without a moment 's notice , though the arguments which come from some of them seem so puerile that we can hardly believe them seriously urged . First . If prayer avail anything , why not pray for the reversal of the seasons , or the arrest of the earth in its orbit ? We might answer , simply because we do not want the seasons reversed , or the earth arrested in its orbit , or we might ask those who allow prayer an operation in the moral world and yet urge this question : Why not pray for omniscience instead of wisdom ? Why not for moral perfection instead of moral improvement ? But our answer is not for these alone . We profess no familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its axioms that no agency can operate at all which is not absolute and unlimited in its operation . If a parent refuse to abandon all his business enterprises at the // request of his child , does it inevitably follow that he will not deviate from the routine of a single day because that child has asked him to ? If he refuses to bestow on that child his entire fortune , is it impossible that he may indulge him in a single toy ? Indulgence within certain bounds may be beneficial to the child , beyond them injurious . What these bounds will be in a particular case must depend upon an indefinite number of contingencies , many of which will lie beyond the knowledge of the child . The most implicit believer in the efficacy of prayer does not suppose it the only consideration that determined the action of the Almighty , but only a consideration which may or may not be outweighed by opposing ones . Because a weight does not always turn the scale , we are not compelled to deny it ponderosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its reasonableness . Moreover , if it were infinite in its possibilities , it certainly is not in its application . If it does not accomplish all things , it may be more because of its limited and imperfect use than its limited power . Second . Prayers may conflict with each other , and of two for opposite results both can not prevail . This certainly is not a peculiarity of prayer . We know of no agency at work in either the physical or moral world which is not constantly in conflict with some opposing force . But one can ever prevail . Must we refuse to believe that the Creator has given us power to advance a cause by our influence , because we shall be compelled to admit that he has given our neighbor power to oppose it by his ? When we come in contact , as we often do , one must fail . Must the lawyer refuse to argue his case because there may be a counter-argument ? The court can not decide in favor of both . If two armies may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not on precisely the same grounds refuse to use every other means of success ? The energy with which each has used the visible means in their power , the meritoriousness of the cause , and the fervor of the petition , may each be elements in determining the result . Third . If prayer is so efficacious , why not pray for food and clothing and everything necessary for comfort , and use no other means ? If God intervenes when we ask Him for what we can in no other way obtain , does it follow that He will do // so when we refuse to use the means we can control without this intervention , and given us by Him for the purpose of accomplishing the result proposed ? If a landlord supplies his indigent tenant with fuel , does it follow that he will also build his fires ? If we should see a child fall in the street , instead of notifying the city officials that it needed assistance we should probably lift it ourselves ; but if a friend were unjustly cast into prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of habeas corpus , rather than beat away with our knuckles at the granite walls of his celL The last argument we notice is that science affords no evidence of the answer of prayer . This manifestly has no validity except on the assumption that if prayer does enter as an element in determining the happening of events , science must have detected it . When we consider how many elements of causation , purely physical in their nature , are to - day known to exist , which science had not detected a few years ago , it is not wholly irrational to believe that there may be others which it has not yet discovered . ft certainly has been true at every other period of the world 's history , if it is not to-day , that there were many truths of which science had furnished no evidence . *Then science knows all the facts present to the Omniscient Mind , when it has precisely weighed every consideration that may determine the action of that mind , when it has explored all the mysteries of the universe , and fathomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not till then , may it tell us that neither mind nor matter have room for a power it has not traced . Meanwhile , since its boast is that it is practical , let it bring us a gauge by which to measure the action of mind upon mind in a more humble sphere . It has never yet demonstrated the force of a single motive on a single human mind . Place a man of the most limited mind amidst circumstances which shall bring to bear on him the fewest possible motives , keep him under the most rigid scrutiny , and science will never be able to determine with certainty what his conduct will be in a given instance , or what motive will determine it , nor after he has acted will it be able to tell us precisely what motives have and what have not actuated him . But when the theater of observation is the universe , of a petty corner of which only // science has ever caught a glimpse , when the subject is the Omniscient Mind , of which science professes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial investigation of an insignificant portion of its handiwork , when the assumed motive to be tested is prayer , when science can know neither the number nor the character nor the objects of the prayers which ht*ve been offered , when the result of the action that shall follow can be but partially and faintly traced , science can say with infallible certainty whether that motive has or has not affected that mind . Surely this science is a very wonderful thing ! The man of science seeing a steam-engine in motion , may trace the physical forces which have been employed in its construction and operation . He may tell us that its shape and motion are the inevitable result of fixed law . lie may trace its onward progress to the rotation of the wheels , this to the play of the levers , this to the movement of the piston , this to the pressure of the steam , this to the expansion of water , this to the agency of heat , this to the contact of certain chemical elements brought together by the motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles , and so on back to the mind , which put all these forces in motion . The chain of causation , so far as he can trace it , is as inevitable as that which determines the variation of heat and cold , or rain and sunshine . Is the result then inevitable ? So far as he is able to trace the order of sequence it is . Do we doubt that the same mind might have started a different chain of causation , or have interrupted this at any point ? And would not the other chain have been as perfect to all the tests of science as this ? The elements that may enter to vary the result in response to the human mind are beyond computation . The order in which they may be introduced ie beyond the test of science . Science has no test by which to ascertain whether the mind which determined the movement of the engine acted of its own impulse or at the request of another . When brought to bear on motive or will , all its scales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain of physical causation is within the range of scientific obseruation , it invariably traces it back to the independent action of will . This is the only ultimate cause it knows . By what authority then does it assume that those phenomena // which are so extended and complex that it can not trace them to their ultimate cause , do not originate in the action of an independent will ? We have not undertaken to present the positive argument for prayer . This would open a wider field than we may enter . The Christian believer rests his belief in prayer pre-iminently on the authority of revelation . The arguments aimed at prayer are equally fatal to all revelation , for revelation implies the intervention of God in the affairs of men . They involve the exclusion of all miracles , for a miracle must be regarded as a more striking manifestation of the same power which is supposed to operate in the answer of prayer , a power constantly present and operative in the world , but having its operation compressed within so narrow a compass that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apparent to the understanding of man , the design being partly , perhaps , to teach by a striking example the existence of such a connection , which might otherwise escape him . So , too , we have been accustomed to regard much of the Old Testament narrative , not as recounting any peculiar action of the Almighty in His dealings with His creatures , but as an epitome of His government , in which the connection between His plans and their accomplishment is laid bare , and we are enabled to see how His will is ever present , working out its great purposes alike through the minds of men and the forces of nature . We find authority for prayer even in the Logia of Matthew , which well nigh baffled the resources of Strauss and IRenan , in their endeavor to explain away all Scripture . The Bible throughout constantly represents it as an efficient power in both physical and moral world . That this is not the kind of evidence demanded in the name of science we know . But the existence of the Scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions of Deity connected with them , are facts which science can no more dispute than the law of gravitation . The primitive and almost universal belief in a Supreme Being who answers prayer , is another indisputable fact . These facts have all had a cause . Has science any test which will unerringly determine that cause ? // The theory we have been considering is not fatal to revealed religion alone . It denies God all conscious presence in the world , and if extended to the universe , denies Him all present conscious existence whatsoever . For on the theory of science , there can be no conscious existence which is not all the while giving rise to some phenomena , and the , argument assumes that th' divine mind is by its present action giving rise to no phenomena . If then , there has been a God who once contrived this wonderful mechanism and set it in motion , He must have ceased to exist immediately upon its creation . Science is making astonishing progress in unfolding the mysteries that have been hidden from the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material universe . So extraordinary is the sight that bursts upon us that our eyes may be dazzled and our minds bewildered for a time . Gazing into the marvelous truths it has revealed , we may in sudden rapture salute it as the mistress of all truth . But are we not repeating a folly written on many a page of history , in exalting to the supremacy what is but one of Truth 's mighty auxiliaries ? Men intent on one pursuit , are apt to forget that there are others worth living for . He whose study is in the immensity of space , finds little worthy his attention in stones or plants or beasts , while the geologist sees more beauty in the fossil protozoa than in all the stars of heaven . Every age has its idol . When the schools of intellectual philosophy were in the ascendancy Abstract Reason was placed on the throne . Must Science now hold the scepter ' ? Then the world must believe all matter but phenomena of mind . Must we now confess all mind but phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path than the one in which we are walking leads to truth . Science has taught us many lessons , but none more plainly than the folly of assuming that to be impossible which we can not understand . It is not a thousand years since the spherity of the earth was shown to be impossible , by the most unanswerable demonstration . Its revolution was utterly absurd . When the facts seemed beyond dispute , they were as inexplicable as ever . Had revelation affirmed either of these facts , it would have been demonstrated out of the world at a very early date . // Had it told us that for long ages the earth was the abode of no nobler creatures than reptiles , how speedily and indignantly would philosophy have resented the insult to divine wisdom ? It has been common in this discussion to remind us that Christianity has always been the enemy of scientific progress . This is no more true of Christianity than it is true of science itself . Every innovation is opposed by 1*hose who have become wedded to old forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have believed an error . The Galileos , the Columbuses and the Harveys have encountered alike the opposition of the churches and the schools of science . And when we remember how many false theories have been proposed for every one that has survived the test of time and further investigation , we can neither wonder at the existence of this spirit , nor regret it , though we may deprecate the manner in which it has sometimes found expression . The world can not help remembering how frequently men who have made some discovery in itself valuable , have supposed themselves to have found the key of all mystery , and proceeded to construct upon it some universal theory of genesis and destiny , and asking how large a proportion of these theories have survived , unmodified , the life of their author ? Vast as have been the achievements of science , the mystery of the universe seems vaster than ever . A little knowledge has been hewn from the infinite unknown . The larger the sphere of knowledge becomes , the more of the unknown does it touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . We think then it can not be the scientist that would have us believe the universe has no room for a power he has not traced . Christianity and science are alike in search of truth . Alike they encounter mystery at every turn . Alike they will be embarrassed and dishonored by those who misconstrue or misapply them . Alike they will often fall into error . May they learn more and more to recognize the beauty and the worth of each other , and the wisdom and goodness of the great Author . While we revere science , we would still worship God .
