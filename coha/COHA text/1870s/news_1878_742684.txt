txt The proceedings in the House yesterday are significant . It is clear that with the failure of the , attempt to widen the scope of the investigation , the organized action of the Republicans meanwhile ends . Having placed the responsibility where it belongs , and having shown whither the steps already taken lead , it is not their intention to concern themselves with the intestine troubles of the Democracy . The motives may not always imply cordial agreement on a basis satisfactory to the President , but in a party sense the purpose is not unwise . The Democrats have undertaken to prove grave accusations : now let them make the most of their ease . Republicans generally await developments . As for the Democrats , it certain that many of them are uneasy . The more moderate among them realize the embarrass- ' ment which the temporary success of the violent elements inflicts upon the party . They see that the failure of the investigation will react disastrously upon the party , while the attainment of the result hoped for will be followed by complications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the investigation means defeat in the Fall campaign ; on the other hand , triumph in the committee will be the precursor of an attempt at revolution . It is not surprising , therefore , that members who were dragged and disciplined into the support of the Potter scheme , against the promptings of their own judgment , are anxious in some way to mitigate the consequences of the blunder . The first impression produced upon the public mind is ' not reassuring . There is an ominous absence of enthusiasm in quarters that are relied upon as exponents of party opinion , and there are remonstrances and warnings which few of ' their number are inclined to ignore . Candid friends remind them that the party can not afford to do morn , or to risk more , for Mr. TILDEN , and that it is in no humor , in the present condition of the country , to incur the responsibility of any proceeding that tends to retard the growth of business confidence . Especially from the South are those suggestive reminders received . That section has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it desires to raise a quarrel about the title of the President who has exerted his authority in its favor . Such are some of the considerations which impel members of the majority , like Mr. HARRISON , to seek a modification of the Potter resolution in the interest of fairness and peace . The effort at amendment comes too late . A week ago the resolution yesterday submitted by Mr. HARRISON might have effected some good . It would then have been entitled to Republican support as a formal disavowal of the ulterior purpose which the extreme Democrats are known to entertain , and , moreover , it would have contributed to that enlargement and impartiality of the investigation which Mr. HALE 'S proposition was designed to secure . The section of the party represented by Mr. HARRISON was then silent . It gave no encouragement to Mr. MILLS in his courageous resistance to the whole scheme . It allowed Mr. STEPHENS to be howled down without interposing a word in his behalf . That ' was the time when the motion of yesterday might have . been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats who thus tardily acknowledge the reasonableness of Mr. HALE 'S amendment and the expediency of terminating doubt in regard to Mr. HAYES ' title , deprives them of any claim to sympathy . They yielded ignobly to the dictation of a few audacious partisans , and they must bear their full share of the odium which the mischievous movement will fasten upon its supporters . Neither their own party nor Republicans will help them , as the fate of Mr. HARRISON 'S resolution shows . It must be admitted that , as between one Democratic faction and another , the logic of the situation is favorable to those who refuse to be bound by the declaration proposed in relation th the President 's title . Mr. Mills ' position was impregnable . Mr. Harrison 's compromise would be practical- ly meaningless , because inoperative in the only contingency that could call for its exercise . The true point of resistance was at the beginning . The question had been settled . Reopen , it , and . there is no logical stopping-place this side of a struggle for possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of fraud , and having by its action decided ' that the decision rendered by the Electoral Commission and the Fortyfourth Congress was not final , could not now offer the pledge suggested by Mr. HARRISON without abandoning the ground it has deliberately chosen . We know that Mr. POTTER 'S language and character have been appealed to as furnishing the assurance desired . But Mr. POTTER 'S political character is that of an unscrupulous partisan , and his language means anything or nothing . If he were a more trustworthy politician than he is , and if his words were frank and honest instead of being equivocal , the essential facts of the ease would remain unchanged . Not only is the Democratic Party not bound by anything he said , but it is no longer free to pledge itself in advance of the revelations . which the investigators have un4ertaken to make . This only is in the meantime indisputable : the Democrats who are anxious to allay distrust by declaring that Mr. HAYES shall not be touches : were not , originally , supporters of the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats who promoted the scheme , whose persistent energy forced the party to adopt it , and who have control of it in the House and in the committee , are outspoken assailants of Mr. HAYES ' title . The investigation was instituted by them as a means of invalidating that title . And if the investigation yield what they expect , they will , without doubt , proceed to use the results obtained as the ground-work of measures for ejecting Mr. HAYES from the Presidency . Had they said otherwise by adopting Mr. HARRISON 'S resolution , wo should not have believed them . They would simply have added hypocrisy to fraud . The Wilson resolution , which did pass the House , amounts to nothing . A specific proposition to extend the inquiry to South Carolina and Oregon , had failed . The declaration that the committee may investigate " well-grounded allegations of fraud , " in " any State , " is a trick that should not deceive anybody .                   @ @
