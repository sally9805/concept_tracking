THE STICKEEN RIVER AND ITS GLACIERS . A DETENTION of a month at Fort Wrangel , Alaska , awaiting the means of transportation back to Portland , Oregon , gave me the opportunity of making a trip up the Stickeen River , which empties into the Pacific a few miles north of the fort , and of seeing its glaciers , the principal one of which , the " Great Glacier , " being , it is said , one of the largest in the world . Embarking with a pleasant party from the post , one beautiful July morning , on one of the boats carrying passengers and supplies to the head-waters of the river ; with a supply of water-proofs and gum-boots for the glacier , with sketching materials , fishing-tackle , shot-guns and rifles , besides cards , organ and violin ,  --  we were , in a few minutes , steaming away toward our destination . The passengers , besides our party , were a Mrs. Lovell , who was on the way to join her husband at Glenora , a town at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal merchant at the Cassiar mines . Rounding a point half a mile from the wharf , the mouth of the Stickeen came in view ; at ten A. M. we were fairly in it , and then the character of the scenery began to change from that of the coast . We had left behind us mountains , high and wooded , but here they became higher and more rugged and were occasionally capped with snow . New beauties presented themselves every moment until the sun set and it became too dark to see anything . We were to stop that night at a landing called " Bucks , " just opposite to the " Great Glacier , " and , as the captain had promised in the morning to give us an opportunity of going over on the ice , we waited patiently , until we were securely tied up , when we " turned in , " but not to sleep ; for , although the night was chilly , from our nearness to the " Ice Mountain , " the mosquitoes were terrible and the first streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the monster glacier , white and cold in -4 ,  --  // the uncertain morning light , but which , as river of from six to seven hundred feet high the sun broke upon it , sparkled and glistened and about seven miles wide . From where the like miles of heaped-up jewels . From pressure was removed , at the mouth of the where we lay we could look out over the gorge , great cracks and chasms showed surface of the ice as it came out of the themselves until , as the edge of the face mountains , dipping with a gentle slope was approached , the whole ice plain was toward the river ; immediately in front of us was the mountain-gorge , about two miles wide , through which it issued before spreading out into its fan-like shape which terminated in a perpendicular face next to the seen to be a net-work of cracks which appeared to run , with broken joints , to the very bottom of the glacier . As we looked into these fissures in the clear ice , from about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , FIVE MILES BELOW GREAT CANON , STICKEEN RIVER . // matic colors were superb . The surface of the ice has the appearance of being covered with snow , but the face of the precipiceis all dear ice . The belt of timber , between the river-bank and the glacier , prevented us from seeing down to its base ; but with the captain 's promise in view , we made a hasty breakfast and immediately afterward the boat was loosened from its moorings and , running across , made a landing on the other bank . We were quickly ashore and started through the dense timber and undergrowth belt , which occupies the space between the moraine at the foot of the glacier and the river . This belt seemed to us , from the deck , to be very narrow , but being in reality almost a quarter of a mile wide and the undergrowth being very dense , with swampy ground here and there , the traveling through it was extremely difficult . It was climbing over and creeping under obstacles the whole way , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing over fallen timbers , the mosquitoes were VIEW FROM GLENORA , STICKEEN RIVER . // 8o8 BIG CA&amp;ON. qwq rnense , irregular , tumulose mass one hundred feet high and about one-fourth of a mile wide , parallel to the whole length of the face of the glacier , and perfectly destitute of vegetable life . Up this we clambered and at last reached the top . Who can describe the sight which presented itself to our eyes ? It was at once grand and ternble ; for miles on either side of our standpoint stretched this perpendicular ice-cliff , towering above our heads , fissured and seamed with great cracks and chasms , in which such tints were seen as were never laid on painter 's palette ; here a block , as large as a church , split out from the face and just ready to fall , and then a rock , weighing tons , which had been brought down by the tedious but terribly irresistible movement of the glacier from the mountaintops sixty miles away , caught in a crack and held there , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about one*quarter of a mil&amp; distant from the face of the cliff ; from the foot of the moraine next to the glacier an ice slope ascends , at an angle of from ten to fifteen degrees , which has been formed by the constant breaking off of immense blocks from the face . These fall in numberless pieces , melting and flowing down in the day-time , the water freezing again at night and gradually building up the slope solidly . The edge next to the moraine is quite thin , and the moVement of the glacier pushing this plow ahead against it breaks up the edges in many places , forcing the pieces into minigture bridges which : span , with their pointed arch , the tiny . stream flowing between the ice-plow and the moraine , and emptying into the river miles above . After gazing at this wonder for a while from the top of the moraine ; we went down its inside slope , and jumping the stream , found ourselves on th' ice slope and on the back of our head simultaneously . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , but when we all got upon it it was discovered that an epidemic of sitting down hard at intervals , and with*out due warning , had broken out in our party , and it was only by taking advantage of the pebbles imbedded here and there in the ice , that we could make any progress . Then , too , there were in the ice many water-washed holes of from two to four feet in *diameter , which went down like wells to the ground beneath ; and the idea of going far up the slope , slipping and coming down with the speed of a billiard ball to be fairly pocketed " in one of these holes , deterred VOL . XVIT. - 64. us from making any experiments . Even here on the ice the mosquitoes were most annoying and kept us moving our arms about like the fans of a wind-mill , but the sight was so grand that we felt as if we could not tear ourselves away . There was something in this mass of ice that fascinated one by its immensity . Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects , and nothing was great but the ice , and that was clear , beautiful , majestic and awful . No one seemed inclined to talk , and the stillness was only broken by murmurs of admiration and wonder . I can not learn that the surface of this glacier has ever been explored . There is a story current , however , that two Russian officers from the garrison at Sitka , years ago made the attempt and were never heard from again , having probably become bewildered and lost in the labyrinth of chasms that can be so distinctly seen from the other bank of the river . The Indians say that at one time the glacier crossed the Stickeen , and that an old Indian and his wife paddled their canoeunder it , through the ice caverns and gleaming passages that were worn by the current . While *many pleasing thoughts stole upon us as we looked up at the great ice-cliff ; a prolonged whistle from the boat recalling us did not sound unwelcome , and we girt our loins for another struggle with the chaparraL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to have a last look , and then plunged down the slope , into the bush , and after a long struggle reached the landing with disordered dresses , hats awry , hands full of , the thorns of the " Devil 's Club , " - thoroughly tired , and thirsty enough to drink dry all the water-butts on the boat . We soon scrambled over the gang-plank , and the lines having been let go , were on our Way again . The scenery continued grand , peak after peak shooting up , not in ranges , but singly , each timbered to the snow line , and then reaching up bare and gray to the very heavens . Here and there a small glacier , starting from near the peak , reached one of the rocky gulches , and as its foot approached the warmer air below it melted into a stream , looking tiny in the miles of distance , and dashed down to join the water of the main stream ,  --  a full-grown river , as cold as the ice itself and as clear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingling with its muddiness . We staggered along bravely , making but little headway against this boiling , whirling torrent of a river until , having been // under way for a few hours , it was discovered that the tubes in the boiler were leaking . Being almost abreast of the site of the old Hudson Bay fort , we ran in and tied up . As soon as the boat was quiet , off came great clouds of mosquitoes from the woods and thick bushes , and we were driven to the invention of all sorts of contrivances to keep from being literally eaten alive . I thought that I had been in mosquito countries before ; but , bless you , I was a babe in mosquito experience . They were business fellows too ; did not sing and enjoy themselves as others of their class do , but possibly , knowing that the boat would not tarry long , wasted none of their valuable time but attended strictly to blood-letting . From where we lay the bushes ran back in great luxuriance , and with a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being broken by great lone pines , spruce and hemlock , with here and there a gaunt dead tree . Beyond this the larger timber grew thicker , and the bushes were lost ; the pine-covered country became more broken until it suddenly reared itself boldly toward the sky . The trees became more and more scattered , until but a few detached ones were to be seen , and then up , up to a dizzy height , the bare gray rocks towered to the clouds . Away up on the first melange of mountains a small glacier was visible , from under the foot of which a tiny cascade threw itself over the precipice , but it was miles away , and when it reached us , just astern of the boat , it was a roaring , tumbling brook . At two o'clock in the afternoon , the tubes having been repaired , the fires were started ; the hand of the steamgauge soon showed the requisite amount of steam , and casting off the lines we were under way , and in a few minutes rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep to come , we went to our state-room , closed all of the avenu* of retreat , and with a towel , slightly wet at one end to give it weight , passed half an hour in an indiscriminate slaughter of all of the little pests that had not been driven out by the draught of air through the boat . Leaving all closed we slipped out , with the satisfaction of knowing that we had purchased for ourselves undisturbed rest , as far as these little nuisances were concerned , and climbed up to the pilot-house , where all of the party had collected to enjoy the scenery . Every - moment brought fresh beauties , fresh surprises ; mountain towered above mountain , - there was no sameness , every turn brought a picture characteristic in itself ; the foreground the river , every inch of it covered with circular swirls as the water boiled us from the bottom in its rapid descent toward the ocean ; now and then a great tree , shorn of its limbs and anchored to the bottom by its rock-laden roots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free itself ; then the ragged banks , with their overhanging grasses , enormous ferns and the immense leaves of the " Devil 's Club . " The eye rested upon moss-covered bowlders half concealed in the soil , and followed thestraggling , far-reaching roots that dipped and withdrew their long arms as they struck the current ; the many-colored greens of the willows , alders , cotton-woods , British Columbia pines , spruce , hemlock and balsam , melted into the haze of distance , where thebrownish-green pines began to show on the mountain-sides ; then up and up traveled the delighted vision until the line of timber ceased , and the variously tinted mosses gave their tone to the scene ; beyond this were gray and red masses of pitiless rocks in countless shapes ; over the shoulders of these , in the deep blue of the great distance , . other and higher peaks miles upon miles away . It was a perfect pandemonium of mountains ; patches of snow lay on the sides and in the great fissures of the highest . Scores of " baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread-like streams of water poured down from the melting snow , leaping at times over thousands of feet orprecipice , their volume disp*rsed in cloud-like vapor long before the bottom was reached ; we all gazed in silence , exclamations of wonder and admiration breaking from our lips at intervals as our advance opened to us a view which seemed grander than anything that we had seen before . Finally the captain , pointing in the direction , shouted " There 's the Mud Glacier ! " All eyes were turned in the direction indicated , and soon , away off to our left , over the trees , we caught sight of the face of a large glacier with a perpendicular bluff of ice , and immense heaps of lateral and terminal moraine . The trees soon hid it from view as we ran in under the bank to take advantage of an eddy , but running out again , further up , we brought it into full view about three miles away . This . glacier is next in extent to the one visited by us in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called the " Devil 's Elbow , " we were in sight of it for five hours , seeing it from all points ; the flow of ice is. from the mountains of the right bank , and . // when one can first see it it sweeps out from a ravine which runs apparently parallel to the river , and then , turning at right angles , wends its difficult way through a cafion , directly toward us , always slightly descending as it advances until it reaches the mouth of the cafion , when it spreads out into the fan shape before alluded to , terminating abruptly in a precipice of ice some three hundred feet high ; from this ice-face , back to where the glacier comes out of the cafion , the distance can not be less than from seven to eight miles , and how much further it extends no one could tell us ; its width , where it leaves the cafion , must be about one mile , while at its face it is about three . Its moraine is pushed out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side , it has surrounded a belt of timber , which , I am sure , must soon give way to the force of the moving ice . . Tliis is called the " Mud Glacier , " from the fact of its surface being covered with sand and dirt blown upon it from the encroaching mountains by the fierce winter winds that here prevail ; and in contradistinction to the Great Glacier , the surface of which is very pure . Our stock of wood being almost exhausted , we ran into one of the company 's wood-yards to replenish . While the wood was being thrown aboard , the steward of the boat took a bucket and went up to the mouth of the stream that flows from beneath the glacier , and before we had completed the wooding returned with some of the most delicious water that I ever tasted ,  --  as cold as the ice itself . We had postponed dinner until we should arrive at this place ; our morning on the upper deck , where we had drunk in great draughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we all blessed " old Uncle , " the cook , as dish after dish of appetizing food made its appearance . The dinner was excellent , as were all of our meals while on the boat . It was a long pull around the bend : an extraordinary circular sweep , with the face of the Mud Glacier for a center ; once I lost sight of the ice , as we worked along , for some time , close in under the trees , and when it again made its appearance the boat had so changed her course , by reason of the course in the river , that I thought I had discovered a new field of ice , and so hailed it , much to the amusement of the captain . Thus we steamed on , always through the same sublime scenery , until we arrived , at ten o'clock , at the bend just below the " Big Cafion . " It was still light , but some difficult passages lay just ahead of us ; and as full daylight , and plenty of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to the bank and in a few minutes were securely tied up under the lee of a point which juts out into the river just above us . Below , and midway in the river , there is a long , low sand island , and on the point of it , next to us , was encamped a party of Indians , with an enormous thirty-paddle canoe of solid cedar ; it was a beautiful model , as are all of the canoes of these Indians . This , being an extraordinarily large one , had attracted my attention as it left Fort Wrangel , two days before we did , with a small American flag flying from a short staff , stuck in a hole made for it in the solid wood of the high stern . The Indians were cooking their supper on the sand , their canoe being pulled well up out of the water ; they had evidently arrived but a short time before us . Night soon shut down , and after supper and a diversion of cards and music , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitement of sight-seeing had worn us all out , and we needed no opiate to send us off posthaste into the Land of Nod . I was sleeping like a baby when the morning stir and the swash of the water against the cabin bulkheads , in deck-washing , awoke me , and I dressed and went on deck , where I learned that , on getting steam , it was discovered that the tubes were again leaking , and that it had been necessary to let the fires go out , so that the engineer might get at the tubes again ; for every pound of steam is most valuable in stemming this powerful current , and the worst of our trip was to come . A movement among our Indian friends on the sand island now attracted our attention ; they had their huge canoe in the water , their camp equipage all on board , and all but three of their party were seated . Of these three , two were at the bow and one at the stern , holding her in ; the current from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head of the island , and then swept along the side on which they were with great yelocity ,  --  so great that the water was banked up at least six inches in the swiftest of it , while between this elevation and the shore to which they were holding , there was a sufficient eddy to make her berth a comparatively easy one . We could hear nothing , of course , of their conversation ; but , with our glasses upon them , we saw the steersman throw up his hand as a signal ; the three men leap into the canoe ; with one accord , the crew sprang to their pdddles . The strug // gle was to cross the swift current outside of the eddy . They took it quartering , with the paddles bending and springing to their limit , and the two steering paddles at the stem trying to hold them up to it . If any boat in the world could cross such a " mill-tail " that canoe , with her beautiful lines , ought to have done it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was whirling down stream like a teetotum , and all control of her was lost until she had gone the whole length of the island , where the current seemed to have lost some of its power , or where it had been distributed over the width of the stream . They then took once more to their paddles , and , crossing the river diagonally , got under the lee of the same promontory that had sheltered us during the night . They passed us with a greeting of " Cla-how-ya ? " ( How are you ? ) and went around the point and out of sight . At noon , the engineer reported that the tubes were again in good order , and that sufficient steam-power to send us ahead was to be had for the asking . The lines were cast oW the bell-signal made to the engineer to " open her out wide , " and once more we were under way , enjoying every moment in the grandeur of the scenery ; it was eternal change in eternal sameness ; there were always mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , different snow , different glaciers , and the constantly changing atmospheric effects , the great , sweeping shadows of clouds across the faces of the mountains , the variously tinted spray of the leaping cascades , all combined to make monotony impossible . And then , too , there was just sufficient sense of danger in the navigation of this tearing , boiling river to give a spice to the feast . Three i ' . i*i. brought us up to the " Great Cafion , " where the whole of this great river flows through a cleft in the mountains but fifty yards wide . One can readily imagine the force with which the mass of water tears through this cut ; it is , as is said of " The Dalles " of the Columbia , a river set on edge . To go through it looks impossible ; and , although but about two hundred yards in length , it seemed almost madness to subject the steamer to the strain incident to an attempt at a passage . The run through , however , is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully framed by the sky , the water , and these eternal rocks . The signal was givefi for a full head of steam and at it we went ! An involuntary shudder ran through us as the gray , rocky faces shut us in ; they seemed , as we got fairly under them , to incline from the perpendicular toward us , ready to fall and crush us to the bottom as a punishment for our temerity . The wheel threw the spray as high as the smoke-stack in its maddening whirl ; every timber and brace groaned and creaked as the fearful rush of the waters struck the boat , but she lessened the distance inch by inch , until , in fifteen minutes from the time of entrance we were fairly through and looking back on another picture through the same frame of sky , rocks and water . We soon came down to the jog-trot which we had maintained for the greater part of the distance from the mouth . From this point the mountains decrease in size very perceptibly ; they would still be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those that we have left behind . At six i . M. we passed thro*igh " Cloutchman 's ( Woman 's ) Cafion . " It is smaller than the others and is so called because the navigation through it is so much less difficult that a woman can steer a canoe through it without trouble . We made but one bite at this cherry of a cafion and emerged at the other end to find a cherry that required a good deal of biting . The current was terribly swift and the boat hung and shivered like a living being , for a time scarcely seeming to move as we watched the trees upon the shore for parallax ; but as we held our breath we saw that she did gradually climb the watery slope until at last we ran into a place that gave her a little rest , when she plucked up her courage and showed , by the more cheerful action of her machinery , that she still had ambition left for anything that the captain saw fit to put her at . And she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the bugbear of these river men , was ahead of us , and we were all looking out for the first glimpse of it with a curiosity not unmixed with anxiety . Early this year the Glenora , one of the opposition boats , took a strong sheer while trying to make this passage , struck a rock and knocked a hole in her side that a man could have crept through . There are several inches more of water , however , on the rapids , the captain tells us , than when the Glenora fiasco occurred ; and as we have great faith in the skill of our friend at the wheel we await patiently our arrival . A sudden bend in the channel threw us out from the wooded point of a mountain declivity and there , right before us , rushed the rapid , foaming and leaping // in its wild descent . The river just above the top of this water-slope is contracted by the close encroachment of two of the mountains and spreading out below to about six times its width makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any boat that can not be handled with ease on a heavy dew . Where we are to try it , however , the river , just after it passes the gorge , is met by an island which sends a fair portion of the water around a strong bend to the left , and although it looks no deeper than where one would ordinarily wade out , on a ripple , after trout , toward it the captain points the bow of his boat and at eight * . M. we are fairly upon it . The wheel seems to fly ; its rapid motion appears to draw out what lit- tle water there is under us and the vessel settles down as if we were about to touch upon the bottom . Iron , steel and brain were pitted against the torrent ; the hull springs and vibrates so that a mist seems to be in front of one 's eyes as they are strained to take in any sign of a forward movement . The onward movement seems impossible ; the desire to assist the boat by pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is in the direction of the course becomes irresistible ; she hangs , she recedes ; the current is too strong for her ! All turn to the captain with a look of appeal . He whirls the wheel over , and , trembling in every timber , she creeps diagonally across the torrent , and again , when quite in shore , obeys her wheel , turns her bow to the current and *stops to take breath . If anything should give way now the result would be most disastrous . Again the wheel is pressed over and again she slowly obeys her propelling power , quartering the rapid and gaining perhaps one-quarter of her length in the right direction before the shore of the island . brings her up . Thus , by successive tacks , we finally master the difficult passage and take at the top the first good breath that we have drawn for twenty minutes . A good thrower could cast a stone the length of the rapids and yet it is all that steel and steam can do to drive our light hull over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grand Rapids over , the Beaver was again jogging along comfortably , and with a nod of congratulation at the captain , we backed ourselves down.the steep stair-way to the saloon deck . A glance through the forward cabin windows showed us that a bend in the river had brought in view a wooding station where we were to tie up for the night . The captain soon dropped the boat in alongside of the bank as gingerly as if her hull were an eggshell ; we are made fast ; the wheel ceased its crazy whirl , and the decks , which had vibrated throughout the long day in response to the " hog chains , " became as quiet as the floors of an inland cottage . What a relief it was to both ears and nerves ! The silence was in such contrast that the sound of one 's voice was almost startling ; that of the steward was , however , very soothing as he announced supper . The country toward Glenora loses much of its wildness , the land rising in immense terraces for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance can be seen peaks , blue and indistinct , similar to those through which the river forces its way . Much placer gold mining has been done from time to time along the banks of the Stickeen and with some success ; and this morning we have passed evidences of it in the dilapidated huts and half tumbled-down sluices ; not one of these places is now in operation ; the miners having pressed forward for their share in the greater discoveries of the Cassiar gold fields . Fout miles below Glenora we pass an Indian rancheria or settlement called Shakesville , consisting of two houses , constructed of logs set on end . One of these was roofed with enormous shingles called " shakes , " and the other with large pieces of bark and pine-boughs . In front , and between them and the river , were drying-frames , on which were suspended quantities of salmon , which were being cured for winter 's use ; and hauled up on the bank were two large canoes , covered from stem to stern with mats made of plaited grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a number of naked Indian children watching the passage of our boat . At half past seven A. M. , we reached the Hudson Bay Company 's trading post , one mile below Glenora . This post was established in 1874 , when it was discovered that the old post , lower down the river , was within the boundary line of Alaska ; the company has a substantial warehouse built upon the bank of the river , in which are stored the multifarious articles that are needed in trading for furs with the Indians of the interior , besides a large stock of goods necessary to the miners of Cassiar . Just across the river is another old mining sluice , abandoned and falling to pieces ; the trough gaping wide open in many places , and the supporting trestle-work reeling about // in the drunkenest way possible , and looking for all the world like a " water-way " on a spree . Soon after leaving the Hudson Bay post , we rounded the point of land on which the company 's buildings are situated , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. M. , were lying broadside on the gently sloping sand-beach which forms its levee , with our hawsers made fast to the " snubbing-posts " ashore . As we were to remain here until the next morning , sight-seeing became the order of the day , and we all went ashore . The town is built on a low plateau that stretches back to the first bluff of the series of terraces which run like a huge staircase , to the distant mountains ; this plateau is but a few hundred yards wide , and here are collected about fifteen log-houses and Indian huts ; the houses are low and built of logs " chinked " with mud and moss , as a protection against the terrible winds of winter ; they all face toward the river and have inclosed yards and vegetable gardens at their back ; the front apartments are nearly all occupied as stores , the " living-rooms " being at the back ; while one , a very low barn of a building , sports across its front an enormous sign of cotton drilling stretched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its overgrown proportions , the tops of the windows and door . On this is painted , in a bold style of lettering , " Cosmopolitan Hotel . " The English have a custom-house here which is presided over by a pleasant , hospitable gentleman , Mr. Hunter . Having called upon us , he invited us very cordially to make him a visit , and so , following in the wake of the ladies of our party , of whom he had taken possession , we soon found ourselves at his house , a neat little cottage with a trim walk bordered with shells , leading up to it . Although it was small , we found , upon entering , that it was filled with many comforts and elegancies . After a very pleasant chat , our host accompanied us on a tour of inspection of some of the gardens . Considering the latitude , 580 north , and the shortness of the growing season , we were very much astonished at the size and varieties of the vegetables raised : there were onions , cabbages , turnips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full head , a patch of oats and another of the Mexican clover ( alfalfa ) , as well as some of the common , hardier flowers ,  --  and this in a country that has a summer of not more than three months , and where , in winter , the thermometer goes as low as * below zero . One might think that the ground would be frozen so deep that the short summer would barely suffice to take the frost from it . The unloading of the boat made the levee very lively , and everybody seemed to be employed in some way or other . We were not only permitted to inspect the gardens and the exteriors of the houses , but were taken , by the main strength of kindly feeling into each and every family ; the interiors were homely but comfortable , and if black with smoke ; it only told of the cozy , roaring fires and , the comfortable groups that sat around them during the imprisoning cold of the winter months . Sun-down saw us again assembled in the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our new friends ashore , who came off for a good talk about the doings of the outside world ; old news to us was new to them ; things that had been wonderful to us when they occurred , months ago , were to them a new wonder ; but our budget was after a while emptied and turned inside out , and we then betook ourselves to music . Scotch , English , Irish , and American airs succeeded each other rapidly , and we sang and played on and on until we were aroused by the most unearthly , unmusical din ashore that I have ever heard , and with one accord we rushed out on the guards of the boat to find out what it meant . Lights were flashing about amid the din of beaten kettles and pans , the blowing of horns , the firing of guns and pistols and the howling and yelping of dogs . Some one suggested that it might be a " calathumpian serenade , " and then it flashed upon us that Mr. Lovell was being made the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , who came up with us , and that the inhabitants , in the absence of a brass band and the usual musical paraphernalia , had had recourse to their kitchen utensils . We stood upon the guards wondering how long Mr. Lovell could stand the din before he capitulated , and whether , when he did appear , his reception of his wife 's admirers would be with a loaded shot-gun or outstretched , welcoming hands . Suddenly a light streamed through the opened door of the store upon bronzed faces and gleaming pans and kettles , and the figure of Mr. Lovell could be seen in strong relief against the light within , bidding the calathumpers , by a wave of his hand , to enter and partake of his hos*itality . The closing door then shut the light in , and all was quiet . By this time it was quite late , and our // guests gave us good-bye and God-speed , as we were to cast off our lines by early daylight , and , D. K , to be in Fort Wrangel before night-fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily . I was anxious to see every inch of it , and made my arrangements to be awakened early , and after a delightful night 's rest turn out willingly when called . After a good dash into the cold water in my state-room , I got on deck at half-past four o'clock , just as the head-line had been cast off and the boat was swinging her bow out into the current . She spun to it like a top , the rushing stream caused her to " heel over " strongly as it struck her broadside on , and then , as her head pointed quartering down the river , the stern line was let go , and we shot away like an arrow from a bow , doing the distance to the Hudson Bay post , which took us twenty minutes in coming up , in three minutes ; it was like flying . We passed over the Grand Rapids beautifully , but . here there was such a pitch and roar of water that the wheel had to be reversed to keep the vessel from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being exciting , to say the least . The steering of the boat in the descent of this river was something marvelous to me . She seemed to obey the will of the captain like a sentient being . Now she whirled suddenly , with her bow as a pivot , *nd now her bow swept through an arc with the stern as a center , always nearly striking an obstacle but always missing it . The steering wheel was being constantly whirled about , as , in the swiftness of our course , object after object , in quick succession , arose before us . We flew past the mountains , which appeared to be engaged in a mad circular dance . Thus we sweep along until we arrive at the Great Cafion . The rush of waters through this cut seems terrible , but as there is an upstream wind which , by its concentration in the narrow gorge , is in considerable force , the captain laid the boat directly across the stream , and the wind , acting on her broadside in a direction diametrically opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wheel , but still with great velocity , having been fifteen minutes in making the passage on our way up , and but three minutes and fifty seconds in going down . Clearing the lower end , the captain swung her on her heel and away we went , right end on again . On and on we flew ! Sand-bars with their piled-up logs , tumbling , foaming mountain torrents , baby glaciers , wooding stations , canoe loads of Indians working their way up , great mountain peaks , the Mud Glacier , and the old Hudson Bay post all are rapidly left behind until , at noon , we reached the Great Glacier , and passed its whole face in review as it lay like the Palisades of the Hudson done in ice . With a full wheel whirling behind us , we moved out of the mouth of the river into the slaty blue of the salt water around the Point , bringing the flag-staff of Fort Wrangel in sight , and at five thirty , P. *. , were heaving our lines to eager hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet us , and everybody well .
