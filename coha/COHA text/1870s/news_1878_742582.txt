txt The practical question which must now present itself to the business community in connection with the Silver bill relates to its probable effects . Those may be considered differently , as they shall be immediate or remote . The more immediate operation of the bill will probably be as follows : The Secretary of the Treasury will proceed to buy in the open market $5,000,000 " worth " of silver bullion . As , under the law , there will be three different legal-tender dollars , it may occasion Mr. SHERMAN some embarrassment td decide as to whether ho will estimate the " worth " of the bullion he is directed to buy in gold , hi legal-tender notes , or in silver . His choice may make a difference of half a million dollars in the amount of bullion bought . But that is a matter of no very grave consequence , and we refer to it only as an illustration of the bungling character of the bill . Of the first purchase , it is estimated by the Director of the Mint that there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,000,000 the next , and that a total of $30,000,000 might be reached before the close of the year . Nothing in the law , however , will.require the Treasury to coin over $20,000 , - 000 during 1878 . It will then be for the Secretary to determine , in the absence of further legislation , what shall be done with the silver thus coined . We assume that it will be paid out in the ordinary disbursements of the Government . It is true that this is not distinctly required by the letter of the law , but it is required by its spirit , and it is not in harmony with the principles of representative government that the Executive shall assume to defeat the purpose of the people as expressed in the acts of Congress , however ill-advised that purpose may be . Moreover , under the construction which Mr. SHERMAN is known to give to existing statutes , the entire revenue of the Government is insufficient to meet the demands upon it for ordinary expenses and for the sinking fund . It is safe , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bill - will he passed out as fast as it shall be received . When it shall have reached the public it will be used mainly for paying duties . Assuming that the relative values of silver , paper , and gold remain nearly as they now are , there is a greater advantage in paying duties in silver than in any other extensive use to which it can be put . As the duties on imports will , by the latest official estimates ; approximate $130 , - 000,000 for the current year , of which $95,000,000 remain to be paid , and as the supply of legal-tender silver dollars will not exceed $30,000,000 , and may be less , it , is reasonable to assume that during the present calendar year , at least , silver dollars will be worth more in the United States than the amount of bullion contained in them would be worth at current market rates . This fact will tend strongly to prevent the depreciation in our bonds held abroad which would otherwise take place , though it is by no means ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that depreciation would result from the actual receipt of their interest in silver by foreign bondholders , it may be for the present practically disregarded ; in the first place , because the Treasury will probably continue to pay interest in gold as long as gold can be obtained , and in the second place , because the demand for silver which we have pointed out will for the . time being enable silver . even if paid to the foreign bondholders for interest , to be sold in our market at near the - price of gold . . But , as the London Times was obliged to indicate in its article of yesterday , it is not only by cool and accurate calculation of known facts that the course of our bonds abroad is likely to be affected .. They may be thrown upon the market in what that journal describes as a " panic , " of which it already sees signs , and in that ease , the consequences to . the holders , and this country Eis ? well , might only too probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our bonds for sale abroad , not , only would the United States suffer in the appreciation of gold , but in the blow-that would be given to confidence , a very important matter at the present moment . And this leads us to the consideration of the ultimate effect of the Silver bill upon the . commercial interests of our people . What the opinion of all who are regarded as best informed , in financial circles is upon this point it is not necessary to repeat in detail . The Silver law provides the United States with a legal tender which for a long time has been'very unstable in its intrinsic value . If we adhere to the policy of this law , and the fluctuations of even the past sixteen months , recur , then , in proportion as silver is coined , we shall feel more and more severely the evils which an unstable medium of payments brings with it . Capital , already paralyzed by the overwhelming losses to which it has been subjected during the past five years , will watch with intense anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in the changing value of our legal tender . Gold drawn from the country not only by the return of our bonds , but by every movement which may require the export of coin , will disappear , and silverIvIllgradnally become the only actual coin of the country and the basis of the remainder of our currency . Commerce , which , in all its legitimate developments , requires a reasonably clear outlook , will suffer from general distrust . Instead of the impulse of speculation which the authors of the Silver bill supposed that they were giving toward " good times , " we shall see the prevalence of greater and more disastrous dullness . Of the certainty of those effects and of the great decline of the public credit there can , unfortunately , be little reasonable doubt . It remains to be seen whether our leading financiers have the courage , the sagacity , and the strength to avoid the worst of these evils by using the time still left to them before the operation of the silver law becomes complete , to place their affairs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan we believe there need be no question , if the financial community is ready to adopt it . But we confess that we have no great confidence in its adoption . There has been very little in the attitude of our financiers to encourage such confidence . They have betrayed a curious mingling of timiditynnd over-confidence in the presence of the silver movement from the first . After belittling its strength and blindly hoping against hope for its defeat , they now sec it triumphant , and appear to have no clear conception of how its effects may be warded off . But it is for them to say , nevertheless , whether the great work of resumption of a sound currency shall be forced to a safe and happy issue , or whether it has been brought so near completion only , like the task of Sisyphus , to be begun over again with exhausted energies .
