UNDERGRADUATE LIFE AT OXFORD . FOR most Americans the subject of English college life is invested with an amount of romance which our ultra-iconoclastic disposition seldom allows to cling to anything . The venerable beauty of their two great universities , the traditions of famous men and incidents which cluster around them , and the medium of poetry and fiction through which come most of our ideas on the subject , have been chief factors in producing this result . Whatever we may think of the English universities as seats of learning and places for study , our impressions of the life of their residents are taken from such sources that they could scarcely be otherwise than somewhat idealized . The late Mr. Bristed attempted , some twenty-five years ago , to give us a quite minute description of Cambridge , from what he undoubtedly thought an American stand-point . But his book " Five Years at an English University " - contained little familiar information about undergraduate life , and was never widely enough read to have much influence in forming popular impressions . The same is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been published of late years , on kindred topics . We still go to " Tom Brown " and " Verdant Green , " " Pendennis " and " Ravenshoe , " as authoritative sources of information . There are description and information of this kind scattered very freely through English literature . The two old universities have always been favorite scenes with poets and novelists ,  --  sources of some of their happiest inspirations . The Clerk of Oxenford , who rode with Chaucer 's pilgrims , has been followed by a host of successors , who have not always , in later times , excelled in his particular direction . Yet the details , which are thus to be gathered , do not make a very complete picture for one who has no supply of plain facts with which to supplement them . And it is a question whether the suggestions which an American reader finds in English fiction , and to which he usually applies his imagination , inventing material to fill blank spaces , are not frequently misleading . The English have such an intense admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life at them , that it would be strange if their fiction did not tend to represent them in a partial and idealizing light . A foreigner , therefore , who simply takes these descriptions , which he meets in the familiar English novels , and forms from them his notions of undergraduate life at Oxford and Cambridge ,  --  subtracting nothing , and supplying whatever is not fully explained , in the spirit of the original , - will be certain to have ultimately a conception of a manner of existence vastly attractive to the romantic side of human nature ; but it will be not very accurate , and extremely incompleta* Still , there is much truth in such an ideal . One who seeks to realize it , if he brings to the task the right spirit and qualifications , need not be disappointed . An Englishman , leaving behind him the boyish restraints of his school ,  --  probably long since outgrown , - finds most of the elements of an earthly paradise in the admirable surroundings , the more mature and worldly atmosphere , and the relatively free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who goes into residence at Oxford , is even better fitted to appreciate , in the long run , the attractions of the life which lies before him . Instead of reveling in freedom , like the English freshman , an American is apt to find himself at first , running against curious and sornexvhat irksome restrictions . It will amuse and occasionally annoy him , to think that he is forbidden to pass the college gates after they are closed at nine o'clock . If he feels inclined for a stroll by the river in the forenoon , he may object to being told that such amusements are allotted to the latter part of the day , and that the morning is supposed to be devoted to work . But it will soon appear that the worst of these old regulations of university police are thoroughly a dead letter . One is relieved at discovering a slight fine to be the severest penalty for the breach of such as are enforced . The new-coiner learns with amazing quickness that , in spite of Latin rules to the contrary , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in study hours with perfect impunity ; and even after dark , the chances of meeting an alert proctor will scarcely warrant his wearing the academic uniform , if it happens to be undesirable . Such relics of the ancient sumptuary and police system as do demand his obedience , interfere scarcely at all with anything which one could do if they were altered , while they are so recommended by long usage , and so identified with the tone and habits of the place , that it is impossible not to acquiesce in them . Perhaps they even add to the charm of the life which , in their days of more active usefulness , they have done so much to form . Aside from this one circumstance , in which an Englishman is less likely to feel himself abused than an American , the latter is in much the better position to get from his university life-in distinction from the studies of the curriculum-all of the pleasure which it is capable of affording . His antecedents fit him admirably for doing so . Not that he can hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through who enters upon life at Oxford with grandly preconceived notions of what his experience will he . Nothing , however perfect , can satisfy an elaborate ideal , completely and at once . The Gothic structure which his imagination may have reared out of the somewhat scant materials at its command , will have to be reconstructed on a smaller scale , with some loss of fanciful ornamentation . The details connected with entrance into this strange college life will be harsh , almost , in their newness to him . But , when this disillusionating process is over , his ideal , so far from being abandoned , will grow again into more vigorous life , based on a better knowledge of actual facts . The beauties of Oxford and of Oxford life are not a myth , and such of them as do not appear at once to a stranger are made more attractive by their coyness . An American never wholly loses his first feeling of strangeness amid these surroundings , and , as it mingles with the familiar attachment which soon grows up , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Englishman , for whom there was never anything startlingly new in it . Comparison and contrast with all that has gone before in his experience constantly reveal fresh objects of admiration . But , after all , his greatest source of pleasure and of profit will be in studying the Englishman himself . Certainly there is an excellent opportunity offered to Americans for gaining an acquaintance with English character and social life , through the medium of their universities . It is rather a matter of surprise that they are not frequented more for this express purpose . The English universities , Oxford and Cambridge , are epitomes of English society . Instead of being local institutions , as are most , if not all , of the seminaries of this country and Germany , they are truly national . Instead of constituting , in themselves , peculiar and distinct features of the social systems in which they exist , they embody and represent society at large in a remarkably complete manner . The men are somewhat older than our students , and after the first schoolboyishness has worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respected place in general society , and introduce into their life all of its ideas and habits which their circumstances will admit . Their clubs are copies , on a limited scale , of the clubs in London . They even , as undergraduates , exert a perceptible influence , in some matters , on national affairs ; while the contempt with which our so-called practical men would regard any serious effort at influencing extra-collegiate opinion , which might emanate from a body of American students , can be easily imagined . The English universities reflect readily , when they do not help to form , public opinion . They are the more intensely English , in that they exert , on the whole , a conservative force upon social and political progress . But not one of the liberalizing movements of the present century  --  to which English society has itself // yielded-has failed to penetrate to the very shrines of these temples which it has erected to its ideal of culture , or to be xvelcomed ultimately by their high-priests . The advantages which such places offer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One may wander indefinitely through the streets and museums and show places of London , and spend months in seeking out the hidden beauties of unfrequented villages and cathedral cities , and , after all , he xviii not have that valuable insight into life and thought among the English educated classes , which even a brief intimacy with Oxford or Cambridge can give him . An American is always enough of a rara avis at Oxford to be sure of admission in$o almost any set . Only native gentlemanliness is necessary to insure him a good position . One of the smaller colleges , where the clique divisions are not marked , and can be easily overleaped , and where an intimacy like that of a large family pervades the whole body , from the master down to the latest arrival , is the best for the purpose I have pointed out . The senior men make it a duty , at such colleges , to give new-comers a chance to show what stuff they are made of , often religiously extending the principle to specimens so unattractive that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the confusion which this series of experiments creates , especially in the Michaelmas term , when the largest number of freshmen " goes up , " there gradually arises an orderly condition of things , where each one has assumed pretty nearly his true position . A school reputation for promise in boating or cricket , or for scholarship , desirable acquaintances among the senior men , or any distinctive mark , like that of coming from abroad , gives a new man a send-off ; no doubt . It is not very long since something of the kind was necessary to secure recognition and influence , and perhaps it still is so at Christ Church , Balliol , Exeter , and the colleges which are too large to have been thoroughly leavened by the modern spirit of democracy . But democracy has been working very potently in these undergraduate societies . There has been a vigorous attempt to soften down and remove the sharp lines of the aristocratical cliques , which we read of as forming such marked features of the university systems of only a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from invidious social distinctions . There can never be , of course , in any association of middle and upper class Englishmen , even a theoretical adoption of the French ideal of equality and fraternity , or of socialistic principles . Their social revolution has produced no more startling results than a relaxing of the strict demarcation lines of their old caste system , and the introduction of less arbitrary and more democratic rules of selection . The regulations of the university require every one to keep a certain number of terms , before he can offer himself for each of the " public , " or university , examinations . No matter how mature in years or wisdom one may be before he goes to Oxford , he must remain in residence a year , by the university calendar , before he is permitted to pass " Moderations , " and devote himself to work in any of the separate courses of study , which they call " Final Schools . " There is no such thing as entering at an advanced stage of the course , as one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after less than twelve terms of residence . This being the case , and as the rapidity of a student 's progress through these preliminary stages  --  the tadpole phase of his undergraduate existence-depends largely upon the pressure of circumstances on him , there is no test to correspond with the division into classes at an American college , and serve as a basis for social classification . Sets of men group themselves , accordingly , upon the natural principle of conformity of tastes and habits . The riding men , the boating men , the reading men , are likely to form closer and more lasting intimacies among those of their own way of life , than with others . But the tendency is now to avoid turning these natural associations into exclusive cliques . Men come together , quite irrespectively of them , at after-dinner " wines , " and Sunday morning breakfasts out of college , and try to keep up a general interchange of hospitality and good feeling . At almost any college , the freshman-while he may be looking forward with annoyance to the rather childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - has an opportunity of enjoying the best society to which he can establish a right . The life of English undergraduates differs in so many particulars from that of American students ,  --  negatives the few points of general resemblance by such numerous and striking contrasts ,  --  that little assistance is gained toward an understanding of it , through familiarity with the latter . Oxford // is a federation of independent colleges , and each of these distinct societies , in the exercise of its complete autonomy , has established customs and regulations which are entirely peculiar to itself . Most of these differences are simply curious , and have no especial significance ; but there are some which are of radical importance , giving a recognized character to the whole college . Often this character was impressed upon it by the object of its foundation , of which we have instances in the establishment of Jesus College , in 1571 , for the benefit of Weishmen , and the recent erection of Kieble for the sons of poor clergymen . Usually , however , it is the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather difficult to trace out . In some cases a college has kept a position , once obtained , for generations ; others rise and fall , fluctuating with the tide of fashion . Its individual reputation is sometimes assiduously cultivated , like that for athletic spirit at Brasenose , for aristocratic eminence at Christ Church , for scholarly free-thinking at Balliol , and for good-fellowship and gentlernanliness , at University . Sometimes , on the contrary , it is forced upon a college , and eagerly disowned , when possible , as in the case of the character of Magdalen for poor scholarship and fast living , and the low social repute of Queens and Wadham . In view of these differences , great and small , it is safe to presume of almost any st4ement which can be made in regard to life or work at Oxford , that there are many exceptions to it . With this warning , by way of preface , we may feel more secure in taking up , with little pretense to method , some of the features of this peculiar life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American , with the object of studying ,  --  not so much books as men and manners ,  --  settled in his new environment at Oxford , and try to gain an idea of what his experience will be . If he is lucky , he has obtained a room in college , but the chances are that he will have to lodge outside for a time . While he is making his way into familiarity with his surroundings , every day will be filled up with occupations , interesting at least from the novelty of their details . The forenoon is nominally given up to reading and attending lectures . The venerable regulations of the univerversity , which make it and the evening " study hours , " are only remembered , as I have observed , to be disregarded , by those who are so inclined . But if one cares at all for the classics , he will enjoy re-reading the A*neid or Horace , and furbishing up a Greek play or two in preparation for the first examination . There is enough that is peculiar about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greek prose composition , and Latin , as well as Greek , verses , are no longer required in any stage of the course at Oxford ; but the facility which is necessary to carry one through an ordinary college entrance examination in Latin composition , will put a fairly representative American graduate to his best paces . Lectures are chosen by each student for himself under the direction of his tutor , with reference to the books he proposes to read . Many of them are drearily u1*interesting . But , with the liberty which is allowed , it will be strange if any man of decided tastes can not find a dozen thoroughly enjoyable lectures a week to be attended . If an examination in Greek grammar , arithmetic , and Latin prose has no terrors for him , our inquisitive intruder within these precincts , hallowed by associations with half of England 's worthies , may spend his mornings as his disposition prompts . He may revel in the magnificent stores of the Bodleian , or dip into the new books and periodicals which are spread over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may study the mysteries of rackets , or fives , and wish that the English did not have a practical monopoly of those excellent games , or may walk out to Marston for a spin around the running track , or take a canter through English lanes or across country . If it is summer , he will be more taken by the idea of Worcester or New Gardens , with a book and a pipe , a study of the rooks which build in the trees over Addison 's walk at Magdalen , or a sculling boat on the deserted river . No one will care to interfere with him , and he will find plenty of countenance and as much companionship as he wants . But whether the morning has been passed in close application , in lazy trifling , or avowedly in amusement , the afternoon is , at Oxford , by universal consent , given up to exercise and relaxation . There are no lectures ; and he is thought a pretty close student who takes the last hour before dinner for his books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of health and pleasure . In their devotion to the open air , they stop for no s*verity of weather . If they did , Jupiter Pluvius establishes over England during the winter are undoubtedly at Oxford . The weather is then so uniformly bad that one ceases in practice to notice or care about it . Even rowing is pluckily kept up through the winter , though the cold sometimes bites sharply . Those who merely seek in it amusement and exercise may take them in some other form on the stormiest days . But the crews in training for the " torpid " races , which occur early in March , and the two " trial eights , " from which the " Varsity " is made up , never think of shirking this work . They regularly hurry down to the river through rain and wind and occasionally snow , muffled from ankles up to ears the moment before they get into their boats , in ulsters and comforters . The river does not freeze over , and there is seldom a troublesome quantity of floating ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerseys over their light rowing shirts , drop down a few rods to below the last of the barges , which serve the different colleges as boat-houses , where the superfluous clothing is removed , and then pull away at a sharp pace to the locks at Iffley . Here they turn , getting into their wraps , meanwhile , with a skill which comes of long practice and dire necessity , wait long enough to catch breath , and go up again , nearly at racing speed . This is usually done twice in the afternoon . The training for the great college races of the summer term , carried on , as it is , under the mild skies and frequent suns of April and May , is mere play in comparison with this . Still , in spite of its rigors and the grumbling which is called out by ice-coated oar-handles and frost-painted noses , I believe that Anglo-Saxon enthusiasm carries most men through the " torpid " training with a keen enjoyment . There is certainly a zest in the feeling with which one gives a parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , with mercury verging upon freezing point , and an ungentle wind searching out the weak spots in his system . I remember the curious sensation with which I once brushed off a half inch of snow from my seat , where it had fallen while the boat was waiting for us . But weather can not be always at its worst , even in Oxford during February . On a bright afternoon , at any time of the year , the scene on the river , and on the broad walk across Christ Church meadow to the barges , is like a carnival . Every college has a distinctive uniform for each of its crews , and all the colors of the rainbow and combinations unknown to the conventional fashion-makers of Paris are called into requisition by their ingenuity . The constant stream of these gay costumes to and from the river , and the shifting mass of boats in irregular procession on the narrow sream , give life to what is , even without them , a highly attractive picture . Everybody rows at Oxford , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university will seem to be crowded on that stretch of water , a mile long , and five or six rods wide . Yet there is no lack of devotees to every other kind of amusement which this amusement-loving people has invented . In the proper season , cricket attracts half its population away from the river ; and then is the time when the latter ceases to be a place for short , sharp exercise , which all one 's manliness can only make endurable , and becomes a grand holiday scene for miles in each direction . Boating parties , from which occasionally a sound of feminine voices is heard , make its windings merry with the not too regular plash of oars ; pedestrians frequent the towing path ; bathers seek out remote bends for a cool plunge ; and the inns at Sandford and Abingdon dispense a steady stream of beer to Oxford customers . Dinner in a college hall is not apt to be a very heavy meal , and yet undergraduates have pretty uniformly adopted the practice of doing nothing for an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , the time till eight o'clock is still sacred to the genius lad  --  a curious genius for a university , which the Italians call " sweet idleness . " In winter men gather over a bottle of port around some friend 's fire , in summer on the grass of the quadrangle ,  --  a word , by the way , of which one never hears the last two syllables . From eight till nine is the time when billiard-rooms are crowded , and men of all descriptions take a cue in a haphazard game of pool . Then the college gates are shut , and black-letter rules , weakly enforced by unwilling proctors , require every one to keep his room and spend the remainder of his waking hours in work . No one who lives out of college can go in after this , and those who have rooms inside are forbidden an exit . Those who are caught on the wrong side of the gates are allowed to pass them , of course , but are punished by a fine , with a sliding scale to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Oxford has settled down for // the evening ,  --  to reading , to cards , or to still other forms of amusement . There are seldom evening entertainments , either dramatic or social , in the town , to keep men out . The coffee-room at the " Union " is tolerably well filled , and the other clubs have a few stragglers all through the evening . This rough outline , which I have sketched , of the occupations of undergraduate Oxonians , represents a life of routine to which there are fewer and less important exceptions than one would be apt to imagine . There are , as I scarcely need say , men who read hard and waste no time in other employments , and others , of an eccentric tendency , who have hobbies which they ride constantly . But individuality of character usually appears only in variations from this common routine , not in exceptions to it . Monotonous in its outlines , this life is redeemed from monotony by variety of detail . Days are filled up with a succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suddenly over , to the surprise of every one . To stop and think amid such employments is impossible . As a result of the understood difficulty in accomplishing any serious work , many men prefer to read in vacation in order to have little to do during the term . The shortness of the academic year , which gives them more than six months away from Oxford , makes this quite feasible . Others , under the shadow of an imminent examination , stay at home , or find some other quiet place for study . But it is a very pleasant life for one who feels at liberty to enjoy it , and not a little good can be got out of it by a barbarian from this country in search of experience . In its economic and intellectual aspects , Oxford undergraduate life is still more interesting . The English collegian is an independent housekeeper . He has a wine-closet , table-service , and all of the ordinary household utensils , except those for cooking ; and the round of entertainments , including wine parties , breakfasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely in all of the works of fiction where he appears , is fostered by motives of convenience and sometimes even of economy , as well as by the spirit of conviviality . As the first two meals of the day are taken in the students ' own rooms , it naturally follows that a habit is formed among friends of eating them together in tolerably regular rotation . In the form that these entertainments take , there is the greatest variety . A few of the colleges encourage an active competition in display , and then they become elaborate and pretentious , and wines , in particular , are carried to an extreme , ending not unfrequently in a regular debauch . But as an undergraduate 's purse is seldom unlimited , where this sort of hospitality prevails it can only be indulged in occasionally . As a rule , enter .. tainments are conducted on an admirably moderate scale . Many of the college societies have very sensible regulations , which it is difficult to evade . At University , for instance , it is rarely that one breakfasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man orders for himself what he wants from the college buttery and kitchen , and simply has it served by his friend 's " scout " in his room . The host only bears the expense of the wine and the little dainties which the lions viva ; ils among his guests will expect to find , but which the college larder does not supply . At the wine parties , which commonly take the form of desserts immediately after " hall , " this rule could not be observed , as everything is brought in from out of college , but , except on extraordinary occasions , display is avoided , and there is extreme moderation in drinking . Englishmen are , in general , too familiar with the use of wine to be tempted to frequent excess . I doubt whether there is , throughout the university , more intemperance than at one of our city colleges , though the aggregate amount of drinking is far greater . But while these entertainments vary widely , they have certain characteristics in common which are readily discernible . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the university . Though the " scouts , " or college servants , are trained to make all the preparations , as only English domestics ever are trained , they involve on the whole a large outlay of money , time and thought . In each college they are governed by , and tend in turn to keep up , its peculiar social tone . It is in them that English undergraduates can be studied collectively to best advantage . In the talk that goes on around the hospitable board of an Oxford student , personal traits and idiosyncrasies appear very little . This small and intimate society is actually among the strictest , in its repression of all eccentricity , and as it has to use the rough methods which are solely available for such a purpose , in condemning eccentricity and ostentation , it silences individuality also . While everything appears to be informal and unconstrained , and is so to a certain extent , // each man has , consciously or otherwise , donned a conventional garb , which resembles , as nearly as may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this model that undergraduate character , and , a little more remotely , English character , appear . Strongly marked originality will seem at first very rare at Oxford to an American , a Frenchman or a German . When discovered , it will be only in the disclosures of a quiet f6/e-e*i-f6/e , after overcoming the reluctance of habitual reserve . Within the limitations of such a despotism as this general conversation must be monotonous and can never rise to be intellectual . Decided expressions of feeling or opinion seldom interrupt it . When they do , they are apt to be received with universal disapprobation , and the mistaken venturer may think himself lucky if this does not take its severest form - universal silence . But the ruling canons of taste forbid the ordinary talk of English undergraduates from becoming even scholarly . Nothing is more absolutely barred than " talking shop , " under which head they include all but the most casual allusions to the work which is , ostensibly , the common object of their university residence . There is one curious illustration of the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At dinner in hall , a custom , whose origin is lost in proper obscurity , imposes a fine upon any one who is guilty of a quotation from a Greek or Latin author , or from English poetry , or-strange association for profaneness or obscenity . This takes the form of a mulct of beer or wine for the benefit of the table , and is always made a great joke . But such humor sometimes has a deeper significance ; I do not know whether this custom rules at the " scholars " ' tables , but it is my impression that it generally does so . Subjects of conversation , in any general assemblage of undergraduates may be drawn from current politics or literature , but , if so , they are treated superficially . The chief interest centers in their own constantly recurring athletic contests , in regard to which the minutest details of information are eagerly imparted and received . Other matters relating to their university life are also canvassed again and again . But notice the questions asked : " Whether Star of Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First ' at the next Examination ? " " How many hours a day this friend is reading ? " and , " Whether that lecturer is not a bore ? " Deeper than this into the philosophy of university education it is forbidden to go . These facts are clues to a number of English characteristics , if not to English character . To explain them all by the one word , reserve , would be absurd , though it has much to do with producing this condition of things . Their habit of reserve enables many of these men , whose intellectual life is on an altogether higher plane , to mingle with the multitude without arousing feelings , either of inferiority and dislike , or of inferiority and emulation , and themselves to enjoy such companionship . But this only serves to point to the truth , that the typical young Englishman is not intellectual , not thoughtful-scarcely even serious . He is little inclined to speculate upon the past or the future and , in dealing with questions of the hour , is more anxious to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has not read much , when he goes up from school , outside of his classics ; and , at the university , it is a question between laying in more classics , and taking a course in history or law , to which he is quite satisfied to restrict his efforts . At the end , he knows enough about his specialty to get a " pass , " or perhaps squeeze in for a " third , " and has still read nothing else . He has none of that mass of undigested facts and crude opinions , which is the ordinary product of our system of education in a genuine American , and , which , though scarcely to be stated as the proper object of education , is a better product , for our purposes , than the English . For out-of-door exercise , the representative young Englishman is possessed by a passion , which follows him through life , until he grows too stiff , in turn , to chase a foot-ball , to wield a cricket-bat or throw the weight of his broad back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or handle a gun . He is fond of animals and keeps a dog ; and is too apt to judge of one 's regard for himself by the treatment accorded to this canine supporter . He is manly , full of animal spirits , modest , good-natured , and accessible-to those whom he likes . He is not intensely religious , though he may be reading divinity , but is a firm adherent of the established church , and intolerant of free-thinking to the last degree . His morality is formed upon his ideas of gentlemanliness . He is mature , as I have remarked , - because he is not ambitious enough to aim at knowing everything and being everything at once , like an American , or at doing // something new and great , like a German ; so that he is able to get rid of crudity very soon after coming under the inifuences of the university , and to settle down into the character which he is to carry , with no violent changes , through his life . It is no new discovery that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as developed by the universities . But studying character in a series of personal experiences is a quite different thing from getting it out of books , although the conclusions reached may be the same , or may , even , be less broad and true than those attainable through a comparison of others ' experiences . It is certain , however , that , before long , a genuine Americanambitious , energetic , speculative-will grow restless under such artificial restrictions , and begin to seek for some more congenial society . Even within his college he can hardly fail to find it . His relations with the instructors will be pleasant . He will find himself meeting them , now and then , on almost intimate terms . And there are , of course , undergraduates in every college , who , while they are marked by all that is admirable in the English type of character , have nothing commonplace about them . The individual worth of such men is enhanced by their modesty . Those who have read and thought to real advantage are no more rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heidelberg . The difference is that there is no temptation to parade , and less inclination to it than among young Germans and Americans . It is my conclusion that the thoughtless , unintellectual tone of English undergraduate society , is rightly attributed by Englishmen , whose pride re* sents any further explanation , to the unwillingness of those who have valuable mental stores to hawk them for the general benefit . But beneath this fact there is another-at once its cause , and the true key to the whole situation-which I should state thus : when one descends from the small circle of those who have read much and thought carefully , he falls in with scarcely any who have read some things , and got some good out of them , but comes at once upon an army of Philistines , who have read nothing but a few text-books , and thought as little as they could . One who makes his way into Oxford undergraduate society for the purpose of getting an inside view of England and the English , must ordinarily be too mature to suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an earlier point of development . So far from being injuriously affected by the enervating tendency of Oxford life , he will find it the thing best worth studying ,  --  the very thing which makes his object attainable . An independent character , once thoroughly developed , may be even led to a truer knowledge of itself : , to a better-directed energy , by contact with antagonistic principles . There appears no reason at all why an American education should not be supplemented by such a residence at an English university . But I doubt whether a course of study under these social influences is , in many cases , a desirable substitute for that at an American college , at the age at which our young men usually leave school . It is true that the advantages for study are in one sense great , and the assistance which is offered would be very useful , if the most were made of it . But it is not probable that an American , at that age , will do far otherwise than those around him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No active incentives are brought to bear on him ; but-by example , certainly , and indirectly by precept  --  a powerful influence toward mental inertness . He , may resist this ; and then he will probably come away a scholarly dilettante , with a disqualification for any rougher work or less civilized life than is within the limited ken of the conventional English man of culture . I do not say that he may not escape this , also . I must avoid overdrawing the strength of the deleterious influence which I should fear for an immature American . My idea is that , while there is less room for dilettanteism in our uncompromising , ungloved civilization , than in the English , an American at Oxford is , on general principles , more likely than an Englishman to be drawn irresistibly into the current which sweeps toward this gulf . In building up their social and educational systems together , the English have adapted the latter to the former with the most perfect economy . It satisfies their own wants . The exact wants of other people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations suggested by the proposal , which we now hear not infrequently , to substitute an English for an American university course , which intimately concern the future of our own system of higher education . If a preference of the English course is justifiable , it will practically settle the question of the availability of their model as a guide for our efforts // in the development of our own universities , which is one of the grave problems for this generation of Americans to decide . It will be a not unfit conclusion to my effort to sketch , in one of its important aspects , the most prominent representative of English ideas of education , if I enter a little into the merits of this question . And as the German university scheme is the competitive model for our adoption , our examination of parallelisms and divergencies in our own and the English systems will be more instructive , if it is also included . The present differences between these three educational systems can be best arrived at through a statement of their objects . We , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread our efforts very widely , scarcely failing to run our plow-share into at least a corner of every field within the known and habitable territory of knowledge . Our aim , as it is intelligently understood by those who have studied it , is instruction or information . All that our colleges have-until recently-attempted , has been to lay a broad foundation for life-work and self-education . The fault of our scheme has been superficiality and incompleteness ; its merit , breadth and suggestiveness . The Germans pursue very much the same course at their gymnasia , which are the real rivals of our colleges and of the " academical departments ' * in our universities . But once at the university , they change their method , drop all but one subject , and carry proficiency in that to a degree which excites our envy . Their object in the university course is not information , in the sense in which I have used it , or education , in any sense ; but training . Their universities are able to turn out highly trained specialists , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is intelligent specialization , and the whole system administers a reproof at once to those who decry , and to those who ignorantly grasp at , its fruits . The English , in their universities , now specialize also , but not so strictly and not from the beginning of the curriculum . Their " Final Schools " are broader than a German 's special course , and do not commonly exclude one another . Traversing , as they do , a more extended space , they are not able to reduce it to possession so completely , and are not trained for dealing independently with their specialties at once . The cure of souls appears indeed to be taught sufficiently in the " Divinity School " VOL . XVIJ. - 23.  --  or course-at the English universities , for young curates step directly from the hall where they take their bachelor 's degree into parish work . But in no other profession is this true . The bachelor of medicine goes into a London hospital , or to Paris or Vienna , before he opens an office ; the bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The student of science attends lectures in London , or goes to the Continent . Perhaps pure mathematics , at Cambridge , should be excepted from this statement , but I know of nothing else . On the other hand , the English public schools are not German gymnasia , but almost confine themselves to a classical course , as a result of which we have seen that a graduate of Oxford may be , and often is , actually ignorant of many subjects which come equally within the scope of the German system of education and our own . The object of the English who support the two old universities , has been frequently alluded to in the preceding pages . It is cuiture ,  --  a word which , in conventional English usage , has had a peculiar meaning , not referring so much to symmetrical development , and a broad intellectual horizon , as to a combination of the tastes and manners of good society , with a pretty talent for Greek verses . This is what their universities have been . Just now there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the powers that be , which betoken an awakening to new life . It must be said for them that they have abolished recently a large number of venerable abuses , and that they have pursued their ideal of culture very successfully . Such is an outline of the differences which these three systems present . Which of them is the better , and which will prevail ; or if we admit that our own is unsatisfactory , to which of the others shall we look for suggestions ? A slight review of history will show us that the German is at least leading in the direct course which events and changes have been taking , and are likely to take . The evolution of a scheme of education is , in its general contour , one of the simplest processes to be traced out in the history of modern civilized peoples . We can follow it from the time of scholastic logic and would-be philosophy  --  the dark ages-through the awakening period , which we are just leaving behind us , with its eagerness after universal knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq has not implicit faith in American creative genius . If we grasp so inconsiderately at German success , we may find ourselves stranded on the very English error which we wish to avoid still , as we have done . But there is still a third plan of action , more promising than either of the others , which has been recently inaugurated at Yale , in the establishment of graduate courses of study . If we admit the somewhat distasteful fact that in our old colleges and academical departments we have gymnasia already , and nothing more , the adoption of this plan would seem to follow on the simplest economic principles . I believe that this is the destiny of the American system of education . But if it is , our future gymnasia  --  the present " academical departments " of our so-called universitiesshould not , in the meantime , be changed in any radical way . Optional studies ought to be introduced in them sparingly , if at all , and in such a manner as only to better the good work which they have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we need more than anything else . Scientific and professional schools should be made not auxiliary , but supplemental to the central academy , and then they , with what we now call graduate courses , would be our universities , as soon as funds could be obtained to endow more professorships , and students induced to lengthen out a four years ' course to seven . It may be asked why , in pursuing this plan , it would be undesirable to yield , temporarily , to the not very intelligent popular clamor for immediate change , in the direction of specialization . To this the English experience is a sufficient answer . Such a change in our situation would be an obstacle to complete development-another illustration of the manner in which , as Spencer has so clearly pointed out , structure , too hastily arrived at , may impede progress .
