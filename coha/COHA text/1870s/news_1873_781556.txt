txt By the death of Hon. JAMES L. ORR. of South Carolina . the nation has lost one of the most valuable of its public men . His course since the war has done much to soften the asperities left by the conflict , and the example he set in the unqualified acceptance of the results of the contest was worth more to his country than has ever been admitted . Almost alone among the men of the South prominent before the war , who gave an earnest and zealous support to the Government at its close , the effect of his course upon the people of his section undoubtedly did much to aid in the pacification of the country . The death of Judge ORR , just as he had entered a new and more elevated field of usefulness and honor , will be sincerely regretted . What he was before the rebellion , what he might have been but was not during the rebellion , is forgotten in the later and . vital service he had the patriotism and ability to render his distracted country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities of the Republic are unlimited . Coming to public life without unusual advantages , he became even in his early manhood one whom the proud aristocracy of South Carolina delighted to honor . A member of the State Legislature at twenty-three , when that body was a close corporation of the bluest blood of the Commonwealth , and sent to Congress at a time when South Carolina limited her choice of public servants to a small and very select circle , the marks of pottier confidence he received were Crib : utes to lin personal worth . A. man of remarkably impressive presence , rare eloquence , great force of character , singular originality , and . warm sympathies , his chief hold.on the respect and confidence of the people was his unbending probity . JAMES L. ORR kept his conscience so clear and bright , it could . mirror his inmost life to the gaze of all the world , without causing him a single pang . More than all his eloquence and grace , more than his intellectual strength , this quality placed . him and kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , as was inevitable , with the views of his Stale , yet deleted 2 lines they involved , sympa izrng with the toiling millions , yet convinced that slavery was the best estate for the negro , and having a strong love for the Union as it had come down from the Fathers of the Republic , his public life before the rebellion was full of seeming contradictions . He was a Democrat of the most pronounced type , but yet a Democrat who thought slavery could be preserved and the Union maintained by compromises . He made the mistake natural and common to his section , of underrating the forces arrayed against the institutions and political theories of his State . It was certain that such a man as he would drift on the waves of civil war just as be did . Striving to the last to avert the conflict by puling compromises which men of clearer vision knew to be impossible , he naturally went with his section , but his heart not being in the struggle . be gained no distinction in its councils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great opportunity of his life came . Previous to that time he had been merely the successful politician ; then he became a statesman . He saw and appreciated the needs of the South , and at the price of temporary obloquy he put himself in the van of a humiliated people to lead . them into perfect accord with their conquerors . He know that until the Southern people had become indoctrinated with political ideas to which they were entire strangers , there was no hope for the pacification and rehabilitation of the South , and to this end he directed his powerful personal influence . By precept and example he labored to build up a national feeling in the South upon an entirely new basis , and how much he did toward it can only be appreciated when we remember now great was the repugnance at the close of the war in his section , to cordial relations with the " Yankee " Government . The spectacle of JAMES L. ORR in active sympathy with that Government , taking office wider it . and laboring for it , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of the great services he rendered during the trying ordeal of reconstruction , he must be classed among statesmen and gratefully remembered by his country .
