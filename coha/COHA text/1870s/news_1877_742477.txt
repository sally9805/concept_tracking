txt That the President has a difficult task to perform in selecting nominees to the civil service in the South will be generally conceded . The positions to be filled are relatively more important than similar ones in the North , and the character and conduct of those who may be appointed to them must have more influence on public opinion than would be the case in this section . For some years back the Federal office-holders in the South have not only been active politicians , but they have been practically the only leaders possessed by the Republican Party there . Whether as politicians or as officials , they have not as a rule been remarkably successful . With some honest and brave men among them , they have as a class brought more discredit than credit upon themselves and upon those who have been connected with them and responsible for them . It was very much to be desired that the President should make a thorough overhauling of the civil service in the South , and it can not be said that he has not had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seven months in which to get at the truth regarding the more important offie ers , and in which to select the successors of those whom he found it best to remove . Two courses were open to him , one or the other of which the country was le cl by his ante-election utterances and by his inaugural address to expect from him . The first was to include the Southern offices in a comprehensive and . well-digested system of removals and . appointments , in which provision should be made for ascertaining fitness by practical and uniform tests , and in which the politics of appointees should have no place . That would have been ideal civil service reform . It would have been conducting the business of the Government on business principles . It was what most of the more sincere and practical advocates of reform asked of the President , and what they wore at one time very confident that they would get . Such a system applied to the South , would have met with serious obstacles , and would have required firmness , sagacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves , we have no doubt that it could have been made to work . It is hardly necessary to say that , as no such system was adopted for the whole country , none was adopted , or , apparently , thought of , for the South . The other way which was open to the President was to seek to make the prominent officials of the South thoroughly respectable representatives of the Republican Party , to remove those who were deservedly obnoxious , and to replace them wherever it was possible by men free from the taint of earpet-bagism , identified in interest permanently with the South , with recognized respectability of character and qualifications , and of Republican convictions . This way , also , would not have been without its difficulties , and would : have required patience and tact to carry it out . We believe that in part an attempt has been made to put this plan into operation . That it has not been uniformly applied is nident from the fact that a number of Democrats have been selected on the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed , of whom it would be foolish to say that they were intended to present the party at its best . It has , unfortunately , not struck the President as necessary to give to the public any clear and authorized explanation of the facts in even the more important cases , and we are , therefore , left to judge of each by such information as is accessible . The judgment thus reached is not always favorable , and the public is sometimes left sorely puzzled to know on what grounds the President can claim that he is faithfully and efficiently carrying out the pledges which he gave before the election and in his inaugural . If Mr. HAYES were merely an ordinary representative of the old party methods , this would not be a very serious matter . People might say that he was not judicious in choosing his advisers , but the responsibility would largely fall on the party managers , and the results would not be criticised by an exacting standard . But the case is different with Mr. HAves . He is a professed reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere one . He has laid down for ? himself certain general principles , which require a specific system in order to their application , and it is natural for the public to examine his acts closely for indications as to whether such a system has been devised , what it is , and how consistently it is enforced . If very few indications of this kind are discovered , Mr. " AYES ' conceded good intentions will not count for much . There is a densely thronged pathway , with an evil goal , which is said to bo paved with good intentions . A matter in point is the nomination sent in yesterday to the Senate for the Collectorship at Now-Orleans . The nominee of the President is Mr. EFFINGHAM LAWRENCE . The acting Collector is Judge KING , who was named last Summer to succeed Col. CASEY , but whose name has now been replaced by that of Mr. LAWRENCE . It iEf reported that Mr. LAWRENCE is nominated at the behest of H. C. WARMOTH and his friends , because these gentlemen complain that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louisiana offices . The report is probably correct , as Mr. LAWRENCE is well known as a partner of WARmomrt , and , though a very different man from him , and a much better one , yet an intimate and useful associate of the ex-Governor . Moreover , it is difficult to conceive of any other very forcible reason for Mr. LAWRENCE 'S appointment . We presume it will not be contended that this act of the President is in pursuance of any definite system of civil service reform , or that it is at all consistent with the principles which he has laid down as essential to . such reform . Judge KING is not charged with being a poor or a bad officer , so far as we know . Mr. LAWRENCE is in no sense conspicuous for his qualifications for the place , and it is , as we have said , substantially certain that ho is named for the purpose of appeasing WARMOTH and his faction . But why should a reform President , bent on regenerating his party , purifying politics , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal Federal officer in New-Orleans to H. C. WARMOTH T That gentleman has clone a great deal to hurt the Republican Party and to injure the country , and very little to help either . He disgraced both by his notorious misbehavior as Governor of Louisiana ; he won the worst reputation for the worst kind of carpetbagism in all the South ; he betrayed the party in the campaign of 1872 , and he is creeping back into it now only because he thinks he can in that way best serve his selfish ends . There is something to be said in favor of a candid and just distribution of patronage with a view to strengthening party organization ; but there is nothing to be said for giving important offices into the hands of a treacherous , corrupt , and disgraced political adventurer such as Mr. WARMOTH is . Such a course is not sound patisanship , and we do not suppose any one is hardy enough to claim that it is reform of any kind .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
