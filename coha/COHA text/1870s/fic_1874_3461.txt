ISABEL LEICESTER , A ROMANCE , by MAUDE ALMA . " Twist ye , twine ye , even so , Mingled threads of joy and woe , Hope and fear , peace and strife , In the cord of human life . " HAMILTON : SPECTATOR PRINTING HOUSE . 1874 . ISABEL LEICESTER . CHAPTER I. In a spacious apartment superbly furnished , and surrounded by every luxury that could please the most fastidious taste , sat Isabel Leicester , attired in deep mourning , with her head resting upon her hand , her face almost as white as the handkerchief she held . Isabel 's Father had failed in business , and the misfortune had so preyed upon his mind , that he sank under it and died . The funeral had taken place that day , and she was to leave the house on the day following  --  the house where she was born and had always lived , except when at school . The servants had all been discharged but two , who were to leave next day . A friend had offered Isabel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which that friend Mrs. Arnold was endeavouring to obtain for her , in the family of a lady who had been one of Mrs. Arnold 's school-fellows . Mrs. Arnold was the widow of a clergyman , with a very limited income , and Isabel was unwilling to trespass upon the kindness of one whose means she knew to be so small . But she had no alternative at the time and trusted that it would not be long before she would be able to procure the situation she had in view , or some other . The tea remained untasted on the table , for Isabel was absorbed by the melancholy thoughts that filled her heart . She tried to feel resigned , but her pride was wounded at the idea of becoming a ' governess . ' She had been the spoiled petted daughter of a wealthy merchant of the city of New York , whose chief delight had been to indulge her in every way . But still Mr. Leicester had been a truly good and christian man , and had taught his daughter not to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth was given to us for the benefit of others , as well as for our own enjoyment . And he was rewarded as she grew up to find that her chief aim was to do good to the many poor families whose necessities came to her knowledge . Great also was his satisfaction to find that after two seasons in New York , where she had been the Belle , she was still the same loving , unassuming , pure-minded girl she had ever been , tho ' the admiration and attention her beauty and accomplishments had excited , had she been less carefully trained , might have rendered her haughty and vain . During her Father 's illness , when her time and thoughts were occupied with attending upon him , and in anxiety for his recovery she had thought and felt that the loss of property was an evil of little moment , and tried to persuade her Father not to think so much about the reverse , urging that he could get some employment , and they would still live very happily together in a cottage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one left to look too , her lonely and self-dependant position was felt severely , and the tears she could not restrain , fell unheeded . The fire sank low , and finally went out , and still Isabel sat thinking of the miserable prospect the future presented . At last she rose with a shudder , and rang for the tea-things to be removed , then retiring to her own room , she threw herself upon the bed in an agony of grief . She had remained there some time , when she felt a kind hand laid upon her shoulder , and turning her head she saw the old housekeeper , Mrs. Stewart , with a cup of hot tea . " Come my dear young lady , " said she , while the tears streamed down her aged cheeks , " You must take this , it will never do for you to go without your tea . " " I know you attach great virtue to a cup of tea " replied Isabel , " so to please you I will take it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she descended the stairs , " how pale and ill she looks , and no wonder poor lamb , if she goes on like this she will be laid up . Oh , how I wish Mrs. Mornington had not gone to Europe . Poor child , poor child . " After Mrs. Stewart had left her , Isabel knelt down and prayed for strength to do her duty , however trying she might find it , and for the holy spirit to comfort her in affliction , after which she retired to rest , and was soon in a calm sleep . Next morning she arose much refreshed , and having sought divine aid and protection , she commenced to arrange for her departure . Her Father 's creditors knowing him to be a man of strict integrity , and that his failure was not attributable to any want of prudence on his part , had kindly arranged that she should retain whatever she particularly wished . This was a great gratification to Isabel , tho ' she was too honorable to take an undue advantage of this benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . The task before her was a sad one , and although she strove very hard she could not restrain her tears as she made her selections . She was soon joined by Mrs. Arnold , who told her she had come to help her to pack , and that she should not leave until Isabel accompanied her . " Come " she said , kissing her affectionately , " the sooner this painful task is over my love the better . I have good news for you . I have heard from Mrs. Arlington , and she says that she shall be most happy to obtain the services of any one recommended by me . The salary I find is only two hundred dollars a year , it is indeed less than I expected , but you must remember that this is your first engagement , no doubt if you remain there a year or two , you will be able to obtain a much more remunerative one . " This announcement of Mrs. Arnold 's brought to Isabel 's mind in full force all the annoyances to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasping her hands , she gave way to uncontrollable emotion . " I do not wonder , dear , at your being disappointed , after what you have been used to , two hundred dollars must seem a very paltry sum . I dare say you gave nearly as much to your maid Harris , but my dear , as a governess your requirements will be less , so with the wardrobe you now possess , you will be able to manage very nicely . " " Oh , Mrs. Arnold , I was not thinking about the salary , I am sure I can make that do very well , " sobbed Isabel . " You are very kind indeed to trouble yourself so much about me . " " You need not go to Elm Grove at present , my love , you are quite welcome to stay with me until you get over your loss a little , and feel better able to conform to circumstances , " said Mrs. Arnold kindly . Isabel made an effort to respond gratefully to her kind friend , and expressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of her new situation . " I have no doubt you will be very comfortable at Elm Grove , it is a lovely place . Of course it will seem strange at first , but people soon get used to a place you know if they only try . I am very happy now , but I am sure at one time , I thought I never should be again , " continued Mrs. Arnold , " but we will say no more on that subject now , we must get on with our work . " And she began to give advice about what Isabel should take , and said that whatever she did not like to take with her to her new home , she could leave at her house . Fortunately the housekeeper then came to ask if she should pack . " Certainly , " exclaimed Mrs. Arnold , " the very person I wanted , " and off they went to Isabel 's great relief . Being left to herself , Isabel soon concluded her selection , and ordering Mary to take them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rest , and time to think , tho ' the latter she could scarcely do , as her temples throbbed violently . Laying her head on the old familiar couch , she endeavoured to calm the tumult of her feelings , the bright sunshine , and the merry sound of the sleigh bells outside , only made her feel her desolation more acutely . " Luncheon is ready dear , and the packing all done , " said Mrs. Arnold , throwing herself in an easy chair . " You have indeed been quick , " replied Isabel , heartily wishing they had been longer . " It is all due to Mrs. Stewart , she is really the most clever person at packing I ever saw , tho ' poor soul she was nearly blinded with tears . Come love , we must have luncheon now , and after that we will send for a sleigh . " " Indeed , dear Mrs. Arnold , I can not go until evening , I am sure Mr. Macdermott will be here presently , for he knows that I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be alone to muse of things in your dreamy way , but my love , it is better not to do so , it only makes things harder to bear . Try to banish disagreeable subjects as much as possible , that is my maxim . But I can not refuse you anything just now , so after luncheon I will go home , and will come back for you in the evening . " Soon after Mrs. Arnold 's departure , Mr. Macdermott the clergyman , called as Isabel had expected , and his sympathy , and advice , tended greatly to soothe the pain she felt at leaving the home she loved so well . He said that Mrs. Macdermott was still too ill to visit her , but that if she felt able she would try to see her at Mrs. Arnold 's . He told her also that he had that morning received a letter from Louis , in which he desired to be kindly remembered . Mr. Macdermott remarked the rich crimson that suffused her cheeks , at the mention of his nephew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered his mind . He remained with her about an hour , then after enquiring if he could be of any service to her , he took his leave . At last the dreaded hour arrived , and Mrs. Arnold with it . After bidding the housekeeper and Mary a kind farewell , ( they had both been with her a great many years , ) Isabel accompanied her friend to Rose Cottage . CHAPTER II . The setting sun shed its bright tints over the snow which lay thick upon the ground , making it glisten like diamonds , the cold was intense , and a bitter wind howled through the leafless trees , when the train arrived at M  --   --  , and Isabel almost benumbed with cold , procured a conveyance from the station to the Rock Hotel , where Mrs. Arlington had promised to send for her . On arriving at the hotel , she found the sleigh waiting punctual to the time appointed . Isabel would gladly have partaken of some refreshment , but Mrs. Arnold had informed her , that Mrs. Arlington was very particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt would have offended her , which she was very anxious to avoid although she was shivering with cold . It was a long drive of twelve miles to Elm Grove , but the horses went at a great speed , and in less than an hour they arrived at their destination . As they drew up at the door , it was opened by a footman , and a woman who seemed to be an upper servant met her in the hall , and conducted her to her room . " I suppose you would like some tea Miss , " she said " I will order it while you are taking off your things , and then I will show you the school-room . Mrs. Arlington and the young ladies are dressing for a ball , so they can not see you to-night . " When Norris had left the room , Isabel sat down with a sigh , and looked about to see what kind of accommodation she was to have . It was a nice sized room , with a bay window having an eastern aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was neatly , but plainly furnished , the fire had burnt low , and the room was cold . She took off her things as quickly as possible , and sincerely hoped that the school-room would be more comfortable . Norris soon returned , and Isabel desiring her to have more fuel put upon the fire descended to the school-room , which she found very bright and pleasant looking , the large fire and lamp making it look quite attractive . The tea was on the table , and Norris after saying " if you want anything Miss , please ring for Susan , " left the room . Isabel was very glad to have some refreshment after her cold drive , and when she rang to have the things removed , the bell was answered by a neat , pleasant looking girl , who had such a sunny face that it did one good to look at her , and presently a sweet little girl of about seven years old came running into the room , and going up to Isabel , said " you are our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much , but I ca n't stay now , for Eliza is waiting to put me to bed , but I did so want to see you to-night . Good night ! " and throwing her arms round Isabel 's neck , she gave her a hearty kiss , and disappeared as quickly as she came . When Isabel returned to her room she had no cause to complain of the fire which was piled to the top of the grate . When she awoke next morning it seemed very strange to be where she had not the least idea what any of the family were like . After dressing and arranging some of her things , she sat down to contemplate her situation , which she found anything but pleasant , so she determined to descend to the school-room . The door was open , and as she approached she overheard little Amy saying " she is the prettiest lady I ever saw , only she looks so pale and sad . " Isabel found three little girls in the room , of whom Amy was the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done on the preceding evening , the other two rose saying " good morning Miss Leicester , " but when she stooped to kiss them , Alice sulkily put up her face , and Rose laughed . " Fancy , Miss Manning kissing us " she whispered to her sister . " Hush ! " returned Alice , " she will hear . " Isabel spoke kindly to them , but Alice only returned unwilling , and Rose pert answers , so the breakfast was a dull unpleasant affair , and Isabel perceived they regarded the governess in the light of an enemy ; even little Amy became shy and uneasy . After breakfast Rose informed her that they always had half an hour before school for a run out of doors . As they were departing little Amy ran back , and coming close up to Isabel whispered " do n't cry Miss Leicester , I love you , indeed I do , " for Amy had noticed the tears that would come in spite of her efforts to repress them . Isabel drew the child to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with the others . Amy had scarcely gone , when Mrs. Arlington entered . She was tall and stately , rather cold and haughty , and very dignified and patronizing in her manner . She hoped Miss Leicester had been made comfortable , and was sure that she would like the children . She then informed her that the school hours were from nine until four , with an hour for dinner , then she would have to take them for a walk , after that her time was her own . She would take her meals with the children , but she would be happy to have her come into the drawing-room occasionally in the evening . She said that her own time was so much occupied with her elder daughters , that she was forced to leave the children entirely to the governess , but , that as Mrs. Arnold had so strongly recommended her she felt sure she should be satisfied , then bidding Miss Leicester a polite good morning , she swept majestically from the room . Poor Isabel , she had not expected quite so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children for walks , " that was a thing she had not thought of , and she did not relish the idea and as to going into the drawing-room , she could very well dispense with that . She was not aware that Mrs. Arlington intended her accomplished young governess to help to amuse her guests . Excessively annoyed , Isabel repaired to her own room to calm her ruffled feelings . At nine o'clock she went to the school-room and found her pupils there already , also a very pretty girl of about seventeen , whom they were coaxing to tell them about the ball . As Isabel entered the room , Amy exclaimed , " Miss Leicester this is Emily ! " Then Emily laughed merrily , and held out her hand saying , " I hope we shall be good friends Miss Leicester , I 'm sorry we were out last night . " " Oh ! Emily , I 'm sure you wanted very much to go to the ball , and you just now said that you enjoyed yourself exceedingly , " said Alice gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned Emily , but I am intruding upon school hours I fear , so if you will allow me Miss Leicester I will come for a chat before dinner . " Isabel bowed assent and Emily retired , rather annoyed that her advances had not met with a warmer reception . Shortly after Emily 's departure , a tall and very elegant looking girl of about twenty entered the room , and bowing condescendingly to Isabel , said , " have the goodness to try these songs Miss Leicester , I wish to know if there are any pretty ones among them , I would not trouble you only I am so excessively tired " she added , taking the most comfortable seat the room afforded ; this was done in the most easy manner possible , precluding of course the idea that it was by design . Miss Arlington upon entering any room , immediately perceived the nicest place , and having seen , at once took possession with an easy indifference , as if totally unconscious that she was monopolizing the best place . Isabel complied with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You sing very nicely Miss Leicester , " Miss Arlington said patronizingly . Isabel 's lip curled contemptuously , she presumed so when the crowded room had been hushed to perfect silence whenever she approached the piano , and when she ceased singing , the murmured praise and applause on all sides had sent the hot blood to her cheeks , and this not once or twice , but scores of times  --  she needed not to be told that she sang nicely . " She sings much better than you do Grace , " said Rose pertly . " Do n't be rude , Rose , " replied Grace , haughtily , " Miss Leicester will have some trouble with you I imagine , " then thanking Isabel , she left the room excessively annoyed with Rose . The lessons proceeded , and Isabel thought that Alice and Rose must alter their manners greatly before she could take any interest in teaching them . It was evident that they had not been treated kindly by their last governess . Alice sulked so much , and Rose was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper , and when tea was over , her head ached so severely , and she felt so tired and miserable , that she retired to her room , and locking herself in gave way to irrepressible emotion , while she thought that she should indeed be unhappy in her new position . Presently some one knocked at the door , but vexed at the interruption , and not wishing to be seen giving way to her feelings , Isabel took no notice . As the knocking continued unanswered , a soft voice pleaded for admittance . On opening the door , she found it was Emily , and not Amy , as she expected . " I hope you will excuse me , " she said , " but not finding you in the school-room I came after you , as I knew that I should not have any other opportunity this evening . " Isabel was very much confused , but Emily sat down by her side , telling her how very much she felt for her , and how she hoped she would consider her a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " and dear Isabel I will do all in my power to make you happy . " But Isabel only sobbed , " I can never be happy again  --  never . " " You must not say that , you must not think so , " exclaimed Emily . " You must come into the drawing-room with us , and that will cheer you up a bit . I know you will like papa . Elm Grove looks dreary now , but in summer it is delightful . Then , I always get up early and go for a ramble before breakfast , if I can only get any one to go with me , and I feel sure you will go with me next summer . I think I shall breakfast with you , I ca n't wait for mama 's late breakfast , but I would sooner have gone without altogether , than have taken it with Miss Manning . I only left school you know a few weeks ago , and I like a little fun . I know I make the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not behave at all like a fashionable young lady in the evening , if I did not get rid of some of my wild spirits before hand . By-the-bye , " she cried , laughing , " I believe you will have to teach me manners , Miss Massie pronounced me quite incorrigible , my sister is a perfect model according to her idea , but I could never be like Grace , I think mamma has given up all thought of it . " " I do n't know about teaching you manners , but I must try what I can do with Alice and Rose , they are sadly deficient even in politeness . " " Ah , you have found that out already have you , " cried Emily laughing . Isabel colored , and murmured something about forgetting who she was speaking to . " O you need n't mind , I like people who say what they think " said Emily , " besides that is just what papa says about them , but you must own that Amy is a nice little thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes Amy is a sweet child . " " It will not be quite so dull here next week , for Everard is coming home . I do wish so much for you to see him , he is my idea of perfection as far as attainable in human nature . Oh ! he 's so handsome , and such a dear nice fellow , I 'm sure you will like him . " " Perhaps you are not an impartial judge , I may not be able to see his perfections so clearly . " " You ca n't help seeing them , they are as clear as daylight , " returned Emily , warmly . " What do you think he asked me in his last letter  --  to tell him what sort of a gorgon the new governess was , so as I wrote to-day , I said she was beyond all description , and not to be compared with Miss Manning , so if he does not imagine something awful its very strange , ( Isabel did not look well pleased ) I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a trick , but it is time I dressed for dinner , dear me how tiresome , and away she bounded . What a funny girl , thought Isabel , I wonder if I shall like her , at all events she means to be kind . CHAPTER III . Isabel was not happy in her new home , it was no easy task to teach such unruly girls as Alice and Rose , whose chief object was to get as much fun as possible at the expense of their governess , but she trusted in time to be able to bring them to better order by the exercise of firmness and kindness combined . With Amy , however it was quite different , she seemed never so happy as when with Isabel . It was Sunday afternoon , the children did not seem to know how to employ themselves , but sat sullenly each with a book , tho ' it was very evident that they were not reading . Indeed , Isabel had seen by their manners all day , that they had not been accustomed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Isabel , " would you like me to read to you . " " Yes please , for it makes my head ache to read all the afternoon . " So Isabel read a portion of scripture and several nice little hymns . Very soon as she had expected , Alice and Rose , drew near . Then she read them part of the ' chief 's daughter , ' and after that she played several sacred pieces and sang a hymn to the tune tranquility . The children all gathered round her asking her to teach them to sing it . She promised to do so if they would learn the words , which they immediately commenced to do . After tea they had a most unexpected and very welcome visitor . " Oh ! Everard , when did you come home , " they all exclaimed . " While you were at church , " he returned . " What a shame you did n't come to see us before , " said Alice reproachfully . " O then , I suppose it was you who shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposed Rose , " why did n't you come in . " " I did not wish to disturb you " he answered , " but why do n't some of you have the politeness to introduce me to your new governess . " Isabel colored deeply as he used the distasteful appellation , and bent lower over her book , and when Rose said , Mr. Everard Arlington , Miss Leicester , " her bow was more haughty and dignified than she was aware of . He seated himself at the window with Amy on his knee , while the others stood one on either side . Isabel heard a great deal being said about Miss Leicester in an under tone , and was about to leave the room , when Everard interposed , saying " I shall go , unless you stay Miss Leicester , I 'm not going to turn you out of the room . " " Indeed I would rather go , " said Isabel . " Indeed I would rather you stayed . " returned Everard . " I do not wish to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go . " " Well , " said Everard putting his hand on the door , " I may as well have it out with you at once , as I did with Miss Manning , I am very fond of my little sisters , and often come to see them here . " " I have no objection , only let me go . " " But that is just what I do n't want you to do , and I always have my own way at Elm Grove . You must not run away whenever I come , or I shall think you consider me an intruder . " " Never mind what I think , " said Isabel looking up , about to insist upon going , for she was very indignant at his behaviour , but the face she beheld quite disarmed her wrath . Such a calm , kind , earnest expression in the mild blue eyes , such a winning smile played round the handsome mouth , a more prepossessing countenance Isabel had never seen , there was something about it irresistibly attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she asked as her eyes met his . " Stay where you are , and do just the same as if I was not here he said , and not run off as if I was going to eat you . " " Then do n't talk about me , " she returned stiffly . " I 'm sure . I never said a word about you . " " But the children did , " she replied coloring deeply as she returned to her seat . " Please Everard wont you read to us ? " asked Amy . When he had finished , Amy asked Isabel if she would play the hymn she promised . " Not to-night dear , " replied Isabel . " Oh please , Miss Leicester , " coaxed Rose . " If I am the cause of their disappointment I will go , but indeed I should like to join , " said Everard . " As you please " said Isabel , ashamed of being so much out of temper . " You know you promised , Miss Leicester , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , " returned Isabel , going to the piano : and she was quite repaid , as they all sang very sweetly , and quite correctly . " Good night , " said Everard , when the hymn was ended . " Forgive me , Miss Leicester if I seemed rude , I did not intend to be . " Isabel was distressed to find how much the children had been neglected ; true they were tolerably proficient in their studies , but in all religious instruction they were miserably deficient . Left entirely to the care of Miss Manning , who was a very frivolous , worldly minded woman , they were led , ( tho ' perhaps unintentionally ) to regard all religious subjects as dry and tedious , and to be avoided as much as possible . Isabel determined to try and remedy this evil by the exercise of patient gentleness , and by striving to make religious instruction a pleasure and a privilege . No easy task did this appear considering the dispositions she had to deal with , nor was it without a struggle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons to this purpose . She certainly did not meet with much encouragement at first ; again and again did the question recur to her mind , what good am I doing , why should I deprive myself of so many pleasant hours for the benefit of these thankless children ; but the selfish thought was conquered , and she persevered . On week days also , she had morning prayer and read a portion of scripture , then they sung a hymn , always taking for the week the one they learnt on the Sunday afternoon . Nor was her perseverance unavailing , for the children became interested , and requested her to have evening service as they termed it , which of course Isabel was only too glad to do . After a while their morning numbers were increased , as Emily and her papa joined them , and so on until at last without any special arrangement they all assembled in the school-room every morning as a matter of course . Isabel was very different from what Mrs. Arlington had expected , so refined in her manners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortifications of a governess 's career . True , she had expected a rather superior person , when Mrs. Arnold wrote that Miss Leicester was the indulged daughter of a wealthy merchant , who on account of her father 's losses and subsequent death , was forced to gain her living by teaching . Still , she was not prepared to find her new governess such a lovely and sweet tempered girl , and Isabel had not been long at Elm Grove , before Mrs. Arlington found that she was becoming quite attached to her . And as Mr. Arlington found that her father was the same Mr. Leicester from whom he had formerly experienced great kindness , they decided Isabel should teach the children , and receive her salary , but that in all other respects she should be as one of the family , and Isabel was very glad of the change . CHAPTER IV . The winter was past , and it was now June  --  bright , sunny June  --  and Elm Grove was decked in its richest hues . Down from the house sloped a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different sizes and shapes ; while in the centre there was a pond and fountain , with a weeping willow shading the sunny side , which gave an appearance of coolness quite refreshing . Beyond was the shrubbery and fruit garden ; and to the left the meadow , bounded by a coppice . The house was of the gothic order : on the right side of it was a beautiful conservatory , filled with the choicest plants ; on the left a colonnade and terrace , shaded by a group of acacia trees . In front a piazza and large portico , around which honeysuckle , clematis and roses , shed their sweet perfume . The grounds were tastefully laid out , with due regard to shade ; and a grove of elm trees completely hid the house from the avenue : so that in approaching it from the main road , the house seemed still in the distance  --  even out of sight  --  until , on taking a half turn round a thick clump of elms , one would unexpectedly come out right in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Emily had said , a delightful place . The children had greatly improved under Isabel 's care . Emily was quite like a sister , and even Miss Arlington treated her as an equal . Isabel knew that governesses were not usually so fortunate as to meet with such nice people , and appreciated their kindness accordingly . The walks , too , that she had so much dreaded , had become a pleasure ,  --  not a disagreeable duty . Emily usually joined them , and not unfrequently Everard also . He performed almost impossibilities to get Isabel wild-flowers , of which , Rose had informed him , she was exceedingly fond . These , to his great annoyance , were always carefully deposited in a glass on the dining-room table ; for Isabel had remarked in his manner toward her more than mere politeness , and endeavored as much as possible to check his growing attentions . But all his acts of kindness were done with so much tact and consideration , as to leave her no alternative , and oblige her to receive them . Neither was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain of , or that others would remark . All this made it very difficult for her to know how to act , as she did not wish to hurt his feelings by unnecessary particularity , or by the assumption of unusual formality lead him to suspect the true cause ; and thus perhaps lay herself open to the possibility of being supposed to have imagined him to be in love with her , without due cause . Isabel knew that she was not deceived ; she knew also that she must be very careful to conceal that she was so well aware of the state of his feelings towards her . " The Morningtons are coming to stay at Ashton Park : are you not glad , Emmy ? " said Everard , as he joined Isabel , Emily , and the children , in their ramble , one bright day in the midsummer holidays . " Glad , I should think so ! " returned Emily ; " but when do they come ? " " Very soon , I believe ; and I expect we shall have jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that merry little Lucy is the spirit of fun . May will be here shortly . And the Harringtons have friends with them , so we shall be able to get up some nice picnics . " " But is not Ada coming ? " asked Emily . " Why , of course she is , " returned Everard ; " but if you have not heard the ' latest , ' I shall not enlighten you sister mine . " " O Everard ! I 'm all curiosity , " cried Emily , opening her blue eyes very wide . " You mean that Ada is engaged to Mr. Ashton , " said Isabel . " Yes ; but how on earth did you know it ? " he returned . " Do you know the Morningtons ? " asked Emily . " Have you known them long ? " " Longer than you have , I fancy , " replied Isabel . " I have known them as long as I can remember . Ada and I had the same room at school . She is my dearest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry and the rest very well ? " " O yes , we were quite like brothers and sisters , " " When are they expected ? " asked Emily . " They may be there already , for all I know . It was last Sunday Sir John told papa they were coming . " At this moment Charles Ashton , with Ada and Lucy Mornington , emerged from a bridle path through the woods that separated Elm Grove from Ashton Park . Greetings were warmly exchanged , and then amid a cross-fire of questions and small talk , they proceeded to the house , where they found Mrs. Mornington and Lady Ashton . The latter insisted upon the young ladies and Everard returning with them to spend a few days at the Park . Isabel declined to accompany them . At which , Lucy fairly shed tears , and every one seemed so much annoyed , that she finally consented . Her position of friend and governess combined , when alone , was pleasant enough ; but with strangers , of course , she was still only Mrs. Arlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it was known ; as people at first did not usually suppose that the beautiful and attractive Miss Leicester was only the governess . And Isabel was sometimes amused , as well as annoyed , to find people who had been very friendly , cool off perceptibly . This she attributed to the circumstance that she was ' only the governess . ' Lady Ashton , especially , had been very anxious to be introduced to that " charming Miss Leicester ; " and Isabel had afterwards heard her saying to a friend : " Well ! you surprise me ! So she is ' only the governess , ' and yet has the air of a princess . I 'm sure I thought she was ' somebody . ' But then , you know , there are persons who do n't seem to know their proper place . " All this had made Isabel cold and reserved in company ; for her high spirit could ill brook the slights and patronising airs of those who in other days would have been glad of her acquaintance . Thus Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perceiving that this cold reserve was assumed to hide how deeply these things wounded her too sensitive feelings . So it was with more pain than pleasure that she made one of the party to Ashton Park , having a presentiment that vexation and annoyance would be the result ; as she was quite sure that it was only to please Ada , that Lady Ashton had included her in the invitation . Nor did it tend to disperse these gloomy apprehensions , when Isabel found that the room assigned her was at the extreme end of the corridor , scantily , even meanly furnished , and had apparently been long unoccupied , as , although it was now June , there was something damp , chilly , and uncomfortable about it . During the whole of this visit , she was destined to suffer from annoyances of one kind or another . If there was a spooney , or country cousin , among the guests , Lady Ashton would be sure to bring him to Miss Leicester , and whisper her to amuse him if possible , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Or just as some expedition was being arranged , Lady Ashton would , by employing Isabel about her flowers , or some other trivial thing , contrive to keep her from making one of the party . Isabel , though intensely disgusted , was too proud to remonstrate . And even when Charles , once or twice , interfered to prevent her being kept at home , she felt almost inclined to refuse , so annoyed and angry did Lady Ashton appear . True , she might have had some enjoyment from the society of Harry and Everard . But so surely as Lady Ashton observed either of them in conversation with her , she invariably wanted to introduce them to some ' charming young ladies . ' And she took good care that Isabel should not join any of the riding parties . Once Arthur Barrington had particularly requested her to do so , and even offered his own horse ( as Lady Ashton had assured them that every horse that could carry a lady had already been appropriated ) , but his aunt interposed : " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as to lend it to poor little Mary Cleavers ! Of course I would not have ventured to suggest your giving up your horse ; but as you are willing to do so , I must put in a claim for poor little Mary , who is almost breaking her heart at the idea of staying at home . And Miss Leicester is so good-natured , that I am sure she will not object . " " Excuse me , aunt , but "  --  began Arthur . " Here ! Mary , dear , " cried Lady Ashton ; and before Arthur could finish the sentence , his aunt had informed Mary that he had kindly promised his horse . Mary turned , and overwhelmed the astonished Arthur with her profuse thanks . " Confound it , " muttered Arthur ( who was too much a gentleman to contradict his aunt and make a scene ) ; then bowing politely to Miss Cleaver , he turned to Isabel , saying , " Will you come for a row on the lake , Miss Leicester , as our riding to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has monopolized ' Archer ' so unceremoniously . I feel assured that Miss Lucy will join us , as she is not one of the riding party . " Isabel assented , and Arthur went in search of Lucy . Lady Ashton followed him , and remonstrated : " You know you were to be one of the riding party , Arthur . " " Impossible , my dear aunt . After what has passed , I ca n't do less than devote my time this morning to the service of Miss Leicester . " " Nonsense ; she is ' only a governess . ' " " So much the more would she feel any slight . " " You talk absurdly , " she returned with a sneer . " You ca n't take her alone , Arthur . I will not allow it . " " My dear aunt , I am much too prudent for that . Lucy Mornington goes with us . " " But who will ride with Mary ? " " Oh , you must get her a cavalier , as you did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At all events , I am not at her service , even though no other be found ; " and he passed on toward Lucy , regardless of his aunt 's displeasure . And he carried the day in spite of her , for she put in practice several little schemes to prevent Isabel going . But Lady Ashton was defeated ; and Isabel remembered this morning as the only really pleasant time during her stay at the Park . Lady Ashton was greatly perplexed as to how to procure a beau for Mary , and , as a last resource , pressed Sir John into service ; but as he was a very quiet , stately old gentleman , the ride , to poor Mary 's great chagrin , was a very formal affair . On the last evening of her stay at Ashton Park , Isabel was admiring the beautiful sunset from her window , and as she stood lost in reverie , someone entered hastily and fastened the door . Turning to see who the intruder might be , she beheld a very beautiful girl , apparently about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , while her short , quick breathing , told of excitement and disquietude . " I have had such a dance to get here without observation , " she panted forth . " Please let me stay a little while . " And before Isabel could recover from her momentary surprise , Louisa had thrown herself into her arms , exclaiming , " I knew that you were kind and good , or I would not have come , and I felt sure that you would pity me . " All anger was now gone from the eager , earnest face , raised imploringly , and Isabel 's sympathy was aroused by the weary , sad expression of her countenance . " Who are you ; what makes you unhappy ; and why do you seek my sympathy ? " asked Isabel . " I am Lady Ashton 's grand-daughter , Louisa Aubray , " she replied . " You do n't know what a life I lead , boxed up with old Grumps , and strictly forbidden all other parts of the house . I have been here two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any pleasure or liberty , except once or twice when I took French leave , when I was sure of not being found out . Ah , you do n't know how miserable I am ! no one cares for poor Louisa ; " and burying her face in her hands , she cried bitterly . " I sometimes watch the company going to dinner , and that was how I came to see you ; and I liked you the best of them all , and I wished so much to speak to you . So I managed to find out which was your room ; but it was only to-day that I could get here , unknown to Miss Crosse . Wo n't you please tell me which of those young ladies Uncle Charles is going to marry . I want so much to know ; because Uncle Charles is nice , and I like him . He is the only one here that ever was the least bit kind to me . As for grandpapa and grandmamma , I know they hate me ; and Eliza says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , is because I am like papa . Oh , I know that dear mamma would not have been so glad when they promised to take care of me , if she had known how unkind they would be . " " But how can I help you , dear ? " inquired Isabel . " Why , I thought if I told you , you would be sorry for me , and persuade grandmamma to send me to school ; for then , at least , I should have someone to speak to . I do n't mind study ,  --  only old Miss Crosse is so unkind . I think perhaps she might , if you were to coax her very much  --  do please , " said Louisa , warmly . Isabel smiled at the idea that she should be thought to have any influence with Lady Ashton . " You err greatly , dear child , in thinking that I have any power to help you . I can only advise you to try and bear your present trials , and wait patiently for better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all very well for you to tell me this . You have all you can wish , and everything nice , so it is easy to give advice ; but you would n't like it , I can tell you . " " I do n't expect you to like it , Louisa . I only want you to make the best of what ca n't be helped . " " Oh , but it might be helped , if you would only try , " urged Louisa . " It is getting late , " returned Isabel , " and I must now dress for dinner ; but if you like you may remain here while I do so , and I will tell you about a young lady that I know , and then perhaps you will not be so annoyed with me for giving you the advice I have . " " Thanks , " returned Louisa , " I should like it very much . " " This young lady 's parents were very rich , and indulged her in every way . Her mother died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her taught every accomplishment , and instructed in almost every branch of learning . And she lived in a beautiful house , surrounded by every luxury , until the age of nineteen , when her father died ; and as he lost all his property shortly before , she was forced to gain her living as a governess . Think what she must have suffered , who never in her life had had a harsh or unkind word , and scarcely ever had a wish ungratified ; but had been spoilt and petted at home , and courted and flattered abroad . Think what it must have been to go alone and friendless among strangers ; to earn , by the irksome task of teaching , no more a year than she had been accustomed to receive in a birthday present or Xmas gift . She was fortunate enough to meet with very kind people , who made her as comfortable as it was possible for her to be under the circumstances . But still she found her position a very trying one , and was often placed in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that young lady , Louisa ,  --  is myself . " " Oh ! I 'm sorry , so sorry , " exclaimed Louisa . " And I thought you so happy , and so much to be envied . And I 'm sorry also for what I said about it being so easy to give advice . But why do n't you marry some rich gentleman ? and then , you know , you need n't be a governess any more . I would . " " I did n't say that I was unhappy , Louisa , and I try not to let these things trouble me so much , for I know it is wrong to care so much about them , but I ca n't help it . I have not told you this to excite your pity ; but that you may know that others have their daily trials as well as yourself . Do not think , dear child , that I do not compassionate your sad lot ; only try to remember the comforts which you do enjoy , notwithstanding the ills you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fate might have been , if your grandparents had refused to provide for you ; and be sure if you have patience , and do what is right , in due time you will have your reward . " Louisa was now weeping violently . " Ah , you do n't , you ca n't know , what it is to live as I do . And I felt so sure that  --  you  --  could help me ; but you ca n't , I know now , for grandmamma would n't listen to ' a governess . ' She is so bitter against anyone that teaches , because of papa . But I ca n't , and wo n't , stand this miserable life much longer  --  I will not ! " she continued passionately , as with compressed lips and clenched hands she started to her feet , while the angry flashing eyes and determined countenance told of strong will and firm resolution . " If I was a boy , " she said , " I would run away and go to sea ; but I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl can do . But I will find some way to escape before long , if things continue like this  --  that I will ! " and she stamped her foot impatiently upon the ground . Isabel could scarcely believe that the passionate girl before her was indeed the same child who had sat at her side so meekly not a moment before . She no longer paid any attention to Louisa 's complaints . Her thoughts were far away with the only one in whom she had ever seen this sudden transition from persuasive gentleness to stormy anger ; for the proud , passionate girl brought him vividly to her mind , though the wide ocean rolled between them . She saw again the proud curling lip , and the dark expressive eyes , which one moment would beam on her in love , and the next flash with angry light and stern displeasure ; the haughty mien and proud defiance , blended with a strange fascinating gentleness , that had won her heart . The time was present to her imagination , when with passionate entreaty he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fondest accents implored her not to refuse , as he was positive that her father would never consent to their union ; and his fearful burst of passion when she most entirely , though tearfully , refused to accede to his request . Even now she trembled as she recalled the angry terms in which he reproached her , and the indignant manner in which he had expressed his conviction that she did not love him ; and that all henceforth was at an end between them . How he left her in great wrath ; but soon after returned , and in the most humble manner deplored his cruelty and hateful temper , and in gentlest strains implored her forgiveness . But her musings were rather abruptly terminated by Louisa exclaiming : " Oh ! tell me what is the matter . Your hand is quite cold , and you are trembling all over . What have I done ? what shall I do ? " she continued , wringing her hands in despair . " I can not talk to you any more now , Louisa dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada about you , and perhaps she may be able to help you ; but you really must not get into such dreadful passions . I ca n't have you stay any longer , as I wish to be alone . " " But why do you tremble and look so pale ? " asked Louisa , mournfully . " Is it so dreadful to be a governess ? " " I was not thinking of that dear , " answered Isabel , kissing her " good-night . Mind you try to be a good girl . " So Louisa was dismissed , fully persuaded in her own mind that she had nearly frightened Isabel to death by her passionate behaviour . After waiting a moderate time to recover herself , Isabel joined the others in the drawing-room . Fortunately , they went to dinner almost immediately , as she felt anything but inclined to make herself agreeable ; and as Lady Ashton , as usual , was kind enough to furnish her with a companion who appeared to be a quiet , inoffensive individual , she treated him with polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion regarding Mr. Lascelles . The man was an ' ass , ' and a ' magpie , ' and appeared to like nothing better than to hear his own voice . However , this suited Isabel tolerably on this occasion , as an ' indeed , ' or ' really , ' was all that was needed by way of reply ; and he was forced sometimes to stop to enable him to eat , and this kept him from being oppressive . But as he found her so good a listener , there was no getting rid of him ; for when the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing-room , he devoted himself entirely to Miss Leicester  --  to Lucy 's intense amusement . At last Ada grew compassionate , and got Charles to ask Isabel to sing , and to introduce Mr. Lascelles to Miss Cleaver . It was a tedious evening , and Isabel was heartily glad that they were to return to Elm Grove . Life there was at all events endurable , which the life she had spent for the last week was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft-repeated question and answer , " Who is that young lady ? "  --  " Oh , the governess at Elm Grove ; " and most emphatically determined that she would never stay at the Park again , let who might be offended . Neither could she help drawing comparisons between this and her former life , nor deny that she felt it severely . But the warm welcome she received from the children on her return to the Grove , went far towards dispersing these gloomy thoughts . CHAPTER V. A pic-nic was decided upon for Emily 's birthday  --  the fourth of August . It was a lovely day , and every thing seemed propitious . And a merrier party seldom started on a pleasure excursion , than the one which now was assembled under the trees at Elm Grove . The guests were Sir John and Lady Ashton , Charles , and the Morningtons , Lilly and Peter Rosecrain , May Arlington ( a cousin ) , the Harringtons and the Hon. Arthur Barrington , the latter had not arrived , but had promised to meet them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children quite wild with delight . All Isabel 's endeavors to keep them in order were useless , and Lucy announced , that every one must be allowed to do just as he or she pleased , or there would be no fun . Lucy volunteered to go with the children if they could procure a driver . " Any one would do , excepting Mr. Everard Arlington , as of course the children would be too much in awe of him , as he could be awefully grave . " Peter immediately offered his services , unless he was too stern and sedate . This caused a laugh , as Peter was renowned for fun . The place chosen for the pic-nic was a delightful spot , ( quite romantic Emily declared ) situated at the bottom of a beautiful ravine , within a short distance of a splendid water fall yclept the " old roar , " the dashing spray of its gurgling waters making quite refreshing music . " Now Emily , you are queen to-day , and all that you say is law , " cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now master Bob , be on your P 's and Q 's , and find a nice place to spread the royal feast . " " I think that you are making yourself queen on this occasion and no mistake , " returned the saucy Bob . " Well , I am prime minister you know , so make haste and obey my commands . " " Self constituted I fancy , " returned Bob with a shrug . " May I ask what important office is to be assigned me on this festive occasion , " asked Peter . " That of queen 's jester , of course , " replied Lucy gravely . " You do me too much honor Miss Lucy , " he said , bowing with mock humility . " I 'm quite aware of that , " answered Lucy demurely . A desirable place was soon found in a shady nook , and the repast was spread , to which it is almost needless to add they all did ample justice . Just as they sat down , Arthur made his appearance , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it Lady Ashton would have annihilated him , so fearfully angry was she at his daring to bring her grand daughter in this manner , upon his own responsibility . " I found Louisa very disconsolate and unhappy , and I thought a little recreation would be good for her , Aunty . I feel sure that Mrs. Arlington will excuse the liberty I have taken , " he added with a smile and bow . " Pray do n't mention it , replied Mrs. Arlington thus appealed to , I am only too happy to have Miss Aubray join us . Alice my dear , make room for Miss Aubray . " Louisa sat with her large mournful eyes cast down , tho ' occasionally she threw furtive glances at her grandmother 's darkened countenance , and seemed to be doing anything but enjoying herself . And no wonder poor child , for she was sure of a terrible scolding sooner or later . Arthur paid attention to the ladies generally , with whom he was a great favorite . Louisa ate her dinner almost in silence , tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But poor girl , she was calculating the chances of being left alone with her angry grandmother when they dispersed after dinner , and almost wished she had not yielded to Arthur 's persuasions , as he had apparently deserted her . But he was much too considerate and kind hearted for that , he had brought her there to enjoy herself , and it would not be his fault if she did n't . They began dispersing by twos and threes to explore the beauties of the place , and Louisa 's heart sank within her , as she saw their numbers diminishing fast , and that Arthur too had disappeared . The children asked Isabel to come and see Rose 's bower , and after a short consultation , Alice invited Louisa to join them , but Lady Ashton interposed . " I had much rather you remained with me my dear , " she said curtly . And Louisa reseated herself with a great sigh as the others started on their ramble . For the children had much too great an awe of Lady Ashton , to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth must be told , they did n't much care for her company . So Louisa was left alone with the elders , who were not in such haste to move after their repast as the young people . " Come Louisa , let us follow the example of the rest , " said Arthur reappearing . " I have ordered Louisa to remain here , interposed Lady Ashton sternly . " " Oh ! Aunt , " remonstrated Arthur . " I do n't approve of her coming at all , but as she is here she  --  " " May as well enjoy herself , " put in Arthur . " Arthur , " ejaculated Lady Ashton , in her most freezing tone . " But Aunt , " you see that she is the only young lady left , and you would n't be so cruel as to condemn me to wander alone through these picturesque ravines . " " You can stay here , and amuse us old people , " returned Lady Ashton grimly . Arthur shrugged his shoulders and elevated his eye-brows , by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect , " interposed Mrs. Arlington kindly , " I think you should relent Josephine . " " But you know that I refused to let her go with Miss Leicester and the children . " " Oh ! did you , " interrupted Arthur , " that was too bad . " " Come Louisa , we will try and find them , " and off he marched her from under Lady Ashton 's very nose , as Louisa felt bold with Arthur to back her , and she knew that she could not increase the weight of censure already incured  --  she also longed to get out of her grandmother 's presence on any terms . Rose 's bower ( so called from Rose having been the first to discover it ) was some distance up the winding path . It was a nice little nook , thickly shaded on all sides , having a small aperture in the west , and was completely covered with wild flowers of every description . The ascent was very difficult , for they had quite to force their way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the wild secluded beauty of the spot quite repaid them for their trouble . Isabel was in raptures , and expressed her admiration in no measured terms to the delighted children . " Oh ! Everard , how did you find us , " exclaimed Alice , as that gentleman made his appearance , " I thought no one knew of this place but ourselves . " " Oh I followed just to see to what unheard of spot you were taking Miss Leicester , " replied Everard good-naturedly . " Then you might have joined us , and not have crept after us in that mean way . " said Rose angrily . " Rose , my dear Rose , you must not speak in that way . " interposed Isabel authoritatively . " Oh Rose , do n't you like Everard to come , " asked Amy reproachfully . " I do n't like him to come in that way . " returned Rose . " Would n't you like to gather some of those black berries , " asked Everard , after they had rested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what beauties , " and off they scampered . Isabel was about to follow , but Everard interposed , " Stay , Miss Leicester , I have long sought an opportunity to address you , and can no longer delay  --  I must speak  --  " Isabel would have made her escape , but that Everard stood between her and the only available opening . She knew that he was about to propose , and would gladly have prevented it if possible , but as it was , there was no reprieve  --  he would do it . How signally had she failed , notwithstanding all her efforts , for she could not but feel , that she had not succeeded in making clear to him , her own ideas on the subject , or this would not have been . How sorry she was now , that she had allowed the fear of being unnecessarily cool to influence her conduct ,  --  yet at the same time , she could not accuse herself of having given him any encouragement . Yet , how far was he from anticipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw it , there was no doubt manifested in the eager expressive eyes , in the warm impulsive manner blended with a gentle earnestness that might have won the heart of a girl whose affections were disengaged . He looked so handsome , so loveable , that Isabel felt she might indeed have been content to take him , had not her affections been given to another , and she grieved to think of the pain she must inflict . It might have been easier if he had not looked so bright and hopeful about it , or if she could have told him of her engagement , but that was out of the question , he seemed so certain of success , so utterly unconscious of the fate that awaited him , that she could have wept , but resolutely repressing her tears , she waited with heightening color to hear the words that were to be so kindly , yet so vainly spoken . " Dearest Isabel , " he said in accents soft and winning . " I have loved you ever since I first saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen of you since , has only increased my esteem . But of late you have been more retiring than formerly , and I have even thought that you avoided me sometimes , thinking I fear , that my attentions ( to use a common phrase ) meant nothing , but that is not the case , I am not one of those , who merely to gratify their own vanity , would endeavor to win affection , which they do not ,  --  can not return . No dearest , I love you truly , unalterably ,  --  will you then accept my love , and give me the right and the inexpressibly pleasure to share all your joys and sorrows . Tell me dear Isabel , will you be my wife . " She was trembling  --  almost gasping , and he would have aided her with his supporting arm , but she sank away from him sobbing " It can never , never be . " " Why do you say that Isabel , " he asked reproachfully , while the expression of his countenance became that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she answered more calmly , " It would not be right to accept you under the circumstances . Your parents would consider , that as their governess , I ought to know my duty better . " " What difference could your being the governess make , " he asked . " Every difference in their opinion . " " But as I am the only son , of course they would raise no objection . " " That makes it the more certain that they would do so , " she replied . " Oh ! Isabel " he exclaimed passionately , " do not reason in this cool way , when my whole life will be happy or miserable as you make it . I am not changeable , I shall not cease to love you while I live . " " Oh ! do not say that I have so much influence upon your happiness Mr. Arlington , " returned Isabel much affected . " You must not think of me otherwise than as a friend , a kind friend  --  a dear friend if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh ! Isabel , dear Isabel , do not refuse me thus , you do not know , indeed you do not , how true a heart you are crushing , what fervent love you are rejecting . Only let me hope that time may change your feelings . " " Do not think that I undervalue the love you offer , but it is impossible  --  quite impossible that we can ever be more to each other than at present . I would not raise false hopes or allow you to indulge them . I do not , can not return your affections , I can never be your wife , it is utterly impossible . " " You love another Isabel , else why impossible . Perhaps , even now you are the promised bride of another , tell me if this is the case , " he said tho ' his voice faltered . " You are presuming Mr. Arlington , you have no right to ask this question , " she replied with glowing cheeks . " Pardon me if I have offended , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted long enough  --  too long in fact . I will now join the children if you please . " " One moment more , say that we do not part in anger . " " In anger , no , we are good friends I trust , " she answered , smiling very sweetly . " My dream of happiness is over , " he said sadly , almost tearfully as he took her offered hand . Isabel had some difficulty in finding the children on such a wild place . When she did so , she found Arthur and Louisa with them . Louisa was looking bright and animated , very different to what she had done during dinner , and was laughing and joining in the general conversation . " We are taking Mr. Barrington and Louisa to the bower , " cried Rose as they drew near . " I 'm afraid we shall be rather late , " answered Isabel . " But you surely would n't have us return without seeing this wonderful bower , after undergoing all this fatigue , " inquired Arthur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing up there again to-day . I will wait here until you come back . " returned Isabel . " Where is Everard . " asked Alice . " I left him at the bower , " " I think I will wait with Miss Leicester , " said Amy , " I 'm so very tired . " " Yes do , " cried Rose , " for then we shall not be half so long gone . " Isabel sat down on the lovely green sward , and the tired child reclined beside her . Amy was so thoroughly worn out that she lay perfectly quiet , and Isabel was left to her own reflections , and these were by no means pleasant . Her conversation with Everard had cast a gloom over her spirits , she no longer took pleasure in the ramble or in the beautiful scenery around her , all the brightness of the day was gone , and why , he was not the first rejected suitor , but she had never felt like this with regard to the others . But then she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to imagine that she was courted for her wealth , but in the present instance it was different . Nothing but true disinterested love could have prompted him , and she felt hurt and grieved to think that she was the object of such warm affection to one who she esteemed so highly , when her affections were already engaged . She had seen how deeply her answer pained him , yet had not dared to answer his question . Could she tell him what she had not dared to reveal to her dying father ? No ; tho ' could she have done so , it might have made it easier for Everard to forget her . When they reached the place of rendezvous , they found the rest of the party including Everard , already assembled , and Peter was declaring that it was utterly impossible to return without having some refreshments , after the immense fatigue they had all undergone in exploring the beauties of the surrounding country . Most of the party were of the same opinion , so forthwith he and Bob Mornington proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most primitive manner imaginable , to the amusement of the company generally , and to the extreme disgust of Grace Arlington in particular . And then there was a general move to the carriages . After they arrived at Elm Grove , Lady Ashton insisted upon Louisa returning to the park at once . Several voices were raised in her behalf , but in vain , Lady Ashton was inexorable , and telling Louisa to say good bye to Mrs. Arlington , she hurried her away , and desired Sunmers the coachman to drive Miss Aubray home and return for her at twelve . Arthur followed and remonstrated . " Arthur , say no more , " returned Lady Ashton decisively . " I consider you took a great liberty in bringing her , and I will not allow her to remain . " " Since you are quite sure that it is best for her to go , I will drive her home , she need not go alone in the great carriage , like a naughty child sent home in disgrace , " he answered laughing . " Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lady Ashton tartly . " Indeed my dear Aunt , as I persuaded her to come I positively could not have her treated so unceremoniously , " he replied . " Here Thomson , " he called to the man who was about to take Archer to the stable , and the next moment he had handed the mistified Louisa into the chaise , leaving the astonished Lady Ashton crimson with rage . " Adieu Aunty " he cried , gathering up the ribbons , " I must trust to you to make my apologies to Mrs. Arlington , and off he drove . Lady Ashton re-entered the house , inwardly vowing vengeance against the unlucky Louisa , tho ' she met Mrs. Arlington with a smile , saying , " that Arthur had begged her to apologize , as he had thought it incumbent upon him to drive his cousin home , as it was entirely his fault that she had come , and you know , " she added with a little laugh , " how scrupulously polite he is to every one  --  . " To Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen of Arthur at Elm Grove that night , and she would have been still more annoyed had she known how thoroughly he and Louisa were enjoying themselves over their game of chess , notwithstanding Miss Crosse 's exemplary vigilance . The evening was spent in various amusements , and the company dispersed at a late hour , all highly satisfied , and voting the pic-nic a complete success . After the guests had departed , Isabel had occasion to go into the school-room for a book , and as the beautiful harvest moon was shining so brightly , she stood a moment at the open window to enjoy the lovely prospect . Hearing some one enter the room , she turned and encountered Everard . She would have retreated , but Everard gently detained her , " promise me Miss Leicester , " he said , " that what passed between us this afternoon shall make no difference to your arrangements , you will not think of leaving , for I should never forgive myself for having deprived my sisters of the benefit of your society if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , " she replied with a sigh . " Only say that you do not wish it , " returned Everard earnestly . " I do not , you have all been so kind , so very kind to me , that I should be very sorry to leave , nor could I do so very easily as I have no home . " " Dear Isabel , why not accept the home I offer you ? " " Stay Mr. Arlington , say no more . You must promise not to recur to that subject again , or however unpleasant it may be to do so , I shall have no alternative , but must seek another situation . " " I will make it a forbidden subject while you remain at Elm Grove if you wish it , " he said doubtfully . " It must be so Mr. Arlington ; good night . " When Isabel entered her own room she found Emily there . " Dear Isabel , " she said , after seating herself on a low stool at Isabel 's feet , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happy , " and she hid her face in Isabel 's lap . " I can not go to Grace , so I come to you , " she continued , " You are more sympathetic and seem to understand me better . Not but what Grace has always been kind enough , but I always am rather in awe of her , and you have just been the friend I always wanted . Oh ! Isabel , you do n't know how much good you have done me . You have taught me to think more of right and wrong , and to consider duty as well as pleasure , and to think of others as well as myself . I know now , that Miss Massie was right when she said that I was wilful and selfish , and had no consideration for others , tho ' at the time she said it I thought her severe and unjust . Before you came here , I made up my mind to be kind to you , and to try to like you , ( tho ' I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in reality ) but you know , my Godmother Mrs. Arnold had written me , that I must be kind to you and love you , under pain of her displeasure , but when I saw how pretty you were , I thought it would not be a difficult task . Now I have learned to love you for yourself , because you are good as well as beautiful . " " Oh ! stop , you little flatterer , you will make me vain , " said Isabel kissing her . " If I have done you any good , I am very glad indeed , " she added in a more serious tone , " I have endeavored to do my duty , but I am afraid that I have not succeeded very well . " " O yes , indeed you have , but what do you think that I came here to tell you dear . " Isabel confessed that it was useless to attempt to guess as the day had been such an eventful one , and offered so large a scope for the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you deary , I 'm engaged to Harry Mornington . " " May you be very , very happy dear Emily , " said Isabel returning her embrace . Then , unable any longer to sustain the composure she had forced herself to assume , she laid her head upon Emily 's shoulder and wept passionately . " What can make this affect you thus , " asked the amazed and astonished Emily , greatly distressed , " Oh ! Isabel is it possible that you love him , how unfortunate that I should have chosen you for my confidant , but I did n't know , I never thought , or believe me I would not have pained you thus . You said that he had always been like a brother to you , how could I know that you ever thought he would be anything more . Indeed , she added as if to vindicate Harry , " I never saw anything in his manner to lead you to suppose so . " " You are quite mistaken dear Emily , " interposed Isabel , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words " I never thought or wished that Harry should ever be more to me than the dear friend he has ever been . But I have many sources of trouble that you are not aware of dear Emily , and to-day , while others laughed , I could have wept , and would gladly have exchanged that gay scene , for the quiet of my own room . But this could not be , and I was forced to assume a serenity of feeling I was far from experiencing . Had you not been here , I should have given vent to my grief in solitude , and none would have been the wiser . As it is I must entreat that you will forgive me for ( tho ' unintentionally ) making you suppose I do not sympathize in your happiness , but I do indeed , for I know that Harry is all that is good , and is worthy of your best affections . " " Dear Isabel , will you not tell me your troubles , " inquired Emily , " for ills lose half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not tell you dear , but for the present I will forget my uneasiness in sharing your happiness . " Then after a long and pleasant conversation they parted , both amazed at the late , or rather early hour which at that moment struck . " By-the-bye , " said Emily , coming back after a few minutes " papa gave me this letter for you two days ago , but I quite forgot it until I saw it just now . " " O you naughty , naughty girl , " cried Isabel , looking very bright as she beheld the familiar epistle . " No more tears to-night I fancy , eh Isabel , " said Emily saucily . " Do n't sit up to read it to-night , it is so very late , " she added wickedly , her eyes sparkling with mischief . All else was soon forgotten as Isabel eagerly perused the welcome letter from her own Louis , whose silence had been one source of her disquietude . But Louis accounted for his silence to her entire satisfaction , and promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER VI . Isabel was to spend this Xmas with the Morningtons , who with with the exception of Harry , were to return to Europe in February . It was very rough weather , and Isabel had much such a journey as that to Elm Grove , and was in a very similar condition to what she had been on that occasion . On her arrival at Eastwood , Ada embracing her exclaimed " Oh ! here you are at last my own darling Isabel , I have been watching for you all day , papa was sadly afraid of accidents this stormy weather , and Bob kept bringing such dreadful accounts of trains being snowed up , that he nearly frightened me to death . Papa has been to the depot three times , and Harry twice , and missed you after all . But do come and warm yourself dearest , for you seem half frozen , " she continued as she hurried Isabel into the cosy little breakfast-room , where the bright fire was indeed a pleasant sight on such a bitterly cold day . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Isabel , her teeth chattering with cold . " I am sadly chilled with this piercing wind , Oh ! this is nice " she added going to the fire , " and it is so very pleasant to be at ' Eastwood ' once more . " " Why here is Isabel I declare , " cried the impulsive Lucy , as she bounded into the room , " how delightful , you will help me to arrange the gim-cracks on the Xmas tree , wo n't you my pet , " said the merry girl as she threw her arms round her friend , and hugged her unmercifully . " To be sure I will , when I recover the use of my fingers , " returned Isabel laughing . " Well , I do n't want you to come now , for if I am a little madcap as papa says , I 'm not quite so unreasonable as that , " Lucy answered , seating herself upon an ottoman . " Here I am your humble servant to command what orders for your slave , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I obey . " " Do be sensible Lucy and let mamma know that Isabel has come , " said Ada reprovingly . " I go , " answered Lucy with mock gravity , " to usher my illustrious mother to the presence of the noble Isabel of Leicester . " " Oh ! Lucy , just the same nonsensical , " laughed Isabel . " Alas , I fear that it will be the same to the end of the chapter , " sighed the incorrigible Lucy as she left the room . She soon returned bringing the other members of the family with her , and Isabel received a very warm welcome . She could not help shedding tears of happiness and gratitude , when Mrs. Mornington embracing her said , " ever look upon this as your home dear child , whenever you like to come you will always find us glad to see you , " and Mr. Mornington added in his kindly tone " yes , yes , always remember Isabel my dear , that while I have a roof over my head , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " On being conducted to her room , she found the best was given her as of old ; it was evident that her altered circumstances made no difference at Eastwood . Happy days were these which Isabel spent with her dearest friends . Bob 's party went off with great eclat , and the perfect success of the Xmas trees was owing to Isabel 's tasteful arrangement . The Ashtons arrived on New Year 's Eve , for Ada was to be married on twelfth day . Lady Ashton was very much surprised to find how very partial the Morningtons were to Isabel , they consulted her on all occasions , and her advice was almost invariably taken . This annoyed Lady Ashton extremely , and she often succeeded in vexing her , and making her feel very uncomfortable . But Lady Ashton 's disagreeable behaviour did not annoy Isabel so much as at Ashton Park . Here among her best friends , she could even think of herself as a governess without experiencing the same degree of mortification as formerly , but she was still very sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew , The Honorable Arthur Barrington was very attentive to Miss Leicester , this raised her ire , and she was determined to prevent it  --  she resolved to put a stop to it , so seeing him seated next Isabel at dinner , she asked her across the table how her little pupils were when she left them , and if Mrs. Arlington had granted extra holidays , as she could scarcely get back by the end of the usual Xmas vacation . " Isabel grew scarlet as she replied " that they were quite well when she left them , and that she did not return until the first of February . " Lady Ashton was gratified to see that she was successful so far . Isabel was no longer the same attentive listener to all Arthur 's stories of marvellous adventures , ( for she was both hurt and angry , as the question was evidently intended to annoy  --  for as Emily had come to Eastwood with the Ashtons , Lady Ashton had later intelligence from Elm Grove than she could possibly give ) and Arthur finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Isabel was left to the mercy of a queer old gentleman who sat next her on the other side , who was exceedingly deaf , and stuttered dreadfully . Nor did Lady Ashton 's evident satisfaction tend to make her feel more at ease , so that she was heartily glad when this to her most tedious dinner was over . But she had a worse attack to endure , for when the ladies reached the drawing-room , Lady Ashton said in the most annoying tone , " I should not have mentioned your pupils if I had had any idea that you would have been so painfully affected by my doing so , at the same time rest assured my dear Miss Leicester  --   --  . " " Pray do n't mention it Lady Ashton , " replied Isabel coldly , " any apology is quite unnecessary . " " You mistake my meaning Miss Leicester , " replied Lady Ashton stiffly , " I am not aware of having anything to apologize for , " she added with a contemptuous little laugh , " I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you overcome this feeling the better . You ought not to be ashamed of earning an honest living  --   --  . " " Nor am I ashamed of it , " replied Isabel with dignity , " at least I hope not . " " I am glad that you qualify your denial , as your crimson cheeks both now and during dinner are ample proof that I am right . But ( as I was about to say , when you interrupted me so rudely ) from my observations , I thought it high time that Mr. Barrington should be reminded of your position , as I know that his father would never allow him to marry a governess , of course it is no disgrace to be a governess , still , it is not from that class of persons that Arthur should choose a wife . " " I 'm afraid that you have taken unnecessary trouble , Lady Ashton , " returned Isabel , " I am convinced that my position is of no consequence to Mr. Barrington , any more than his is to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is nonsense for a girl in your circumstances to pretend such indifference , I am not deceived , I know that you would be only too glad to make such a match , and he is just foolish enough to take a fancy to a pretty face . But I warn you not to encourage him , as it will only end in misery to you both , as Lord Barrington would never consent . " " Really , Lady Ashton , I do not know what right you have to insult me in this manner , I can not permit it , " said Isabel , and then with dignified composure she crossed the room to Ada , who was scarcely less annoyed than herself , at Lady Ashton 's unprovoked attack . This little scene had afforded no little amusement to the party generally , tho ' all agreed that it was too bad of Lady Ashton , and very ill-natured . Lady Ashton , however , had miscalculated the effect of the course she had pursued , for Arthur Barrington was annoyed at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever attentive to Isabel , and endeavored as much as possible to atone for his aunt 's disagreeable behaviour , while Isabel ( being convinced that Lady Ashton had nothing to warrant her conjecture , but her own surmises , ) made no alteration in her manners . She found him a very agreeable companion , and imagined that he too found her society pleasant , as indeed he did , beautiful , accomplished , and good-natured , how could she be otherwise than attractive . But Lady Ashton 's chagrin knew no bounds , and she told Isabel that she should certainly let Mrs. Arlington know how very unfit a person she was to have the care of her daughters . She had always been surprised at her having such a very young person , but she had heard that it was out of charity , but there was such a thing as carrying that much abused virtue too far . Stooping lower over her tatting , Isabel only smiled at the harmless threat , for whatever her failings might be , Mrs. Arlington was not over ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without due cause . Moreover , she was not easily influenced by others , and her decisions were usually just . But the hot blood suffused her cheeks as Lady Ashton concluded . Fortunately Lucy entered the room , and then her ladyship was or appeared to be deeply engaged with her book , as having before been worsted in a combat of sharp speeches with that young lady , she by no means wished for a renewal of hostilities . Isabel was invariably made low spirited by one of Lady Ashton 's ill-natured attacks , especially so to-day , as the insults she had received were particularly painful , being both unfeeling and uncalled for . However , upon retiring to her own room at night , she found upon the dressing table a letter , the contents of which soon dispersed all gloomy thoughts , and Lady Ashton 's rudeness was quite forgotten . Louis , her own dear Louis , wrote that he would return in the early spring . My uncle he said , has or is about to purchase for me a practice in H  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your teaching will not be of long duration , as there will then be no cause to delay our union . I already in perspective , seem to see you my own dearest , presiding over my bright fireside in H  --   --  , the joy of my heart , and the good angel of my home . I trust that you have made no arrangement with Mrs. Arlington but such as can easily terminate upon a short notice . I would not advise your taking any steps at present , as my uncle does not say positively that the purchase is absolutely made . But at all events you may depend upon seeing me in the early spring , as I have his orders to return . The darkest hour is just before dawn . She had been so truly wretched an hour ago , and now how radiantly happy she was . Ah , with what sweet visions of a bright unclouded future did she fall asleep , to dream of her loved one far away , soon to be distant no longer . When Isabel descended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , that Lady Ashton could account for it in no other way than that Arthur had proposed , and that she had accepted him , so she taxed him with it accordingly . Arthur was excessively amused , and so archly evaded giving a direct answer , that she became the more convinced of the truth of her own surmises , and grew so wrathy that Arthur fearing that in her anger she might annoy Miss Leicester , at length assured her that she need be under no apprehension , as nothing was farther from his thoughts . CHAPTER VII . " Oh , Isabel , mama says I may stay until the first , and then we can return together , wo n't that be charming , " said Emily , as she came into Isabel 's room on the following day , holding an open letter in her hand . " You ca n't think how glad I am to escape the escort of that tiresome Lady Ashton . " " I certainly should not imagine that she would make a very pleasant travelling companion , " returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " exclaimed Emily , " you have no idea what I endured coming down . Poor Charles , he must have been almost worried to death , she is such a horrid tease , and the old gentleman too , is an awful fidget . I think Arthur Barrington knew what he was about , when he refused to be of our party , and went on by express . Talking of Lady Ashton , how abominably she behaves to you . I was saying so to Harry the other day , and he really seemed quite hurt about it . He said that he saw what she was at the other day at dinner , and was very much annoyed . Then I told him that was nothing to what took place afterwards , and related what she said to you in the drawing room . " " Oh , Emily , how could you , " exclaimed Isabel . " Ah now do n't be cross with me , Isabel , darling . I really could n't resist , it was so supremely absurd . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes out about it that night , and then in again next morning . " " I know that Ada was very much hurt at Lady Ashton 's rudeness , " replied Isabel . " I 'm sure that I was as angry and annoyed as any of them , but for the life of me I ca n't help laughing whenever I think of it . But confess now , Isabel , are you not desperately in love with Arthur Barrington  --  come tell the truth . " " Well , the truth is , no , most decidedly not , " Isabel answered , laughing . " Ah , now , I 'm quite disappointed , for I had made up my mind to that match , if only to aggravate Lady Ashton . She has no influence in that quarter , as anyone may see ; and he is so decidedly ' smitten . " ' " What nonsense you talk , Emily . " " It is not nonsense . I assure you that I mean what I say . Ah , my dear , you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are sometimes best . He is a very nice fellow , and his father is immensely rich . You can have him if you choose : I am sharp enough to see that . " " But then you see I do n't choose , " returned Isabel , much amused . " Besides , I think that you are quite mistaken . " " Oh , you silly Isabel , how can you be so provokingly stupid ? By the bye , what a little namby-pamby thing that Mabel Ainsley is . What Lucy can see in her to like , passes my comprehension . " " I presume it must be because Lucy is so different , and then Mabel is so pliant , which no doubt suits , as Lucy is fond of taking the lead . " " They say that likes go by contraries ; but as far as my observations go , it is seldom the case , " observed Emily . " A similarity of tastes and ideas is usually more attractive ; but then , ' novelty 's charming , ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could get up a fancy ball  --  a private masquerade , you know . I was speaking to Ada and Lucy about it last night . I said that I would be night , and Lucy thought you ought to be morning . " " I hope they will give up the idea , as I really could not take part in it , " interrupted Isabel . " Why not  --  what harm could there be ? What makes you so fastidious , Isabel ? " " It is not that , dear Emily ; " but I have very painful associations connected with a private masquerade , the only one that I ever went to . That night poor papa received the sad news of his failure ; and in the midst of that gay scene , I received a summons to return , as my papa was alarmingly ill , and scarcely expected to live through the night . He never recovered , though he lingered for some weeks afterwards . Can you wonder then , dear Emily , that even the idea of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very sorry that I proposed it , " returned Emily , much concerned . " I will tell Ada what you say , and we will get up some other amusement : so do n't think any more about it , dear ; " and giving Isabel a hasty kiss , she left her . The sixth was a bright , cloudless day  --  the dazzling whiteness of the frozen snow , and the deep blue of the sky , forming a beautiful contrast . The weather was cold , not intensely so , and the trees looked splendid , as their ice-covered boughs glistened and sparkled in the sunlight ; and the merry jingle of the sleigh-bells was quite enlivening . The wedding was quite a grand affair , and passed off with great eclat . Charles and Ada were to travel for three weeks , and then join the Ashtons and Morningtons at Boston , and proceed to the old country together . The Ashtons left Eastwood shortly after the wedding , to prepare for a long absence from the Park ; and from the time of Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninterrupted enjoyment . She became so cheerful and animated , that Emily declared they positively would n't know her again at Elm Grove . Harry was to remain at W  --   --  , to read up for the examination . He had tried very hard to prevail upon his father to let him enter Mr. Arlington 's office , as in that way he could get on much better , he said , as he would see a great deal of law business , and he could easily read up in the evenings . But his father only laughed . " Love-making would play the dickens with the studies . You would be poring over your book , without knowing that it was upside down . No , no . After you have ' passed , ' you shall travel for a year ; and then I believe that I shall be able to get you a partnership in H  --   --  with my old school-fellow , Harding , who is a very clever lawyer , and stands very high in his profession . " " But will you allow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? " asked Harry . " Upon my word ! that is a modest request , " replied his father . Harry laughed . " When I was young , young men expected to make their way in the world a little before they talked of marrying , " continued Mr. Mornington ; but you ask me as coolly as possible to give you enough to enable you and your wife to travel , before you go into business at all , which I think is pretty brassy . I wonder what my father would have thought if I had made such a request . I honestly believe he would have thrashed me . But as I said , things are different now-a-days . " Harry grew very red during this harangue , but wisely kept silent . " Now , I 'll tell you what my father did . He called me into his study one morning . ' How old are you ? ' he asked . ' Fifteen , sir , ' I replied proudly . ' Old enough to be better , ' he retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I consider that you are old enough to earn your own living . I have procured you a situation in a wholesale grocery , where you will get a hundred dollars a year . Now , as you will be away from home ( for the firm is in Washington ) , I will pay your board for the first year . After that , you will get a rise in your salary ; and from that time , you will have to depend upon your own exertions , as I shall not help you any more . If you are honest and steady , you get on . But if you will get into scrapes , do n't expect me to help you out . " " Yes , sir , " resumed Mr. Mornington , " that was the way I began the world ; and by the time I was twenty-three ( your age , Harry ) , I had acquired a good position in the firm , and a promise of a future partnership . What do you think of that ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I was fifteen , that I should have done the same , " replied Harry , with spirit . " Then you think that you ca n't be blamed justly ? " " No , sir , " returned Harry , respectfully . " Well , I suppose that it has been all my own doing , " resumed Mr. Mornington . " But seriously , Harry , do you wish to give up law and become one of the firm ? Speak out , boy , there is no good in taking up a thing if you have no heart for it . " " You mistake me altogether , " interposed Harry , hastily . " I have not the least wish to give up the law . " " So let it be then . And I agree to your request  --  provided that you ' pass ' within a year . " " All right  --  thanks , " returned Harry , thinking that he had made a capital arrangement . " I suppose , " added his father , " that you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless it interferes with the bargain , " Harry began  --  " Ha , ha ! " laughed Mr. Mornington . " You will make a good lawyer yet , I believe . " " I hope so , " responded Harry , lighting his cigar . On the first of February , they all set out for Boston , according to the previous arrangement . On their arrival in that city , they found that Charles and Ada had been there some days . Charles had received a telegram , saying that the elder Ashtons would only get there an hour or so before the steamer left . The girls were delighted at this intelligence , as now there was nothing to mar the happiness of the party during the few days that they would spend together . Ada and Isabel were inseparable , and it was astonishing how much Lucy and Emily had to say . Charles and Harry discussed their future plans . Mr. Mornington had a great many people to see , and a great deal of business to attend to , so that he was closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during meals , which was the only time he was with them . And Mrs. Mornington 's happiness seemed to consist in seeing the young people enjoy themselves . After the arrival of Sir John and Lady Ashton , with Miss Crosse and Louisa , they all went on board the steamer ; and when they had seen them comfortably settled , Emily , Harry and Isabel , returned to the hotel , and the next morning continued their journey to Elm Grove , where Mr. Mornington had stipulated that Harry should stay no more than three weeks  --  or it would interfere with the bargain . CHAPTER VIII . The Arlingtons had a grand ball in honor of Miss Arlington 's twenty-first birthday , which Rose said was n't fair , as Everard did n't have one on his . Mrs. Arlington , always celebrated for the taste and elegance displayed at her parties , has almost surpassed all former occasions in the magnificent arrangement of everything . Isabel wore a plain white dress , and jet ornaments . A single flower adorned her hair ; and the usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of greater animation . The excitement of the occasion had given an unwonted glow to her cheeks . She did , indeed , look lovely , as she stood engaged in lively conversation with Emily , while they were waiting in the drawing-room to receive the guests ; and so Everard thought , who stood talking with his father , while his eyes rested admiringly upon Isabel 's sweet face . After the greater part of the guests had arrived , and the dancing fairly commenced , Isabel , who had been waltzing , returned to the drawing-room . She was scarcely seated , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Louis Taschereau enter . Oh , how her heart throbbed at the unexpected meeting ! Here was Louis , her own Louis , actually in the room . It was annoying , that after being parted so long , they should first meet in a crowded ball-room.  --  Never mind ; she was only too glad to have him there . He looked so well , so bright and happy , as he made his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she delighted . How long would it be before he reached her ?  --  Oh , that the room were smaller , or that she had been nearer the door . It seemed an age while he was shaking hands with Mrs. Arlington . But who is that pretty girl on his arm ? Could it be his cousin Marie ? He has taken her to a seat , and is moving down the room . The hot blood rushed to her cheeks . Someone asked her to dance . " Oh , not yet , " she replied , scarcely heeding who it was that asked her . Louis sees her , and is coming towards her . How her heart bounded , her joy and happiness was so great . She hid her glowing face behind her fan , to conceal her confusion . Another moment and he was by her side , greeting her cordially . " Oh , Louis , " and she smiled upon him , O so sweetly . " You did not expect to see me to-night , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the expression of his face which she did not like  --  something that seemed to freeze up all the warmth of her feelings in an instant . Was it that he thought she was too ready to show what she felt , with so many present who might observe any unusual degree of pleasure on her part . Oh , surely not , for she had been so careful  --  as careful as it was in human nature to be . " Was that your cousin , " she asked , " that you brought with you ? " " No ! that  --  is  --  my wife  --  " he said , with a look of triumph . " Your wife ! Why , what do you mean ? " she inquired , thinking he was jesting . " Just what I say , " he replied . Then , with insufferable insolence , he hissed in her ear , " Louis Taschereau never forgives . " " Indeed , " she answered , assuming an air of indifference that surprised even herself ; for she had felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really , " he said , with cool effrontery , " that assumption of indifference is sublime . But I am not deceived , " he continued , with a scornful laugh ; " my revenge is most complete , my plans have been entirely successful , " and making her a low bow , he retired . And Isabel was left to her own thoughts . But this would not do ; she must not  --  dare not  --  think ; she must have excitement until she could be quite alone . Fortunately , Harry now claimed her as his partner . " Oh , Harry , " she said , " I am so tired of sitting here . " " Why , I asked you for the last dance , and you would n't come , " answered Harry , laughing . " I did n't think it would have lasted so long , " she returned . " Do you know that Louis is here ? " he inquired . " Yes . " " Do n't you think his wife pretty ? " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite with Isabel , but the remotest idea of the real state of the case never for a moment occured to him . When the dance was over , they went out on the glass extension room . Presently Harry said abruptly : " Isabel , I really thought that you would have been Mrs. Taschereau . " " Harry ! " " I did , indeed . " " Harry , do n't , " she said imploringly . Just then Everard and Emily came in , and at the next dance they exchanged partners . As they passed under the hall lamp , Everard remarked the extreme palor of her countenance . " You are ill , Miss Leicester , " he said . You should not have remained so long in that cold place . Let me get you a glass of wine . " " Oh no , thanks . I shall soon get warm with dancing . " " I do n't think that you should attempt this galop . You look too ill ; indeed you do . " " I intend to dance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , I can have another partner . " Everard looked so sad and reproachful as she said this , that she felt sorry for the hasty words . She knew they had been harsh , and he had said nothing but what was kind  --  nothing to deserve anything so severe . But then she dare not sit during a single dance ; she could not , would not , rest a moment . She was making a great effort to ' keep up , ' and it was only by a continual struggle that she could succeed . However , Everard had no more cause for uneasiness on account of her looking ill , as they had scarcely entered the ball-room before her brilliant color had returned . Isabel was decidedly the belle of the evening ; and for this , Grace Arlington never forgave her . Everard saw that Isabel 's gaiety was assumed , and he would have given much to know the cause . Harry was not so keen an observer , and only thought how much she was enjoying herself , and how much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . Oh the weary , weary length of that dreadful evening . Isabel thought that it would never end . But she kept up splendidly . Once she unexpectedly found Louis her vis a vis  --  then came the master-piece of the evening . She looked superb , as with graceful dignity she glided through the quadrille . She avoided touching his hand , except when it was inevitable ; but she did it so naturally , that to others it did not appear premeditated . He spoke to her , but she passed on as though she did not hear . Once again , before the dance was ended , he ventured to address her ; but she replied with grave dignity , " We must meet as strangers : henceforth I shall not know you , Dr. Taschereau . " Louis foamed with rage at the cool contempt conveyed in these words . He ground his teeth , and swore to be revenged . At last the guests all departed , and Harry too had taken leave ( for as this was his last day at Elm Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his promise , for Harry was very strict , and would not have remained another day on any pretext ) . Then Isabel had to listen to the praises bestowed on her by all the Arlington family , who complimented her upon the sensation she had made , and to force herself to join in an animated conversation regarding the events of the evening ; so that she was truly glad when Mr. Arlington dismissed the ' conclave , ' saying that they could discuss the party next day . When Isabel gained her own room , and sat down to think of her trouble , she began to realize the full extent of her misery . She had scarcely known ' till now , how much his love had supported her through all her trials ; or how the thought of one day being his , had softened the ills she had been called upon to endure since her father 's death . Now she must think of him no more  --  he was hers no longer . But worse than this , was the pain and grief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had bestowed upon him . She knew that he was proud , passionate and exacting , yet she loved him ; for these very characteristics , mingled as they were with more endearing qualities , had a peculiar charm for her . How happy she had been to feel that he loved her ; and oh ! the pain , the agony , of knowing that he did so no longer . Why , why had he written that letter ? Oh it was cruel , cruel . And then to think that it had all been planned , premeditated , with the express design of making her suffer more acutely , was bitter in the extreme . To lose his love was misery ; but to know that he was deceitful , cruel and revengeful , was agony beyond endurance . She did not weep : her grief was too stony for tears . " Oh , Louis , Louis , " she moaned in her agony , " what have I done , to deserve such cruel treatment ? " She leaned her head upon her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tumult of her thoughts became intolerable . She pictured to herself Louis , as she loved to see him ; old scenes recurred to her mind , and the days when she had been so happy in his love  --  nor had a wish beyond . Even this very night , how inexpressibly happy had it made her to see him in the room . And oh , to have all her dreams of happiness crushed in a moment . Again she thought how different it might have been had he been faithful and true ; but he was false  --  he did not love her , and what had she to live for now ? A sense of oppression , which almost amounted to suffocation , distressed her , until at length a fearful sensation of choking forced her to rise to get some water ; but ere she could do so , a crimson stream flowed from her mouth , down her white dress , and she fell upon the floor . CHAPTER IX . The daylight was streaming in at the window when Emily awoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kind little heart that Isabel had been so happy , and had enjoyed herself so much . Then she sighed as she thought Harry was gone , but smiled again at the bright prospect she had in view , for Harry had imparted to her the nice arrangement that he had made with his father , and she did so love the idea of travelling for a year . Then again she heaved a little sigh , and hoped he would not overwork himself ; but there was no cause for uneasiness on that score , for Harry was too much accustomed to take things easy , and too wise to work himself to death : and Emmy was content to believe this . But she was that sociable disposition , that she could not half enjoy anything unless she could get some one to sympathise with her . She did so long to tell her news . Late as was the hour when the party broke up , she wanted to tell Isabel ; but Isabel had refused their accustomed chat , saying that it was too late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if Isabel was awake , she did so long to tell her about the year 's travelling . She thought she would go and see . So she got up very quietly , partially dressed , and then threw on her dressing gown , and ran up to Isabel 's room ; but finding the door locked , she rattled the handle slightly , and called through the key-hole , " Isabel ! Isabel ! are you awake ? open the door . " Then as she drew back , something attracted her sight , and impelled her to apply her eye to the said key-hole . She did so ; and horrified beyond description at what she beheld , she shrieked aloud with terror . Her frantic cries brought her father , mother , Everard , and several of the servants , to the rescue . " Open the door ! oh , open the door ! " was all that she could say , wringing her hands in anguish , and pointing to it . " Speak , child , " said her father , " what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " open the door ! open the door ! " without attempting to explain . But Everard , with his firm , quiet manner , and reassuring tone , calmed her almost instantly . Mrs. Arlington did as Emily had done before her . " There is something wrong , " she exclaimed , " we must get the door open . " The united efforts of Everard and his father forced the door , and a more distressing sight can scarcely be imagined than that they beheld . Stretched on the floor lay Isabel , in her ball dress , the blood pouring from her mouth in a crimson stream . As soon as Everard saw this , he waited for no more , but hastened to the stable , and was soon on the road , dashing at a reckless pace , towards Dr. Heathfield 's . Mrs. Arlington quietly desired Norris to remove the children , who , alarmed by Emily 's cries , had crowded into the room , along with the servants . Emily also was dismissed ; and ordering two of the servants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send Norris back again . She then turned her attention to the suffering girl , whose face wore an expression of ineffable agony ; but she was at a loss how to proceed , not knowing what ought to be done , and fearing that she might do harm by injudicious treatment . In less time than could have been imagined , Everard returned with the doctor , who had great difficulty in stopping the bleeding . She had broken a blood vessel , he said , and was in a very dangerous state . He ordered perfect quiet , as the least excitement would cause a return of the bleeding , and then nothing could save her . He questioned very sharply as to what had happened , and gave as his opinion that it had been caused by some great shock , and violent emotion struggled with and suppressed , by undue excitement . Mrs. Arlington repudiated the notion , and protested against such an assumption , saying " that Miss Leicester appeared quite well when she retired to rest . " " These things do not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " therefore in all probability something has occurred of which you know nothing . " " I am convinced that you are mistaken , Dr. Heathfield ; but I will take care that your orders are strictly attended to . No one but myself and Norris shall be allowed in the room . You have no doubt of her ultimate recovery , I trust , " she added . " I could n't pretend to give an opinion at present ; I can only tell you that she is in a most precarious state , " he replied gravely . " Everything depends upon the prevention of the hemorrhage , a return of which would be certain death . At the same time , that is not all that we have to fear . " For a long time Isabel hovered between life and death , scarcely conscious of what was passing around her . Day after day the children would linger on the stairs , whenever the doctor came , to hear his account of Miss Leicester . But he only shook his head , and said " he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they must be very good children . " Then they would return to the school-room , and spend , as best they might , these joyless holidays . At last the longed for answer came  --  " She was certainly better , " and they were delighted beyond measure ; but their joy was considerably damped , when he told them that they could not be permitted to see her for some time yet . Isabel 's recovery was very slow , though every care and attention was bestowed upon her , and each vied with the other in showing kindness to the orphan girl . Still Isabel felt her lonely , dependent condition , acutely . Life seemed a dreary , cheerless existence ; and she experienced a shrinking from the future which seemed to be before her , which was at times almost insupportable . She longed to be at rest . The prostration and langour , both mental and bodily , that accompanied this depression , was so great as to seriously retard her recovery , and almost baffled the doctor 's skill . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only in a sort of waking dream . She took no interest in anything , and appeared quite incapable of making any effort to overcome this apathy . Emily tried her best to amuse her ; but after taking pains to relate everything that she thought of interest that had occurred , Isabel would smile and thank her , in a way that proved she had not been listening . Thus week after week of her convalescence passed , while , to the doctor 's surprise and disappointment , she made no further progress . After visiting his patient one afternoon , he requested a few moments ' conversation with Mrs. Arlington . " My dear madam , " he said , when that lady had led the way into the morning-room , " has Miss Leicester no friends , with whom she could spend a few weeks ? for if she is allowed to remain in this lethargic state , she will inevitably sink . An entire change of air and scene is absolutely necessary . She requires something to rouse her in a gentle way , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but really , I know so little about them , that any arrangement of that sort is out of the question . All those I do know , are at present in Europe , " returned Mrs. Arlington . " But we are anxious to do everything in our power to promote her recovery . If you can suggest anything , I shall be most happy to carry out your plans . I proposed her going to the sea-side , but she would n't hear of it , and said that she hoped she should not trouble us much longer . I remonstrated , but to no purpose  --  she persisted that it was utterly impossible . " " That was the very thing I was going to suggest , " returned the doctor ; " but I trusted that the proposal would have met with a better reception . But if you will allow me , I think I might persuade her to accompany the children , as if on their account . Have I your permission to do so ? " " Full permission to make any arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlington . Doctor Heathfield went back to his patient . He found her alone . " What do you think of making a start to the sea-side ? I think it would do you good . " " Oh , indeed I could not , " returned Isabel languidly . " Mrs. Arlington is very kind , but it is quite impossible . " " Do n't decide so hastily , " replied Dr. Heathfield , taking a seat by her side . " A thing which is impossible , requires no consideration . " " But I am convinced that it is not impossible , " he urged , " and by obliging others , you will also benefit yourself ; it is such a very small thing that is required of you , just to accompany the children to D  --   --  for a few weeks . Indeed I think that you can scarcely refuse after all the kindness that you have received during your long illness . " " I am extremely sorry to have caused so much trouble , but I assure you that I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you wo n't do what little you might to please , " returned the doctor . " Do n't say will not , " Dr. Heathfield . " Ay but I must say will not , and excuse me when I add , that you greatly mistake your duty to give way to this apathy , and thus retard your recovery , " he said kindly . " I do not seek to fathom your trouble , but I do know that it was excessive mental anguish that caused you to break a blood-vessel , and I would remind you that this is not the right way to brood over and nurse your grief , refusing to make any effort to do your duty . " I know it is wrong faltered Isabel with quivering lips , but I can not take an interest in anything or find comfort , save in the thought of early death . " " But that is from the morbid state of mind induced by weakness . " Isabel shook her head . " And will pass off as you get stronger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Pooh , nonsense , I ca n't have you talk in that way , if you only make an effort and go with the children to D  --   --  , I think you will soon alter your opinion . " " Please do n't say any more , my head aches dreadfully , " pleaded Isabel . " One moment and I have done , " he said , " I fear that you forget your position here , the family have behaved to you with the greatest generosity , but still you must be aware that they would not continue to keep an invalid governess , and as I understand that you are entirely dependant upon your own exertions , you must see the necessity of trying the benefit of sea air , when you have the opportunity , do not take it unkindly that I have used such freedom in pressing this matter , think over it quietly , and to-morrow let me know what answer I am to give Mrs. Arlington . " Then he took his leave , and his kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fair patient . CHAPTER X. Mrs. Arlington never for a moment suspected the way in which Dr. Heathfield would induce Isabel to accede to his plans . In justice to her it must be said , that had she known it , she would if possible have prevented it . But in the end perhaps it was better for Isabel that she did not , though the reflections to which his remarks gave rise , were extremely painful . It needed not these cruel hints to remind her of that which had scarcely ever been absent from her thoughts since her father 's death , and she shed very bitter tears , even after she retired to rest she could but weep over her unhappy lot far into the night , until at length the bright moonlight streaming in at the window , reminded her of one above , who doeth all things well , and she resolved to try and do her duty according to His appointment , however trying she might find it , trusting that as her need was , so would strength be given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die according to her wish , even because her work was not yet accomplished . How willingly and with what pleasure had the children received what she had taught them regarding religion ; how eagerly had they listened when she had explained the scriptures ; with what different feelings did they now regard the sabbath as a day of holy rest , and prayer , and praise , instead of a day of weariness , dreaded and hated . Did she not remember how shocked she had been , when Amy said , that she liked all the days except sundays , and the others had expressed the same . And oh , how glad and thankful she felt when Amy not long since , one sunday afternoon had clasped her arms round her neck , and exclaimed that she liked Miss Leicester 's sundays very much . All this she had been able to do through divine blessing upon her endeavors to benefit the children , and would she leave them when her work had only just begun ? No , no , how wrong and selfish had she been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had her work before her  --  her duty to perform . With such thoughts as these , her tears became less bitter . Soft tear of quiet resignation followed the bitter rebellious ones she had shed so abundantly , and she resolved by steady abnegation of self , to forget the past ( as much as might be ) in the business and duties of the present . Then with a prayer for strength to keep this resolution , and patience to wait , and work until such time as rest should be vouchsafed her , she fell asleep . With a severe headache , and extremely weak from the trying night she had past , Isabel waited for the doctor next day , though she had determined to give him a favorable answer , she wondered much how she could go , when she felt almost unable to raise her hand to her head . She was feverish and restless , very anxious for his arrival , yet dreading it , for it seemed as though she were about by her own act , to put an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she fain would prolong . However , when Dr. Heathfield came , she managed to return his greeting with some degree of cheerfulness . " I trust you feel better to-day , " he said . " No , rather worse , the dose you administered was anti-narcotic I assure you , but I have decided to accede to Mrs. Arlington 's wishes . I will do my utmost for the children , but I fear that will be very little , " and she smiled faintly from her pillow . " Pooh , nonsense , you are not to teach at present , we all know you ca n't do that , " returned the doctor cheerfully , " what good would the poor children get if they were cooped up in a school-room all day , time enough for that when they come home again . " Dr. Heathfield began to fear that the dose had been too strong , when he felt the feverish pulse . " You must be very quiet to-day , promise me that you will not worry yourself , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls tease you . " " They never tease me. " replied Isabel hastily . " Oh they do n't , well that is fortunate , " he answered , preparing some mysterious compound that he had taken from his pocket , " now if you take this " he continued , presenting the mixture , " and then take a nice little sleep , you will feel much better by the afternoon , and then if Miss Emily would read to you , it would be better than talking . " " I 'm afraid your patient is not so well to-day doctor , " said Mrs. Arlington coming in , " she seems feverish this morning . " " Oh , she has been tormenting herself , thinking that she had to teach while at D  --   --  , but I think if you keep her quiet , this feverishness will soon subside , and she is going with the children to D  --   --  like a good sensible girl , " replied the doctor . " I am very glad that you have come to that decision Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without you , " ( no more she would ) said Mrs. Arlington , keeping up the farce that she was the obliged party . " Emily and Norris go with you , so that you have no cause for anxiety , dear , " she added , laying her cool hand upon Isabel 's hot forehead . " Is your head very bad , " inquired the doctor , pulling down the blind . Then as Isabel assented , he went on , " if you were to send the quiet one , ( Alice I think you call her ) to bathe her temples with a little lotion it would be as well . " " I think it should be Norris , I do n't like to trust the children , " Mrs. Arlington began . " You may trust Alice , " interrupted Isabel . " Very well , " returned Mrs. Arlington smiling , " then Alice it shall be . " Within a week , everything was arranged for their departure , Everard was to escort them to D  --   --  and see them comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The morning they were to start , Isabel joined them at the early school-room breakfast . This was the first time that Everard had seen her since her illness , and he was inexpressibly shocked at her appearance , and remonstrated with his mother , saying , that Miss Leicester was not in a fit state to travel . " My dear Everard , I am acting entirely under the the doctor 's orders . " " Nevertheless it is cruel , " he replied gravely . " My dear son what can I do , Dr. Heathfield says that it is absolutely necessary . " " It will kill her , that is my opinion of the matter . " he answered " why she can scarcely stand , I had no idea she was so awfully weak . " " But what can I do , " persisted Mrs. Arlington . " Wait until she gets a little stronger , " urged Everard . " But the doctor assures me , that she will inevitable sink , if allowed to remain in the same low spirited state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , and then probably she might not have got so low . It is dreadful to see any one so fearfully weak , " he added in a tone of grave commiseration . " I do n't wonder at your being shocked at her altered appearance , but you should not blame those who have had the care of her , without due consideration . I assure you that she has had every attention , " said Mrs. Arlington reproachfully . " I do n't wish to blame any one , " returned Everard coloring , " surely not you dear mother . " " I am glad to hear it , " she answered , in a somewhat injured tone . " I was sure that it only required a moment 's thought to convince you , that however painful a state Miss Leicester may be in , it has been brought about by circumstances over which we have no control . " Everard looked perseveringly out of the window . And his mother continued " it was at her own request that she remained so secluded . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entreaties too long already , now others must act for her in the way they think best . " " Then it is not her wish to go , " observed Everard . " Certainly not , but the doctor almost insists upon it . " " Kill or cure as I take it , " he returned . " I fear that is too near the truth , unfortunately , " replied his mother . " " Everard remained silent , and Mrs. Arlington saying that the carriage would be round shortly , quitted the room . Then he returned to the school-room , to find Isabel fainting upon the sofa and Emily bending over her in helpless despair , Amy crying , and Alice emptying the contents of a scent bottle over Isabel , and Rose spilling the smelling salts almost into her mouth , in her anxiety to cram it to her nose . This quaint mode of treatment had the desired effect , for Isabel with a great sigh opened her eyes , and asked what was the matter . Dr. Heathfield arrived soon after this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours rest , so that they were forced to wait for the next train . " She ought not to have come down to breakfast , " he said , " let her have lunch in her own room , and remain there until everything is quite ready , then let her go straight to the carriage after the rest are seated , it must be managed quietly or it can not be done . " Then he called Everard aside , and cautioned him , " it is a hazardous thing to move her at all , and requires very nice management , " he said . " It should not be attempted , " returned Everard coldly , " she is only fit to be in bed . " " The doctor smiled incredulously , keep her there and you would soon finish her , and she would be only too content to do it . " " You are severe Dr. Heathfield , " said Everard stiffly . " Come , Come , Everard do n't get angry , you think me a brute no doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes away she may recover . Now you have my honest opinion . " " It seems to me little short of murder , to start her off in this state , " returned Everard . " " Upon my word , who is severe now Mr. Everard , " retorted the doctor . I do n't attempt to deny that moving her may be fatal , if not judiciously managed But if carefully and properly done , I am very sanguine as to the result . " That is a nice way of getting out of a scrape , I must say , " " Oh a very nice way indeed , " said Dr. Heathfield laughing . " I will come in again about one , " he added addressing Mrs. Arlington , " and if I have time , I will go down to the station and see them off . " " Oh , if you could doctor , it would be such a satisfaction to know that you were with them , " Mrs. Arlington answered . Everard could not bring himself to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her going seemed inevitable , he was glad that he was to have the charge of her . A little before one the doctor returned , but only to see that all was right . " He was so very busy , " he said , " but had no doubt that Mr. Everard would manage very well . He could not possibly go down to the station , he had to set a man 's leg two miles off in quite another direction . Everard 's face was a picture , as the doctor so kindly expressed the belief that he would manage very well . Emily was so convulsed with laughter at the sight , that she was forced to stuff her handkerchief into her mouth to conceal her mirth . Everard managed everything so nicely during the journey , that Isabel never knew that he made special alteration on her account , and he assisted her on all occasions in a nice kindly matter of course manner , quite like an elder brother , that prevented any embarrassment on her part . He was also very successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared quite worn out the night they arrived at D  --   --  , Norris insisted upon perfect rest and quiet next day , saying that she should join them at tea if she seemed sufficiently rested , but Everard rebelled , and made Emily amuse her during the morning . Norris submitted without much fuss , as he was a great favorite . " I know as well as you Master Everard , that she needs to be kept more cheerful than she has been , but after all the worry and fatigue of the journey , a little quietness is good for her , " said Norris , endeavoring to justify herself . " I do n't deny that Norris , I only object to her being quite alone . " " And you know sir , that you always get your own way , " replied Norris laughing . " Usually , " returned Everard , " but Norris , understand that I wish her kept quiet . " " As if anyone could be quiet where Miss Emily is , " said Norris reproachfully . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more nor I would Mr. Everard , " she returned with the familiarity that old domestics who have been a long time in a family often acquire . For Norris had been with Mrs. Arlington ever since she was married , now some twenty-six years . After dinner , Everard , Emily and the children , went out for a ramble . On their return , Everard left them near the town , as he had to make some inquiries as to the time the train left , as he was to leave next morning , for they had been so much longer on the way than had been anticipated , consequently his stay at D  --   --  had to be curtailed . When he returned to the cottage , he found Isabel in the old arm chair in the sitting-room , the others had not yet arrived . Isabel was looking wretchedly ill , but pronounced herself much rested . Everard gave her an animated account of their ramble , and an excellent description of the place , but she appeared to take little interest in either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as she leaned her head wearily upon her hand . " O , I do n't mind , " she replied in a tone of such utter indifference that Everard took a book . He did not read however , but sat shading his face with his hand , so as to enable him to contemplate the poor worn face and fragile form of her whom he loved better than life . He pictured her , as she appeared when waiting the arrival of the guests on Grace 's birthday , and the contrast was painful in the extreme , neither could he account for the utter hopelessness depicted on her countenance . " Are you aware that I leave in the morning , " he said , after some time had elapsed . " So soon , " she inquired in surprise . " Yes , by the early train , " he replied . Then I must not miss this opportunity of thanking you , for all the trouble you have taken , and for all the kindness you have shown me . Indeed I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too glad to have been of any service to you , " he returned with something of the old manner . " Will you not write when you are able , if only a line , just a line , I shall be so anxious to hear . " " Emily will write , " she answered quietly . Everard bit his lip , he was silenced but not satisfied ,  --  an awkward pause ensued , then the others came in full of glee to find Isabel down . The tea was a very cheerful one , and Isabel strove to appear interested , and to join in the general conversation , but the effort was too much for her , for when she rose to retire for the night , she all but fainted and alarmed them very much . When Everard came into the sitting-room next morning , he found a cheerful fire burning ( for the morning was raw and misty ) and breakfast on the table , although it was only half-past five o'clock , and shortly after Emily came in . " Why Emmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everard in surprise . " You did n't think that I would let you breakfast alone did you , " returned Emily proceeding to pour out the tea , " but oh , Everard , I 'm so sorry that you are going away so soon , I really am quite afraid to be left alone with Isabel so weak , whatever shall I do if she gets worse . " " As to being alone , why Norris is a host in herself . Besides , you must take it for granted that she will soon get all right . If there really should be cause you must not hesitate to call in the doctor , but remember Dr. Heathfield said you were not to do so , if it could be avoided , and Emmy , if there should be anything serious , mind you telegraph mamma , and if you get very much alarmed , you know that I could get here in a few hours , and I shall not mind the trouble , so make yourself easy . But at all events , I intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you all get on  --  mind you write often Emmy . " This Emmy promised to do , and bid him good bye with a bright face . D  --   --  was a pretty little town on the sea-coast , which was much frequented in summer , but during the winter it was almost deserted . It was very quiet just now as it was so very early in the season . The house in which our party had taken up their abode , was beautifully situated upon some rising ground , about half a mile from the beach . On the right , as far as eye could reach , stretched the broad expanse of deep blue sea , with its ever varying succession of white sails and gay steamers . To the left lay verdant meadows , picturesque villas , and sloping hills , stretching far into the distance until bounded by a belt of forest , beyond which the ground rose again , capped by a rugged crag . Belonging to the house , were pretty grounds tastefully laid out , and a nice shrubbery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . After the first few days , Isabel mended rapidly , and before long was able to join the children and Emily in their rambles , and even got down to the beach after the second week , so that Emily sent charming accounts of Isabel 's progress to her mother and Everard . CHAPTER XI . " Look Louis , what a nice packet has come by express , I wonder what it can be . Oh , open it now dear Louis , " she added , laying her hand coaxingly upon his shoulder , as he was about to pocket the wonderful packet . " I am dying with curiosity , to see what it contains . " " It is only a business affair , nothing to interest you , little curiosity , " he answered playfully . But she was not so easily satisfied , for the start of recognition as he glanced at the writing , had not escaped his wife 's quick eyes . " But I do so want to know what is in it , I felt something hard like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Perhaps the drugs I wrote for , " he returned carelessly . " Drugs from a lady , Louis , " she said archly . " Oh I forgot , no it ca n't be the drugs , but it will keep , " he replied , thrusting it into his pocket . " I must teach you not to be so curious Natalie . Then laughing , she endeavored to withdraw it from his pocket , but he took the little hand in an iron grasp , saying " do n't be silly Natalie . " " Oh Louis , you hurt me , " she pouted . " I did n't intend to do so , " he returned , loosening his hold , but there was a stern , determined look in his face as he did so , which prevented her making any further attempts to satisfy her curiosity , and the large tears welled up into her eyes as he hastily left the room . That night , after Natalie had retired to rest , Louis stood leaning against the chimney-piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the packet , he knew well enough the moment he saw it what it contained , the letters and presents that Isabel had received from himself . Yes there they were , and he would not for worlds have Natalie see them . There they were , the letters , the trinkets , but he had expected something more  --  an angry note , upbraiding him for his mean conduct and requesting the return of her letters . Over this he would have rejoiced , but no , here were the letters and trinkets without note or comment , just enclosed in a blank cover , and this cool contempt annoyed him more than the bitterest expressions of angry reproach would have done . She had returned all that he had ever given her , well , what else had he expected , did he think she would have kept them ? No , of course not , but then he had not thought about it , he knew now that his revenge had had a very different effect to what he had intended , she would cast off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he , trusting to her sweet disposition and deep affection for himself , had expected that she , unable to overcome her wondrous love , would pine and grieve over her great , her irreparable loss . Ah Louis , if this was your object you did not manage the affair skilfully . You also forgot that by marrying another , you were taking perhaps , the only step that could effectually prevent the object you had in view , ( for this , together with the offensive manner in which it was done , supplied her with a motive which aided essentially to enable her to carry out her determination to stifle all feelings of love towards him , in fact to forget him . ) He now saw the folly of the course he had adopted , she would soon forget him altogether , perhaps find another more patient and gentle , who could make her happier than he would have done , such thoughts as these were madness  --  perhaps she might marry another , no , he clinched his fist and vowed she should not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not been aware how madly he loved her , until she was lost to him forever , and he almost cursed the filthy lucre that had lured him on until it had been his ruin . For what had he gained  --  he new what he had lost , the only woman that he had ever loved or could love , but what had he gained , not the satisfaction which he had expected , only a few thousand dollars and a pretty childish little wife of whom he already tired . With an angry exclamation he threw the whole packet into the fire , and then leaning his face upon his hand , before an open book , sat still and pale through the long long night , until in the gray dawn , a soft little hand upon his shoulder , and a warm kiss upon his cheek , aroused him from his reverie . CHAPTER XII . There was a large rock , about a mile to the left of the town of D  --   --  , which was surrounded by numerous small ones . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered at high water , but when the tide was low , Isabel and the others often went there to get shells . They had to be careful to watch the rise of the tide , as , long before the rock was covered the retreat was cut off by the water surrounding the largest rock , like an island , this island gradually diminished , until , when the tide was in it was several feet under water , this part of the coast was very little frequented . One afternoon when they had been at D  --   --  about three weeks or a month , having obtained the shells they wished for , they sat down on the rocks to rest , Isabel began relating a tale she had lately read , and they were all so much interested , that they had not observed that the tide was fast coming in , nor was it until the rock was quite surrounded that they did so . The terrified children clung around Isabel entreating her to save them , while Emily scarcely less alarmed , screamed aloud for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance would be heard in that lonely place , and their danger became more imminent , as a stiff breeze had sprung up , and the surge round the reef was becoming very heavy , and even should they be observed , the passage from the beach to the reef was so dangerous , that only a skilful and experienced hand could possibly succeed in rescuing them from their perilous situation , so that although there was a small boat moored on the beach it did not afford them much consolation . They were constantly drenched with spray , and were quite aware that the reef would be covered with water ere long . " Oh dearest Isabel , what shall we do , " asked Emily , looking ghastly white , and shaking like an aspen . " The water will wash us all away , and then we shall all be drowned , " cried little Amy . " And we shall never see papa and mamma any more , ' added Rose . Alice stood perfectly quiet , ( after the first moment of their surprise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large eyes fixed upon Isabel with an expression that spoke volumes . " I fear there is no escape , " said Isabel , in as calm a tone as she could command , " we can only commend ourselves to the care of our heavenly Father , and patiently await his will . This they did , and then Isabel endeavored to calm litttle Amy , who was crying most piteously , but a shout of joy from Rose , drew her attention once more to the shore . " Here is Everard , oh here is Everard , " cried Rose , clapping her hands and dancing with joy , and sure enough , there was Everard scrambling down the cliff . This was Saturday afternoon , and he had come to spend Sunday with them , but finding they were out he came in search of them , Norris , fortunately being able to tell him where they had gone . As the reef was such a short distance from land , and as a boat was moored on the beach , the children naturally concluded that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel , she knew the dangerous nature of this shallow water , with innumerable rocks only just beneath the surface , but still sufficiently covered to hide them from view , which made it very difficult to take a boat safely through them , even when the water was smooth , but how much more so , now that a rough swell was foaming over them . Indeed it was only by taking a zig-zag course , that any boat could be guided in safety through the labyrinth of rocks . As Everard was quite unacquainted with the perilous nature of the reef , it was well that Isabel had taken particular notice of the only passage and its curious windings , so that they were enabled to direct him how to steer , or the boat would assuredly have been knocked to pieces , and they all would inevitably have perished . But fortunately Everard was the crack oar of the college club , and the owner of the champion medal , and in spite of all difficulties managed to make his way to the reef . Isabel had watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beat fast , for she expected every moment that it would come to grief , and she experienced an indescribable sensation of apprehension when it grated on the rock on which they stood . " Oh , this boat wo n't hold us all , " exclaimed Emily in dismay . " Do n't leave me , " entreated little Amy , " please do n't . " " No darling , you shall not be left , " said Isabel kissing her and then lifting her into the boat . Quickly as this was done , Rose was already in ; Isabel insisted upon both Emily and Alice going , though the boat was by this means very heavily laden  --  Alice would have remained with her , but Isabel would not allow it , as there was every prospect of the reef being entirely covered before the boat could possibly return . " But it seems so mean to leave you here alone . " urged Alice . " It will not mend matters , if two are washed off instead of one , " whispered Isabel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it seems so mean , " she repeated . " Come Alice , " said Everard in a tone that settled the question at once , " every minute is of the greatest importance . " It was agony to him to leave Isabel , but there was no help for it , the boat was now loaded down to the water 's edge . He would gladly have let Alice remain , had there appeared any chance of returning in time , for he would have gained several minutes by so doing , for if the boat had been lighter he could have made better time . As it was he did not dare to risk it , for it seemed like dooming Alice to destruction needlessly . But oh , the horror of leaving Isabel when perhaps she would be washed away by the fast rising tide before he could return . This thought had also decided him to take Alice , for should Isabel be washed off he might be able to save her , but how could he hope to save two in such untoward circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to fly through the water with each vigorous stroke ; his face wore an expression of intense anxiety as he bent to his oars . No words passed his firmly compressed lips after they left the reef , but his contracted brow and heavy breathing revealed how deeply he was suffering . In an incredibly short time they reached the beach , and Everard landed them in a very unceremonies manner , and then started once more for the rock . Notwithstanding all the exertion he had undergone , his face was as pale as death , and the cold damp stood upon his brow . There was an air of determination about him as he sprang back into the boat , that convinced Emily that he would save Isabel or perish in the attempt , and from that day she was master of his secret , but like a dear good sister as she was , she kept it in her kind little heart , though she sometimes built castles in the air . Knowing now the proper course to take , Everard propelled the boat with marvellous rapidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least so Rose said ; yet when he reached the reef , every part on which it was possible to stand was covered with water , and it was with the greatest difficulty that Isabel contrived to cling to a pointed piece of rock which still remained above water , nor could she have done so much longer , as her strength was fast failing . It seemed to Isabel wondrous strange , that she should feel so anxious to be rescued from her perilous situation , when not so long ago she had been so desirous of death , but so it was . It was no easy matter to get the boat to this point , and had it required any more water to float it , it would have been impossible . As soon as Isabel was in the boat a joyful shout was raised by the party on shore . The return to land was slow , as the great exertion he had been forced to use was beginning to tell upon Everard . Of course Isabel was soaking wet , but fortunately a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left on the beach ; this they wrapt round her , and then went home as quickly as might be . " Mercy on us , " exclaimed Norris , as they made their appearance , " what in the name of wonder have you been doing . " " Why getting a soaking do n't you see , " returned Isabel , much amused at Norris 's manner . " Then you will just get to bed right away Miss Leicester , for I would like to know how I am to answer to my Misses and Dr. Heathfield , if you get the consumption through your nonsense , dear me , and you were looking so well . " " But Norris , if I change these wet things surely that will do . " " You just get to bed , I say , for you are in my charge . " Everard laughed . " Now Mr. Everard do n't you be a interfering . " " Oh , certainly not . " " Now come along at once Miss Leicester , and I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bid , not wishing to vex Norris who had been very kind , but she protested against the gruel , but in vain , Norris made her swallow a large basin full , which to Isabel 's intense disgust had a plentiful supply of brandy in it . After this Norris consented to hear the history of their adventures , which was told by the whole five at once . " The air of D  --   --  seems to have done wonders , " said Everard when Isabel made her appearance at breakfast next morning looking quite her former self . " Yes indeed , " returned Isabel with a pleasant smile , " how very stupid you must have thought us yesterday , I ca n't imagine how we could have been so foolish . " " I suppose that you were not aware that the reef would be covered as the tide rose . " " Oh yes , we knew quite well . " " Well then , you were all awfully stupid , if you will excuse my saying so , " returned Everard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You may well be surprised , " Isabel answered coloring , " I am afraid when Mrs. Arlington hears of it she will be of Lady Ashton 's opinion , that I am not fit to have charge of her daughters . " Emily laughed . " Did she say that , " said Everard , " it was very impertinent of her . " " She thinks herself a privileged person , you would be astonished I can tell you if you heard all that she said . " " Do be quiet Emily , " interrupted Isabel . But Emily kept giving provoking little hints all breakfast time , and even as they walked to church she let out little bits , until Isabel grew almost angry . Everard admired the church exceedingly , " that is just such a church as I would like , " he said as they went home . " Oh Everard , " exclaimed Emily , " a little bit of a church like that . " " It is not so small , " he returned . " Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a clergyman I should wish to preach to a crowded assembly in a very large city church , and make a sensation . " " Emily ! " " Oh do n't look so grave . " " A man that would care about making a sensation , would not be fit to be a clergyman . " " Oh Everard , I am sure it is only good clergymen that do make a sensation . " " What do you call making a sensation ? " he inquired . " Why , to have every body saying what a splendid preacher , and praising you up to the skies . " " Of course every clergyman should aim to be a good preacher , but his sermon should be composed with the object of doing as much good as possible , the idea of getting praise by it should never enter his head . " " Of course I know I never should have done for a parson , if I had been a man I should have been a  --   --  . " " Lawyer , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midshipman , " said Emily . " I wonder what Miss Leicester would have been , " observed Rose . " A doctor , " said Emily , " I know she would have been a doctor , would n't you Isabel . " Isabel became scarlet , this was only a random suggestion , but it seemed so like the answer the children had given Emily , that it made her color painfully . " Oh what is the use of talking such nonsense , " she replied , but her vivid color had given Emily a new idea ; Isabel she whispered " do those pet letters come from a doctor , " a shade passed over Isabel 's face like a cloud over the sun , as the thought occured that she should get no more pet letters , as Emily chose to call them , for though she had so firmly resolved not to allow her thoughts to dwell upon the past , there were still times when she was painfully reminded of the happy days that would never return , not that she grieved for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his true character . She knew that it had been her own ideal Louis that she had loved , she had clothed him with virtue that he did not possess , and ascribed to him a nobleness of nature to which he was a stranger , and her bitter sorrow was that he should have proved so different to what she had believed him . She had already begun to think that , as he was what he was , it was all for the best , and even now she felt more of contempt than love regarding him , though nothing short of the offensive and aggravated circumstances that had taken place , could have served to quench such love as her 's . Isabel avoided giving an answer to Emily 's question , by drawing attention to a beautiful yacht that was now making the harbor , this did for the time , but Emily had made enough by her venture to plague Isabel sufficiently about the doctor , so much so , that Everard took occasion when they two were walking in the shrubbery to remonstrate with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you see that Miss Leicester is really annoyed at your nonsense , and I think that it amounts to rudeness in such a case . " " Oh she do n't care about it . " " You are mistaken Emily . " " Oh , but it is such fun , I do so like to make her color up , she looks so pretty . " " But when you see that it really annoys  --   --  . " " When I get into the spirit of the thing , I ca n't stop . " interrupted Emily . " I know it , " replied Everard gently , " and that is the reason that I mention it , otherwise the matter is too trivial to comment upon . " The tears stood in Emily 's eyes , " I did not mean any harm , " she said softly , for Everard had great influence , and the secret of this influence which he had acquired over all the family was , that he was gentle yet very firm . " I did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop when you see that it annoys , and surely you might abstain from such nonsense on a Sunday , it is setting the children a bad example to say the least of it . " CHAPTER XIII . Isabel and the children remained the greater part of the summer at D  --   --  , but Emily returned home to join her mamma and sister , who had consented to join an expedition that had been got up among a few select friends . Upon the last afternoon of their stay at D  --   --  they went for a ramble into a pretty little copse wood , the children were looking for berries , and Isabel sat upon a mossy bank reading . " Come Isabel , let us at least be friends , " said a voice close beside her . Surprised and startled , Isabel beheld Louis Taschereau . " Let us be friends , " he repeated taking a seat on the bank . " Impossible , Dr. Taschereau , " said Isabel rising , " had you broken off your engagement in a straightforward manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergone a change , I should have been quite content to release you , but to have corresponded with me up to the very day of your marriage , and allow me by a chance meeting at an evening party to become aware of the fact for the first time , together with the effrontery with which you behaved on that occasion , are insults which I should be wanting in self respect not to resent . " " My feelings have undergone no change , they can not change , it is you alone that I have ever loved or shall love , my wife I never did , never can . Oh pity me Isabel for I am most miserably unhappy . " " From my heart I pity her who is so unfortunate as to have Dr. Taschereau for a husband , " she replied , " I can not pity you , for if anything could make your conduct more contemptible , it is the fact that you have just acknowledged , that you do not love the girl that you have made your wife , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess to love it is no great loss , and your happiness must ever be a matter of indifference to me . " " Oh cruel girl , I am not so heartless , what grieves me more than even my own misery is the thought of your suffering . " " Then pray do not distress yourself on my account Dr. Taschereau , whatever I may have felt it is past , for when Isabel Leicester could no longer esteem , she must cease to love . " " I will not believe that you find it so easy to forget me , for that you did love me you dare not deny , it was no passing fancy , you must feel more than you are willing to own , " he said angrily . " I do not wish to deny it , " returned Isabel firmly , " but you out to have known me better than to think that I should continue to do so . After you were married it became my duty to forget that I had ever loved you , and to banish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now regrets are useless , even wrong , whatever she may be , she is your wife , and it is your duty and should be your pleasure to make her happy , and as you value happiness , never give her cause to doubt your love . " " As you say , regrets are useless , but that thought only adds to my torture , I can only compare my present wretchedness with the happy lot which might have been mine , but for my own folly , " he said sadly , " but you must help me . " " How can I help you , " exclaimed Isabel . " It is you alone who can , for you are the only person who ever had any influence over me , you must help to keep me right . Will you not forgive me Isabel , and let me be a friend  --  a brother . " " Thank heaven I have no such brother , " exclaimed Isabel fervently , " for I should feel very much inclined to disown him if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you before , whenever and wherever we meet , it must be as strangers . " " As you will , " he said bitterly , " but since you will not have me for your friend , you shall have me for a foe . " " Think not to intimidate me with idle threats , " she answered haughtily , " you have no power to harm me , and I feel assured that as your love is worthless , so in the end your hatred will prove harmless . " " That is as it may be , but still I had much rather that we were friends . " " If an enemy , I defy you , my friend you can never be . " " As you will , " he returned fiercely , " but remember if I go to the bad , with you will rest the blame , " and then he disappeared through the wood . " And what is his wife about during this conversation , writing to her cousin . Let us take a peep at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy , how could I be otherwise with my noble Louis , he is so kind , so thoughtful and considerate , he would not let me accompany him to-day , because I was so tired with the journey yesterday , so I take the opportunity thus afforded me to write to you . Oh Marie , how could you ever suppose that he married me for my money , how could you form so mean an opinion of my generous , noble , high minded Louis , you wrong him Marie , indeed you do . True , he is more reserved than is pleasant , but I presume that is because I am so childish as papa used to say . Would you believe I had a jealous fit about a packet that he received from a lady , which he refused to open when I asked him . Well he sat up very very late that night , and I took it into my stupid little head that his sitting up had something to do with the packet , and the thought so possessed me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there he was in a brown study over some medical work . Oh Marie I felt so ashamed of my foolish fancies . CHAPTER XIV . Upon the morning after their return to Elm Grove , Isabel requested a few moments conversation with Mrs. Arlington . Desiring Isabel to follow , Mrs. Arlington led the way into the morning-room , and after expressing her great satisfaction at the beneficial results of the sea air , she said " that she hoped Miss Leicester 's health was sufficiently restored to enable the children to resume their studies upon the following Monday . " Isabel replied " that she was quite well , and was as anxious as Mrs. Arlington could be , that they should lose no more time . " Indeed for some weeks past she had been teaching during the morning , but it was not of them that I was about to speak , " she continued , " it was of myself , and I trust that you will not blame me for not doing so before I went away , as indeed it was impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by mental suffering , it was indeed a severe shock , " she added , covering her face with her hands , for it was a trial to Isabel , and it cost her a great deal this self imposed task . " Defer this communication if it distresses you , " said Mrs. Arlington kindly . " Oh no , I would rather tell you , " but it was not without some difficulty that Isabel continued , " sometime before my father 's death , I was though , unknown to him , engaged to a medical student , I always regretted concealing our engagement from him in the first instance . I knew it was very wrong , but Louis made me promise not to tell my father , or breathe a word about our engagement to any living soul . I asked him why , but he would give no reason except that he wished it . I promised , but had I known that it was for more than a short period , I think that I should not have done so . About six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to France to a relation who was a celebrated physician , he wanted me to be married privately , this I positively refused , I said that whilst my father lived I would never marry without his consent , and urged him to let me acquaint my father of our engagement . This he refused , I told him that I was sure my father would not object , but he would not listen to me , it was absurd he said , to suppose that he would let us marry if he knew of it , for he was entirely dependent upon his uncle , and had positively nothing of his own as yet , but hoped soon to rise in his profession ; if we were once married he argued , my father would storm a little at first , but would soon give in , and make some arrangement that would prevent his going away , in vain I entreated to be allowed to plead our cause with my father . Louis was inexorable upon that point , he dare not he said , and used every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to his propositions ; but when I resisted all entreaties he was mortally offended , and got into a terrible passion , it seems he never forgave me for thwarting him , but I was not aware of it , for after his anger had cooled down our parting was most kind . During my father 's illness , my secret became an intolerable burden , oh , how bitterly I suffered for deceiving so indulgent a parent , and yet my conscience would not allow me to break my promise . I wrote to Louis imploring him to give the desired permission , and received a very kind letter , assuring me that my altered circumstances would make no difference to him , that in fact the only barrier between us was now removed , but the longed for permission was withheld , Louis did not notice that part of my letter in anyway . Shortly after this , my poor father died  --  died without ever having heard of our engagement , his greatest pain in parting from his darling child , being the grief he felt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief and misery , " said Isabel shedding bitter tears of agony and remorse at the remembrance of that dreadful time , and what it must have been to witness his anguish , as over and over again he would say " oh my child , could I but have left you to the tender care of a beloved husband , or even could I know that you were the promised wife of one who truly loved you , I could die in peace , even though he were not rich in this world 's goods , but to leave you thus my darling child , to make your own way in this wicked world is almost more than I can bear . " " What good " continued Isabel " could I expect after such a return for all dear papa 's fond indulgence and unvaried kindness . After my father 's death , I received a letter from Louis full of love and sympathy , and approving of my plans , as it would be some time before he would be in a position to marry . We continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dr. and Mrs. Taschereau were among the guests , then I learned for the first time that he was faithless and unworthy . You do not know what I suffered , nor his cruel triumph , or you would not wonder that it should end as it did . I have told you all this Mrs. Arlington because I thought it my duty , and also , that should Dr. Taschereau again be your guest , you might kindly spare me the pain of meeting him . " " Poor child you have suffered greatly , " said Mrs. Arlington kindly . She had listened very patiently and very attentively to all Isabel had to say , but she had not said how that she already knew something of this from her own delirious talk during her illness , but she thought that it would make Isabel uncomfortable , therefore she remained silent upon that point . " You may depend that I shall not abuse your confidence " she continued , " I do not promise secrecy , but you may trust to my discretion without fear . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as I shall always be glad to give it , " no doubt , but Isabel was the last person to ask advice , though she had the highest opinion of Mrs. Arlington . " I think you would do well Isabel , to re-consider the offer I made you to visit with my daughters . " " You are very kind ; but , indeed , I would rather not . " " As you please , Miss Leicester ; but I think you are wrong to refuse . You may be sure that the offer is disinterested on my part . " ( Disinterested it certainly was , as neither of the Arlington girls could compare favorably with Isabel as to beauty or accomplishments . ) " I fully appreciate your kindness , Mrs. Arlington , but indeed it would be extremely unpleasant to do so , " returned Isabel . " I can not let this opportunity pass without expressing my gratitude for your great kindness during my illness , for I can never , never repay you . But I will use my best endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And that will quite repay me , " replied Mrs. Arlington , kindly . CHAPTER XV . Upon a beautiful moonlight night , under the trees in the garden of Madame Bourges ' boarding-school , near Versailles , quite secure from observation stood Arthur Barrington and Louisa Aubray , engaged in earnest conversation . " Are you happy here , dearest Louisa ? " he inquired , in accents of deepest tenderness . " Happy ! Ah , no , Louisa is never happy , " she answered , " but lonely and unhappy  --  so unhappy and miserable ! " " But you are not lonely now that I am here , dear Louisa . " " No ; but , when you are gone , it is so dreary  --  oh , so dreary ! " " You used to think that you would be so happy at school . " " Ah , yes ! but I 'm not . Madame is harsh , the teachers cruel , and the girls so strange : they do not love me , " she cried , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Louisa , dearest Louisa , do not say so ! " he exclaimed passionately ; " do not say that nobody loves you , when I have come so far expressly to see if you are happy . I love you , Louisa , with all the warmth of my ardent nature , with undying affection . I want you to be mine  --  MINE ! that I may guard you from every ill but such as I can share . " " Oh ! can you  --  will you  --  do this , Arthur ? Will you , indeed , share all my troubles and sorrows , nor deem them , when the first full joy of love is past , unworthy of your attention  --  your cares , too great to admit of such trifles , claiming your consideration ? If you will , and also let me share all your joys and griefs in perfect sympathy and love , then  --  then my dream of happiness will be fulfilled ; but if , in years to come , " she continued , with suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indifference take the place of sympathy and love , Oh I would wish to die before that day ! " " Dearest Louisa , can you doubt me ? " " I will trust you , Arthur , but I have seen that which makes me almost doubt the existence of love and happiness . I can picture to myself the home of love and peace that I would have . Is it an impossibility ; is it but an ideal dream ? " " May it be a blessed reality , my darling Louisa ! " he exclaimed , with ardor , as he clasped her passionately in his arms . She made no resistance , but , with her head resting upon his breast , she said , in a tone of deep earnestness : " If you loved me always , and were always kind , oh Arthur , I I could do anything  --  suffer anything  --  for your sake , and care for naught beyond our home . But , my nature is not one " she continued impetuously , " that can be slighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endure it patiently . No ! " she added , with suppressed passion , " a fierce flame of resentment , bitterness , perchance even hatred , would spring up and sweep all kindly feelings far away ! " " Oh , Louisa , Louisa ! " interrupted Arthur in a tone of tender remonstrance , " why do you speak in this dreadful manner  --  why do you doubt my love and constancy ? " The impetuous mood was gone , and a trusting confidence succeeded it . She fixed her eyes upon his face with an expression of unutterable tenderness , as she answered , in a sweet , soft voice , " I love you , Arthur ; I can not doubt you ; you are all the world to me . " " Then you will leave here as soon as I can make arrangements for our marriage . " " How gladly , how joyfully , I can not tell ! " she replied , smiling sweetly through her tears . " Tell me again that you love me ; I do so want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , indeed , or is it only a beautiful dream ? I have lived so desolate and alone that I can scarcely believe my happiness . " " You may believe it , Louisa , it is no dream ; my love for you is no passing fancy  --  it is true and sincere , and will last till life shall end , " he said , kissing her tenderly . " Ha , ha ! " laughed Lucy Mornington , as she came full upon the lovers , " Now I have found you out , Miss Aubray ; I wondered what was up . Oh , if Madame could only see you , what a scene there would be ! " she cried , dancing about and laughing immoderately . " " How dare you come here ? " exclaimed Louisa , her large eyes flashing angrily , while her whole frame trembled with passion . " How dare you follow and watch me , how dare you ? " she repeated . " Hush , Louisa ! " said Arthur , soothingly , " Lucy is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure she would not be unkind ; and we must not mind her laughing , as I 'm afraid that either of us would have done the same if placed in the same unexpected position . " Louisa now clung to Lucy , weeping violently , and imploring her in the most winning manner not to betray them to Madame . " Do n't be afraid , Louisa ; Lucy and I were always good friends , and , now I come to think of it , she will be a most valuable assistant . I am sure we may trust her , " and he looked inquiringly at Lucy . " That , you may , " answered Lucy ; " but there is no earthly use in trying to keep a secret from me , as that is utterly impossible ; but whatever you may have to say , you must defer to a more auspicious moment , for Mademoiselle Mondelet has missed Louisa , and she is hunting everywhere for her . So make yourself scarce , Mr. Arthur ; we will enter the chapel by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditions , and they will never imagine that we came from the garden . Come along , Louisa . " " Adieu ! Lucy , and many thanks for your warning , for I certainly do n't want Mademoiselle to find me here . Farewell , dearest Louisa ; I will be here at this time to-morrow evening , " said Arthur , and then he quickly disappeared . Lucy and Louisa went into the chapel , and the former commenced playing the organ , which she often did . So that when Mademoiselle came into the chapel , by-and-bye , fuming about Louisa , Lucy replied , with the greatest coolness , " Oh , we have been here ever so long . " Shortly after this , Isabel received the following epistle from Lucy : DEAREST ISABEL ,  --  I am at school again , instead of being in London enjoying myself as I expected . I am cooped up in this abominable place . I suppose Mamma thinks me too wild . Heigho ! But , never mind ; Ada and Charles are going to remain three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . Ah , me ! I think I should die of ennui in this dismal place ( which was once an abbey , or a convent , or something of the sort , I believe , ) but , fortunately for me , an event has occurred which has just put new life in my drooping spirits . We have // who in the name of wonder do you think the parties were ? Arthur Barrington and Louisa Aubray . Oh , what a rage Lady Ashton will be in ! Do n't be shocked , my pet , when I tell you that I went into the affair with all my heart and soul , and was bridesmaid at the interesting ceremony . Oh , Isabel , Arthur is so thoroughly nice that I almost envied Louisa her husband . We managed everything so beautifully that they were married and off upon their travels before Madame found out that there was anything in the wind . And the best of the fun was that Arthur brought a clergyman friend with him , and they were married in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sweet little piece of fun is not known , and is never likely to be . I enjoyed the whole thing immensely . Of course they do n't know that I had anything to do with the affair . Woe betide me if they did ! If Louisa had had a father and mother , I would not have had anything to do with it ; but , under present circumstances , I thought it was the best thing she could do . So I helped them all I could  --  in fact I contrived it all for them  --  when I once found out what they were up to . Yours , at present , in the most exuberant spirits , LUCY MORNINGTON . P.S.  --  The happy pair have gone to Switzerland or Italy . " Here , Emily , " said Isabel , when Emily came in , " I think this will amuse you . " " I think Arthur and Louisa did very wrong , " she resumed , when Emily had finished reading . " Ah , well , I have not much fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable , if they were to marry at all , " said Emily , laughing . " But I thought that second cousins could n't marry . " " They ca n't , I believe ; but then Arthur and Louisa are no relation  --  for though he always calls Lady Ashton ' Aunt , ' she is not his aunt in reality . Do n't you know Lord Barrington 's first wife was Lady Ashton 's sister , and Arthur 's mother was the second wife ; so you see they are no relations , " replied Emily . " Oh , what a rage Lady Ashton will be in ! " she resumed . Do n't you know that Louisa 's father was Arthur 's tutor . There was a dreadful quarrel between the two families about that marriage ; they would n't speak for years , and the old folks are barely civil to each other when they meet even now . But she likes Arthur . What a good thing it is that she is going to stay away so long . But I 'm sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So we shall , but May and Peter will be here , and they are a host in themselves . " " But May ca n't be compared to Lucy ; I will have her come ; I will tell Harry so . She can come out with her papa and mamma , and go back in the spring . And now , my dear , guess what I came to tell you . " " Rose told me your brother was to come to-day . " " What a sieve Rose is , " exclaimed Emily . " But I have more than that to tell . I have a letter from Harry ; he is coming soon , and has passed his examination already . What do you think of that ? " and she looked so triumphant and delighted . " Why , Emily , how ever could you read my letter , and discuss the news it contained , when you came on purpose to tell me ? I declare , wonders never will cease . " " The fact is that I was so astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my own letter for the time . " " I suppose Harry will make a long stay now ? that will be very nice . " " No , he says he can only stay a week , or perhaps a fortnight . He has promised a friend to go to the Blue Mountains , " pouted Emily ; " I wish his friend was at Jericho . " Isabel laughed . " Suppose in that case Harry had gone with him . " " Do n't be provoking , Isabel . But , to turn the table , how is it you never get any of those ' nice letters ' now-a-days . " " Do n't be provoking , Emily ! " said Isabel , growing very hot . " Ah , you see I always get the best of it , " returned Emily , laughing . " I must go and dress , for I have to make some calls with Mamma and Grace . " CHAPTER XVI . " I do not know what on earth they will do , " cried Emily , tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a terrible stew about the anthem ; Mary Cleaver is laid up with a bad cold and sore throat , so that there is no chance of her being able to sing to-morrow , and there is not another in the choir that could make anything of the solo  --  at least not anything worth listening to . Is it not provoking ?  --  just at the last minute . Grace , now wo n't you take Miss Cleaver 's place just for once ? Do , please . " " Thanks ! But the idea is too absurd . Fancy my singing at a ' missionary meeting . ' " " Perhaps Isabel would , " interposed Rose . " The idea is too absurd , " returned Emily , affectedly . " Do n't be impertinent , Emily , " said Grace , haughtily . " It is useless to talk of Isabel , she added , addressing Rose , " she refused before , and Everard would not be so absurd as to ask her again ; he was quite pressing enough  --  far too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sure he wo n't ; he will not easily give up his ' pet anthem , ' " replied Emily . " Well , Isabel will not do it , you will see , " answered Grace . " I 'm not so sure of that , either ; he usually gets his own way somehow or other . " " Then how was it he did not succeed at first ? " said Grace , tartly . " Oh , because Isabel made him believe that it would not be fair to Miss Cleaver . " " Oh , Emily , that was not why Isabel would not , and she never said it was , " exclaimed Alice ; " she told Everard she had several reasons for not singing , and , she added , it would not be fair to Miss Cleaver after being in the choir so long . " " And pray what might these weighty reasons be ? " asked Grace . " I do n't know , " returned Alice . " Nor Isabel , either , I imagine , " Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily ? " asked Isabel , who now joined them . " " The choir are in trouble about the anthem . " " How is that ? " inquired Isabel . " Mary Cleaver is sick , " returned Emily , " and Everard is awfully put out about it . " Everard entered with a roll of music in his hand . " Where is Miss Leicester ? " he asked . " She is here , " Grace answered , languidly . " You will not now refuse to take the soprano in the anthem to-morrow , he said , when I tell you that it is utterly impossible for Miss Cleaver to do so , and that the anthem must be omitted unless you will sing . " " I am sorry that the anthem should be a failure , but I really can not , " replied Isabel , evidently annoyed . " Oh , yes you can  --  just this once , " he pleaded . But Isabel only shook her head . " Do you mean , Miss Leicester , that you positively will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlington , I do not intend to sing in the choir to-morrow . " " That is your final decision ? " " Yes . " He sat beating his foot impatiently on the ground . " Is there no one else ? Everard " asked Rose . " No one ! " he answered , in a very decided tone . He tossed the music idly in his hand , though his brow contracted , and the veins in his forehead swelled like cords . They were very quiet ; no one spoke . Emily enjoyed this little scene immensely , but Grace was highly disgusted that her brother should deign to urge a request which had already been denied , and that , too , by the governess ; while Isabel sat , thinking how very kind Everard had always been , and how ill-natured it seemed to refuse  --  how much she wished to oblige  --  but the thing was so distasteful that she felt very averse to comply . She remembered , too , the beautiful flowers with which Alice had kept her vases constantly supplied when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to whom she was indebted for them , as but one person in the house dare cull the choicest flowers with such a lavish hand , " What are you waiting for , Everard ? " Emily inquired , at length . " For Isabel to relent , " said Grace , contemptuously . Everard rose , and stood for a moment irresolute ; then , going to the piano , set up the music , and , turning to Isabel , said in a tone of deep earnestness : " Will you oblige me by just trying this , Miss Leicester ? " Grace 's lip curled scornfully , and Isabel reluctantly seated herself at the piano . Having once commenced , she thought of nothing but the beauty of the anthem , and sung with her whole soul  --  her full , rich voice filling the room with melody . Never had Isabel sung like this since she had left her happy home . When she ceased they all crowded round her , entreating her to take Miss Cleaver 's place just this once . " She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will  --  will you not , Isa  --  Miss Leicester ? " he asked persuasively . Isabel was silent . " A nice example of obliging manners you are setting your pupils , " said Emily , mischievously , at the same time hugging her affectionately . " What makes my pet so naughty to-day ? " " I suppose I must , " said Isabel , in a tone of annoyance ; " I see that I shall have no peace if I do n't . " " Thanks , Miss Leicester , " said Everard , warmly ; " I ca n't tell you how much  --  how very much  --  obliged I am . " " I should not imagine that such a very ungracious compliance called for such excessive thanks , " said Grace , sarcastically . " Do n't be ill-natured , Gracie , " returned her brother , laughing ; " you do n't know how glad I am . " " But it is so very absurd , Everard , the way you rave about Isabel 's singing , any one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nor have I , before , ever heard such singing as Miss Leicester 's , " he returned . " Oh , indeed , how very complimentary we are to-day ! " retorted Grace . " Such singing as Miss Leicester 's ! " echoed Isabel , with a gesture of contempt which set Emily laughing excessively , while Everard beat a hasty retreat . In the evening Emily and Isabel had their things on , and were chatting and laughing with the children in the school-room , before going down to the church for the practising , when Mrs. Arlington came in , saying , " I am afraid that you will all be disappointed , but Dr. Heathfield strictly prohibits Miss Leicester taking any part in the singing to-morrow . " " Oh , Mamma ! " exclaimed Emily . " He says that it would be highly dangerous , and that she must not attempt it . " " But , Mamma , we can not have the anthem without her . " " I am very sorry , my dear , but it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the unpleasant tidings to digest as best they might , Mrs. Arlington returned to the drawing-room . " Now is not that too bad ? Who in the world told Dr. Heathfield anything about it , I should like to know ? " cried Emily , indignantly . " What possessed him to come here to-night , I wonder  --  tiresome old fellow ? " " But if it would really do Isabel harm , I think it was very fortunate he came , " said Alice , gravely . " Oh be quiet , Alice ! you only provoke me , " returned Emily . " Are you young ladies ready ? " asked Everard . " Oh , Miss Leicester is not going to sing , " cried Rose , saucily . " What will you do now ? " " What do you mean ? " he asked , looking inquiringly from one to another . " Why , " said Emily , " Dr. Heathfield has forbidden anything of the kind , and was quite peppery about it . " " Confound Dr. Heathfield ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , turning to Isabel . " Yes . " " It is all nonsense ! I shall speak to Heathfield about it . " " That will do no good , Everard , " interposed Emily ; " He told mamma that Isabel ought not to think of doing so at present . " " You did not think it would hurt you Miss Leicester , " he asked . " Never for a moment . " " I dare say he thinks you are going to join the choir altogether , I shall tell him that it is only the anthem to-morrow , that you intend taking part in , surely he can not object to that . " What passed between them did not transpire , but when Everard returned he said to Isabel in a tone of deep earnestness , " I should not have asked you to sing , had I known the harm it might possibly do you , indeed I would not , and though annoyed beyond measure at having to give up the anthem , I am very glad that Dr. Heathfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for had any serious consequences ensued , I alone should have been to blame . " " No one would have been to blame , all being unaware of any danger , " returned Isabel warmly , " but I am convinced that Dr. Heathfield is considering possibilities , though not probabilities " she added coloring , not well satisfied to be thought so badly of . " " Tell us what he said , Everard , " petitioned Emily . " He spoke very strongly and warned me not to urge her , " Everard replied evidently unwilling to say more . " I do n't believe that it could harm me , " said Isabel thoughtfully , " but of course  --  . " " You are jolly glad to get off , " chimed in Rose saucily , and received a reproof from Everard . " We can not disregard what he says , " continued Isabel finishing the sentence . " Certainly not , " returned Everard , and so the anthem was omitted . CHAPTER XVII . Alone in tears sits Natalie , alas she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality that she is an unloved neglected wife , and bitter very bitter is this dreadful truth to the poor little bird far far from all who love her , for the wide ocean rolls between them , poor little humming bird formed for sunshine and happiness , how cans't thou bear this sad awakening . Ah cherished little one , with what bright hopes of love and happiness dids't thou leave a sunny home , and are they gone for ever , oh what depth of love in thy crushed and bleeding heart , striving ever to hide beneath a sunny face thy aching heart , lest it should grieve or vex the husband thou lovest so fondly , while he heedlessly repelling the loving one whose happiness depends upon his kindness , or impatiently receiving the fond caress , discerns not the breaking heart nor the secret anguish this same indifference causes ; Ah Louis , Louis , should not one so bright and gentle , receive something better than impatient gestures and harsh words , which send the stream of love back with a thrilling pain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hope has proved vain , her babe , her darling babe has not accomplished what she fondly imagined , brought back her Louis 's love , if indeed she ever possessed it , and it is this thought which wrings her gentle heart and causes those sobs of anguish , that make her fragile form to quiver like an aspen , as the storm of grief will have its course . If indeed he ever loved her , that he does not now is clear enough ; but did he ever , why should she doubt it , she has accidentally heard the following remarks , and seen Louis pointed out as the object of them : He was engaged to a beautiful girl , but she was poor , so meeting with an heiress , he was dazzled by the prospect of wealth and married her ; but the marriage had proved an unhappy one , that Mr. T  --   --  had soon tired of his gay little wife , and now treated her with the greatest indifference and neglect , and that having married her solely for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss  --   --  and bitterly repented his folly . It may be true she sighed , for she knew in her heart that the part regarding his treatment of herself was but alas too true ; but could he indeed love another , no , she would not believe it , she would dismiss the thought , but still the words rung in her ears , having married her solely for her money . Could Marie be right , but no , no , she would not , could not believe it , O Louis , Louis , how have I loved you , how I love you still , and is my love entirely unrequited ? And now a new feeling springs up in her heart , bitter hatred towards her unknown rival , with beating heart and trembling lips she calls to mind the packet and Louis 's embarrassment , the beautiful miniature she had seen by accident , and his evasive answers when questioned about the original , could she be the Isabel he had named her darling after , in spite of all she could urge as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could confide all her troubles to him and tell him all her fears , and if possible have her mind set at rest , but she dare not , for though she loved him so devotedly , she feared him too , his fierce bursts of passion frightened her . Oh I will win his love in spite of this hateful girl , I will be so gentle , so careful to please him , so mindful of his comfort ( as if poor thing she had not always been so ) that he shall forget her , and love his own little wife , and wearied with conflicting emotions , she laid her head upon the table and sobbed herself to sleep , and thus Louis found her at two o'clock in the morning , when he returned from attending a patient . " Good gracious ! Natalie , what are you doing here , " said he raising her from her uncomfortable position , " why you are quite chilled , " he continued as a convulsive shudder shook her whole frame , " what ever possessed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you be so foolish . " She raised her large dark eyes to his with an expression intensely sad and entreating , and whispered " O Louis , tell me do you love me ! " he could not bear the searching eagerness of that wistful gaze , and turning from her answered " can you doubt it you silly little thing , come , take the lamp and go to bed , while I get you something to stop this shivering  --  he turned to go . " Do not leave me , oh Louis , stay , " she cried , and fell senseless on the floor . Through that night and for many long days and nights , Natalie lay in a burning fever , and in the delirium caused by it she would beseech him to love her , and again and again in the most pathetic manner entreat him not to leave her , and say , it was very wicked of him not to love her , why was it , what had she done to displease him , then murmur incoherent words about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not his poor little Natalie , and then starting up with outstretched arms she would implore him to be kind to her and love her . Whether Louis felt any remorse at dooming a being so bright and fair to such a miserable existence , or whether there was not more anger than sorrow in that impenetrable calm none could tell ; he was very attentive , and tried to sooth with gentle words , but woe to any of the attendants who dared to make any remark upon her in his hearing ; all she said was treated indifferently as the natural result of the disease , and the nurse was commanded to be silent , when she presumed to say poor dear ; whatever passed amongst themselves , in his presence they maintained a discreet silence . When Natalie recovered she was sweet and gentle as ever , but a passive lasting melancholy took the place of her former charming vivacity , henceforth life had lost its charm ; with patient love she bore with Louis 's variable temper , and was never known to speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the happy days in the beautiful villa home to which Arthur Barrington had taken his bride . But at length remorseful thoughts of his father 's loneliness would intrude themselves upon Arthur 's happiest hours , until he could bear it no longer ; so he told Louisa the unkind way in which he had left his father , and how unhappy he was on that account , proposing that they should proceed to Barrington Park without delay . To this she readily agreed , but unfortunately their route lay through a district where a malignant fever was very prevalent , and while traversing a lone and dreary portion of this district , Arthur was attacked with this terrible disease . He strove bravely against it , and endeavored to push on to the nearest town , but that was yet forty miles distant , when Arthur became so alarmingly ill that they were forced to stop at a little hamlet and put up with the best accommodation its miserable inn afforded , which was poor indeed . There was no doctor to be had nearer than Z  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible . With this they were obliged to be content ; but day after day passed and none came , while Arthur hourly became worse , and Louisa grew half wild with grief and fear . " If we could only get a doctor , I believe he would soon be well ; but , ah ! it is so dreadful to see him die for want of proper advice , " murmured Louisa , glancing toward the bed where Arthur lay tossing in the terrible malaria fever , so fatal to temperaments such as his ; " but he will not die , O no I can not believe that my happiness will be of such short duration that I shall again be left in such icy desolation . Oh ! Arthur , Arthur , do not leave me she sobbed , covering her face with her hands , but Arthur does not heed her , racked with burning fever he can not even recognize her , as with patient gentleness she endeavors to alleviate his sufferings with cooling drinks , or bathes his burning brow . In vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn could suggest , or that Louisa 's love could devise . Day by day his life ebbed away consumed by the disease , the prostration and langour following the fever being too much for his strength , thus Louisa saw that he who alone in the wide world loved or cared for her , was fast passing away ; still though she could not but see it was so , she would not believe the terrible truth , but clung to the hope that a doctor might yet arrive before it was too late , and so her great bereavement came upon her with overwhelming force , when after a day of more than usual langour , during her midnight vigil , he ceased to breathe . Louisa had not known why he had clasped her hand so tightly all that night as she sat beside his couch , he was dead , and with a cry of anguish Louisa fell insensible beside the lifeless body of her husband . The moonbeams fell alike upon the inanimate forms of the living and the dead , and the morning sun rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight cry of anguish , or if heard it was unheeded , and the noisy lamentations of the girl who brought in the morning meal , greeted her as consciousness returned . The master of the inn said the funeral must take place at sunset , and Louisa shed bitter tears in the little room which was given her , while the corpse was being prepared for interment , for these precipitate funeral arrangements added greatly to Louisa 's grief . Composed but deadly pale she followed Arthur 's remains to the grave  --  his only mourner ; there was no minister to be had , but Louisa could not see him buried thus , so read herself a portion of the beautiful burial service of the Episcopal Church , then amid tears and sobs she watched them pile and smooth the earth above him , and when they had finished , with a wail of agony she threw herself in a burst of passionate grief upon the damp earth , and there she lay until darkness enveloped all around , heedless of danger , of time , of everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreparable loss . And there she would have remained but for Francesca , the girl who had waited on them ; Francesca had some pity for the poor lady , and with a great effort stifled her superstitious fears , and went down to the grave and led her away , whispering you will get the fever here . So Louisa returned desolate indeed to the miserable inn , not for a moment because of the fear of fever , only dreamily , scarcely knowing where she was going . Those long hours with the dead had but too surely done their work , Louisa was attacked with the same fever of which her husband died , but carelessly tended and neglected as she was , she did not die . When she was able to go out again , she would sit pensively for hours by Arthur 's grave , or in passionate grief throw herself upon it and wish that she too might die . It was after one of these paroxysms of despair that Louisa remembered her promise to Arthur , that she would take his letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reluctantly prepared to depart , when to her dismay she found that a cheque for a large amount had been abstracted from Arthur 's desk , and further search discovered that nearly every article of value had been perloined during her illness . Their charges were so exorbitant , that it took nearly all the money she had to satisfy their demands , and when she mentioned the cheque , &amp;c. , they held up their hands in horror at the idea , that after all their kindness she should suspect them of such villiany . Weary and broken-hearted , Louisa set out on her lonely journey , and at length arrived sad and dejected at Barrington Park , having had to part with nearly all she possessed in order to prosecute her journey . After some difficulty she succeeded in gaining Lord Barrington 's presence . " Well , what is it you want ? " asked his lordship impatiently , but Louisa could not speak , she could only hold out Arthur 's letter with a mute gesture of entreaty . " I do n't want to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , and be quick , as I am busy . " Tell him what she wanted !  --  tell him that she wanted him to love and receive her as a daughter  --  tell him that the love he bore his son was henceforth to be transferred to the unhappy being before him  --  how could she tell him this ? how could she tell him what she wanted ? " Speak , girl , I say ! " he cried , angrily . " Read this , " she faltered , " it will tell you all . " " I will not , " he answered ; " tell me , or begone ! " Falling on her knees before him , she held out the letter , crying : " I am Arthur 's wife . He is dead , and this is his letter , and I am here according to his wish  --  to his dying injunction . Take it  --  read it  --  it will tell you all . " " Good gracious , the girl is mad ! " he exclaimed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up and go about your business , or I shall have you put in the asylum . " Louisa felt choking , she could not speak ; she could only stretch out her arms imploringly , still holding the letter . " There is some great mistake ; my son is not dead , nor is he married , so do not think to impose upon me . " " There is no mistake ; Arthur is dead , and you see his widow before you , " she managed to articulate . " No , no , Arthur is not dead , poor crazy girl ; get up and go away , " and he threw her half a sovereign , saying , as he did so , " now go away quickly , or I shall have you turned out ; and mind , do n't go about with your tale about being my son 's wife , or I shall send the police after you . Now go . " Crushed and humbled as she was by sorrow and suffering , this was more than Louisa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her lips quivering with anger , while her large eyes flashed with passion , she cried , as she threw the proffered alms upon the table , in proud defiance , " Keep your alms for the first beggar you see , but do not insult me . I ask but what is right  --  that , as your son 's wife , I should receive a home and the necessaries of life from you , his father , as he promised me . This you refuse me ; but , were I to starve , I would not take your alms , thrown to me as a crazy beggar  --  never , never ! " " Go , go ! " he cried , she by her burst of passionate indignation still more confirming the idea that she was mad . " I will go , " she answered , " and will never again trouble you ; but know that I am no impostor  --  no insane person . " John , who answered his master 's summons , stood wonderingly at the door , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking terribly mystified . " Take this , " she said to him , " and if you loved your young master , give this to his father when he will receive it . " Then with a full heart Louisa hastened from the park . A short distance from the gate was a small copse wood , which Louisa entered , and , throwing herself down on the grassy bank beside a stream , gave way to a storm of passionate grief . " Oh , Arthur , Arthur ! " she sobbed , " how desolate is Louisa in this cold , cruel world . " The storm of grief would have its way , nor did she strive to check it , but continued sobbing convulsively , and shivered with cold , though it was a balmy autumn day ; the icy chill at her heart seemed to affect her body also . When at length she became more calm , she began to consider what course she should next pursue . She turned out her scanty store of money  --  fifteen and sixpence was the whole amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had left the small bag ( the sole remnant of the numerous trunks , etc. , with which they had left  --   --  ) , and remain there that night , and start next day for Brierley , the present abode of her grandfather , and try her luck in that quarter , but with small hope of success . Not for herself would she have done this , for she trembled at the thought of meeting him , but circumstances made it imperative . CHAPTER XIX . " Please maam , is baby to go for her walk this morning , " asked the nurse as Louis and Natalie sat at breakfast , " Oh no Sarah , " returned Natalie . " Why not , I should like to know , " interposed Louis , " it is a beautiful day and will do her good , I ca n't see how it is that you always set your face against her going out . " " Oh but Louis , you know she has a bad cold . " " Well it will do her cold good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that going out is bad for a cold . Take her out Sarah . " " But Louis I 'm afraid it will rain . " " Rain , nonsense , what are you dreaming of this bright morning , take her out by all means Sarah , it will do her good . " Natalie gazed uneasily at the dark storm cloud in the horizon and was anything but satisfied . " Why Natie you look as sober as a judge " said Louis as he rose to go on his morning calls , " looking out for rain eh , do n't be alarmed baby is not sugar nor salt . " The careless gaiety of his tone jarred unpleasantly with her anxious fears for her darling , and she sighed as she looked pensively out upon the bright landscape , with another sigh she left the window and went about her various duties , about an hour after this , Natalie was startled by a vivid flash of lightning , and deafening peal of thunder ; down came the rain in torrents , oh where is baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front door , but no sign of Izzie , and how cold the air has turned . She orders a fire to be made in the nursery , and waits impatiently for baby 's return . She comes at last , " oh my baby ! " Natalie exclaims as she takes in her arms the dripping child , wet to the skin , and white as a sheet , every bit of clothing soaked , saturated . Natalie can not restrain her tears as she removes them , and warms the child before the bright fire , " oh my baby , my baby , my poor little Izzie , " she murmured passionately , as she soothed and caressed her pet . Baby was happy now in her fresh clothes , and nestled cosily to her mother . After the thunder shower the weather cleared and all seemed bright and joyous without , but Natalie 's heart was heavy , she was still very uneasy about the child , Louis was detained from home the entire day . At night baby became so oppressed in her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listen for Louis return , as she knelt by the child 's cot in agony watching her intently . " Oh if he would but come , why , why , did he send her out . Oh the agony , waiting , watching , yes that is his step at last , she sends message after message , but he comes not , he will come when he has had his dinner she is told . It wrings her heart to leave her darling , even for a moment , but it must be done . Softly she glides to where he sits , and laying her trembling hand upon his arm , says in a husky voice " Louis come now , do not wait a moment longer  --  baby has the croup " in an instant he was at baby 's side . Natalie 's ashy face and the word croup , acted like a talisman . It was croup , and a very bad attack too , he speedily did what was needful , but not without almost breaking his poor little wife 's heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful of her , " he said angrily " ten minutes more , and I could have done nothing for her . " " Oh Louis , " ( he had been home now nearly a quarter of an hour . ) " There must have been some gross mismanagement and fearful neglect , to bring on such an attack as this , to a child that has never been subject to croup , how she ever got into this state passes my understanding , you have been trying some of you foolish schemes I suppose . " " Oh Louis , you know she was out in all that rain to-day " interposed Natalie meekly . " What was that for , I should like to know , " he asked indignantly " are you tired of her already that you do n't take better care of her than that ?  --  Oh Natalie ! " Natalie 's pale cheek flushed at his injustice , but she made no answer , she only watched little Izzie in fear and trembling , and oh how glad and thankful she was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she dwell upon these cruel words , and shed many bitter tears beside her sleeping darling 's cot , oh baby , she would murmur , what more care could I take of you than I always do . CHAPTER XX . In his superbly furnished library sat Lord Barrington . He had just finished reading a letter that he had taken from his desk . " Strange , " he murmured , " very strange , that Arthur has not come yet , nor any letter from him ; I ca n't understand it , " and he replaced the letter with a heavy sigh . He then turned to the letters on the table , which he had before cast aside , finding the wished-for one was not among them . " Ha , one from George ; perhaps he may have seen him . " He reads for a while , then starting from his seat exclaimed " Good Heavens ! what is this ? " Then reads again : Judge my amazement when I came across a rude apology for a tombstone , in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only son of Lord Barrington of Barrington , who died August 8th , 1864 . " As I had not the remotest idea that he was dead , but was almost daily expecting to find him . I most heartily sympathize with you  --   --  " What can he mean ? " he said , putting down the letter . " But what is this ? " he cried , as his eye caught one he had overlooked before . ' T is Arthur 's hand ! " With trembling hands he broke the seal ( taking no note , in his agitation , of the fact that it had not been through the post ) , and read the almost unintelligible scrawl : DEAR FATHER :  --  I have charged Louisa to bring this and give it into your own hand . She will not believe that I am dying , and still clings to the hope that I will recover . But it can not be ; I feel  --  I know  --  that I shall die . Oh , how I wish that I could see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be ! With my dying breath I beseech you to forgive your erring boy ; it was the first , it is the last deception I ever practiced toward you . To you I ever confided my hopes and plans , and you always strove to gratify every wish . I feel now how much I wronged your generous nature , when I feared to tell you of my intended marriage . The tune seems ever before me when you asked me , even with tears , why I wished to leave you again , after I returned from America , and I answered , evasively , that I wanted to see the world . And when , in the fullness of your love , you replied " Then I will go with you , " I answered angrily , " In that case I do not care to go , " and pleaded for just one year . And you granted my request , and sent me forth with blessings . Oh , why did I not tell you all ? I feel sure that you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will love her as a daughter , only do not leave me . " Oh , father , forgive your boy ! Thoughts of your loneliness would intrude at all times and mar my happiness , until I determined to return and bring my wife , trusting to your love , and was on my way home when I was attacked with this dreadful fever . Oh , how I repent that I did not mention my wife in my last letter to you ! It is but a few short months since I left you , but O how long those lonely months must have been to you ! Then let your sad hours be cheered by Louisa , since the sight of your boy may never gladden your heart in this world . Bestow upon her the same love and kindness you have ever shown to me . Nothing can alleviate my pain in leaving her , but the certainty I feel that you will love and cherish her for my sake . Oh make not her coming alone harder by one word or action . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Farewell , dear father !  --  a last farewell ! Before you receive this , I shall be sleeping in my distant grave . And oh when my poor Louisa presents it , treat her not harshly , as you hope that we shall meet again . Your affectionate and repentant son , ARTHUR . As the old man ceased reading , his head fell upon the table , and bitter tears coursed down his cheeks . " Oh , Arthur ! Arthur ! my boy ! my only child ! why , why did you leave me ? How gladly would I have received your wife ! But now how harshly have I treated her  --  how cruelly sent her forth into this heartless world , friendless and alone ! But I will find her and bring her home  --  yes , yes , I will love her for his sake . Oh if I had only taken this when she brought it ! But I will lose no time now . Oh , Arthur ! Arthur ! " he murmured , and he rang the bell violently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful old man who answered his summons , " stay , John , till I can speak , " he cried , gasping for breath and trembling from head to foot . " My boy , my Arthur is dead ! " he wailed , at length , and that person  --  that lady  --  was his widow , John . It was all true that she said , and I treated her so badly , too . " " Yes , " old John replied , meekly , " I thought it wor true ; she did n't look like an himpostor , she did n't , " and he shook his head gravely . " You must find her , John , and bring her back . Go , you have your orders ; you must find her . Arthur is dead , and he has sent his wife to me , and I must take care of her  --  that is all I can do for him now . " " Ah , that 's the way with them secret marriages , " soliloquized old John . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder , and his governor so indulgent ? " " Yes we will find her , and she shall have the green room , not Arthur 's  --  no , not Arthur 's . Love her for his sake , he says ; aye that I will , " murmured his lordship , as he paced the room . " Too late , old man , too late , too late . " CHAPTER XXI . " I declare it 's a shame , " cried Emily throwing a letter on the table . " I ca n't think what Everard means , it 's positively unkind , I shall write and tell him so , " she continued endeavoring in vain to repress the tears of vexation that would not be restrained . " I would not have believed it of him , indeed I would not  --  what will Harry think , I should like to know . " " What is the matter , " asked Grace and Isabel at the same time . " Read this and you will see , " she replied  --  Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , be sorry to hear that I can not be home for the Xmas . festivities , nor for the wedding ; I am as sorry as you can possibly be , dear Emmy , but circumstances , over which I have no control , make it imperitive that I should remain away , therefore , pray forgive my absence , nor think it unkind . " It is outrageous " said Grace folding the letter carefully . " Mamma will not allow it I am certain , and I can not imagine any reason that could prevent him coming if he chose . You had better get mamma or papa to write , people will think it so strange . " " I do n't care what people think , it 's Harry and ourselves " replied Emily hotly , " I will write and tell him that I wo n't be married this Xmas . if he do n't come  --  ' there . ' " How absurd " returned Grace contemptuously . " Do you mean it " inquired Isabel gravely . " Oh that is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and try the effect . " " It can not be his wish to stay away " said Isabel thoughtfully . " It is the strangest thing I ever knew , " replied Grace . " Isabel felt very uncomfortable , for somehow she could not help thinking that she might be the cause , ( as , once , Everard had been very near the forbidden subject , saying that it was quite a punishment to be under the same roof , unless there was some change in their position , toward each other . " She was sorry that he had not said so before Isabel had replied , and that very day , told Mrs. Arlington that she wished to leave , as soon as she could meet with another governess . Mrs. Arlington asked her reasons . But Miss Leicester would give none . Then Mrs. Arlington requested that Miss Leicester would reconsider the matter , but Miss Leicester refused to do so . Then Mrs. Arlington insisted , saying that she would except her resignation , if at the end of the week she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to part with her . Everard of course heard what had taken place , and immediately made it his business to alter that young lady 's determination , protesting that he had said nothing to make her pursue such a course . He forced her to admit that it was solely on his account that she was leaving , and then talked her into consenting to withdraw her resignation at the end of the week , promising to be more careful not to offend in future . ) She wished very much that she could spend this Xmas . with Mrs. Arnold , but this was impossible , as she had promised Emily to be bridesmaid . " Then you do n't think it would do to say that , " Emily said inquiringly . " It would seem childish " returned Isabel . " And have no effect , " added Grace . " Coaxing would be better you think . " " Decidedly , " said Isabel laughing . " The begging and praying style , might answer " returned Grace scornfully , " he always likes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the children do but kiss him , and call him a dear kind brother and such like rubbish , he will do almost anything . " Now Grace do n't say the children , when you mean me , interposed Emily , I will not hear a word against Evvie , so do n't be cross . I know you always were a little jealous of his partiality for me . " " I am not cross , nor did I say anything against Everard , " retorted Grace haughtily " and as for partiality , where is the favouritism now . " " Oh well , I shall write such a letter that he ca n't but come . " " I wish you success with all my heart , " returned Grace more good naturedly , while Isabel gazed silently out of the window . * * * * * * * * " No answer to my letter yet , is it not strange said Emily as she joined Isabel in her favourite retreat , the conservatory , " what do you think about it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what I think " asked Isabel passing her arm round Emily and continuing her walk . " Do please , for you ca n't think how disagreeable it is , when Harry asks , when Everard is coming , to have to give the same stupid answer , I expect to hear every day . " " I do n't think you will . " " Oh Isabel . " " No , I do not think he will write , but just quietly walk in one of these days ! " " Do you really think so , " asked Emily , her face radiant . Isabel gave an affirmative nod . " What makes you think so , Isabel ? " " I do n't know , but I feel sure he will , " she replied , turning away her face . " Isabel . " " Well , dear , " said Isabel , with heightening color , still keeping her face turned away , " tell me , was it because of you that Everard would not come home . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be . " " It is very foolish to think so . " " Then you do think so , " said Emily , archly . " Oh , miss , I have found you out at last . What a sly one you are . I have been watching you a long time , and thought you all unconscious how it was with a certain party who shall be nameless . Oh I 'm so glad . " " Glad that your brother is so unhappy ? " Oh , Emily ! " No ; glad that he need be so no longer . " " How do you mean ? " " How do I mean ! Why how obtuse you are , Isabel . " " You run on too fast . " " Oh , not much . I found out how it was on his part long ago , and I shall not be long before I tell him the result of my observations elsewhere . " " Tell him what ? " asked Isabel , aghast , " To go in and win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily ! what are you saying  --  what do you mean ? " " Mean ? " replied Emily , with a saucy nod , " to help on my pet scheme a little , that 's all . " " You never mean to say that you intend to  --  " " Oh , but I do , though . " " Emily , if you dare ! " cried Isabel , indignantly . " Ah , but I shall . " " You shall not , " said Isabel , grasping her arm , " you do not know what you are about . " " Yes I do , perfectly well , and you will both thank me hereafter . " " Stop a moment ; what is it you intend to tell him ? " " Only what I have found out  --  that all is as he wishes , so he need not be afraid . " " You have not found out any such thing . " " Oh , have I not though ? " " Decidedly not . All you have discovered is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be on my account that he was not coming home . That is all you could honestly tell him , and you will do more harm than good if you do ; depend upon it , you will only make matters worse by interfering . " " Well , if it is to do no good , I would rather that he did not know I had found out his secret , but keep it as I have done . " " Since when ? " asked Isabel . " Last spring , when we had to leave you on the rock , but of course I did not let him see it . " " Then do not enlighten him now , you will only make him uncomfortable . " " You are right , but come tell me since when did you know . " " I have known a long time . " " But does he think you know . " Isabel was silent . " Come , miss , how did you find out ? " " Do n't , Emily , " said Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tell you ? " " Is this generous ? " asked Isabel , with burning cheeks . " " You do n't mean to say that you refused him ? " said Emily , turning her blue eyes full upon Isabel , " that would be too cruel . " " Be quiet , Emily , " implored Isabel . " I see how it is now . Oh , Isabel , how could you ? " " Remember , Emily , I have told you nothing ; you have found out my secret ; keep it better than you did your brother 's . " " Oh , Isabel , I am sure I kept that well enough . " " Not so well as you must keep this . I am very , very sorry , for I feel that I have not been sufficiently watchful , or you would I not have suspected it . And he would be justly angry if he knew . " " Well , under the circumstances it would make no difference to you if he was . " Isabel bit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear Emily , promise me that you will try to forget this conversation , and never mention it to any one . " " But Isabel when was it . " " I will answer no questions on that subject " more than enough has been said already . " What a rage Grace would be in , if she knew , well , well , I have my own ideas . " " Have you indeed , and pray what would Grace be in a rage about if she knew , " asked a well known voice close to them . Both young ladies started and crimsoned . " You see Emmy I could not resist that letter , so here I am for a few days . " " Isabel was right " cried Emily triumphantly , " she said you would come quietly in , one of these days . " " What made you think so , " he asked . " I felt sure of it , I can not tell why , but I had a presentiment that you would . " " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " he said in a low tone , as Emily turned to caress his dog , Hector . " Certainly " she answered laughing . " I would not have Emily disappointed on any account . " " Such a true prophet ought to be rewarded , do n't you think so Emily , " said Everard presenting Isabel with the first and only flower of a rare foreign plant . " I can not accept it , " replied Isabel , " the reward is more than the prediction was worth . " " Oh no , it is not , I am sure you earned it , " cried Emily clapping her hands , and running off with Hector for a romp . " Surely you will not refuse a flower " said Everard . " But why that flower . " " Because it is the best . " " For that very reason , I can not accept it . " " You are over scrupulous Miss Leicester . " " No , only prudent . " He looked hurt , " you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Why . " " What would they think . " " If the truth ,  --   --  , that the flower I valued most , I gave to the one I loved best . " " Are you not venturing on forbidden grounds " asked Isabel with glowing cheeks . " Isabel you are cruel . " " I do not wish to pain you . " " Then accept my flower . " " No , were I to do so , I could only take it to your mother saying that you wished it preserved . " " Would you do so Isabel , " he exclaimed reproachfully . " I should be obliged to do so , if I took it . " " Is it only this one you refuse . " " Or any other equally valuable and scarce . " Gathering a choice little bouquet he said " you will not refuse this Isabel . " " Miss Leicester if you please sir , " she replied as she took the flowers , and hastened to the schoolroom . While Everard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay his respects to his mother , and present the rejected flower , to the bride elect . This was the last evening they would be alone , to-morrow the guests were to arrive . Isabel did not always join them at dinner , and this evening she intended to spend in the schoolroom to finish the reports , which Mr. Arlington always liked to have when the holidays began , giving the children leave to go in the drawing-room . But the best plans can not always be carried out . Isabel received a message from Mrs. Arlington requesting her to join them at dinner , accompanied by a threat from Harry , that if she did not they would all adjourn to the schoolroom , of course she had to comply . However the evening passed off very pleasantly , Everard was so much occupied with his mother and sisters , that with the exception of making her sing all his favourite songs , he paid even less than usual attention to Isabel . CHAPTER XXII . The children are on tiptoe of expectation , anxiously waiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Now the wished for moment has come , what a delightful stir and confusion it has occasioned . Rose is in ecstasy , and Amy wild with glee , even the quiet Alice seemed to have caught the infection . It was to be a regular old fashioned Xmas . Eve . All sorts of games and odd things , snap dragon , charades ( for which Harry and Lucy were famous ) magic music , dancing , and even blindmans buff was proposed but was over-ruled by the quieter members of the party . ' Santa Claus ' sent a bountiful supply of presents down the chimney that night , which caused great merriment next day . For ladies got smoking caps , and cigar-cases ; while gentlemen received workboxes , thimbles , and tatting-needles . Peter got a jester 's cap and bells , which he vowed was a dunce 's cap intended for Rose , to that young lady 's great indignation . Tom had a primer , and a present for a good boy , and May received a plain gold ring at which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After breakfast they all went to church , and then all who chose went to see the school children , who were enjoying themselves immensely over their Xmas . fare . Then the sleighs were had out for a glorious drive over the frozen snow , but Isabel refused to join the party , preferring to stay quietly at home . To practise anthem 's with Everard , Grace said . Isabel had no such idea , but for all that they did sing some anthems with the children , as Everard , who had taken a very active part in the arrangements for the Sunday School feast , was not of course one of the sleighing party , and returned some time before them . The children sang very nicely , doing great credit to Isabel 's teaching , for which she was highly complimented by Everard . " They ought to be much obliged to you , as they bid fair to surpass both Grace and Emily , " he said . " Pray do n't let Miss Arlington hear you say so , or she will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not believe it , but I will be careful , as she is already dreadfully jealous of you . " " Of me , how can she be , why should she . " " She has cause enough , " he replied warmly , " but she should be more magnanimous . " " I do n't think it possible , I can not imagine she could be so silly . " " It is plain enough to me , that she is . " " I do n't see it , I confess . " " ' Where ignorance is bliss , ' he replied , with one of his usual penetrating glances . " Yours must be a very happily constituted mind to be so unconscious of all things disagreeable . " " Not quite so unconscious as you imagine , but I advise you not to fish into troubled waters . " " Still waters run deep , you mean , " he replied . " Unfathomable , " she said , and followed the children to the dining-room , for they had gone there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party sat down to dinner , sixty in number , all relations or old friends . Here is Tom 's description of the wedding nest day , which he sent his friend : DEAR DICK ,  --  We are having jolly times here  --  rare fun on Christmas-eve , I assure you . But the best of all was my brother 's wedding ; eight bridesmaids , all as beautiful as sunshine . ( I was a best-man , of course . ) The bride looked magnificent  --  ( between you and I , Dick , he has made a very good choice )  --  the rain and sunshine style . I ca n't say I understand that kind of thing , but on such occasions it tells immensely . ( I admire one of the bridesmaids amazingly , but mum 's the word , mind . ) But to speak of the wedding . Governor Arlington is a liberal old fellow . Champagne like water , and everything to match . Your 's truly , T. M. Elm Grove was scarcely the same place to Isabel when Emily was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found teaching anything but pleasant . Often after a tedious day , when tired and weary , she would gladly have laid down to rest her aching head and throbbing temples . Mrs. Arlington would request that she would join them in the drawing-room . Isabel did not consider herself at liberty to refuse , besides she did not wish to encounter Mrs. Arlington 's frowns next day ; and even when they were out , and she congratulated herself upon being left in peace , Mr. Arlington ( who seldom accompanied hem ) would ask her to sing some songs , or play a game of chess , and of course she had to comply . This kind of life was very irksome to Isabel  --  so different to what she had been accustomed to . She strove bravely with her fate , but in spite of all her endeavors she often cried herself to sleep she felt so desolate and alone . She had no home : there was no hearth where she was missed , or her coming anxiously looked for . Then she would grieve bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy days gone , it seemed , for ever ; and then in the morning be angry with herself for her ingratitude , remembering the blessings she still enjoyed , and how much worse off she might be , and strive to be contented . A fresh cause for disquietude arose , Grace evidently was jealous of her . Grace was handsome , but she was aware that Isabel was more attractive . Grace sang well , but she also knew that Isabel sang better , her voice was richer , fuller , more melodious . She said that Isabel always wanted to show off , and would look very incredulous and neutral when Isabel 's performances were praised . One gentleman in particular was very enthusiastic in his praises . " But professional people are different you know , " returned Grace . " Oh indeed , I was not aware that Miss Leicester was a professional singer , " he replied . " Not a professional singer , she teaches singing , " said Grace thinking she was going a little too far . " Indeed , where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom hear such a splendid voice . " " Oh she is our governess , " replied Grace . Turning to Isabel he said " you have a very fine voice Miss Leicester , if you were to make your debut at one of our best operas , you would make your fortune . " " I have no such idea , " said Isabel , the indignant tears starting to her eyes , " that is the last thing I should thing of doing , she added with a reproachful look at Grace , " but Grace seemed to be enjoying the whole thing amazingly . " I do not suppose that you have thought of it or you certainly would not be a governess , with such a career open to you ; with very little training you might command almost any salary . " Isabel was excessively annoyed . " I assure you my dear young lady that it is worth your consideration he continued . " You mean well , no doubt , Mr. Bandolf , and I thank you for your kind intentions ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for a moment " returned Isabel , and bowing coldly opened a book of prints . " You should not let pride prevent your worldly advancement , " he added , which only made her more angry than ever . For all this I have to thank Miss Arlington she thought , and her feelings toward that young lady , at that moment , were not the most charitable . CHAPTER XXIII . " No I am sure it never answers at least not in most cases and in ours it would not I am convinced ; but I had a pretty hard battle about it I assure you Ada . " " I had no idea until now that they wished it " returned Ada . " but I am very glad you did not agree to it . " ( The matter under consideration was , if it were desirable that young couples should reside with the parents of either ; but Charles Ashton knew his mother 's disposition too well , to subject his wife to it , though he was a very good son and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he consider himself at liberty to place his wife in a position that he knew might make her very unhappy . Nor did he think that such an arrangement would promote domestic bliss . He was a particularly quiet easy going fellow , very averse to exertion of any kind and seldom troubled himself to oppose any arrangements , usually agreeing to any proposition for the sake of peace and quietness . But for all that he had a will of his own , and when he had once made up his mind , nothing on earth could move him . Before he married he gave the matter careful considertion , and came to the conclusion that it must never be  --  never Ada would be his wife , and no mortal should breathe a word against her in his hearing  --  therefore it must never be . Having come to this conclusion he waited until the subject should be broached by either of his parents , knowing very well that when that topic should be discussed , then would come the tug of war , and he was not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father proposed that he should bring his bride there , saying , " there is plenty of room for all . " But Charles was not so sure of that , and feared that the house might possibly become too hot to hold them , but merely stated quietly that he had decided otherwise . Then arose a perfect storm , but he was firm . His mother asked with her handkerchief to her eyes , if she was to lose her boy altogether . While Lord Ashton requested to be informed what his plans might be . " To live in England " he answered . " What might be his objection to Ashton Park . " He had nothing to say against Ashton Park , but he wished to reside in England . Very well , they would go to England , and all live together , that would be charming Lady Ashton said . " He should like them to live in England , but as to living together , that was out of the question , " Charles replied . " Whereupon Lady Ashton was highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , all they could urge was useless , he would not hear of it . ) " It might answer in Arthur 's case " he returned , by the way Ada is it not strange we have never heard anything of them , poor Louisa , I suppose boarding school did not answer her expectations , as she left it so soon . " " Can you wonder at it , situated as she was . " " It was natural no doubt , and Arthur could be so winning , he always was a favourite with the ladies . " " Oh well , he is a nice fellow you must admit . " " I do n't deny it , I always liked him very much , but still I think that sort of thing , is not right , but he always was impetuous , never considered anything , but just acted on the spur of the moment , and he is very soft hearted " he added laughing . " I wonder if the old gentleman knows it . " " Your mother was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about Isabel " asked Ada . " Yes , and the daughter of his tutor does not come up to the mark . " " I should think her own daughter 's child might at all events . " " But she never regards her in that light , never will I fear . " " Somebody wishes to see you Sir , very particularly please , " said Thomson . " Who is it ? Thomson . " " Do n't know I 'm sure Sir , she would not give any name , but is very anxious to see you , I said you were engaged , but she replied I that she must see you to-night , it was very important . " " What sort of a person is she ? " asked Ada . " A lady madam , quite a lady I should say , only in trouble , she says she knew master in America . " " I must see her , I suppose , where is she . " " In the study , sir . " The stranger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impatient gesture for him to close the door , then threw herself at his feet passionately imploring him to help and protect her , and throwing aside her thick vail , disclosed the features of Louisa , but so altered that he was perfectly shocked and amazed . He could scarcely believe that the haggered emaciated being before him , was indeed the pretty , impulsive , fiery , Louisa , but such was the case , and anger , compassion and indignation filled his heart , as he listened to the recital of her misfortunes . As the reader is already acquainted with a portion of Louisa 's story , we will not repeat it here , but only record such circumstances as have not appeared in these pages . On arriving at her grandfather 's she encountered a storm of angry abuse , and was driven from the door with a stern command never to return , as she had forfeited all claims upon him , and might die in a ditch for all he cared . She managed to get about a mile from the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . How long she remained there she had no idea , when she recovered she was among strangers , who were very kind . She had had a brain fever , and was in the hospital When asked for the address of her friends , she replied that she had none . But afterward she remembered that her Uncle Charles had always been kind to her , and had occasionally procured her little indulgences from her stern , cold-hearted , grand-mother , and that it had been mainly through his interference that she had been sent to school . She therefore determined to seek his aid , and accept a small loan from the doctor , to enable her to do so , long and weary had the journey been , and she implored Charles not to send her away . She knew she said that it would not be for long , and entreated him to let her die in peace . Charles assured her that she should want for nothing , and commended her for coming to him , and expressed in no measured terms his disapprobation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Louisa falling senseless on the floor . His violent ringing of the bell , brought not only the servants , but Ada also , to his assistance ; medical aid was quickly procured . That night her child was born , and when morning dawned , Louisa lay still and cold in that last long sleep from which no mortal could awake her . Sleep in thy marble beauty , poor little Louisa , and perhaps that sad fate may soften the hearts of thy cruel grandparent . Oh not as it has been fulfilled did the dying Evangeline understand the promise made with regard to the little Louisa . Oh how often was the stillness of the night broken by the bitter sobs of the desolate little orphan whose aching heart sought for love in vain . Then can we wonder that when this lonely one , did find one to love , that she should willingly listen to his persuasions in hopes of a happy future , rather than endure any longer such a cheerless existence . In the early morning a violent knocking at the hall door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there not a lady  --  a widow lady , staying here ? " inquired an old gentleman in an agitated voice , while the cab driver beat his arms on the pavement . " Is not this Mr. Ashton 's ? " he added , as Thomson hesitated . Thomson answered in the affirmative , and the old gentleman continued , " Is the lady here ? Can I see your master ? answer me quickly do n't be so stupid . " " A lady came last night but , but , " stammered Thomson " she , " " Is she here now , I say , " he cried angrily . " Yes sir , but  --  " Say no more , just tell your master I want to see him immediately , stop , take my card , here , now be quick . " Poor Thomas was quite bewildered by the old gentleman 's manner . I 'm blest he murmured if I know what we 're coming to next , Lord Barrington , what does he want I should like to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed Charles . " How very fortunate , " returned Ada " of course he will take charge of the baby , I confess I was in a quandary for I do not relish the idea of having the care of it , poor little thing . " " Nor I either , but I am not so sure that he will take it , it is much more likely he has come to row me about the whole affair . " " You ! Why , what had you to do with it ? " " No more than you had ; but I must see him at once , I suppose . " " Shall I go , too ? " asked Ada , timidly . " Not at present : if there is to be a storm , I do not see why you should be in it . " " He is such a dreadful old man , is he not ? " " Not usually ; he was always very , very kind to Arthur . " " Not to his wife , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very cruel ; but you must not grieve so much about it , dearest Ada . " " I can not help it , it is so terribly shocking . " " But it is past , now : she is at rest , she is happy ; even her lifeless remains look calm  --  the weary , weary look exchanged for one of peace . " " True , but it is so dreadful ; if we had only known before , " she sobbed . " I wish we had , with all my soul , " returned Charles , " but you really must not distress yourself so , or I shall have to keep the poor old gent waiting . " " Go to him , Charley ; I shall feel better presently . " He found his Lordship impatiently pacing the room . " I am seeking my daughter-in-law ; she is here , I believe , " he said , after the first salutations were over . " She is here , " Charles answered gravely , " at least her remains ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " repeated Lord Barrington , putting his hand to his head . " Then I have nothing left . " " But the child , " interposed Charles . " The child  --  what child ? " " The babe born last night . " " He did not heed the answer , but seemed overpowered by the news of Louisa 's death . " Let me see Arthur 's wife , " he said , after a few minutes had elapsed . Charles conducted him to the darkened apartment , where he gazed in agony upon the worn , but calm features of poor Louisa . And as he thought of his harshness , and Arthur 's words , " make not her coming alone harder by one word or look , " his grief became so violent and excessive that Charles was quite nonplussed , and went to consult Ada as to what should be done . In accordance with their plan , Ada took the frail little piece of humanity , and , approaching Lord Barrington , as he bent in sorrow over the corpse , said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , but you still have Arthur 's child , " and she laid the babe in his arms . His tears fell on its tiny face , but the sight of it , and its helplessness , did him good . " Oh , Arthur ! Arthur ! " he moaned , why did you doubt your old father ? how would I have welcomed your wife if you had brought her home at first ! aye , as I now welcome this child  --  Arthur 's child , " he added , looking at it fondly . He had the corpse conveyed to Barrington , and placed in the family vault , and erected a monument  --  very beautiful , indeed  --  beside the one he had already placed there in memory of his son , inscribed : To LOUISA , the beloved wife of Arthur , only son of LORD BARRINGTON OF BARRINGTON , Aged 16 years . He also placed another in the little burying-place at Z  --   --  : In memory of ARTHUR , only son of LORD BARRINGTON , of Barrington Park , England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal fever , in a foreign land , when on his way home . When Lady Ashton arrived , shortly afterwards , and heard what had taken place , she was in a terrible fume . " Oh ! my dear , what a misfortune . How unlucky for her to come here : why did you let her stay , Charles ? " " Why did I let her stay ? Say , rather , why did you send her away ? " " Yes , why did you let her stay ? " she repeated , angrily . " Why did you not let her go to the hospital ? " " Or die in the street , " added Charles , scarcely able to keep his temper , for he was angry and hurt to think how Louisa had been treated . " Goodness knows what people will say : no doubt all kinds of strange stories will be circulated . I feel for you , Ada , my dear ; I do , indeed . " " Do n't be alarmed , my dear mother , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing her a newspaper , and pointing out the following : DIED .  --  At the residence of Charles Ashton , Esq . LOUISA , wife of the late Hon. Arthur Barrington , and grand-daughter of Sir Edward Ashton of Brierley . " Charles , how dared you ? " cried his mother , reddening with anger , " your father will be excessively angry . " " I can not help that : it is the truth , is it not ? " " True ? of course you know it is ; but , for all that , you need not have published it in that absurd manner . " " I thought it best . " " And you are simple enough to think that that notice will prevent absurd stories getting abroad . " " As to who she might be , yes ; and , as to the circumstances that brought her here , I presume you would prefer any , rather than the right ones , should be assigned . " Lady Ashton was for once abashed , and her eye dropped beneath the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she answered , " you , at least , have nothing to do with that . " " I am thankful to say I have not , " he returned , " I can not forget it , it makes me perfectly wretched ; and , but that I know that Ada has her own home to go to , if anything happened to me I do n't know what I should do . I shall insure my life this very day , that she may be independent . If a daughter 's child could be so treated , why not a son 's wife . " For goodness ' sake stop , Charles ! " cried his mother , " do n't talk so dreadfully . " " I feel it bitterly , mother ; indeed I do , " he replied , and hastily left the room . He would not have done so , however , had he known the storm he had left Ada to be the unhappy recipient of . She was perfectly terrified at the violence of Lady Ashton 's wrath , and Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in her chair , pale as marble and panting for breath . " What is the matter ?  --  speak , child , " she cried , shaking her violently ; but this only alarmed her the more , and she called loudly for Charles , and then remained gazing at Lady Ashton in speechless terror . " Ada ! dearest Ada ! what is the matter ? " asked Charles , coming to the rescue ; but Ada had fainted . CHAPTER XXIV . " Well , old fellow , how are you ? " said Louis , as he entered Everard 's room at the college . " I only just heard you were back . " After they had conversed awhile , Louis said , " Pretty girl that governess your sisters have at Elm Grove ; aye , only she is such a confounded flirt . " " I esteem Miss Leicester very highly , " returned Everard , coldly . " Take care , old fellow , for she is , without exception , the greatest coquette I ever came across . She always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw on until they came to ' the point , ' and then laughed at them . By Jove she will make a fool of you , Everard , if you do n't mind . " " I assure you , Louis , that you are quite mistaken . Miss Leicester is quite a different person to what you imagine . " " Ha ! ha ! so you may think , but I knew her intimately , and I must say that I was surprised that your mother should trust her young daughters to her care . " " Be quiet , Louis ; I think her as near perfection as possible . " " Well , they say that love is blind  --  stone blind , in this case , I should say . She must have played her game well , to deceive you so thoroughly . " " I am not deceived , neither has she played any game , " returned Everard , with warmth . " She gives me no encouragement whatever  --  very far from it . " " Oh , that is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is a most accomplished actress . " " You are mistaken , " replied Everard , indignantly , " you know some one else of the same name . " " Not a bit of it , my dear fellow ; I saw the young minx at Elm Grove , and knew her directly . ' Beautiful , but dangerous . ' I know her well . " Everard 's cheek flushed with anger . " Louis , " said he , " I will not hear any one speak disrespectfully of Miss Leicester . I consider any insult offered to her as a personal affront ; therefore , if we are to remain friends , you must say no more on that subject now or at any other time . " Louis saw by Everard 's countenance that he was in earnest , so answered , " as you will . I have satisfied my conscience by warning you ; of course I can do no more . Wo n't you dine with us to-day ? " " No , really , I can not possibly ; I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't work too hard , and have to give up altogether . You look as if you were overdoing it . Too much of a good thing is good for nothing , you know . Come when you can  --  if not to-day , I shall be always glad to see you . " " What object can he have in speaking thus of Isabel ? " Everard asked himself when Louis was gone  --  his beautiful and beloved Isabel , the charm of his existence , yet the torture of his life  --  ( for was it not torture to be forever dwelling on her perfections , only to come back to the same undeniable fact that she had refused him  --  that she either could not , or would not , be his )  --  and now to hear her , the personification of his own ideal , spoken of as an accomplished actress and deceitful coquette , was almost more than he could endure . Then he asked himself what he had gained by his constant and excessive study : had it caused him to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever with him in all her beauty , gentleness , and truth . He would win her yet , he told himself , and then owned he was a fool to indulge such thoughts , and determined to study harder still than ever , to prevent the possibility of his thoughts recurring so often to Isabel . Nevertheless , he would believe nothing against her  --  nothing . CHAPTER XXV . " Louis , I wish you would look at baby before you go ; I do not think she is well to-night . " " What is the matter now ? You are always thinking she is ill : she seemed well enough this morning . " " I do n't know . She is restless and uneasy ; I wish you would come . " " Of course I will , but I am in a great hurry just now ; Mrs. Headley has sent for me , and old Mr. Growl has another attack . I must go to the people in the office now , but I will come up to baby before I start . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might forget , with so many people to attend to . " " Forget ? Not I. Why , Natalie , how do you think I should ever get on if I had no better memory than that ? " But he did forget , and was gone when Natalie again sought him . " I thought it would be so , " she sighed . Baby became more and more uneasy , and moaned and fretted in her sleep . Natalie knelt beside the bed , and tried to soothe her darling , thinking sadly of the long hours that would elapse before Louis 's return , but all her efforts were in vain . Izzie did not wake or cry , but this only alarmed Natalie the more . The deadly palor of her countenance was the only sign of the anguish she suffered ; outwardly , she was very calm . If she could only have done anything for her pet ! but to wait , and watch , not knowing what to do , this was unendurable ; and she was just debating in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Louis might be detained all night , when she heard him come in . She pressed her cold hands upon her brow , and ordered Sarah to bring him immediately ; while she rose from her knees , and breathlessly waited for his coming . " What 's the matter with popsy ? " he asked , cheerfully , as he entered the room , but his countenance became grave as his eye rested on the sick child . " What is this ? , " he inquired , " why was I not told before ? Tut , tut , what have you been thinking about , Natalie , " he added , as he felt the child 's pulse . " I asked you to come and see her before you went out , " Natalie answered , in an almost inaudible voice . " Yes , but you did not say that there was anything particularly the matter . " He stooped over the child and examined her more carefully . " She is seriously ill , " he said . And the words sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you treat me in this shameful manner ? " he continued bitterly . " Why let the child go on until it is almost past recovery , and then send for me in the greatest haste ?  --  just the same way when she had the croup . I am surprised at you Natalie ; it is really quite childish . " He ordered the bath to be brought immediately . Impatiently waving Natalie aside , he took the child in his arms and put her into the bath ; while Natalie stood by , in speechless agony , Louis refusing to allow her to assist in any way . How cruel ! To have done anything for her darling would have been an unspeakable relief . As it was , she could only stand by while he murmured , in a tone which greatly distressed her " poor little popsy , " " Did they neglect papa 's darling ? " He would suffer no one to touch her but himself , and what assistance he did accept was from Sarah , it being into her arms he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Natalie , how this grieved her ; for though she took the child from Sarah , the slight was the same . " Oh , baby , baby ! " she murmured , as the burning tears fell on little Isabel 's face , " what should I have left if you were taken from me ? " When Louis returned , he took the child , administered the medicine , and was about to lay her in the bed . " Let me take her , " whispered Natalie , in a tone of tremulous earnestness and passionate entreaty . " No , she is better here , " he replied . " Oh , please , Louis ! " she pleaded , but he was firm . She stood , with clasped hands , silently gazing on the babe with a strange sensation of awe and dread , and a yearning wish to do something for her . " You are not required , Natalie , " Louis said , " you had better go to bed . " With a gulp she restrained the rising sob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only disturb her , " he said , putting out his arm to prevent her doing so . Then Natalie could only steal away to her dressing-room , and there , alone in the darkness , she crept to the sofa and hid her face in the cushion , to hush the tumultuous sobs , while she breathed fervent prayers for baby 's recovery . But a horrible dread surrounded her : she could not endure to be absent from her pet , and noiselessly she stole back to the nursery . She was glad that Louis did not observe her entrance , and retreated to the dimmest corner of the room , and there , in the old arm-chair , listened to baby 's uneasy breathing , which caused her an agony of grief and pain . Yet she could do nothing but sit and suffer  --  suffer , oh , how deeply ! Thus the night wore away , and Louis was not aware of her presence until , as the day dawned , he beheld the wan , wretched face of his poor little wife . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , Natalie ; go and rest . " She shook her head . " You must , indeed : you know I have to leave her to you the greater part of the day , and this is no preparation for the watchful care she will need . " " She can not need more care than I will gladly give , " returned Natalie , with trembling lip . Her face wore an expression , so sad  --  so suffering  --  that Louis must , indeed , have been adamant if he had not been softened . Stroking her hair caressingly , he was about to lead her from the room with gentle force , when , grasping his hand convulsively , she said , in an almost inaudible voice , " I can not , can not go ; have pity , Louis , " she added , raising her tearful eyes to his . " For an hour or two , and then you shall take care of baby . " " If  --  if  --  you would let me kiss her , I will lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered , almost choking . " You may do that , " he said , with a disagreeable sense of the fact that he had been unkind , to use no harsher term . And he lifted a weight from Natalie 's heart , as he placed a shawl over her , saying , " try to sleep , dear ; you know how much depends upon you , " in sweet , modulated tones of thrilling tenderness , such as Louis knew well how to use  --  none better , when it suited him to do so . It mattered not to little Izzie who tended her for many days ; not so , however , when she began to mend , for now she would suffer none but mamma to touch her . She would scarcely bear to be put out of her arms . If Natalie attempted to lay her in the cradle , thinking she slept , instantly the tiny arms would be clasped round mamma 's neck , and she would take her up again . No more could papa usurp mamma 's rights ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her . Only from mamma 's hand would she take her medicine . On more than one occasion Natalie had to be aroused from the little sleep she allowed herself , to administer it . All this annoyed Louis beyond measure , but he did not again give way to his temper before the child , except on one occasion . He had , in the strongest terms , urged upon Natalie the importance of giving the medicine with regularity . The bottle was empty , and Natalie sent it down to be filled , but by some means it got mixed with the other medicines to be sent out , and was not returned to her . She suffered tortures for the want of it during his absence . When he returned , coming straight to baby as usual , he learned how it was , and found her worse for want of it , his indignation was extreme , and he heaped upon Natalie unjust and unmerited reproach , in harsh and bitter terms . His cruel words cut her to the heart , but her only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Truly Isabel had not much to regret . CHAPTER XXVI . " What do you think ? " cried Rose , bursting into the school-room . " Everard is coming home . " " Oh , is he ? I 'm so glad , " returned Alice . " Yes ; mamma had a letter to-day . He is better , and is coming home for change of air and mamma 's good nursing . It was not Everard who wrote the letter , but the doctor , who is coming with him as far as Markham , and papa is to meet them there . " " When ? " inquired Alice . " To-morrow . " " And papa is away . " " Oh , he will be back to-night . Why , there is a carriage ; I wonder who it is , " she exclaimed , running to the window . " How can you be so silly , Rose , " interposed Isabel . " Oh , it is Everard , " she shouted , without heeding Isabel 's remonstrance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad Everard has come , " and she danced about the room with glee . " Rose , what a noisy child you are ! " exclaimed Isabel , going to the window with the rest ; but when she saw the Doctor , she became deadly pale , and had to lean against the window frame for support , but she had ample time to recover herself , as they were all too much occupied to observe her . " How terribly ill he looks , " said Rose . " And how dreadfully weak , " returned Alice . " I 'm sure that gentleman was at Grace 's party , only I forget his name . " " Oh , mamma and Grace are both out ; who is to do the honors , wo n't you , Miss Leicester ? " " Oh , no . " " Do , there 's a good creature , " pleaded Rose . But Isabel was firm . " It will seem so queer , " urged Rose . " Alice , dear , you must go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please excuse me , Miss Leicester . " " Oh let me go , " pleaded Rose , " I shall manage far better than Alice . " " You ! " exclaimed Isabel , " nonsense ! Alice has more thought , besides she has the advantage of two or three inches in height , at all events . " Alice remonstrated . " Not another word , Alice , you have to go , " said Isabel ; and Alice thought she had never seen Miss Leicester so peremptory . Isabel was not afraid to trust Alice . Once fairly installed as hostess she would do very well , though shy at first . " But he seems so very ill , and I shall not know what to do , " said Alice . " You must tell them they were not expected until to-morrow , to explain your mamma 's absence ; and I will order up some refreshments , and tell Norris to have your brother 's room ready for him . " Poor Alice looked quite scared at the ordeal that was before her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your brother comfortable , " said Isabel , kissing her . And Alice , with a great sigh , left the room . Isabel would have been content to have done " the honors , " as Rose termed it , had the Doctor been any other than Louis , but under the circumstances she was determined not to do so . Though firmly resolved to abide by this decision , she did not feel very comfortable , as she thought it not improbable that Everard would send for her . Indeed , he did tell Alice to bring her , but Alice , with her usual blunt manner , answered that Miss Leicester had refused to come , and had sent her . As Isabel had foreseen , Everard soon retired to rest after his journey , and she would have been nicely in for a long tete-a-tete with Louis , which she did not choose . As it was , she sent Rose to help her sister to entertain the Doctor until her mamma came home ; and , taking Amy with her , Isabel retired to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The absentees returned early , and Mrs. Arlington came herself to request that Miss Leicester would endeavor to make the evening pass pleasantly to the gentlemen , as she and Grace had an engagement that evening , and as it was to be the ball of the season Grace did not wish to give it up . " Pray , excuse me , Mrs. Arlington , " Isabel began . " Stay , Isabel , I know what you would say . The Doctor goes with us . Everard and his father will be alone , and I think you can find a song , a book , or something to amuse them . " " I will try , " said Isabel , well content now that Louis was not to be of the party . " One word more , Miss Leicester , " said Mrs. Arlington , dismissing Amy . " I disapprove very much of the children being sent to entertain visitors , and I hope it will not occur again . " Isabel felt hurt , but merely replied , " under the circumstances it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ; I can not see any justifiable reason . It is more than two years since Dr. Taschereau was married , and if you have not got over that affair you ought to have done so , that is all I can say . " " I have , I have , " exclaimed Isabel , warmly , " but still you could not expect me to meet him . " " I do n't see why you should not ; it would have been better to have done so than , by acting as you have , lead him to suppose that you have not overcome your former attachment . " " It is utterly impossible , for him to think that , " returned Isabel hotly , " I told him differently long ago ; no , " she added indignantly , " I have not the slightest shadow of affection for him ; but I can not , will not , subject myself to his insufferable insolence . You do n't know him , or you would not expect me to do so , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not hear my son 's friend aspersed , Miss Leicester , especially when he is my guest , " said Mrs. Arlington , stiffly , " at the same time I do n't , of course , mean to justify his former conduct towards you ; and with regard to the children , do not let it occur again . You may make yourself happy about the doctor , as he returns by the early train in the morning , for he is anxious about his little girl , who is only now recovering from a serious illness . " On entering the drawing-room , Isabel found Everard on the sofa looking very pale and rather sad . " I am sorry to see you so ill , " she said , " I came to give you a little music , but I 'm afraid you will not be able to bear it . " " On the contrary I think it would do me good ; but why would you not come this afternoon ? " " I am here now . " " But why not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so intended . " " Will you not give me the reason ? " You must not ask me ; believe that I had sufficient cause . " The words were not such as he would have , but the manner was so winning that he could not choose but be satisfied . " I am here now , solely on your account , to amuse you as you like best . You must have been very ill , " she said , regarding him kindly . " Yes , I am awfully weak , " he returned , " it seems so strange to me , I have usually been so strong . " " You will soon get strong here , " replied Isabel , cheerfully . " Not if you plague me as you did this afternoon , " he said reproachfully . " Do n't be angry , " she pleaded . " Not angry , but hurt , " he said . " I could n't help it , " she answered , almost with a sob . " It did seem a chilling reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly without welcome , and I had longed so much to come . " It was not my fault they were all out . " " Yes , they were all out , and you would n't come . " " You are angry , " she was crying now , her face down on her hands . " I am a brute , " he said . " Oh , no ; but I am a naughty girl , " and seating herself at the piano , she asked what he would have . She had not thought of the seeming neglect , she had not thought what he would feel at finding Alice the only one to receive him . She could not help it she told herself , perhaps so , but she had been selfish , very selfish ; she was sorry , sorry that Everard should take it so hardly ; but even so , did it occur again , she could not act differently . " What will you have , " she asked . " You know my favorites . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , " said Mr. Arlington , who now entered . " I see you know what will please him most ; I do n't know what we should do without you , " he added warmly . " You do n't know how good she has been to me , Everard , she is a good substitute for my gay party-going daughter , but for her I do n't know what I should do now Emily is away . " She is not good to me , thought Everard , and then a ray of hope sprung up , as he thought of her very kind manner , but no , had he not been led into thinking so before , but whenever he had touched ever so lightly on the old topic , he had been repelled . Isabel felt sad to-night , and could only sing plaintive melodies , and then felt annoyed to think that she had failed to accomplish the purpose for which she came . But she was mistaken , these songs harmonized better with his present mood than more gay ones would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel did her best to relieve the weariness of the long , long days : bringing the children into the library in the afternoon in order that he might share their amusement as she read aloud , and in various ways endeavored to lessen the monotony of the time . She would , perhaps , have acted more wisely had she not done so , for Isabel 's was a very tender nature , and her gentle sympathy was very pleasant to Everard , but it only served to keep up the conflict between hope and fear , which was specially hurtful to him just now , when he needed perfect repose . But she thought Grace and her mother neglectful , and strove to make up for it . She often sent one of his young sisters to sit with him , but Rose was not allowed this privilege as often as the others , though on the whole she was best . Alice was too quiet , and Amy too apt to dwell on the perfections of her dear Miss Leicester , while Rose , her wild spirits subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently so to prevent her being oppressive , was just the cheerful companion that was good for him , her vigorous , healthy , happy-in-the-present style had a good effect . She was never at a loss for a topic for conversation , and her quick perception enabled her to detect at once when he grew tired , and then she would immediately employ herself in some quiet manner . She never sat contemplating him thoughtfully with eyes so like his own , as Alice too often did , as if she would read his very soul . There did not appear to be much of " Mamma 's good nursing " to which Rose had alluded . True it was a very gay season , and Mrs. Arlington 's duties were very onerous . " You know , Everard , " she said , " that Grace can not go out alone , so that my time is so much occupied , that I fear I must appear very neglectful , but you understand it is not my wish to leave you so much , " and Everard assented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up society , and was all the attentive mother . Louis was very skilful and had got him through a very severe illness , how severe they had not known till now . Mrs. Arlington sent the children into the country to be out of the way , and Isabel of course went with them . CHAPTER XXVII . Baby is quite well and happy , in fact all trace of her illness has passed away ; but Natalie is worn and weary with tending her pet and bearing with Louis 's hasty temper ; she is pale and wan , but ever sweet tempered . " Hark , baby , there 's papa . " Izzie ran to meet him . He raised her in his arms and caressed her , scarcely noticing his fond little wife , who would have been made happy by a kiss or kind word . Tired and weary , but with a heart ache which was harder to bear , Natalie lay on the sofa , she was nothing to him , that was clear . " Love papa , baby , love papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his neck and kissed him , then struggled to get away , " What 's the matter , " he asked . " Love mamma , Izzie want 's to love mamma . " She ran to her mother and repeated the action . Natalie caught the child in her arms , kissing her passionately . " Izzie , my darling Izzie , " she murmured , while large tears fell on the child 's face . Taking up her pinefore Izzie gravely wiped her own face , and then tenderly endeavored to dry her mother 's tears , whispering do n't cry mamma , Izzie do n't like to see mamma cry , " and she nestled to her mothers side , stroking her hair and kissing her repeatedly . Nothing would have induced Izzie to leave her mother then , even had Louis attempted it , but he did not , he stood by the mantlepiece watching them , with an unpleasant sensation , that baby had no power to dry those tears . He remained there a long time , his head resting on his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time a deep , deep sigh would escape from Natalie , which was not pleasant for Louis to hear . Sarah came for baby , but he desired her to leave her there . After a while , he thought it was not best that she should be there , and went softly to the sofa and took her away . As he did so , he remarked for the first time  --  aye , for the first time  --  the worn unhappy expression of Natalie 's sweet face , which did not leave it even in sleep , and stooping over her gave the kiss and kind words to his sleeping wife , which he had withheld when she might have been made happy by them . He carried the child to its nurse , then went to his surgery , busy among his drugs he could not but think of Natalie . How pale she looked , how fragile she had become , how languid and listless she seemed of late , he had noticed that , and with no pleasant feeling did he remember , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy . How blind he had been , he saw plainly enough that she needed change of air , she should have it , she should pay his uncle Macdermott a visit , and take Izzie with her , but what should he do without Izzie , he asked himself , but with surprising magnanimity , he refused to consider that question . He had been a little inattentive perhaps lately and owed her some amends , so Izzie should go with her . He knew very well that Natalie would never go without her , and , truth to tell , he had his misgivings as to how Izzie would behave without her mother , so , as he really thought it needful , it was as much necessity as kindness , that brought him to this decision . Natalie submitted passively to all their arrangements , but , on the evening previous to their departure , when Louis was enjoying a cigar in the library , after superintending all the preparations for the next day 's start , Natalie came fondly to his side , and laying her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled with emotion , " I can not go , do not ask me , Louis , I can not , will not leave you , " and her head sank on her hand , as she again murmured " do not ask me . " " Pooh , Natie , what nonsense , " he answered , laughing . " No Louis , I cant , you promised that you would come for a week , so I will wait until you can take the week , and then we will go together , but not now alone , O , not alone , " and she sobbed out on his shoulder the pent up anguish of her heart . He drew her to him with more kindness than he had shown for a long time . " You will not send me away , " she whispered . " Now , Nattie dear , be reasonable , you know you are not strong , and I want you to get your roses back , and a week would be too short a time to benefit you much , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will do , wo n't it . " She shook her head , " I have a terrible dread of the journey , no Louis , I will not go , I will wait till you can come with me . " Louis was not one to submit to opposition , his brow grew dark and the fierce light was kindling in his eye . She should go , once for all he would not brook this resistance . After he had decided to let Izzie go to please her , and save all fuss , was this to be the end of it ? no . " It is too late to say that now , " he said , " a few weeks will soon pass , and this idle fear is childish . " " I should have spoken before , only I did so wish to please you if I could . " " No , Natalie , " he said , sternly , " you do not care whether I am pleased or not , you think of nothing but your own foolish fancies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because I love you so much that I want to stay , do n't send me away , O Louis , do n't . " " Now , Natalie , you are enough to provoke a saint , " he said , angrily , " cross , indeed , no wonder if I am , do n't let me hear another word about it , you go to-morrow . " Natalie saw that any more opposition would inevitably cause one of those fierce bursts of passion of which she ever stood in mortal dread ; she glanced at his darkened countenance and was silent , but her heart was heavy . " Come , we will take a turn on the lawn the moon is so bright , " he said . They walked in the moonlight , those two , husband and wife not three years , but the happy brightness had faded out of her face , and the girl not twenty walked by his side with a weary step , as if life were almost a burden . She resolutely checked her tears , and silently paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful home in the south of France , where she first met the man who had proved so different a partner to what , in her love and trust , she had fondly imagined , and then she wished so fervently that she might even yet be to him all that she had hoped . But he did not want her with him , he would be glad when she was away , oh , he did not love her , or he would not thus cruelly insist upon her going . She had it in her heart even yet to throw herself into his arms and entreat him to let her stay , but she felt that it would be useless , besides she dare not offer further resistance to his will . She looked up into his face and knew she dare not . His eyes were fixed upon her , " why Natalie , " he said , laughing , " anyone would think I was an ogre to see your countenance . " But it was not a pleasant laugh . Then the hardest thought that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she thought that he was acting very like one . Louis paused as they were about to enter the house saying , " You will not worry me any more , if you do it will be useless and only make me harsh , " his manner was stern , determined and chilling in the extreme . Natalie shivered , " I will go , " she replied in a choking voice , then flew up the stairs and alone in the dark gave vent to the grief that was breaking her heart . " Little fool , " murmured Louis between his firmly closed teeth , " what a plague she is . " CHAPTER XXVIII . " O Isabel , it is nearly time for the train to pass , do let us go and watch for it , " said Rose , and they went accordingly . " Here it comes , here it comes , " she shouted , and the iron horse came on snorting and panting ; nearer , nearer it approaches the bridge . ' T is on the bridge . Crash  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train with its living freight is a mass of broken ruins . The screams are appalling ; the sight fearful in the extreme . The children ran back to the house trembling and awed , and huddled together in a frightened group . Among the first to be taken from the debris was a lady , and a little girl about two years old . Isabel offered her own room for the use of the sufferers , and some men carried them to the cottage , where kind nurse Bruce did all in her power until the doctor should arrive . Isabel took the beautiful child , who a few moments before was all life and animation , and laid it upon Bruce 's bed ; the poor little thing must have been killed instantly as there was no sign of suffering upon its face , but a large bruise on its temple . The doctor feared that the lady had received fatal injuries ; all through the night she continued insensible , and the morning brought no change . Who she was they could not tell , but as Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had seen her before , but where she could not recall . Late in the afternoon consciousness returned , and with a feeble moan she opened her eyes . " Where am I , " she asked , " Oh , where is my little Izzie ? " Isabel 's only answer was a kiss . " Do n't say it , " she cried , grasping Isabel 's hand convulsively , " O , not that , not that ! but I see it is so  --  I see it in your face without you saying so . " " O , my baby , my baby , my little Izzie ! " she moaned , covering her face with her hands ; and then she lay quite still , her lips moving as if in prayer . The doctor , who came in shortly after , called Isabel from the room . " Miss Leicester , " he said , " she will not live many hours , we had better find out who she is and summon her friends by telegraph . We can do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidly that she is past all human aid . Poor thing , she need not grieve for her child , she will be with her soon . " They returned to the room to gain the desired information . " Send for Dr. Taschereau , at H  --   --  , " she replied to the doctor 's question . Now Isabel knew where and when she had seen her . But it grieved her to see what a change there was in the bright sunny girl who had cast such a cloud over her path at the ball at Elm Grove . " Am I dying ? " Natalie asked anxiously . " I dare not give you false hope , " the doctor replied . She covered her face with her hands for a few moments . " Do you think I can live till Louis comes  --  Dr. Taschereau you know . " " I hope so , " he answered , evasively . " Make the telegram very strong ; O , very strong . Say that I am dying , but be sure you do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , " she said in a choking voice . " He will come , O , surely he will come , " she murmured to herself . The doctor left promising to send immediately . " You are Isabel Leicester , " Natalie said as soon as they were alone . " I am sure you are , for I have seen your picture . " " That is my name , " replied Isabel , smiling , while she wondered how much Natalie knew about her . " You loved Louis once ? " she asked . " Yes . " " You love him still ? " " No ; that is past . " A smile of satisfaction illumined Natalie 's countenance for a moment , but quickly left it . " I was always sorry for you , Natalie , " Isabel said kindly . " Sorry for me , why should you be sorry for me ? " she asked quickly , then pausing a moment she added , sadly , " I see you know how it is . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be otherwise . " " He does not mean to be unkind , " she said , " but it is a cruel thing to know that your husband does not love you When I first found out that he did not , it almost killed me . He insisted on calling our little girl Isabel , in spite of all I could say as to my dislike to the name ; so I thought it was his mother 's name , though he would not say . But when I found out that it was yours , I was very angry ; O , you must forgive me , for I have had very hard thoughts towards you , and now I know that you did not deserve them . O , Isabel , you are too good ; I could not nurse you so kindly , had I been in your place . Let me see my little Izzie , " she pleaded . Isabel brought the child to its mother ; it looked sweetly calm in its marble beauty . " Bury us both together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell fast upon its icy face . Natalie complained of great pain , nothing that the doctor could do seemed to give her any relief , and she lay moaning through the night . About six o'clock in the morning there was a quick step on the stairs which did not escape the ear of the sufferer . " Oh , Louis , Louis come to me , " she cried . In a moment he was at her side , and her arms clasped round his neck . " I knew you would come , " she said , fondly , " I could not have died happily unless you had . " He pressed her closely to him , while the hot tears fell upon her face , for he was now suffering bitterly for all his neglect and unkindness to his gentle little wife . " O Louis , I have always loved you so much , so very much ! " she said , clinging more closely to him , and gazing into his face with an intensity painful to witness , then smiling sweetly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired from the room , and Louis was left alone with his dead wife , and had yet to learn the fate of his child . During the time that elapsed before the funeral , Isabel carefully avoided meeting him , and hoped that he had not noticed her on the morning of his arrival . But just as he was about to leave , after that had taken place , and she was congratulating herself for having managed so nicely , a message was brought her that Dr. Taschereau wished to see her before he went . Though annoyed , Isabel did not see how she could very well refuse , so complied with the best grace she could . She found him in the sitting room , looking very pale . " I could not leave , Miss Leicester , " he said , " without thanking you for your kindness to my wife . I had no right to expect it . " " I merely did my duty , and do not require any thanks . " " I would ask one question , " he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was my little girl dead when first taken up ? " " Quite dead , " she answered . " It is a bitter trial , " he resumed , " I loved my child unutterably ; the blow seems to have crushed me , I have no longer any interest in anything , I have nothing left , nothing ! " Isabel was silent , she was thinking of the time when she had nothing left but him , and he had deserted her . And now it was the child he grieved for and not his dear little wife . His treatment of her , had always appeared to Isabel as his greatest fault , and her indignation was aroused as she saw , or thought she saw , that he did not feel her loss as he ought to have done . " I can not but think , " she said , " that the blow was sent in mercy to her , in whose future there could only be pain , weariness and silent suffering , and had she alone been taken , I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have no idea of the agony and remorse I have endured or you would not be so severe ; you think because you know that I did not love my wife as I should , that I do not feel her loss , but you are mistaken , her angel gentleness and patience seem forever to upbraid me for my neglect and unkindness . " And unable any longer to control his feelings , he laid his head on the table , while heavy sobs convulsed his frame . His passions were strong , and it was something fearful to witness the violence of his anguish . Isabel could not see his deep grief unmoved , yet dared not attempt to comfort him . Oh how she had wronged him ; how keenly he felt his loss . She would not leave him , and yet she did not wish to stay , and turned away to hide her emotion . When he grew more composed , he advanced towards her saying , " It is getting late , Miss Leicester , once more I thank you for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my cruel words . " said Isabel , the tears streaming from her eyes . " Then you do not withhold your sympathy , even from me , " he returned , offering his hand . " How can I , " she replied , taking , though reluctantly , the offered hand . " I am very sorry for you . " " Good news , Isabel , good news ! " cried Alice coming in shortly after with an open letter in her hand . " Everard is out of danger , and is recovering rapidly , so we can soon come home , Mamma says . " " That is indeed good news , " replied Isabel , who was really anxious to get the children home , as the late events had cast a gloom over all . Little Amy had more than once asked if Everard would die like the poor lady , and all three had cried very bitterly about the pretty little girl that was killed . In three weeks more they were back at Elm Grove . Everard was on the terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again , but his manner towards Isabel was changed , he was cordial and kind , but still there was a difference . There was something inexplicable , and shall we say that it pained her . Why did she on retiring to her own room , shed bitter , bitter tears ? She could scarcely have told , had you asked her , but so it was . Now that Everard had resolved to turn his thoughts from Isabel more resolutely than ever , as it was useless any longer to indulge the hope of one day possessing her , and had determined upon becoming a divinity student , and as soon as possible be ordained and go as a missionary to some distant land , and there amid new scenes and duties forget his dream of happiness . Isabel found that she was not indifferent regarding Everard , and often drew comparisons between her old love and the would-be missionary , much to the disparagement of the former , and thought that he was unnecessarily strict with regard to the forbidden subject . Confess now , Isabel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has discovered the alteration in your feelings and is paying you in your own coin ? Believing this , and thinking also , that he has ceased to care for you , is there not a coolness gradually springing up between you ? Oh , Isabel , why did you on the night before he returned to college , throw his favorite song into the fire , saying that you were tired of that old thing , and did not think that you would ever sing it again ? Were you not watching him when he took one step forward as if to save it , then turned away , the color mounting to his cheek and the veins of his forehead swelling ? Oh , Isabel would you not gladly , gladly have sung it all the time if he had only asked you in the old way ? Ah , it will be a long , long time before he will ask you again . You did more than you intended when you burnt that song . When at his father 's request you sang , did he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel , that you could with difficulty conceal your vexation . Did you not long to sing it with all your heart , and bring him back again ? Oh , what a farce to burn that music ; and yet , when he did return , did you not show him more coolness than you had ever done before ? CHAPTER XXIX . A year has passed since the events recorded in the last chapter ; things have gone on much the same , Everard trying to appear indifferent , while in reality he was not so , but succeeding so well that Isabel felt almost ashamed of her preference for him , and was , also , only too successful in concealing her true feelings . She is now paying Emily a visit , though it was seldom that she could be persuaded to accept any invitation . But in justice to her old friends , it must be said that they often endeavored to do so . Ever since she came to Elm Grove she had always received abundant invitations for the holidays ; but , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome her pride sufficiently to visit , in her present position , those she had known when in such different circumstances . Harry and Emily , after travelling about for some time , had settled in H  --   --  , not far from the college , and had insisted upon Everard spending a great deal of his time with them , as they had fitted up a nice little study for his especial use . Emily was very anxious for the ordination , and had announced her intentions to hear him preach his first sermon , let it be when and where it might , in spite of his saying that he would go where he was quite unknown . " Now , Everard , I 'm going to have a party on the fifth , " said Emily , " and I want you to bring some of the students , and I should like very much to have tall , handsome ones , and none of your little ' ugly mugs . ' I want particularly that nice Mr. Elliott you introduced to me the other day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their appearance , and Elliott is not one of the students , " returned Everard . " Never mind who he is , I want him to come . " " I will ask him if he is in town ; but I ca n't come , I am altogether too busy . " " Nonsense , Everard , you only say that to vex me . I mean you to come , that 's pos ' . Is n't he provoking , Isabel ? " " Perhaps his business is as important as it was that Christmas , " said Isabel , quietly . Everard looked up quickly from his book , but Isabel was fully employed with her tatting . " What do you know about my engagements at that time ? " he asked . " Oh , nothing ; only , perhaps , you can as easily put aside your work as you did then . " " How do you know that it was so easy ? " he inquired . " Only from appearances . " " Appearances are often deceitful . " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make nothing of her placid countenance ; and the single word " very , " it must have been his own imagination that gave significance to the very decided manner in which she had uttered it , or did she , indeed , see through his assumed indifference ? " You speak as though you had some experience , " he said . Isabel crimsoned , for she felt very guilty . " Do you try to appear different to what you are in reality ? " he inquired . " Do you ? " " Why do you ask ? " he said . " Why do you ? " she retorted . " Isabel , Isabel ! the carriage will be here in five minutes , " interposed Emily , " make haste and put your things on . " The fifth came in due course , and Mr. Elliott with it . " Let me introduce to you a partner , " said Emily , taking him up to Isabel . " We have known each other too long to need an introduction , have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to Emily he added , " Thanks , Mrs. Mornington , for an unexpected pleasure . " Everard , who was near by , heard him call her by her Christian name , and saw the warm welcome accorded him , and the evident pleasure the meeting caused Isabel . He was furiously jealous , and walked away intensely disgusted . " You are a stranger here , are you not ? " asked Emily . " Oh , quite . " " Then I leave you in Isabel 's hands . " " Could not be in better , " he said , smiling , and Charley Elliott 's smile was a very pleasant one . Emily was enchanted , and went to sing his praises to Everard , much to his annoyance . " Upon my word , Emily , if I were Harry I should be positively jealous . " " Oh , jealousy is not Harry 's forte ; he leaves that to Mr. Everard Arlington , " she said saucily , with a low curtsey and a most provokingly wise expression . " Emily ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where have you been this long , long time , Isabel ? " asked Elliott , " I have missed you so much . " " Have you , Charley ? I 'm glad to hear that some one has missed me . The happy past seems almost like a dream , it seems so far away . " " It was too bright to last ; do n't you think so , Isabel ? " " Perhaps so . " " Ah , those were days to remember , the excursions I had with you and Harley . But I , too , have had my troubles , " he added , gravely . " Who is exempt ? " she returned . " But what of Harley , foolish Harley ? Whatever possessed him to go to India ? But , " she added , with a sigh , " it would not have availed him much to have stayed , as it turned out . " " I do n't know ; I think he would have done more wisely to have remained . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You never knew ? " " Never . He assured me that he had good and sufficient reason , and that papa thought so , too . " " I did n't think them good , or sufficient either , but he would n't take my advice . It was our only quarrel , and I believe I have scarcely forgiven him yet for going . It would , I am convinced , have been better for all if he had not done so , " and the tears stood in the young lieutenant 's eyes . Though brave as a lion , Charley Elliott had a kind and loving heart . There was a soft , warm light in the deep-blue eyes ; no one could know Charley Elliott without loving him . Everard had no mean rival , if Charley was one . But he was not . He loved Isabel , it is true , with all the warmth of his ardent nature , but he loved her as he might a beautiful sister . He thought her worthy of Harley  --  his Harley  --  the pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wrong , until one day when he told him that he was going to India . Charley 's grief was excessive , but his indignation arose when he learned the cause . Harley Elliott was ten years his brother 's senior . He was the favorite clerk in the firm of Leicester &amp; Co . Had Isabel to be met anywhere , and her father was unable to go , Harley was invariably sent ; he was constantly at the house for one thing or another . As Isabel grew up he was frequently called upon to escort her and her young friends to places of amusement . As might be supposed , he became deeply in love with her , until at last life was almost a burden , for Harley was sensitive and high-minded to a degree : as a poor clerk , he was too proud to woo the rich merchant 's daughter . He determined , therefore , to try to amass wealth in another land , and , if successful , to return and endeavor to win her ; if not , to remain forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not appreciate this course . " Stay and be brave-hearted , Harley , " he said , " she will , she must , love you , and the Governor will not refuse . " But all he could obtain from Harley was a promise that he would tell Mr. Leicester the true cause of his going . Charley had great hopes as to the success of this course , but Harley was not so sanguine , and Harley was right . Mr. Leicester quite approved of his going , and offered him letters of introduction to parties at Calcutta . True , he inquired if the attachment was mutual . But when Harley confessed that he had not sought to know , considering himself in honor bound not to do so in his present circumstances , he was well satisfied that it was so . He took care , also , to find out if Isabel really had a preference for Harley , lest by urging his departure he might make her unhappy . And it must be admitted that he was glad to see that she was heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more brilliant match . So he wished Harley success , and did all in his power to hasten his departure . Poor Charley had missed his brother sadly . He would have accompanied him but for his mother , who was not strong , and certainly could not have borne the climate . " But your troubles , Charley ; you have not told me of them , " said Isabel . " Is not Harley doing well ? " " Yes , now ; but it was some time first . I am going to see him soon . But it was my mother 's death to which I alluded just now . " " Oh , have you lost your mother ? Poor Charley ! " " Do n't talk of her , Isabel , I ca n't bear it , " and Charley brushed away a tear . Dance succeeded dance , and Isabel was still Charley 's partner . " There are half-a-dozen gentlemen dying to be introduced to Miss Leicester , and you give them no chance , Mr. Elliott , " said Emily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are engaged for the after-supper galop . " " I 'll not forget , " she returned . Now it so chanced that Everard had so often been Isabel 's partner for that dance , that he began to consider it a matter of course , and was highly offended when , after keeping away all the evening , he approached her , saying , " This is our dance , is it not , Miss Leicester ? " and she replied , " You are too late , Mr. Arlington , " and whirled off with Charley Elliott . " Why did you do that ? " he asked , when Isabel was again seated . " Was I to refuse a partner in case Mr. Arlington , after keeping away all the evening , should condescend to ask me ? I think you expect too much . " " You knew I should come . " " How could I know ? " " I always do . " " And do you always keep away all the evening ? " He bit his lip . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The next . " " Impossible , my card is quite filled up . " " Never mind , you can strike out one of the names . " " Why should I do so ? You had the best chance ; you were here from the first , but from some whim determined not to put down your name , and looked glum whenever I passed you , and now you think that I will treat one of these young men so unhandsomely . No , Mr. Arlington , I will not . " " You chide me for not coming sooner . I thought you so well amused that I was not needed . " " Needed , no ; but still you have not been commonly civil to-night . " " You are very unforgiving . " " No , but I will not encourage your whims ; you chose to sulk , it was no fault of mine . " " As you will . " " I think this dancing awfully stupid , " he said to Emily , as Isabel went off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . " " Of course , " she replied , with a most provoking laugh . " Parsons do n't usually care for dancing , " added Harry , in a tone equally irritating . But for Charley Elliott the evening would have been dull enough to Isabel . She would far rather have had Everard for a partner than any of those whose names were on her programme , but she believed that he had purposely avoided her all the earlier part of the evening : besides , Everard 's manner towards her of late had become quite an enigma  --  now cold , almost haughty , then again soft , even tender , then indifferent  --  and Isabel resented its variableness . She was the more annoyed , as she knew that Emily was not quite in the dark . " I think Mr. Elliott is a very nice young man , do n't you , Isabel ? " said Emily at breakfast next morning . " Very , " replied Isabel , coloring warmly as she caught Everard 's penetrating glance . " A done thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you be so absurd , Harry ? " Are you fond of sea voyages ? " he continued . " I think them delightful . " " Capital . Did you know that he was going to India ? " " Yes . " " You did ? Well , really . " " Oh , Harry , be quiet . " " I thought you two seemed awfully good friends . Did you know him before last night ? " " Certainly . " " I am sure you do n't agree with Everard that the party was a dreadfully slow affair ? " " Oh , no ; it was very pleasant . " " I was very sure that Miss Leicester did not find it dull , " said Everard coldly , almost scornfully . " Goosey , goosey ! " said Emily , later in the day , as she came upon Everard in the music-room . " Why do you go on in this provoking way , Emily ? " he said , angrily . " Because I have no patience with this stupid jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win her in a straightforward manner ; if not , why be vexed that another should ? " " Why do you strive to undo that which has cost me so much ? She is nothing to me ; I have determined that she shall be nothing . " " Then why so jealous ? " " I can not help it ; you know that I can not . " " But why force yourself to give her up ? " " Why , indeed , " he echoed , " is it not worse than useless to cherish an attachment for one who is so perfectly indifferent ? " " I do not believe that she is as indifferent and inaccessible as you imagine . " " Why do you tempt me , Emily ? " he returned , almost fiercely . " Let me be ; the ordination will be very shortly , and I am sure of an appointment directly after . " " Ah , goosey , goosey ! ' Faint heart , ' you know , " she said , and left him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been before . CHAPTER XXX . " Isabel , you said something about going home this week ; now I have settled that for you . I wrote to mamma , saying that you were going to stay until after the ordination , and then we would all return together . " " I declare those children will get quite unmanageable with such long holidays . When will the ordination be ? " " The beginning of next month . " " Dreadful ! I do not think that Mrs. Arlington will consent . " " Oh , yes , she will . What a state Everard is getting into about that ordination ! " she continued , " and I am nearly as bad . I suppose we shall all go to see it . " " I shall not , " said Isabel . " Why not ? " asked Emily . " I had rather not . " " What a strange girl you are ! I would n't miss it for the world . He will be so vexed , too . " " Why should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested that she would not go ; but for all that , when the time came , she could not resist the desire to be present , even at the risk of being thought changeable . She went , after the rest , and from her corner saw the whole . From where she sat she had a full view of his face  --  grave , earnest , calm , evidently feeling how much was implied in the ordination vows . As she returned before the others , they were quite unaware that she had been there , and she , little hypocrite , listened gravely to all Emily 's descriptions . In the evening Isabel walked on the lawn in the pale moon 's silvery beams , musing of all that had taken place that day , and thinking how very happy Everard must feel to-night . Suddenly that gentleman accosted her : " Why did you refuse to be present at the ordination to-day ? " he asked . Isabel was silent . " How is it , " he continued , " that while others were so anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say the least , unkind . " " You may be sure that I wish you all prosperity in your new vocation , " she said . " I would have said so before , had I thought you wished or expected it . " " I did not expect , " he said , almost angrily , " such a calm expression of a cold regard ; I wished and expected kindly sympathy , if nothing more . " " As you think I should say more , accept my sincere wishes for your happiness ; and believe me when I say that the lot which you have chosen is , in my estimation , the highest to which man can aspire , and may your labors be blessed with abundant success . " " Your kind wishes , though so reluctantly expressed , are not least valued , " he returned , warmly . " But , Isabel , you say that you wish my happiness . My happiness , as I told you long ago , rests with you . Here I can refer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave for my distant mission without making one more appeal . Listen to me patiently for a few minutes . You seemed to adhere so strictly to what you said , that I considered it my duty to give you up ; but it was a duty that , with all my endeavors , I was unable to perform . I sought relief in study  --  hard , excessive study  --  almost night and day . You know how that ended . My mother left me much to you , and your kindness only made matters worse . Afterwards , when you were away , I determined on the course I am now pursuing , and I persuaded myself that my heart was in the work , and so it is , but it is not yours the less . What I endure is almost insupportable  --  it is too hard . Often I have been obliged to appear cold and variable to conceal my real feelings , and you have despised me for it . I have seen it , Isabel . To-night I determined to seek you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received me with indifference , even coldly , I still hope that beneath this reserve there may be some warmer feeling . " Tell me dearest , " he continued , " will you not love me ? Oh , Isabel , must I go alone ? " She was silent . Then for an instant her eyes met his , and the love and happiness in that one glance fully satisfied him , and he clasped her passionately in his arms . " You loved me all the time , Isabel , " he whispered , " only from a mistaken sense of your duty you refused me when I first spoke of my love . " " Oh , no , I did not love you then ; I esteemed you very much , but I was engaged to another . " Then she told what is already known to the reader . " And his name ? " he asked . " Louis Taschereau . " " Tell me : did the thought that I loved you tend to soften the blow , when you found how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not deceive him , even though those beautiful eyes were fixed upon her in earnest expectation . As we have said , she was very truthful , so answered , " I can not flatter you so much , Everard ; it afforded me no comfort whatever . Indeed I never thought of it , except when some kind attention on your part reminded me of the fact , and then the thought only caused me pain . " He looked disappointed . " No , " she added , " it was not until long after , that your worth and uniform kindness won my heart . " They lingered on the lawn until the chill night air warned them not to remain there any longer . Entering the music-room by the window , they found Emily waiting for them . " Oh , here you are at last ; Harry had to go out , and I 've been all alone this half hour . " Then , starting up , she seized a hand of each , exclaiming " You need not tell me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very glad . " " I saw you at the ordination this morning , " said Charley Elliott , who came in during the evening , addressing Isabel , " only you were in such a fearful hurry to get away that I did not get a chance to speak . " " Then you must have very good eyes , Mr. Elliott , as Isabel was not there , " cried Emily , laughing . " I beg your pardon , " he returned . " I was there , " said Isabel quietly , though she colored hotly . " You were ? " exclaimed Everard , evidently well satisfied . " I declare you  --  are  --  a queer girl , " said Emily , opening her blue eyes very wide , " I 'm afraid you have not the bump of firmness . " " I knew you would think me changeable , but after you had all gone I began to think I should like to see it , so I followed . But I certainly did not see you , Charley . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw no one but the candidates , " returned Charley , laughing . " Indeed you looked so solemn and earnest , one would almost suppose that you were one of them . " " Is it true , " asked Harry , on his return , " that you have agreed to start for Madagascar next month ? " " Quite true , " returned Everard , coolly . " I protest against it , " said Harry . " And so do I , " added Emily ; while Charley shrugged his shoulders , and Isabel laughed . Emily was terribly anxious for Charley to depart , as she longed to tell Harry the news ; which news , when Emily told it , Harry received with unmistakable satisfaction , saying he could n't see why Everard should not settle down comfortably near home , instead of going to such an out-of-the-way place . The following week they all started for Elm Grove , and when , on their arrival Mrs. Arlington took both her hands and kissed her affectionately , Isabel knew that the news of their engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Arlington being in a most gracious humor . Mr. Arlington shook Isabel so heartily by the hand that it ached for hours afterward . Emily was in the most exuberant spirits ; Everard 's happiness , from its very depth , was of a more quiet nature ; while Harry was as merry and joyous as his wife ; and Isabel , in her own sweet way , had a kind look and word for all . On entering the school-room , next morning , Isabel found little Amy sitting upon the floor , her head buried in the sofa cushion , sobbing as if her heart would break , her little form quivering with the violence of her emotion . " What is the matter , Amy dear ? " asked Isabel , taking the trembling child in her arms . But Amy could not speak ; she only clung to Isabel , and sobbed more bitterly than before . Isabel sat down with Amy on her knee , stroking the shining hair until the child should be more composed . After a time , when the violence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquired the cause of her tears . " Rose says that you are going to Madagascar with Everard , and perhaps I shall never see you any more , " she managed to blurt out amid her sobs . " You ought not to go , for I am sure I love you more than he does . I told him so this morning , but he only laughed and said I did n't ; but I do , and I think it is very unkind of him to take you away . We know lots of young ladies ; I 'm sure he might marry some one else , and not take my darling Isabel to nasty Madagascar . Oh , Isabel , you must not go . Oh , please ! please ! " she said , coaxingly . " Oh , wo n't you please tell him that you have changed your mind , and would rather stay with us ? " " Oh , but you know I promised , Amy . " " But you sha n't go ; tell him you wo n't ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she threw her arms round Isabel 's neck . " But do n't you think that it is very selfish of little Amy to wish that her brother should go alone to that far country , when she will have papa , mamma , and sisters ? " " Oh ! I wish you did n't love him one bit , and then you would stay with us . " " Hush ! Amy dear , you must n't talk so . " " But I ca n't help wishing it , and I told Everard so , and that I hoped you would change your mind . Then he said that it was very wicked of me to wish that ; and he put me off his knee so quick , and walked out of the room looking so angry  --  no , not angry , exactly , but as if he thought , perhaps , you might . " " But , Amy , if you loved any one very much , would you like it if that person did n't love you one bit ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doing as you would be done by to wish such unkind and selfish things ? " " I did not think of that , " replied Amy , resting her head on Isabel 's shoulder , " but it seems as if you did not love me , to go away to Madagascar , " she added , sadly . " Oh , Amy dear , I love you very much , " said Isabel , the tears gathering in her eyes , " and it grieves me to part from you . " " And then we shall have another horrid governess , like Miss Manning , and the days will all be long and miserable , like the long , long , weary day that Emily used to sing about . And what will become of all our nice Sundays ? " " Poor little Amy ! " said Isabel , parting back the shining curls from the sorrowful little face , and looking into the violet eyes that were fixed upon her so earnestly . " You must not think that I would leave you without first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and try to make you happy . Now , if you will stop crying , I will tell you about the young lady who , I hope , will be your governess . She is a very dear friend of mine , and I trust you will all be very kind to her , and love her very much . Her name is Gertrude Hartley . " Alice and Rose now entered the school-room , and gave a very warm welcome to Isabel . " Please go on about Gertrude Hartley , " pleaded Amy . Then Isabel told them how Gertrude had gone as a governess to a family who lived far back in the country , miles away from any church , and how , by her endeavors , a small but pretty one had been erected , where service was held once a month . But Gertrude had grown tired of the country , and was anxious to obtain another situation . " She will come to see you next week , and I am sure you will like her . And you know you can often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall write you nice long letters about that strange country , and I shall often think of my dear little sisters , for you will be my sisters then , you know . " " I did not think of that , " said Amy , smiling . " Oh , Isabel , I 'm so sorry that you are going away . Do n't you think you could persuade Everard to give up being a missionary ? I 'm certain he could have Attwood Church if he liked , because Dr. Herbert once asked him if he would like it . Please do , because it would be so nice . " " What ! and leave those heathen people still in ignorance of God ? My little Rose does not think what she is wishing that Everard would give up . No , I could not wish him to do so , much less persuade him . " " But he might get some one else to go , " replied Rose . " No , Rose , we must each perform our own duties . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to the plow and looking back ? " " Exactly so , " replied Isabel . " I did not think of it in that way , so you must not be angry with me . " " I was not angry , dear , only I wanted to show you that your wish was a wrong one . What does Alice think about it ? " " I think , " replied Alice , " that he ought to go , and I am very glad that you are going with him , for you are so nice and so good that I am sure the little heathen children will listen to what you say , because you have such a nice way of telling things . Of course I am very sorry to lose you , but I mean to think of the good your going will be for other people , and how nice it is for Everard , and then I shall not care about it so much . " " It gives me great pleasure to hear you say this , and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear children , that the surest way to forget our own troubles is to find pleasure in the benefit and happiness of others . " Everard Arlington was about to enter by the window , but paused a moment to contemplate the group before him . On a large ottoman sat Isabel , with Amy on her knee , one arm encircling Alice , who was standing thoughtfully by her side , her head resting on Isabel 's shoulder , while behind was Rose , half smiles , half tears . " Oh , Everard ! " cried Amy , " I wo n't say again that I hope Isabel will not go with you . But she says that it is not naughty to be sorry . You are not angry with me now ? " she inquired , looking wistfully into his face . " No , my little Amy , " he replied , smoothing the glossy curls , as he stooped as if to kiss her , but he did n't kiss Amy . CHAPTER XXXI . Mrs. Arlington was not one to do things by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her return , it was no longer as " the governess , " but as her future daughter-in-law  --  as the bride-elect of her darling son  --  indeed as one of them , the Arlingtons . She was glad , as he was so determined upon being a missionary , that he was to marry before he went , but she would rather  --  far rather  --  that he should have chosen any other than " the governess , " though she had nothing against Isabel  --  nothing . Still it was a trial to the haughty mother that her only son  --  the hope and pride of the family  --  should marry a governess . She knew that many would say she had been imprudent in having so young and pretty a governess , knowing how fond Everard was of the society of his young sisters . And , indeed , she did feel she had been wrong when she got Everard 's letter announcing the engagement , and it was some little time before she could be at all satisfied with the matter . Grace was excessively annoyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's displeasure , saying that it was quite a disgrace to the family , and that she would never receive Isabel as a sister . Fortunately her consent was never likely to be asked , as her easy-going brother , the pet of the house , had a pretty determined will , and her opinion would certainly not influence him in the matter . Indeed , now that he had Isabel 's consent , he would have married her even though opposed by any number of relations ; and it was with no thought of obtaining their ideas on the subject that he had written , but simply to inform them of the fact , little suspecting the commotion it would cause at Elm Grove . However , the course he pursued had the effect of reconciling his mother to the match , and it was well that it was so , or Isabel would have met with a sorry reception on her arrival . Very quickly after the letter we have mentioned , came another , such as only Everard could write  --  written out of a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his former despair , long probation , and weary waiting ; how his love for Isabel had dated from that Sunday evening when he first saw her in the school-room with the children ; and expressing the hope that his mother would give Isabel a place in her heart equal to that of her own children . Tears of sympathy and love fell from the mother 's eyes as she read , and a happy smile played around her mouth as she refolded the letter which would be read again and again . Henceforth she was won . So , then , when Lady Ashton , who had now returned from England , came to condole with dear Mrs. Arlington upon the ill luck that had befallen the family , she found that lady quite satisfied , to her profound astonishment . However , she gave a willing ear and ready sympathy to Grace , who was quite disgusted at her mother 's contentment , and returned with Lady Ashton to the Park , saying , that she was far too angry to meet them at present ; and there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would so shortly leave for a distant land , not heeding the possibility , nay probability , that he might never return . Who could foresee the dangers that might be in store for him ? Read the dangers and miseries to which the missionaries sent to foreign and heathen lands are only too often subjected  --  dangers on sea and land , and fearful cruelties at the hands of wild and savage creatures , more ferocious sometimes in their implacable fury than the beasts of prey . But even overlooking these more dreadful calamities , there is the climate , so trying to the natives of cooler countries . Nor was she just to Isabel . She would only see a beautiful , designing girl , who had succeeded in catching her brother . She was angry with Isabel , with Everard , with her mother , and , lastly , with herself , to think that she , too , had been for a short time deluded like the rest . She felt now that she positively hated Isabel . Lady Ashton did her best to fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that under that lady 's able management it grew day by day , until Grace really believed her silly anger to be just indignation at her brother 's blind infatuation . Ah , foolish Grace ! To Emily 's great satisfaction , Everard preached his first sermon in the church they usually attended , and was very calm and self-possessed considering the eight eager faces in the family pew , his heightened color being the only evidence that this was the first time he had addressed a congregation from the pulpit . It happened , strangely enough , that a collection for the Missionary Society was to be taken up on this occasion , and the young deacon delivered an exceedingly eloquent discourse advocating the cause of missions , with a warmth and earnestness that carried his hearers along with him , and showed that his heart was in the work . No one who heard him could doubt his future success in the cause . Then what a happy group waited for him after service , and what approving smiles beamed upon him from loved faces when he came ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep at sermon time if you always preached , " cried little Amy . " It was so nice , " added Rose , warmly ; while the proud father wrung his son 's hand in silence more eloquent than words . Then Everard disappointed a crowd of admiring friends by disappearing through a side gate and going home across the fields , even waving back his young sisters , who would have followed him . " I could not stand it , " he said , on reaching home half an hour after the others , though his way had been much shorter , he having spent the interim in self-communion beneath the shade of a friendly oak . Oh ! that was a happy Sunday at Elm Grove ; but , like all earthly happiness , it had one cloud  --  Grace 's strange and unkind conduct . CHAPTER XXXII . " Please , Miss Leicester , a gentleman wishes to see you , " said Susan , putting her rosy face in at the school-room door , as Isabel was giving the children their last lesson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Miss , he asked for you , but he would not give his name . " " Very well , Susan . Who can it be ? " she asked , turning to Alice . " I 'm sure I do n't know , " answered Alice , laughing , " you had better go and see . " On entering the drawing-room , Isabel saw to her astonishment that it was Louis Taschereau . " This is indeed a surprise , " she said , extending her hand , for in her present happiness she could not be ungracious or unkind . Encouraged by her cordial greeting , Louis began : " I thought of writing , but determined on seeking an interview , as a letter could but inadequately convey what I wished to say . I have suffered much , as you are aware , and my troubles have made me a very different man ; but a gleam of light seems once more to shine on my path , and I hope yet to repair the error of my life . Can you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be again to me all that you once were ? I know that I do not deserve it , but I will try to atone for the past if , dear Isabel , you will be my wife . " " Stay , Dr. Taschereau ! " interposed Isabel , " I am just about to marry a clergyman who is going abroad . " Had a cannon-ball fallen at his feet , Louis could scarcely have been more dumbfounded than he was at this intelligence . He became deadly pale , and she thought he would faint . " You are ill , Dr. Taschereau . Let me ring for some wine . " " Do n't ring , I do n't want any . Is this true ? " he continued , " are you really going to marry another ? " " I am , and I do not see why you should be surprised . " " Why do you make me love you so ? Why must your image intrude itself into every plan , and all be done as you would approve , if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not wonder at the effect of what you have told me , if you knew how the hope that you would forgive me and yet be mine , has been my only comfort a long , dreary time . " " You have no right to speak in this way , Dr. Taschereau ; it was I who had cause of complaint , not you . But I am very sorry that you should feel so ; very sorry that you should have suffered yourself to imagine for a moment that we could ever be again to each other what we once were . And do not think that my present engagement is the cause of my saying this ; for never , never , under any circumstances , could I have been your wife after what has passed . I say not this in anger or ill-will for the past , I do not regret it  --  I feel it was best . " " Will you not tell me the name of the fortunate clergyman ? " he asked . " Certainly , if you wish it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Everard Arlington ! " he exclaimed in unfeigned astonishment . " It was the knowledge of his hopeless attachment that made me hope  --  almost make sure  --  that you had not entirely ceased to love me , and might yet be mine ; the more despairing he became , the higher my hopes rose . " " How could you , how dared you , indulge such thoughts after what I said in the woods at D  --   --  ? " exclaimed Isabel , indignantly . " If Everard had so long to believe that his attachment was unavailing , it was because Isabel Leicester would not give her hand unless her heart went with it ; because I respected his affection too much to trifle with it , and not at all on your account . Believe me , that from the time I first learned that you were married , every thought of you was rigidly repelled , and it was arrant presumption in you to suppose anything else , " she continued , proudly , the angry tears suffusing her eyes . The conference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance of Everard , who looked inquiringly at each . " How are you , old fellow ? " he said ( for Isabel 's proud anger fled at his approach ) , " what brought you here so unexpectedly ? " " Oh , a little private affair , " he replied , looking rather uncomfortable ; but there was that in Louis 's eye , as he said this , that made Isabel distrust him ; something that made her determined to put it out of his power to misrepresent and make mischief . True , he had said how changed he was , and spoken of the reformation his trials had made . Certainly he had been more calm under disappointment than had been his wont . But still she doubted him . She had seen that look before , and knew that it was the same false Louis , not so changed as he imagined . The dark side was only lying dormant ; she could read his malicious enjoyment in that cruel smile , and knew its meaning well . Meeting his glance with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as plainly as words , " I will thwart your fine plans , Mr. Louis , " she said : " You are aware that I was formerly engaged to Dr. Taschereau . His business here to-day was to endeavor to renew that engagement . I need not say how very strange and absurd this appears , as you are acquainted with the circumstances under which the former engagement terminated . " " Yes , that was the ' little private affair , ' but I find that you have already won the prize ; allow me to congratulate you . " Louis said this in a frank , pleasant manner , appearing to take his own disappointment with so much good nature , at the same time blending a certain degree of sadness in his tone as quite to deceive Everard and win his sympathy . But the thundering black look which he cast at Isabel fully convinced her that she was right . " You will dine with us , of course , " said Everard , cordially . " I shall do so with pleasure , " returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how much he can annoy me , " she thought . But if this was his object he must have been disappointed , so totally unconscious of his presence did Isabel appear , and when he addressed her personally her manner was colder than even Everard thought necessary . The heat of the rooms became very oppressive during the evening , and Isabel stepped out on the lawn to enjoy the refreshing breeze , but was soon surprized to find that Louis had followed her . " Let us at least be friends , " he said . " You will remember that it was not in anger we last parted . " But Isabel was silent . " You doubt me , " he continued . " I do not blame you , but you are harsh , Miss Leicester . " " Not harsh , but just , " returned Isabel . " Friends we can never be ; enemies I trust we never were . " " You draw fine distinctions . May I ask what place in your estimation I am permitted to occupy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Taschereau ; I must ever regard you with indifference , " returned Isabel , coldly . " Be it so , " he replied , angrily . " You have obstinately refused all offers of reconciliation , and must therefore take the consequences . " " The consequences ? You speak strangely , Dr. Taschereau . " I repeat : the consequences . I determined long since that you should never marry another , and my sentiments on that subject have not changed . No ; I vow you shall not ! " he added , with the old vindictive expression . " How dare you hold such language to me , sir ? " cried Isabel , indignantly . Without answering , he drew a pistol from his pocket and would have shot her , but , changing his purpose , he turned upon Everard , who was approaching . With a cry of horror , Isabel threw herself between them , and prevented Louis from taking as good an aim as he might otherwise have done ; for though the ball , in passing , grazed her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . With parted lips , but without the power of speech , she clung to Everard in an agony of terror for a moment , and then lay motionless in his arms . In terrible apprehension he carried the senseless girl into the house , fearing that she was seriously hurt , as the blood had saturated a large portion of her dress , which was of very thin texture . Of course the consternation into which the family was thrown by the shot , followed by the entrance of Everard with Isabel in this alarming condition , was tremendous . But happily Isabel was more terrified than hurt , Dr. Heathfield pronouncing the wound of no consequence ( to Everard 's intense disgust ) , telling her to take a glass of wine and go to bed , and she would be none the worse for her fright in the morning  --  in fact treated the whole thing quite lightly , and laughed at Isabel for her pale cheeks , saying that such an alabaster complexion was not at all becoming . He promised to send her something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a composing draught to enable her to sleep , as he saw very little chance of her doing so without . Everard volunteered to go with him for it . On their way , Dr. Heathfield remarked that he was afraid Everard thought him very rude and unfeeling . Everard , who had been very silent , replied that he did . " Then do not think so any longer , " said the Doctor , laying his hand on his companion 's shoulder . " I saw how scared she was , and treated the case accordingly . You are both great favorites of mine , so I hope you will not be offended . Do you know what became of the scoundrel ? " " He made for parts unknown immediately after he fired , " replied Everard , sternly , while the heavy breathing showed how much it cost him to speak calmly . " It is quite a Providence that one of us is not dead at this moment , as he is a splendid marksman . I do n't know which of the two the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thrown herself between us . " " She is just the girl to do it , " cried the Doctor , grasping him warmly by the hand . " I have always had a very high opinion of her . " " I should think so , " said Everard , with a quiet smile of satisfaction . Fortunately Isabel had no idea that Everard had gone with the Doctor , or she would have been terribly anxious , for fear Louis should still be near . But guilt makes cowards of all , so Louis was now in a fearful state of mind : for he was passionate , hasty , violent and selfish , but not really bad-hearted , and jealous anger and hatred had so gained the mastery over him that he had been impelled to do that at which , in cooler moments , he would have shuddered . So now he was enduring agony , fearing lest his mad attempt at murder had been successful , yet not daring to inquire . Ah , Louis ! you are now , as ever , your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look so sad Everard ; Isabel was not much hurt ; not hurt at all I may say . " " I was not thinking of her just now Emmy , " he answered smiling , but the smile passed away , and left his face very sad indeed . " What is it Evvie , " she asked in the old coaxing way , seating herself beside him on the seat round the old Elm tree . " I was thinking of Grace , " he replied " you ca n't think how her keeping away pains me . " " I would n't think of it , if I were you , it is very mean and ill-natured of her , but she will get over her huff after a while . " " That would be all very well , if I were going to remain here , but you know how soon I go and  --   --  " " Oh Everard , " ( Emmy could not contemplate this event with composure ) " Oh Everard , I ca n't bear you to go , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His sisters were not much given to tears , this one in particular , the brightest of them all , so that this genuine bust of grief was the more perplexing . He was endeavouring in vain to soothe her , when little Emmy came upon the scene , and seeing her mamma in trouble , she set up a terrific howling , and running at Everard , she seized his coat to steady herself and commenced to kick him with all the force she could muster , exclaiming " naughty , naughty , to make my mamma cry . " This warlike attack upon her brother set Emily laughing , while he feigned to be desperately hurt by the tiny feet at which the round blue eyes grew wonderfully well satisfied . Isabel now joined them alarmed by the cries of her little playmate . Emmy looking very brave scrambled upon mamma 's knee , from whence she darted very defiant glances at her uncle . " I think I will go to Ashton Park " said Everard . " Do you think that it will do any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not bad hearted , only vexed , besides , I should wish to leave on good terms with the old lady . " " I have no doubt that she pities you immensely . " Everard laughed " I will go now " he said , " and we hope you may be successful " returned both warmly . " Good evening Lady Ashton " said Everard when he arrived at the Park ; entering the drawing-room from the lawn . " Oh is that you , you poor unfortunate boy , " returned her ladyship compassionately . " Pray spare your pity , for some more deserving individual , " answered Everard laughing , " I think myself the most fortunate of mortals . " " Do n't come to me with your nonsense , you are very silly , and have behaved in a most dishonorable manner towards your family . " " Will you be kind enough to state in what way , " replied Everard colouring , " I confess I ca n't see it . " " Why , in offering to that governess girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't patience with you ; my sympathy is all with poor Grace , who feels quite disgraced by it . " " She can not think so , seriously , or if she does , she ought to be ashamed . " Hoighty , toighty , how we are coming the parson to-night . " " Pshaw , " exclaimed Everard impatiently . " I think she is justly angry and aggrieved . Of course in receiving so young and pretty a girl , as governess for your sisters , ( for I allow that she is pretty . ) " Oh you do , " said Everard sarcastically . " Your mother " continued Lady Ashton " relied upon your honorable feelings , and good sense , but you have abused her confidence in a most cruel manner . " The swelling veins , and heavy breathing showed how annoyed he was , and he answered warmly , " I deny having done anything wrong or dishonorable , I presume that I have a perfect right to choose for myself . " " To a certain extent I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family . " " They have no cause of complaint , Isabel is quite their equal if not superior . " " In your estimation , " said Lady Ashton contemptuously . " I do n't care to discuss the subject " returned Everard haughtily . " Reverse the matter , how would you like it , if Grace was going to marry a tutor . " " If he was a worthy person , and Grace was satisfied , I certainly should not object . " " I doubt it , " cried Lady Ashton angrily . Then she commenced aspersing Isabel in every way , and Everard hotly defended her . " Nasty , artful , designing girl , you will live to repent your folly yet , " she said . Then Everard got in a terrible passion newly ordained though he was . But Lady Ashton was a woman , and Everard Arlington never forgot when he was in the presence of ladies , so though they most decidedly quarrelled , Everard saying some pretty severe things , he managed to keep the cooler of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton could be . So instead of conciliating Grace he had only made matters worse ; as he supposed ; but Lady Ashton really loved her god-son , and in her heart admired him for his spirit . Everard 's anger once roused was not easily appeased , so that after he left Ashton Park , he took a ten mile walk in the moonlight before he was sufficiently calm to venture home . " What is the matter " asked his mother when he did . " I have been in a tremendous passion , and am not quite cooled down yet " he answered , " good night . " The upshot of all this was , that on coming home one afternoon , Everard found Lady Ashton , and Grace waiting for him . " Let bygones , be bygones , " said the former taking his hand , while Grace offered hers with a dignified condescension that was truly amusing , Everard was only too glad to have a cessation of hostilities , and responded cordially to the overtures of peace . Then Lady Ashton insisted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial , saying that if Everard did not come , that she would not believe that he forgave her . " Grace and Emily were delighted , saying , it was the very thing , and Alice was half wild with glee at being included in the invitation , and also allowed to go . So Isabel had a new white dress for the occasion , and now that she was no longer the governess , she arrayed herself with some of the beautiful and costly jewels , which her fathers creditors had refused to take , ( though they were offered them by Isabel , ) which had not seen the light since she came to Elm Grove . " Oh Isabel , now you look like yourself " said Lucy , who had arrived just in time to be of the party . " How sly of you Isabel , not to let us see them before " cried Emily examining them " what beauties , " and Mrs. Arlington looked very approvingly at her future daughter-in-law . " I think that you are the proudest girl I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh mamma , not proud , only sensitive , " interposed Alice warmly . " I think you were wrong my dear " continued Mrs. Arlington without heeding Alice . " Please do n't ' , pleaded Isabel the tears gathering in her eyes " I could not help feeling so , indeed I could not . " " Do n't blame her mamma , it does not matter now , " put in Emily . " She was a stupid little goose to care so much about it ; and I always said so , " chimed in Lucy . " Pray who is a stupid little goose , " asked Everard joining the group in the drawing-room . " Ask no questions  --   --  you know the rest " returned Lucy saucily . " Dear me , how late we shall be " cried Emily " what can make papa and Harry so long . " " On arriving at the Park , an unexpected pleasure caused a great deal of excitement . On entering the dressing-room they met Ada . " Oh , when did you come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Burst from them simultaneously , as Ada was hugged in a manner that bid fair to ruin the effect of her careful toilet . " Did n't Lucy tell you , " asked Ada amazed . " Not I , " cried Lucy triumphantly . " Oh Lucy . " Then a thundering rap at the door from Harry , who was impatient to see his sister ; made them hasten down , all in high spirits at the unlooked for meeting . Lady Ashton hardly seemed herself she was so pleasant , and even Grace did the agreeable to perfection . Lucy , lectured Everard , and condemned severely his taking Isabel to be eaten up by savages ; as she persisted would be the case if he carried out his preposterous intentions . But Everard only laughed . " I can not see how you can reconcile it to your conscience , to doom such a girl as that , to so wretched an existence , look at her , is she fit for such a hum-drum-knock-about life . " " Everard cast a very admiring glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather sad smile . " Oh I see I am right , " she cried , " I know you think that she is more fitted for civilized society , confess now , confess , I used to think you so considerate , but now I see you are very selfish . " Perhaps I am , " and he walked out on the lawn , leaving Lucy much astonished and very indignant . " Be merciful Lucy , " said Charles offering his arm . " Not I , " returned Lucy , " I think it awfully cool . " " Then it must be very refreshing this hot evening " said Charles laughing . " Do n't be provoking . " I 'm awfully angry . " " Lucy ! " " Charles ! " CHAPTER XXXIV . " Oh , here you are , " said Lucy when shortly after breakfast next morning she found Everard enjoying a cigar in the piazza . " You need n't think to escape by going off in that unceremonious manner last night , so you may as well listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or other . " " I am all attention Miss Lucy , only I hope you do n't object to my cigar . " " Not at all , it will make you more patient perhaps . " " Should n't wonder , as I 'm afraid from your preamble it is nothing I care to hear . " " Everard ! " then with a shrug . " Of course you do n't . " Everard laughed . " You stupid fellow , wo n't you be quiet and hear what I have to say . " " Oh certainly . " " I wish to remind you , that you need not go goodness knows how many hundred miles to find people to convert , as there are plenty nearer home . " " No doubt , and also , others near home anxious to convert them . " " And do you think , that no one but yourself would go to that outlandish place . " " Very few , comparatively ; of course there are some . " " Mighty few I expect . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should . " " I have not seen any yet , so of course can't see additional ones " she answered saucily . " I tell you what you had better do , stay and convert me , and that will take you a precious long time I promise you . " " Lucy ! " " Oh , how grave you are , I wish you could see your face . " " You forget what you are talking about , Lucy , or you would not speak so " he said gravely , " I can not believe that you are in earnest . " " Of course I do n't mean half I say , I never do , I did not think you would take it so seriously . " " It is a bad way to get into , Lucy . " " Do n't be alarmed " cried Lucy laughing , " I 'm not so awfully wicked as you imagine . I know , that I am very wild , and thoughtless , and that that school did not do me any good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathen . " " Be merry and wise , " he said kindly but gravely . " " That is not so easy " returned Lucy with a gulp , " you may think so , you are so mild tempered ; but with one , so impulsive , and high spirited as I am , it is very hard , almost impossible ; that 's always the way with you quiet , easy going people , you have no sympathy with us . " " Oh , Lucy , how apt we are to form wrong opinions , you think me quiet , easy , gentle , I may be so , but I am also passionate , determined , and you say selfish ; be that as it may , I can not give up without a very hard struggle , not even then usually . I am unyielding . Persevering and firm , Emily would say , self-willed and obstinate , Grace would call me . " " I ca n't believe you . " " It is true . " " But to resume our discussion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that outlandish place . " " It is settled , all the talking in the world ca n't make any difference , " he said with the quiet smile , and languid manner , that made it so hard to believe that he was indeed what he had described . In the evening Susan brought a note to Isabel , as she and Everard were walking on the terrace . Isabel turned deadly pale on observing the handwriting , " it is from Dr. Tachereau " she exclaimed . " Let me open it " said Everard seeing her agitation . " A poisoned letter perhaps . " " Oh Everard , such things only happen in story books , but if you really think so , it had better go at the back of the fire . " " The fire is the right place for it no doubt , but I have a curiosity to see the inside first , some impertinence you may be sure . " " Perhaps to inform us , that he will bring his pistols to the church , if we dare to venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but a sickening faintness overpowered her , and she was unable to read . He had now succeeded in making her fear him , while his vindictiveness had been solely against herself , she had defied him , but now , that another was menaced she trembled for his safety . " Let me see this madman 's effusion " said Everard soothingly , " Why I declare you are quite ill , take this seat and I will read for our mutual edification . " Casting an anxious glance towards Isabel occasionally to ascertain if she was recovering from her agitation , he read a follow 's : DEAR ISABEL ,  --  ( cool muttered Everard ) . What a fool I was the other night , can you , will you , forgive me . Could you know the remorse and misery I have suffered since , or the feeling of thankfulness with which I heard that I had not seriously injured either of you ; I think you would . What a reward for your kindness to my poor Natalie ; what a return for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my misfortune , I could scarcely have been surprised . But I loved myself , and my own way , and you thwarted me twice ; but enough of the past . I dare not contemplate it . Let me however say a few words in extenuation of my folly . You can never know what I endured that evening , to see the regard once bestowed on me , transferred to another , to see that I was nothing ,  --  that I was entirely , unmistakeably forgotten ,  --  perhaps detested ; for you treated me with unnecessary coldness . All this so worked upon my unhappy temperament until nearly mad with anger and jealousy , I did that , for which I now beseech you to forgive me . I shall never see you again , as the thought of your marrying another is so hateful to me that I dare not trust myself in your presence after the dark glimpse I have had of my evil nature . I did not think I could be so wicked . Farewell , I still remain your loving , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into fragments , with the same expression that Dr. Heathfield had remarked , while an angry flush suffused his countenance . But there was more of pity , than of anger , in Isabel 's mind , and she did not notice his displeasure . And as Rose at this moment came to call them in , to see Mrs. Arnold , of course no comment was passed on the letter ; though Everard 's unusual gloominess that evening , proved that he had not forgotten it . Mrs. Arnold was very fussy as usual , and told many amusing anecdotes regarding her journey , and also gave an immense amount of good advice to both Everard and Isabel , for which of course they were duly grateful . " Really my dear Mabel " said Mrs. Arnold , " I never was more glad in my life , than when I heard of this match , I was positively delighted . But you must not suppose for a moment , that I had any such idea ; when I got her the situation . " Isabel looked annoyed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out , how foolishly sensitive , ( as Mrs. Arlington termed it , ) Isabel had always been , regarding her position . " Never mind , dear , " said Mrs. Arnold kindly , " It is all over now , but still I should have thought that you had been a governess long enough to get used to it . " " Please do n't pleaded Isabel , resolutely forcing back the tears which invariably came , at any allusion to the distasteful subject . And Everard , who until now had been unaware of her extreme dislike of being a governess admired her the more , that while hating her position so much , she had so determinately refused him , as long as she felt , that she did not return his affection . " How is it my dear " inquired Mrs. Arnold , who seemed destined to-night to hit upon the wrong topic , " that you have never been to visit any of your old friends , Mrs. Price , Mrs. Vernon , Miss Carding , and hosts of others , told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the most pressing invitations , all to no purpose . " Isabel reddened painfully , Emily and Lucy laughed . " That is another of Isabel 's ' weaknesses ' . " Everard looked annoyed . " Sing some of your comic songs , Harry , " he said , wishing to change the subject . And Harry sung , to the great amusement of the party generally , and of Mrs. Arnold in particular . Before they separated , a moonlight excursion to the romantic dell , the scene of the memorable picnic four years ago , was arranged for the next evening , and met with universal approbation . All agreeing that the water-fall could only be seen to perfection by moonlight . CHAPTER XXXV . It had been a dull day , this last day , so that all were glad that the evening was not spent quietly at home , giving time for sad thoughts of to-morrow 's parting . Thanks to Harry and Lucy , the excursion passed off more cheerfully than might have been expected , all appearing to enjoy themselves . On their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing-room , but went out and lingered by the fountain , in the moonlight , musing on all that had happened since she first came there , now nearly five years ago , and wondering how long it might be , and what might happen , ere she would again be there  --  or if , indeed , she would be there again . Ah ! seek not to look into futurity , Isabel . It is well for you that you know not all that shall be ere you again sit there . Enjoy your happiness while you may , and leave the future to unfold itself . She remained there a long time thinking of many things , and was still lost in meditation when Everard joined her . " A penny for your thoughts , " he said . " Oh , Everard , I want you to do something , " she returned , laying her hand on his arm . " What is it , dearest ? " he inquired . " I feel so unhappy about Louis . I wish so much that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent , and his face became very stern . " If you would , I should be so glad . " " You ask too much , " he said . " Only what is right . " " Right perhaps , but hard  --  very hard . " " Oh , do , " she pleaded , raising her blue eyes to his so earnestly . " Oh , Everard , it is not the way for us to be happy , to be unforgiving . I should be so miserable : day by day watching the blue waters , knowing that I had left any one in anger or ill-feeling . Oh , Everard , you will forgive him ! " She looked so lovely there in the moonlight , pleading for one who so little deserved it of her , that Everard found it hard to refuse her . " I can not write a lie , Isabel , even to please you , " he replied , in a harsh , unnatural voice . " Oh , no , not that ; but I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not , " and his voice was hard and cold . Isabel shuddered . Was this the Everard usually so kind and gentle ? " Oh , Everard , and you a clergyman ! " " Perhaps I am not fit to be one , " he answered . " I have thought so sometimes lately , but I wished so much to be one that , in seeking to fulfil the wish , I may have overlooked the meetness . " " If you are not , I do not know who is , " she said , " but this is not like yourself ; I should be less surprised if I was unforgiving and you forgave . " " I hope that I do not often feel as I do now towards him . But you forget how nearly he took you from me ; he whom I trusted and regarded with the warmest friendship . " " It is not for his sake I ask it Everard ; forgive as you would be forgiven . " They walked on in silence until they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart I wish I could , Isabel , " and abruptly left her . Then , alone in his own room , after all had retired to rest , far into the night he fought the battle of good and evil . What was he about to do  --  preach and teach meekness , self-denial , and forgiveness of injuries , while he was still angry and unforgiving ? What mockery ! Ought he not to practice what he taught ? Was theory  --  mere words  --  sufficient ? No ; he must , by example , give force to his teaching , or how could he hope to succeed ? All this he saw clearly enough , but the difficulty still remained . He strove hard to conquer , but evil prevailed . " Forgive as you would be forgiven " rang continually in his ears , but he did not , could not , forgive . He laid down , but not to sleep , and the pale moon shone calmly and peacefully in upon him , as if mocking his disquietude . At length he threw the painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He awoke , next morning , with the sun beaming brightly in at the window . But dark clouds gathered round him ; gloomy doubts as to his fitness for the office he had taken , and sorrow at the impossibility of his forgiving Louis . " Forgive as you would be forgiven , " and again the last night 's struggle was renewed , and even when they started for the church he had not conquered . Isabel saw how it was , and this was the bitter drop in her cup of happiness . Alas ! in this world when is it unalloyed ? A burst of music filled the church as the bridal party entered , and very lovely looked the bride , surrounded by her three little bridesmaids , while in the background stood a fourth , the merry Lucy . Bob and three youthful Arlington cousins were groomsmen , and Everard , to use Lucy 's own words , was the very beau ideal of what a bridegroom should be , in fact " perfect . " The sun shone with almost dazzling splendor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and again the organ pealed forth its joyous strains as they left the church , and gaily rang the marriage bells . " Everard , " said Isabel , when they were in the library awaiting the arrival of the others , " write that letter now ; I know you can , for you would not look so happy if you felt as you did last night . " " I can write it truthfully now , " he replied , smiling at her earnestness . And then , with his bride bending over his shoulder , Everard wrote such a note as only he could write , expressing their entire forgiveness , and made Isabel take the pen and write " Isabel Arlington " under his signature . The others , coming in , insisted upon knowing the subject of their very important correspondence , but Everard pocketed the letter and refused to satisfy their curiosity . The breakfast was but a dull affair , notwithstanding the exuberant spirits of the young groomsmen . The parents knew that they were parting with their only son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; and the son , amid his happiness , remembered that he was leaving father , mother , sisters , perhaps never to return . Isabel , also , felt it hard to part so soon with her new sisters , who hung about her with every demonstration of affection and regret . Then such a scene in the dressing-room ( from which Mrs. Arlington had mercifully contrived to keep Mrs. Arnold . ) Emily , with her head buried in a sofa cushion , weeping passionately at the thought of parting with her brother , while the children all clung around Isabel in such a manner as to make it utterly impossible for her to don her travelling dress ; Lucy trying to comfort Emily , and Grace scolding the children . Ada , taking pity on Isabel , reminded them that Everard was going as well as Isabel , suggesting that they should go down to him . To this they readily agreed . " I ought to go , too , only I 'm afraid Everard will be vexed to see me in such a state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Emily dear , " replied Isabel , " but you had better go down ; you will be sorry afterwards if you do n't . He feels it dreadfully , I know , poor fellow . " " He looked fearfully pale during breakfast , " added Ada , feelingly . " I will go , " returned Emily , vainly endeavoring to check her emotion . And Grace went with her , leaving Isabel with Ada and Lucy . Isabel , who had managed to keep up tolerably well so far , now gave way to uncontrollable emotion . This second scene with the children had been quite too much for her . " Isabel ! Isabel ! you will never be dressed to-day , " cried Ada , in despair . " Oh , let her be , " returned Lucy ; " they will miss the train , and have to wait for the next steamer . What a glorious stew Everard would be in ! for then , of course , they would be too late for that precious Indian ship . Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy ! " and Isabel made quick work with her dressing , to Lucy 's intense amusement . Everard , meanwhile , had been undergoing a terrible ordeal down stairs , and was truly glad when Isabel made her appearance . She was met now with a worse storm of grief than any previously encountered ; as for Amy , she flew into the carriage after her . So they drove off , amid thundering cheers from the young groomsmen . Papa inquired if Amy intended to go to Madagascar , and on Everard 's answering in the affirmative she was wild to get out , protesting that she would not . " But you ca n't get out until we reach the gate , " said Everard . " Promise me , Isabel , dear Isabel , that you will let me out at the gate , " she cried , in an agony ; " pray do n't let me go to nasty Madagascar ; oh , please do n't . " So Everard , seeing that the child was really terrified , stopped the carriage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for any more leave-taking , getting several thumps from the old shoes which were sent in a continued shower after the carriage until it had passed through the gate , when a deafening " tiger " made the welkin ring . * * * * * * * * Here we must bid adieu to those whose fortunes we have followed so far , hoping at some future time to hear more about them . But as we do not care to inquire particularly after Louis Taschereau , we may as well mention here that he , some time after , married a fine high-spirited girl , who was completely his match , the domineering being all on the wife 's side . No tears were shed by her during his absence , and a scornful smile was the utmost that his anger or ill-temper ever elicited . So they managed to get on tolerably well , the inquiring look of the cold grey eye often checking a fit of passion . As Louis 's mercenary propensities have already shown themselves , it is almost needless to add that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which , by the way , she took good care to have settled on herself . But this he did not object to ( albeit she would have done so all the same if he had ) , provided there was plenty of it . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Errata Noted by Transcriber : Since a full list of errors would be almost as long as the novel itself , most are given in tabular form only .
