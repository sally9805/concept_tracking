txt Among our border population , horse-thieving is generally regarded as the worst crime that can be committed  --  a crime in all cases worthy of death . A short shrift and a long cord are tolerably certain in our Western States to be the reward of any unlucky speculator in alien horse-flesh caught in flagrante &lido.; So far , indeed . as punishment is concerned , it is very much safer in certain parts of the country to shoot one 's neighbor than to take a fancy to his stock . Of course , among other reasons for the intense bitterness against this particular species of roguery , are the great importance and value of the animal in an agricultural and thinly-settled district , the comparative ease of robbery , and the difficulty of pursuit or detection . But in proportion as the vigilance and vengeance of the owners grow keener , the boldness and skill of the thieves seem to increase .

In Butler County , it will be remembered , the power of these marauders rose to such a pitch that they actually turned the tables on the vigilants , and in turn lynched the lynchers . We had p. glimpse of similar daring in the ex- ploit of certain Missouri outlaws a few days ago .

Usually , however , these artists are content to achieve their ends rather by finesse than force . And in this they certainly display a degree of enterprise and a fertility of invention which would win them wealth more reputably , if not more honestly , in stocks or commerce .

The apparent legitimacy of every ' part of this transaction made it uncommonly successful . Still more artistic is the latest trick by which an Illinois knave continues to dispossess his fellow-citizens of their choice cattle . He has hit upon the attractive expedient of going about the country in the character of a revivalist . His preaching attracts multitudes , when , while spell-bound by his eloquence , confederates stationed on the outskirts of the camp skillfully relieve the people of their horses and . vehicles .
