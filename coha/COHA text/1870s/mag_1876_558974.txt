ART . IV . - ECONOMIC SCIENCE IN AMERICA , 1776 - 1876 . THE century which has elapsed since our independence was declared exactly covers the period for which the science of political economy has been a systematized branch of human learning and research . Before the publication of Adam Smith 's " Wealth of Nations " in 1776 , we have , indeed , discussions of detached topics , and even attempts here and there to throw the whole into connected form ; but , after all , the economist finds the foundations of the science , as it stands to-day , laid deep and solid for the first time by Adam Smith ; the great men who have since carried fQrward the work have declared themselves his followers , and in developing and extending the science have kept to the lines of discussion which lie laid down with such vigor and insight a century ago . The science which is thus coeval with our nation has been studied with zeal and with Ineasurable success in most parts of tb* civilized world . New principles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , and added to the body of ascertained truths . Unceasing discussion has enforced constant revision of the whole work , with increase of firmness and consistency as the issue of every threatened revolution . The field properly occupied by the science has been surveyed and its limits determined , even to the disappointment of over-ambitious economists or of a too expectant public . No other moral science has equally engaged the attention of public men , and 110 other , it is safe to say , has equally influenced public affairs , whether by the correct or the incorrect application of its principles . Nor has any nation had the monopoly of honors gained in this new pursuit . Adam Smith , Ricardo , and Mill have secured the leading position for England ; but France and Germany , and perhaps Italy , have made contributions of lasting importance to tile subject , and have never been without their full proportion of active and judicious investigators . Notwithstanding the priority of England in some remarkable advances , the centre of interest in economic discussion has not always rested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is now , probably , in Germany . In short , the science has been made a common possession by the efforts of all . When we come to inquire what part our own country has taken , and what contribution it has made in building up this science , we are struck at the outset by the fact that the growth of tho United States has been a circumstance of prime importance in the economic history of the world during the century . It must be placed in the same rank with the brilliant succession of discoveries in the industrial arts , or with the extensive improvement of government and social organization , as one of the half-dozen great influences which have changed the face of the civilized world . Without entering into the details of a comparison , to which every reader is likely to have his attention sufficiently drawn during the present year , we may here note a rew of the facts which have given to the development of this country so great an influence upon that of the rest of the world . Beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Uiiion now occupy a territory larger than the whole of Europe , outside of the iRussian Empire . The improved land of these States , measuring 295,000 square miles in 1870 , can not be much less than the total improved surface of England and Ireland , France and Prussia , together . Of this vast field of production , we may fairly say that the whole has been brought into the circle of international exchanges and added to the available resources of mankind within this century , so insignificant were its relations with the rest of the world a hundred years ago . Moreover , the products to which this territory is adapted by nature are such as have a singularly direct and important bearing on the welfare of other countries . How great an industrial revolution has been wrought by cotton , and what the nineteenth century would be without that fibre , of which we produce more than half of all that comes to the markets of Europe and America , it would be hard to say ; but the memory of our civil war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the interruption of our supply , and what a chain of consequences , involving the well . being , the peace , the institutions , and even liberty of millions of nlen , have followed from the addition of the cotton-plant to // the agricultural products of the South . Of different but hardly inferior significance in the economy of the world is our supply of gold . The astonishing expansion of industry and coinnierce for which the close of the wars of Napoleon seems to have given the signal , which has stimulated and been stimulated by our growth , is one of the great phenomena in the history of mankind . This expansion , however , must have been checked at the most critical period , had not fresh discoveries of gold supplied the enlarged medium of exchange required by the new scale of transactions ; and of this series of discoveries , the second in importance in recorded history , California made one of the chief and also the earliest . From that time the United States have continued to be the first in importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the rest of the world , the influence of our rise as a nation upon the general well-being must be admitted to be direct and powerful in an extraordinary degree . Tobacco , one of our earliest staples for export , has become not only an article of great moment in the revenue systems of several leading nations , but stands in a peculiar relation as one of the few luxuries which enter largely into the consumption of the poorer classes of all countries , thus acquiring , as it were , a social importance far beyond its simple pecuniary value . And of tobacco , the United States are now the leading source of supply for England , France and Germany . To turn from this to petroleum , one of our newest staple articles of export , and now the third or fourth in importance on our list , it may be doubted whether to the majority even the ludicrous incidents of the discovery do not continue to be more familiar than the reflection that by the timely introduction of a cheap and excellent artificial light an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world . And last among those economically important natural products to which we shall refer are the cereals . Our capacity for the supply of these , although of secondary importance in the markets of other countries , has made it possible for us to sustain an increase of population which , for years , has been cited as the standard example of maximum natural growth . This abutidance of cheap food has also made it for our interest , simul // taneously with this rapid natural increase of numbers , to invite from the Old World an immigration on a scale so vast as to constitute in itself an economic phenomenon of no mean order , the result being the relief of the older countries from a serious , if not dangerous , pressure of numbers , by the transfer to our shores of more than nine millions of people , or a number equal to the whole population of Great Britain at the date of our independence . And the population thus established upon our soil , whether native born or of immediate foreign extraction , has proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , has been active and resolute to a fault , in improving all material advantages and in pushing its way to a place among the great powers of the modern world . Mineral resources of remarkable variety , and of extent not even yet fully measured , together with fortunate conditions of physical geography , have sec'onded these efforts and have often enabled us to enter into sharp competition with the longer-established industries of Europe . To excellent natural facilities for communication has been added a railway system of 75,000 miles , being little less than half the railway mileage of the world , and going far to neutralize the disadvantage of great distances , which , in some directions , threatened to hamper our growth . A mercantile marine , which even in its present depressed condition is not far short of the greatest on the ocean , and is of nearly double the magnitu*&amp;6ffts next competitor , helps in part to connect this vast internal network with the general commercial system of the world . So great , however , is the volume of our exchanges with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our own shipping . With the mother-country , especially , our commerce has grown , until it overshadows that of every other nation with whom she carries on a trade either of export or of import . What a growth this has been is shown by the fact that the steam-tonnage now annually cleared for New York alone from the United Kingdom exceeds the total tonnage of ships annually cleared for all parts of the world down to the close of our IRevolution . In the process of development indicated by these few leading facts , the United States , by a natural and steady though rapid movement , have taken among commercial nations a place not // lower than the second , and likely soon to become the first , - the second or first place , it must be remembered , in a changed world , and in a scale of magnitudes hardly comparable with those of 1776 . We have advanced to the front among competitors who were themselves all rapidly advancing . But , with improved facilities for intercourse , the economic ties between countries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading position in commerce now implies a direct connection with the progress of others and with their material well-being , immeasurably closer than has ever existed before . Every fresh conquest over nature made by us belongs to the family of nations also , and every loss suffered by us is also their loss . Infinite mutually dependent interests unite us with Europe and with the very antipodes . Every pulsation in the financial system is felt alike on each side of the Atlantic . A crisis in London has its instant counterpart here , and the great revulsions which periodically sweep over the commercial world may begin , almost as chance may dictate , in New York or in Vienna . The value of the triumphs of material development achieved by the United States is not to be underrated . They represent but one side of human progress , but their influence on interests of a higher order is immediate and powerful . The world can not yet dispense with the stimulus which the search for wealth gives to every science and art , nor forego the support which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions which most elevate and ennoble civilized life . Doubtless Carlyle is right when he says that " America 's battle is yet to fight Their quantity of cotton , dollars , industry , and resources I believe to be almost unspeakable ; but I can by no i*ans worship the like of these . " But these have been one of the great factors in producing whatever of progress and hope the world has gained in our age . If not to be worshipped , they are still not to be despised , for from them comes , as must be admitted , much that is itself worshipful . Even our merely material growth may then fairly be a subject of pride , so long as we remember that it is itself only the means for higher ends . Standing in this relation to the general advance in wealth // which the world has made , it might have been thought in advance that the United States would be prompt in investigating the laws which govern all economic progress . The philo*opher who could have foreseen in 1776 the amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their place as an independent power , might easily have been persuaded that the new science then having its birth and treatii*g of " the nature and causes of the wealth of nations , " would be taken up by this people with especial animation and success . " Here , " he might have said , " is the beginning of an inquiry into the nature and causes of that which will chiefly occupy the new nation . Others in their maturity or decadence may prosecute this inquiry in the hope of discovering the means of escape from impending evil ; this people will pursue it with the enthusiasm of strengthening youth . Success in this investigation and a wise application of its results will account for the splendid triumphs in the acquisition of material wealth , which are to distinguish the first century of independent national life . " How far the imagined anticipations of our philosopher have been verified , and the reason for their failure so far as they may be found to have failed , is the object of the . review on which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Revolution found the study of economic science in this country is *we1l exemplified by the writings of Franklin . Of all our public men of that period he was the one whom we should perhaps most naturally expect to find dealing with this class of subjects , and , if not profoundly investigating the causes of phenomena , at least deriving from observation and reflection sound and consistent rules for practical guidance . His *ctivity in the political discussions of more than half a century , and his natural fondness for every inquiry respecting material well-being , seem to mark him out as the American who must deal with political economy if any one did , and the one who could rise to the level of the national thought in economic g speculation , if he did not soar much beyond it . Franklin wrote upon topics of this class from his twenty-third year , and probably wrote as well in his twenty-third year as he ever did . The questions of currency then raised in every Colony by the // paper issues of the colonial governments- he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support which he gave to issues of that kind rests on no well-defined systematic body of opinions ; indeed , his discussion of the continental currency , in some of his letters , raises questions as to his clearness of perception in morals as well as in political economy . He is quoted with admiration by writers of the protec*-tiQnist school , and he might equally well be quoted by their opponents . He was in fact a man of expedients rather than principles , often sagacious in dealing with immediately practical questions , but satisfied with the crudest speculations as to the operation of causes in any degree remote . His economic writings were edited for Mr. Sparks 's collection of his works by the late Judge Phillips , himself an economist of no mean capacity ; and the annotations of the editor afford ample evidence that he found it no easy task to present with respectful comment and due admiration the mass of ill-digested reasoning placed in his hands . That Franklin read much of the writings of others on questions of political economy is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations " is cited in a paper on the increase of wages in Europe likely to be caused by the American Revolution , written shortly after 1780 , when Franklin was abroad ; but the citation is made to settle a fact , and not to further the discussion or elucidation of a principle . Of Franklin then it must be said , that lie not only did not advance the growth of economic science , but that lie seems not even to have mastered it as it was already developed ; and little more can be said for any of our public men or writers during the period of Franklin 's activity . We find no one well versed in ecoiiomic theory and entering upon speculative inquiries of real value until we come to Alexander Hamilton . That great man , whose remarkable career was finished at the point when most men are just ready for action , was a reader and inquirer in political economy in his twentieth year . In his twenty-fifth year , in such leisure as the camp of the Revolution afforded , he matured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a correspondent of Morris on that subject . And , finally , at the age of thirty-four , he produced , // as Secretary of the Treasury , his great reports on the Public Credit , on a National Bank , and on Manufactures , the most powerful and comprehensive discussion of the national finances ever made under our government , and the subject , it may be remembered , of one of Mr. Webster 's noblest periods . Those reports bear the evidence throughout of much reading and reflection upon the experience of nations , and of careful meditation on the speculations and theories of previous writers . Examination of the report on Manufactures , in particular , will show that in some parts of it , in his selection of topics and even in the order in which they are marshalled , Hamilton was influenced by his familiarity with Adam Smith . The writings of the French economists were probably known to him at this time , as they certainly were a few years later , and some of the doctrines of this school , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful refutation . Both the knowledge of economic questions and the power of dealing with them exhibited by Hamilton in these discussions warrant us in setting him down as a writer who , under other conditions and freed from the pressure of public business , might have been expected to make some positive contribution to the development of economic theory . But his few crowded . years left him little opportunity for such pursuits , and it would now be hard to say that he left any impression on the thought of the world , by his dealing with this subject . His reports have continued to be the arsenal from which the advocates of special measures have again and again drawn forth weapons now well worn ; but systematic political economy can not be said to owe to him any recognized principle , any discovery in method , or indeed any influence save the stimulus which his example must always afford to the ' student of financial history . If Hamilton did not permanently influence the economic thought of the world , there is certainly no other statesman of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among Hamilton 's great contemporaries none followed the discussions of the new science with more interest than Jefferson and Madison ; but neither of these statesmen was comparable to Hamilton in his mastery of the subject . Jefferson had that fondness for it which he had for all philosophical // speculation , kept himself informed as to all new publications abroad , was instrumental in bringing some of these before the American public , and corresponded with some of the leading French economists of his day ; but in his own discussions of economic questions it is difficult to find any firm ground of logical principle , and impossible to find any addition to what had been previously ascertained and better comprehended by others . Madison , with interests less diffuse than Jefferson 's , had a much firmer hold upon this subject . He appears to have followed its current literature with close attention , and to have reflected upon principles and to have applied them , with great although not uniform force , in his reasoning upon public questions . It is interesting to find Madison - and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doctrines of Malthus on population , and defending them by arguments from the experience of the United States . But Madison could make as little pretension as Jefferson to having added any results of original investigation to the work of others . His merit was not as an economist , but as a statesman who conscientiously prepared himself for the duties of public life by following this necessary branch of a statesman 's studies . Of the other public men of this early period of our history we need mention only Robert Morris and Gallatin ; and of these eminent practical financiers the latter only has any claim to notice in connection with scientific theory . The memorial drawn up by him and presented to Congress , in 1832 , from the Philadelphia Convention in favor of tariff reform , is a full and strong statement of the arguments against protection , and exhibits familiarity with the results of theoretical discussion , as well as with the practical side of the question ; but the complete oblivion which now covers the document shows how narrow and temporary is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Currency and Banking System " is also a comprehensive and sound discussion of these topics , but has ceased to be much referred to , except for historicaV purposes . Of the great men of the next generation , Mr. Calhoun was doubtless well qualified by nature for this field of investigation , and displayed a strong inclination to enter upon it ; but , unhappily , every mental power and every pursuit at last became // subservient with him to a narrow sectionalism , which finally frustrated all hope of sound fruit from a laborious life . The electric power with which Mr. Clay acted upon the emotions of men was not coupled with any special capacity for the research of principles ; and while his name is iiiseparably connected with the " American system , " his argumentative defence of that system is practically forgotten , - so much easier was it for him to give vogue to an effective name , than to give a scientific basis to the thing itself Mr. Webster discussed with great power many questions involving general principles , of political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundations of the science . Indeed , in one of his letters he says : " I give up what is called the science of political economy . ' . . . I believe I have recently run over twenty volumes , from Adam Smith to Professor Dew , of Virginia ; and from the whole , if I were to pick out with one hand all the mere truisms , and with the other all the doubtful propositions , little would be left . " Whatever else may be said of this passage , it absolves us from the necessity of further explanation of Mr. Webster 's failure to contribute to the world 's advancemerit in economic science . Of the contemporaries of these three great men , the other champions on whose words listening senates once hung , in the fierce contest over tariff and bank , no name can now be recalled as having any claim to connection with the development of the science of which we speak . Lowudes , Crawford , Wright , Berrien , MeDufile , Bentori , and the others may yet shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political science . And if we examine the roll of statesmen of the generation which closes our century* what better success is met ? We find , indeed , the names of some men who have skilfully managed interests of vast magnitude , and of others , not in great number , who have shown a competent scientific knowledge ; but we may safely challenge the mention of one who has added to the stock of economic principles with which the world was already acquainted , or has given any essential assistance in their elucidation . As a class our public men have confined themselves , like Franklin , to the sagacious application of rules of thumb . So far as they have dealt with the science at all , ' it // has been made for them by others ; they have not aided in making it . Indeed , the promise held out by hamilton 's great example , of the thorough examination of questions in the light of ascertained principles , has seldom been fulfilled , even by our highest officers of administration . Few things , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the extreme fragility and brevity of the reputations acquired , either in administration or in legislation , by most of our public men who have assumed to deal with this class of subjects . . If we turn from the statesmen to the scholars of the United States , the result is not more satisfactory . Down to the year 1820 no American produced any treatise on political economy which the world has cared to remember . Such books of that period as come to light , upon industrious search in forgotten corners , are crude , unsystematic , full of empirical notions , and are now intellectually obsolete . The philosophical study of the subject , to which Adam Smith gave an impulse abroad , was , in fact , late in making any public appearance on this side of the Atlantic . The increasing interest in it is shown by three editions of the " Wealth of Nations " ( Philadelphia , 1789 ; Hartford , 1811 ; ibid. , 1818 ) , and by the reprinting of IRicardo 's great work ( Georgetown , 1819 ) only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that on the other side of the Atlantic this period was marked by the appearance of works so important , and in some cases of such lasting influence , as those of Malthus , Say , Ricardo , and Sismnondi , the poverty of American thought upon the subject is striking , even if we allow , as we must , for the infancy of the country and the consequent small number of its literary class , in the twenty years which followed the period of which we have just spoken , a tolerably rapid succession of treatises by American authors was given to the public . Raymond ( 1820 ) brought to the discussion zeal and ingenuity , but such looseness of method and want of precision of ideas as to defeat his efforts and de stroy the value of his work , - which , indeed , from its confusion of definition and want of system , seems a late growth of the generation which preceded Smith , rather than one of that which followed him . Alexander H. Everett , fresh from the influences of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the leading economists of the world , published ( 1822 ) an answer to the essay of Malthus on Population , which holds a place among the best of the many attempts made in this direction ; but his dialectic skill was not able even to supply the opponents of the Malthusian doctrine with a common standing ground , and still less to prevent the doctrine from being accepted in its essentials by the great majority of economists who have followed , and eveti by many who imagine that they reject it . Dr. Cooper , of South Carolina , issued a treatise ( 1826 ) , of which McCnlloch says that , " though not written in a very philosophical spirit , it is the best of the American works on political economy that we have met with , " - an encomium measured with judicious care . Dr. Cooper 's chief success , in fact , was in reproducing in systematic form the results attained by the English economists , with whose works he was well acquainted ; but he did nothing itt original speculation . Willard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating the whole structure of Malthus and Ricardo as unsound , he sought to take up the subject where Adam Smith had left it . He treated it with an abundant knowledge of commercial and industrial facts , and with a mind well trained for speculative inquiry ; but it was complained , even by a friendly contemporary critic , that he reared nothing in place of that which he sought to remove . Rae 's book ( 1834 ) has been pronounced by high authority to be a valuable discussiGn of the subject of production ; but as the work of a Scotchman settled in Canad'a , and originally intended for publication abroad , we can hardly count it as an American contribution . President Wayland 's book ( 1837 ) is the only general treatise of the period which can fairly be said to have survived to our day ; and this , it must be admitted , owes whatever value it has to its manner of presenting for easy comprehension some of the leading English doctrines , - of which , however , it ' may be doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treatise ( 1838 ) is now little known , its more valuable portion having served its purpose , like the works of Cooper and Waylaud , of bringing before our public some of the results , at that time unfamiliar , which had been reached by writers not then well understood in this coui*try . Other // writers of this period , like Dew , Newman , Tucker , and Potter , can be dismissed even more summarily , so transient was their influence , and so completely forgotten are their works . The years which followed from 1840 down to the war for the Union were for natural reasons much less prolific of works on political economy than the period just noticed . The stimulus given to the study of the science by the extraordinary advances made in it by the great English investigators had ceased to be active ; questions of currency , as we shall presently see , had fallen into a subordinate rank ; the tariff question , after a furious party struggle in which all considerations of political science were lost sight of , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to fill all minds , to the exclusion of every other public question . A few text-hooks appeared , recasting familiar material ; as , for example , the well-known treatise of Professor Bowen ( 1856 ) , in which he threw into connected form a long series of articles and lectures produced by him in the preceding ten years , and Bascom 's convenient r*8um6 of economic theory ( t859 ) . To these we must add Stephen CoIwell 's work on " The Ways and Means of Payment " ( 1859 ) , the production of an author who had few equals as regards his acquaintance with economic literature , but who in this , his chief work , appears to have been led into unprofitable subtleties , which have failed to influence appreciably the opinions or studies of others . Beyond these works , however ,  --  and omitting for the present a writer whom we must notice more at length further on , - our literature now has little to show in this department except pamphlets and occasional essays of limited interest , for the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring in our own country . In the period which includes and follows the war we have a few works like that of the late Amasa Walker ( 1866 ) , with its earnest but not always conclusive discussions of currency , and the vigorous treatise by Professor Perry ( 1866 ) , - both designed for use as manuals , and claiming but little attention as statements of original thought . In general it must be said of the last ten years , that while they have witnessed a marked and salutary revival of interest in economic discussion , the // most absorbing questions which have caused this revival have been quite too rudimentary to lead to fresh development of principle . Whether we shall have more paper , or shall return to specie , are questions calling not for research so much as for skill and force in rhetorical treatment , which may carry axiomatic truths into unwilling or otherwise unreceptive minds . It is true that the question whether our fiscal policy should look to continued protection or to ultimate freedom of trade involves more really controversial matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the question of currency , that it neither has produced nor seems to us likely to produce for some time to come any marked originality of investigation . It might perhaps have been enough for our purpose , if , instead of passing in review this series of American writers on political economy , we had simply called attention to the fact that , with few exceptions , the works produced in the United States have been prepared as text-books by authors engaged in college instruction , and therefore chiefly interested in bringing principles previously worked out by others within the easy comprehension of undergraduate students . The success with which this work has often been done and its value , we shall not question ; but clearly it is not by such means that discoveries in abstract science are likely to be made or to be announced to the world . It should occasion no surprise , therefore , that of the considerable list of American writers on the subject , so few have produced any impression out of our own country , or have been able even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only has no American school of writers on political economy been established , if we except that which we are about to notice , but no recognized contribution to the development of the science can be poilited out in any way comparable to those made by the French writers , or to those which the Germans are now making . The writer to whom we have referred as offering in some respects a possible exception to these general remarks is Mr. Henry C. Carey . It can not be said that Mr. Carey has not engaged attention outside of his own country , for his works have been translated and circulated in nearly every important // language of Europe , and Mr. Mill on several occasions pays him the distinguished tribute of singling him out in an especial manner from a throng of opponents . Nor can it be said that he has won his place by following others , for his system aims at nothing less than revolution in the leading doctrines of political economy , and he certainly bids fair to stand next to Malthus and Ricardo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained as the result of a long and laborious career as a writer . Mr. Carey 's first publication , in which he appears as an advocate of free-trade , with an economic theory based on a new doctrine of value , dates from 1835 . His denial of Ricardo 's doctrine as to the law of production from land and his conversion to the theory of protection followed a *dozen years later . The final elab6ration of his system in opposition to what he is fond of calling the British school appeared ten years later still , in 1858 ; and hardly a year has passed since without some addition to the long line of his works on this class of subjects . This series of publications has had a distinct and not inconsiderable effect . Bastiat not only borrowed Carey 's law of value and presented it in a brilliant paraphrase , but seems to show Carey 's influence throughout his eager search for harmonies in the economic world . In Germany , where the way was no doubt prepared for him by the labors of Frederic List , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose numbers are explained by Dr. Diihring of Berlin , the most active German writer of this school , by pointing to the American author 's early sympathy with the Germans and his prediction of their intellectual leadership of the world ; although a more substantial ground of explanation might be found perhaps in his more than German readiness to refer to the co-ordinating power of the state , as a specific for social or economic discords . But while we may admit that the system elaborated by our countryman is likely to be , as Diihring says , " a ferment of the strongest kind " in the discussions of this generation , we must not forget that to lead a school is not necessarily making a contribution to the science . Not much of Mr. Carey 's work , we are confident , will be found wrought into the political economy of the future . His doctrine of value gives epigramnmatic // form to some important general truths , but does not sn*ersede the usual conception of value as the ratio of exchange or . purchasing power of commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conception in dealing with a wide range of questions , both theoretical and practical . His doctrine as to the law of production from land , which is presented in fundamental contradiction of the English school , is chiefly a statement as to historical development , which does not touch the essential point of Ricardo 's theory ; and while he denies the whole of that theory and the law of Malthus as to increase of population , his reliance upon a conjectured physiological law as an ultimate limit to the increase of numbers , shows the difficulty which he has found in avoiding as a logical conclusion the tendency to increasing pi ' *ssure upon the means of subsistence pointed out by those writers . And it is upon his speculations as to value , production from land , and population that , as we apprehend , his claims to be regarded as a permanent contributor to the science would be rested ,  --  not upon his later discussions of protection , the major part of which follows from the three lines of speculation just named , nor upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be disputed by a series of writers , from John Law down . That Mr. Carey , by his ardent attack , compels a wholesome revision of positions and arguments there is no question ; that he has checked some incautious generalizing we have no doubt ; but that he has overturned any previously accepted principle of leading importance , still more that he has established any new and valuable principle originated by himself , is a claim which , in our judgment , cann6t be made good . In thus recognizing Mr. Carey 's position as a writer of exceptional importance , we are confirmed by observing that he is the only American author noticed by Dr. IRoscher in his exhaustive History of National Economy in Germany . But it must be admitted , we think , that Mr. Carey 's following , in our own country , has had a more local character than might have been expected from his wide reputation . The work of E. Peshine Smith ( 1868 ) , Dr. William Elder 's " Questions of the Day " ( 1871 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are representative , not only of the views of his school , // but almost of its geographical limits in the United States . The conclusion at which we have arrived , however , as to Mr. Carey 's own position with respect to the development of economic science , frees us from the necessity of considering more particularly those writers who have followed but have not advanced beyond him. * The general result then to which , as we believe , a sober examination of the case must lead any candid inquirer , is , that the United States have , thus far , done nothing towards developing the theory of political economy , notwithstanding their vast and immediate interest in its practical applications . It is not an agreeable duty to declare a conclusion so little flattering to patriotic sentiment ; but to arrive at it as a truth forced upon the mind by the history of economic science is still less agreeable . And what explanation , it will be asked , is to be given for a failure apparently so much at variance with what our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the growth of intellectual activity among us , might lead the inquirer to expect ? The answer to this question will be easier , if we briefly consider the circumstances under which one of the leading public questions having an economic bearing has been discussed and acted upon in this country . The question of paper currency , when it first came before the people of the United States for settlement under the present Constitution , in 1790 - 91 , was already complicated in a manner which made its thorough investigation doubtrul . Whether such paper should be issued at all , whether it should be regulated by the general government or the States , and whether the proposed national bank should control the paper issues of the country , or should be content with simply pouring its own into the general mass , were questions the decision of which was in a manner forestalled by the existence of banks of issue established several years before under State * It is impossible to make any serious mention of Mr. Greeley as a writer on political economy , although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parey 's school .

And the approach to the fundamental question as to bank paper was still further embarrassed by the political turn which the discussion took in its early stages . The advocates of a liberal construction of the Constitution , and those of a strict construction , arrayed their forces for battle over this question as soon as it appeared . Nothing , indeed , could be more natural ; but nothing could be more unfortunate for the proper settlement of an economic problem . All scientific questions were made subordinate to the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the national government too strong were committed in advance in opposition to a measure which for them was part of a general political system , and in large sections of the country hostility to the bank became hostility to banking . And the division of opinion upon this line , rather than upon abstract principle , was promoted by the supposed opposition of interests between the commercial States and the agricultural . Of thirty-nine votes for the bill chartering the first Bank of the United States , all but six were from States north of the Maryland line ; of the twenty votes against the bill , all but one were from States south of that line . How far the political side of the question of banking overshadowed the scientific is clear from the manner in which it was discussed by Mr. Jefferson , from whom one of the great parties took its tone for years . That statesman 's treatment of the question of currency , and , indeed , of other economic questions of which the relations happened to be political , would to-day be universally recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . His intense democracy , and his extreme dread of any proposition based on English models or English opinions , incapacitated him for any genuine discussion of this subject in its larger aspects . And to what length the ignorant bigotry of many of his followers carried the hostility to banks , which was instinctive with him , the political history of our first half-century amply testifies . The prudence and good judgment with which the first Bank of the United States was conducted are now seldom questioned ; and the real service which it rendered , in its twenty years of existence , towards giving a stable foundation for our // finances , at a time when the State banks and their issues were in actual chaos , is not more doubtful . But the Bank owed its existence to the Federal party , and with the downfall of that party the renewal of its charter became impossible . Late in the War of 1812 , an empty treasury brought the government of the day to the support of a new bank charter , as an expedient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adinonition , can not give the means of supporting an expensive war . " They are useful to the state in their proper place and sphere , but they are not sources of national income . The streams of revenue must flow from deeper fountains . " But so urgent was the demand for a bank , on grounds of merely temporary policy , that Mr. Madison , who had opposed the charter of the first Bank of the United States , vetoed , as dilatory , one bill chartering the new bank , because it required the institution to begin on the basis of specie payments ! Happily , the return of peace settled this weighty question for us , and the secoiid Bank of the United States was chartered , to begin as a specie-paying bank , on the first day of January , 1817 . But whatever influence the new Bank of the United States might have had in directing the pul4ic mind to broader views of the question of currency , had it been left to itself and had its management continued to be sound , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Political hostility was excited against it , and , six years before the expiration of its charter , war was formally declared against it by President Jackson . We , of the present generation , are in some respects losers from the total and probably final disappearance of that personal loyalty to great leaders , which marked our politics forty years ago and gave to them a glow of generous enthusiasm ; but in some respects we are also gainers . The overwhelming individuality of one man is not likely again to convert a high question of economic policy into a mere struggle between " Jackson and the Bank , " in which the rival clamors of personal adherents and personal foes shall drown all considerations of scientific or political principle . Such , however , was the ignoble character of the contest which led to the final overthrow of the second Bank of the United States . The financial revulsion which followed . that contest , and was // in part its natural consequence , established for years in the minds of a great political party the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that paper currency of any sort is sure to work ruin . Under the domination of this party the general government in 1846 made specie its only currency , and left the paper , the currency of the people in three quarters of the States , to take care of itself . That this measure for the protection of the treasury was judicious , supposing it to be settled that the paper was to remain free from all control , few are now disposed to deny ; but it involved an abdication of power over the part of the circulation which was of immediate importance to the mass of the community , and a confession of the insolubility of a great public question , which hardly has its parallel . The effect produced on our statesmen by thus drawing a line which left this whole subject in the exclusive province of State legislation , was disastrous . From 1846 to 1862 the study or discussion of currency and finance formed no part of the training of men for national politics . In the legislatures of the States questions of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by those who were only anxious to make their mark and go up into a broader field ; but they had ceased to be national questions which could repay the political aspirants to national office for any considerable expenditure of time or thought . Congress had nothing to do with the currency , except to settle the weight and fineness of the coin , and government finance resolved itself into paying all demands in gold from a treasury which generally overflowed , and borrowing upon easy credit in any exceptional case of difficulty . It is not surprising that , when the war for the Union compelled the government to deal comprehensively and at short notice with questions of finance and currency in their most threatening form and on a gigantic scale , we had no leading man in public life who could speak upon them authoritatively or command general attention . The bald confessions of unfamiliarity with what had become the vital topics of the hour are a humiliating part of the record ; but what other outcome from our public history was possible ? We need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in // season to avert the ruin with which the gross violation of the plainest economic principles threatened the nation , and the task of repairing the mischief and returning to specie was set before us . For eight years , however , it waa overshadowed by the business of Southern reconstruction , and was habitually treated by men in public life as a topic of the second order , which could wait for settlement at a more convenient season , and as to which perhaps one need not yet make up his mind . The finaiicial catastrophe of 1873 suddenly brought the currency question to the front , as one which must be answered if we would secure the return of stable prosperity ; and the number of men , either in legislative or in executive position , who were then able to show that they had fairly investigated it and thought it out in the light of scientific principles , might almost be counted upon the fingers . The discussions which followed showed that the mass of public men were dealing with it , either with the audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conscious . The published debates exhibit our Congress for two sessions laboring painfully with sophisms which other countries disposed of half a century ago , and finally resorting to action which fails to be mischievous only because it has thus far been nugatory . The majority still drift upon the sea of doubt , without compass and without any directing impulse save such as may come from the veering gusts of popular feeling ; and it is with this as the prevailing condition of opinion among the majority of our most conspicuous leaders on both sides , that we finish the first century of our national existence . But that our statesmen have been incapable of taking any consistent action upon the currency question , and that every material interest is thus placed at the mercy of chance , is not , to our mind , the most serious evil resulting from this state of things . What appears to us most threatening is the sceptical turn thus given to opinion among the mass of our people . What is the ordinary voter to think of a subject which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion he is apt to follow either talk antiquated nonsense to him , or tell him that nothing is settled ? Add to this the fact that one half of the present political generation have come upon the stage since we abandoned specie , and have had no other experience to enlighten // them , and we can not wonder that the currency seems to the mass a subject on which mankind have learned nothing , and that the plainest proposition of reason confirmed by history may any day be talked about as " an opeim question . " The scepticism of searching inquiry is not to be feared ; but the incredulity of ignorance multiplies tenfold the difficulty of the task of restoring the financial health of the nation . In the case of the currency question , then , it appears that the subject from the first came before our public men in a form which seemed to make its political bearings too importaPt to be subordinated to any scientific treatment . The same might be said of the tariff discussion , which , apart from its inevitable complication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in such sectional or party relations as to make its settlement turn largely upon far other considerations than those of general principle . Whether this complication has been the result of some untoward chance , or has come from the errors of our statesmen themselves , we need not now inquire ; in either case the effect is the same . Under our form of government these two questions of currency and tariff cover most of the space within which those charged with national affairs have been called upon to investigate and apply economic laws . No doubt , important topics lie within the domain of State legislation ; but there the adoption of any general theory , however sound , has been impracticable from the nature of the case . It is a part of the price which we necessarily pay for the advantages of our federal system , that under it questions of essentially general interest , such as those of taxation , education , or poor-relief ; are classed as merely local , and are therefore not subject to any one controlling authority . With the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inextricably bound up with other issues , it is hardly surprising that our statesmen should have neglected the investigation of this subject , so that it is to-day easier to find well-read economists among our men of business than among public mcii of equally good general education , although the inducement to such pursuits should not properly be any stronger in one case than in the other . It is necessary , however , to look deeper than this for the // reason of the general sterility of American thought upon this subject , and the failure of our scholars as well as statesmen to contribute their share in the progress made l ) y the world . For the explanation of this we must look to the causes which have made the progress of the United States so slow in philosophy , in the pure mathematics , and in abstract science generally , in philology , in the more recondite historical investigations , and in the higher generalizations in physics . Our position as a nation charged with the business of subduing a new world , and the rapid material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given to our life for the greater part of the century an intensely practical aspect . Practical objects , and puPsuits which are believed to be practical , have occupied the first place , almost as a necessity of our external condtions . It has been well remarked that some of our best achievements in natural science have been in those directions in which the promise of some material gain has afforded the stimulus ,  --  as , for example , in economic geology , to which so powe*rful an impulse has been given by our eagerness to know the resources offered by our vast territory . Under such an influence as this it is but natural that the moral sciences should develop slowly . Nor could we expect that among these sciences political economy should outstrip the others . Broad as are its applications in the actual affairs of life , it is mastered and fruitfully studied best as an abstract inquiry . The thorough student soon finds that it is necessarily an investigation as to the direction which human volitions will take under given conditions , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mind itself , finding in the complex phenomena of society the test but not the grounds for his conclusions . Especially has this been the necessary character of the study during the last century , , while the work to be done was that of de*ermining the fundamental principles of the science . Such a pursuit , at any rate in the stage from which it has hardly yet emerged , must needs appear remote from the present interests of a nation like Ours , and could not offer an attractive field for scholars under the influence of a young and vigorous national life . Thus it has happened that not a few of our inquirers have either been unwilling to recognize this essentially abstract // character of ' the investigation , and so have vainly sought to remodel the science , or else have strained its conclusions by the attempt to give them a practical bearing in advance of what their development would allow . In either case the wrong road has been taken , and the result has been failure and disappointment . J.Ience , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a peculiarly national economy under any name , ending in nothing but fresh proof of the impos*ibility of stating the application of any scientific law under special conditions , until the nature of the law has first been thoroughly investigated , abstraction being made of all accidents of time , place , or disturbing influences . Indeed , the strongly practical direction given to every pursuit in American life has not only served to turmi our statesmen and scholars away from work in the field of political economy , hut has also given a marked character to such work as they have done in that field . In the application of settled or accepted principles to special questions , particularly to questions of importance in politics , many of our writers have shown great skill . Examples of this kind of success in a narrowed field of definite practical relations may be found in the writings of Hamilton and Gallatin already referred to , in Henry Lee 's report written in 1827 for the Boston committee in opposition to an increase of duties , in the valuable reports of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strong presentation of the protectionist argument , and in Grosvenor 's application of the crucial test , " Does Protection Protect ? " It is hardly too much to say that our best work is to be found in our pamphlets and occasional essays , and not in our systematic treatises , so powerful has been the stimulus of practical objects , and so weak the inducements to abstract philosophical inquiry . To the same influence must we ascribe the exceptional success sometimes attained in statistical inquiry , from the famous report of John Quincy Adams in 1821 on weights and measures , to some important discussions by Dr. Jarvis , and the admirable work done by General Walker on the census of 1870 . The fact must be *taken into account , moreover , that deficiency in our comprehension of scientific reasoning and conclusions // is perhaps less readily realized in political economy than in any other science . That its vocabulary is drawn from the language of popular discourse , and is therefore peculiarly liable to equivocal use and consequent vitiation of the whole process of reasoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of misconception and error among economists themselves , but causes those who are unfamiliar with the st*hject to think that they have mastered its terms long before they can fairly claim any such mastery . The conceptions with which political economy deals are also sul ) jects of every-day contemplation , on which every one must needs reason more or less , and as to the bearing of which in their broad scientific relations self-deception is peculiarly easy . The senator who calmly announced a couple of years ago that he had given his leisure for an entire fortnight to the currency question , and had thus been enabled to sound its depths , preFented , after all , only an egregious type of the difficulty with which in this subject one acquires the knowledge that he knows nothing . This does not spring from any peculiar obscurity to be found in the subject itself , but from the fact that in dealing with it the mind is apt to begin with the tendency to misapprehension to which we have referred , which must first be overcome ; just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed ability of every man to determine its falsity by the seeming evidence of his own eves . And while this is not a peculiarity of the study of political economy in our own country or , our own language , but everywhere impedes its progress , it is easy to see that , among a people who are predisposed to neglect , or to examine only superficially , whatever does not offer directly practical results , a science which under the most favorable circumstances is subject to such embarrassment , must lend itself with especial readiness to the prevailing disposition . Americans are disposed to neglect the higher mathematics as unpractical ; but they do not imagine that they understand t'he subject . Political economy they are disposed to neglect for the same reason , and all the more because they flatter themselves that they already have it at command . The failure of the American mind to aid in the development of political economy is not then necessarily the result of any // lack of original adaptation , hut a natural effect of our environ* ment . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neglect of the science , they have also led our people , scholars as well as others , into some serious misconceptions as to the direct bearing of economic laws . From our holding the position , unique among the great powers , of a people developing a rich and virgin territory , the conclusion often seems to be drawn that if the operation of such laws be not actually suspended in the United States , they can at any rate be disregarded with comparative safety . Few men outside of Congress or off the political stump will maintain the absurdity that for a new country like ours there is a different set of such laws from those which obtain in the Old World ; but there is an unquestionably great amount of mischief done by the knowledge that the lusty growth of the nation will repair the injuries caused by economic blunders . Whatever follies our statesmen commit , the bounty of nature and the rapid increase of numbers incident to this stage of our growth soon cure the evil ; its traces are soon overgrown , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not richer and our States more populous than ever ? " it is asked ; " how then can we be said to have lost ? " And it is not surprising that the sense of risk to be incurred by the mistakes of ignorance shoMd be weakened , when it is found by experience that few such mistakes can bring our national expansion to an actual stop . " Where the concerns of a nation are conducted in a deep , strong , favorable current of the national energies and impulses , " writes a critic in this Review of the last generation , " progress may be made , notwithstanding the mismanagement of the sails , oars , and rudder . This is precisely and pre-eminently the case in the United States , where the spontaneous , productive , onward energies are in greater activity than in any other country . " The idea thus frankly avowed , that the management of our resources is of little account , so long as we find ourselves sweeping along with the current of growth , has been for years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of their faith . That it easily leads to indifference as to the monitions of economic law is sufficiently obvious . How complete our disregard of economic law has been , and // how little we owe our brilliant advance in wealth and power to the wisdom with which we have used our fortunate position , may easily be seen . The manner in which the currency , the life-blood of industrial ciPculation , has from the first been left practically to shift for itself has already been noticed . As a consequence there is no evil incident to a vicious currency , from the inability to procure the means of exchange for daily transactions on the one hand , to the wildest abuse of depreciated paper on the other , to which our body politic has not bceii 8u1 ) jected . And that the vigor of youth has enabled it to survive such disorders and even to recover its thriving condition has only seemed to give fresh encouragement to rash experiments on its endurance . In the matter of protection to manufactures neither protectionist nor free-trader would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in fact neither has been able to secure adherence to his system . Six radical changes of our customs tariff , six reversals of policy , have occurred in the last sixty years . The present tariff , dating from 1861 , already approaches the extreme of longevity , and , if we may judge from the past , must soon foh1o*v its predecessors , each of whom once appeared as strong and as firmly established as itself . In these successive revolutions we have seen industi*ies artificially excited to a premature and tinhealthy activity , and we have seen them laid waste by the withdrawal of the stimulus . Who can measure the misdirected labor , the destroyed capital , to repair which we have fallen back after pach change of tariff upon those natural resources which no folly of management could exhaust ! If we turn from the tariff to our internal taxation , where the adoption of sound principles has rarely been embarrassed by sectional or political considerations , the state of things is still more extraordinary . Down to the year 1861 the United States appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were generally too light to cause serious uneasiness , except in some cities , and the average legislature is tolerably well steeled against the complaints of city interests . Since the year 1861 the rapid increase of taxes in every form has attracted the attention of our people , but they are not yet sensible that their methods of taxation are antiquated and the machinery ineffi // dent , that their systems lead to extraordinary inequalities , and often rest upon theories which fail of being ridiculous only because of their flagrant injustice . Ingenuity in preventing the cscape of any taxable person or thing has been carried to a high point ; the art of adjusting the burden so that it may he most easily borne has never been studied by any State legislature or by Congress . That our people have been able to endure this neglect of one of the first duties of good government , is due solely to the abundance of their resources , which for the present are al ) le to withstand the effects of such waste by taxation as , in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . Here , again , we rely for impunity on the rude health of youth . And as a final illustration of our easygoing defiance of sound principle , we may cite the continuance of slavery as the industrial system of the Southern States , until its unexpected destruction by war . Nothing can be more cci ' - tam than that slavery was an economic blunder of the first magnitude . It notoriously stunted the social development of the communities where it existed , checked all tendency to diversification of employments by discouraging all pursuits except those least advanced , and craved for its successful working constant transfer of its exhausting cultivation to fresh soil . Leaving out of view its moral aspect , there can be no doubt that slavery , economically considered , was the most efficient system yet seen for simply taking the cream from productive powers , which under wise management are of unlimited duration . What this perseverance in a wasteful use of our resources has cost us , directly and indirectly , may be partly seen by comparing the splendid natural advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may doubtless be said that we are not the only people who in the past century have committed errors of this kind and on a great scale . But we are the only people who with a light heart have trusted to the ' energy of growth to insure us against the effects of present mistake , and have therefore steadily neglected to cultivate one of the most important branches of the s*ience of government . As a consequence , we find ourselves to-day absolutely incapable of following out , for example , such a firm and judicious course of management // as that by which France is re-establishing her finances on a solid basis , after a calamity in which all but the name of the French nation seemed to have disappeared . Not forced like others to count closely with our resources , we have in effect forgotten how to count with them at all , and are every day confessing our inability to deal with a practical problem , which has been promptly answered by others far less favored , either in material or in political conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added nothing to the world 's knowledge of political economy is not surprising . The surroundings have not been incompatible with the prosecution of such a study , but they have not been such as to promote it . For that purpose something more is needed than the mere presence of great resources and of rapidly increasing wealth . The profound significance of the investigation as bearing upon the right use of resources must be realized , as it has not been among us , before we can expect that it will be pursued with much effect . Elsewhere this lesson has been impressed upon statesmen and scholars by the sternness of nature or the approach to the limits of her bounty , or by the necessity of dealing with the consequences of generations of misrule . But it is a lesson no more easily learned by a nation in the full luxuriance and strength of its early growth , than is that of obedience to the laws of physical health in the first flush of youth . As the result of our failure to reckon closely with forces which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of our first century , falling manifestly short of the development to which our exuberant vitality might easily have carried us . In every case it was with seeming impunity that we offended against the laws of our well-being ; but as the consequence of the whole , our statisticians are now accounting for missing millions of population , and for the slackening of the growth of wealth . The youth to which we owe our power of ready recovery from the effects of all transgressions is also passing away , and it is with a sort of angry surprise that our people note their increasing sensitiveness to the penalties with which economic error is visited . This leads us to the remark , in conclusion , that most of the conditions to which we have ascribed // the failure of the United States to contribute to the progress of political economy , being incident to the earlier stages of national life , may henceforth be expected to act with diminishing force . The period of the most rapid development of wealth once passed , we may expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be such , to become less absorbing , and the tendency to enter upon deeper and more abstract investigations to strengthen . Already in our older States , which are farthest removed from the special conditions which characterize the United States as a whole , we may trace the first effects of this tendency , in their increased devotion to that sound learning and the arts for which the newer States , still in the hurry of swift growth , seem to have little leisure . As this movement strengthens , we may expect to see the moral sciences generally rising towards that proportionate development with respect to physical science which obtains in older countries , and among the moral sciences political economy advancing at least as rapidly as any . To this we shall be driven by matei'ial considerations as powerful as those which have thus far restrained our progress in this subject . As our condition approaches more and more to that of old countries , our ability to rely upon the increasing abundance of our resources to cure all mistakes will disappear , and the mistakes themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , they may easily become more formidable in their consequences than elsewhere ; for in the coming century an economic blunder in the United States will be a blunder on a far more portentous scale than those of the past , and will work out its consequences among political elements which will admit of no trifling . Already our public men are appalled by the responsibility of answering such a question as is set them by the currency . But in such a country as we may reasonably believe this will be fifty years hence , and with the dangerous forces now growing within our democracy fairly developed , such a question will be for the men or the party to whom it is offered for answer a very Sphinx 's riddle , and failure to solve it will mean political death . It will then no longer be possible for statesmen or scholars to ignore or neglect those economic laws which determine the consequences of our actions . The same // unfailing operation of historical causes , which in other countries has led to every great step yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effect here . This action may be hastened by the shock of some crisis in national affairs ; but if not , the same result must come in the fulness of time . The regular course of our development must , at a point not far distant , disclose to us an imperious necessity for investigating the laws of material wealth ; and that point being reached , we may confidently expect that the United States will no longer fail to contribute their due share to the advancement of this branch of knowledge .
