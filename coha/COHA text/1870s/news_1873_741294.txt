txt That section of the French people which has recently gone back to the middle ages for its forms of devotion , wants to return to the period before the revolution for the basis of its political constitution . The charter nominally of 1814 , to which we have already referred , and which the cable BOAC declares to have been accepted as the Royalist platform , is a document which ought to date a good . deal further back than the fall of the First Empire . Not to be misled by dates , let it be remembered . that Louis XVIII. , who was the author of the charter aforesaid , was the brother of Louis XVI. , that he was a man thirty-four years old at the date of the revolution , and that both his character and opinions were formed under the state of things which was happily swept away by the revolutionary whirlwind of 1789 . If further proof were needed that the charter of 1814 is really a quarter of a century older than it professes to be , the proof is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . In the speech read for him before the assembled notables of France , on June 4 , 1814 , Louis XVIII. , " by the grace of God , King of France and Navarre , " said that he had drawn up the constitutional charter granted to his subjects , " with his eyes fixed on that immortal work "  --  the pretended will and testament of Louis XVI . As pointed out by the Opinion Nationale , the King regarded . this charter , not as a solemn compact between himself And the people but as a concession which , of his own free will and in the plenitude of his power , he was pleased to grant to his penitent subjects . As the charter was simply a royal concession , it could , of course , be revoked at the royal pleasure , and , in point of fact , it was substantially revoked by his successor , when the indignant protest of 1830 sent the Bourbon King " by divine right " into private life again . The preliminaries and the consequences of the blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do , events which are among the immediate possibilities of French history . On the appropriate date of April 1 , the allied sovereigns who had sent NAPOLEON to Elba jointly " invited " the Senate which was assumed to represent France , " to prepare a provisional form of government , and . to draw up a Constitution which should be approved by the French people . " The Senate met under the Presidency of TALLEYRAND , voted the exclusion of the Napoleonic dynasty , agreed upon a Constitution , and declared that it should be submitted for the acceptance of the French people in a manner to be afterward determined . The proclamation of LOULS-STANISLAS-XAVIER as King of France , was declared to be conditional upon his solemn submission to the Constitution in these terms : " I accept the Constitution and I swear to respect it , and to cause it to be respected . " Before his formal recall , LOUIS XVIII . tacitly consented to the constitutional guarantees required of him . He made some little difficulty about the constitutional provision for the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detail like this , he was of course understood to be perfectly willing to accept the rest of the instrument . By and . by , his brother , the Count of ARTOIS , afterward CHARLES X. , reached . Paris , bearing the title of Lieutenant General of the Kingdom . " Friends , nothing is changed in France ; there is but one Frenchman the more , " said that fair-spoken roue and despot in the grain . He vaguely assured the Senate that his brother accepted the fundamental principles of the Constitution , but proceeded , without any further reference to that document , to complete the preliminaries of the Bourbon restoration . The white flag went up on the Tuileries , the white cockade supplanted the tricolored one , and early in May the King entered France to claim " his own " again . Louis XVIII . was as little disposed as is his grand-nephew , the Count DE CHAMBORD , to admit that he could be King in any other way than by Divine ordinance , and as for that Constitution he was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bases were good , but that " a great number of the articles bore marks of the haste with - which they had been drawn up , " and could not , therefore , become part of the fundamental law of the State . The language used . in 1873 by the Count DE CHAMBORD is said to be substantially as ? follows : " I hold now , as always , that I must be recalled without conditions , because the only strength which I carry in France is the representation in all its integrity of the right of hereditary succession . Once my rights are unconditionally recognized , I am ready on my part to grant all the concessions held to be necessary by the representatives of the people . " Louis XVIII .. held . very much the same sentiments in 1814 , and , to do him justice , was as honestly prepared as his legitimate successor can possibly be to carry them into action . But the Ministers who stood to Louis XVIII . as " the representatives of the people , " were infinitely less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His royal charter of 1814 was very extensively pared down in his own life-time , and when CHARLES X. got his hands over it , the few liberal guarantees which it contained disappeared very rapidly . Priestcraft and tyranny . ruled the hour ; sacrilege was voted a capital offense , an attempt was made to reenact the law of primogeniture , and the liberty of the press was persistently and , in the end , successfully assailed . It needed the infamous Polignac administration to throw Paris into revolt , but the liberties of France had been frittered away , and the lives of some of the noblest Frenchmen had been taken before that , notwithstanding the royal charter of 1814 . Frenchmen have very short memories if they allow themselves to be fooled into trusting their freedom to a dishonored basis like this . Already the names of a " Restoration " Cabinet are given to the world , and there is surely an ominous significance on the list being headed by the name of the younger DECAZES . The father of the proposed Premier of HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVIII . When the day of his fall came , CHATEAUBRIAND said of him , " His feet had slipped in blood . " The name recalls the last " White terror . " Can it be that it is to introduce the next ?
