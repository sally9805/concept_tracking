MUSIC A MEANS OF CULTURE . *UR musical history has been pecu. -/ liar . We were in no sense a musical people forty years ago . Nothing could be further from the old New England character and " bringing up , " - we will not call it culture . But , strangely ( and not much in accordance with the common theory that the way to elevate the taste is to begin with what is light and popular ) , the first real and deep interest in music awakened here in Boston was an interest in the greatest kind of music . Handel , and then more irresistibly Beethoven , were the first to take deep hold on thoughtful , earnest , influential souls . This was when the new spirit of culture , in the fullest , freest , highest sense , became in various ways so rife in this community . So that it is scarcely paradoxical to say , that music in this country , or at least this portion of the country , " came in with the Conqueror . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music ( for it is only the love of it , not the creative gift as yet ) , which has for some time been imputed to this once Puritanical Boston and the regions spiritually watered from it , came in with the conquering ideas , - with the ideas of spiritual freedom , of self-reliance , of the dignity of human nature , of the insignificance of creeds compared with life and practice , of social justice , Music a A/cans of culture . // equal opportunities to all , a common birthright in the beautiful , - ideas which from the time of Channing began to quicken the whole thought and conscience of the young Republic , and which were glowing with fresh fervor of conviction in the light of that ideal philosophy which , where it made one mystic , made a dozen practical and sound reformers , - ideas fitly summed up in the one idea of CULTURE , in the nobler sense in which it then began to haunt the mind , as something distinct from , and superior to , the barren routine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; culture in the sense of free unfolding of intrinsic germs of character , of conscious , quick , sincere relationship and sympathy with all the beauty and the order of the universe , instead of in the old sense of a mere makeshift clothing upon from without with approved special knowledges , conventional beliefs and maxims , and time-honored prejudices . Intimately implied in this idea of culture is the aesthetic principle . For what is culture without art ? - art , the type and mirror of ideal , complete life , the one free mode of man 's activity , wherein he may become partaker in the Divine creative energy ? And what form of art , what ministry to the aesthetic instinct , was so peculiarly the need and product of our age , so widely , easily available , as music ? It was not strange that it should come in with the conquering ideas , as we have said . At all events , it is a fact of some significance that the interest here felt in Beethoven began at the same moment with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who found such quickening in his free and bracing utterance . It was to a great extent the young souls drawn to " Transcendentalism * ( as it was nicknamed ) , to escape spiritual starvation , who were most drawn also to the great , deep music which we began to hear at that time . For , be it remembered , the first great awakening of the musical instinct here was when the C Minor Symphony of Beethoven was played , thirty years ago or more , in that old theatre long since vanished from the heart of the drygoods part of Boston , which had been converted into an " Odeon , " where an " Academy of Music ' * gave us some first glimpses of the glories of great orchestral music . Some may yet remember how young men and women of the most cultured circles , whom the new intellectual dayspring had made thoughtful and at the same time open and impressible to all appeals of art and beauty , used to sit there through the concert in that far-off upper gallery or sky-parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence of the sublime harmonies that sank into their souls , enlarging and coloring thenceforth the whole horizon of their life . Then came the Brook Farm experiment ; and it is equally a. curious fact , that music , and of the best kind , the Beethoven Sonatas , the Masses of Mozart and Haydn , got at , indeed , in a very humble , homemade , and imperfect way , was one of the chief interests and refreshments. of those halcyon days . Nay , it was among the singing portion of those plain farmers , teachers , and ( but for such cheer ) domestic drudges , that the first example sprang up of the so-called " Mass Clubs , " once so much in vogue among small knots of amateurs . They met to practise music which to them seemed heavenly , after the old hackneyed glees and psalm-tunes , though little many of them thought or cared about the creed embodied in the Latin . words that formed the convenient vehicle for tones so thrilling ; the mUSiCwas quite innocent of creed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest wants and aspirations of all souls , darkly locked up in formulas , till set free by the subtile solvent of the delicious harmonies . And our genial friend who sits in Harper 's " EasyChair " has lately told the world what parties from " the Farm " ( and he was " one of them " ) would come to town to drink in the symphonies , and then walk back the whole way , seven miles , at night , elated and unconscious of fatigue , // carrying home with them a new good genius , beautiful and strong , to help them through the next day 's labors . Then , too , and among the same class of minds ( the same " Transcendental set " ) , began the writing and the lecturing on music and its great masters , treating it from a high spiritual point of view , and seeking ( too imaginatively , no doubt ) the key and meaning to the symphony , but anyhow establishing a vital , true affinity between the great tone - poems and all great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for years printed at Brook Farm , in the " Dial , " which told the time of days so far ahead , in the writings of Margaret Fuller and others , these became favorite and glowing topics of discourse ; and such discussion did at least contribute much to make music more respected , to lift it in the esteem of thoughtful persons to a level with the rest of the " humanities " of culture , and especially to turn attention to the nobler compositions , and away from that which is but idle , sensual , and vulgar . The kind reader will grant plenary indulgence to these gossiping memories , and must not for a moment think it is intended by them to claim for any one class the exclusive credit of the impulse given in those days to music . Cecilia had her ardent friends and votaries among conservatives as well . But is it not significant as well as curious , that the free-thinking and idealistic class referred to ( call them " Transcendental dreamers " if you will , they can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in the movement , - that among the " select few , " constant to all opportunities of hearing the great music in its days of small things here , so many of this class were found ? The ideas of those enthusiasts ; if we look around us now , have leavened the whole thought and culture of this people ; have melted icy creeds , and opened genial communion between sects ; have set the whole breast of the nation heaving , till it has cast off the vampire of at least one of its great established crimes and curses ; have set all men thinking of the elevation of mankind . These are the conquering ideas , and with them came in the respect for music , which now in its way , too , is leavening , refining , humanizing our too crude and swaggering young democratic civilization . A short pedigree but great ideas , by their transforming power , work centuries of change in a few years . The great music came in then because it was in full affinity with the best thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep want that shrank from the old Puritanic creed and practice ; that sought a positive soul 's joy instead of abnegation ; that yearned for the " beauty of holiness , " and for communion with the Father in some sincere way of one 's own without profession ; that kindled with ideals of a heaven on earth and of a reign of love in harmony with Nature 's beauty and the prophecies of art , - found just then and here unwonted comfort , courage , and expression in the strains of the divine composers , of which we were then getting the first visitations . It was as if our social globe , charged with the electricity of new divine ideas and longings , germs of a new era , were beginning to be haunted by auroral gleams and hashes of strange melody and harmony . Young souls , resolved to keep their youth and be true to themselves , felt a mysterious attraction to all this , though without culture musically . Persons not technically musical at all would feel the music as they felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They understood as little of the laws of one as of the other fascinating and prophetic mystery . Beethoven , above all , struck the key-note of the age ; in his deep music , so profoundly human , one heard , as in a sea-shell , the murmur of a grander future . Beethoven , Handel , Mozart , found no more eager audience than among these " disciples of the newness " ( as some sneeringly called them ) , these believing ones , who would not have belief imposed upon them , who cared more for life // than doctrine , and to whom it was a prime necessity of heart and soul to make life genial . This was to them " music of the future , " in a more deep and real sense than any Wagner of these later times has been inspired to write . All this , to be sure , does not prove us to be a " musical people . " it does prove that the great music , into which great , earnest men like Beethoven breathed the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great thoughts and impulses beginning at that time to renew religion , politics , society , and the whole spirit and complexion of the age . With the casting adrift from old authorities and creeds came this instinctive feeling forth for art , as for a tangible assurance of the essential " substance of things hoped for . " The aesthetic instinct woke in us ( to music 's touch more quickly than to any other ) to save this radicalism from sheer discomfortable , boisterous , quarrelsome negation , from the rude , antagonistic , and destructive attitude , from that hard , dry , killing prose of life , unquickening , discouraging , conceited , overbearing , which is of the very essence of atheism , and overturns the altars of the old religions only to worship self and the almighty dollar . True radicalism is positive , affirmative , not negative ; a seeker of agreement , unity , and not of difference ; a puller down of only what obstructs the rising of a more divine and universal temple . Resenting imposition and authority , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the truth there is or ever was in each . Now much of that transcendental radicalism was of this temper , and naturally found a reconciling , saving grace in art ; in music , most of all , as the most fluid , subtile , sympathetic of the arts ; the Christian , modern , youngest art , which , weaving airy motion into forms immortal , best illustrates life 's perpetual becoming , and does not stand a milestone of arrested progress ; the art which , while it is infinitely expressive and suggestive , does not limit to precise interpre tations , to mere word meanings , or too inquisitive thought meanings ; does not tie us down to definitions . We were but babes in music , doubtless , and capable of little scientific understanding of the works we heard with rapture . Shall it be said , then , that this love was mostly affectation , or illusion ? What was the so great need of understanding ? Are great poems written , are great pictures painted , were the old cathedrals planned and reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to do the like ? The picture in the window which all passers stop to see was not made solely or mainly for professional enjoyment , but for mere laymen also , ignorant of the art that made it , yet open , it may be , to the full influence and beauty of the thing made . Is nature spread out only for astronomers and physicists and chemists , or to rejoice and raise , refine and harmonize , the unscientific heart and soul of you and me ? The least instructed of us may like the greatest kind of music , for the same reason that he likes the greatest kind of man ; for the same reason that we enjoy real poetry more than that which is weak and commonplace , or find ourselves happier with Shakespeare than with Tupper . May not a community which prefers an Emerson for its lecturer be credited with all sincerity in choosing to sit under the influence of Beethoven rather than of Verdi , finding itself more warmed thereby ? And if you are personally attracted to a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow creature of convention , why should you not be to the music into which some finer , deeper natures put their very lives ? It is not our own fault , surely , if we find that we love Mozart , as we love Raphael or Shakespeare , and turn to such when we most need strengthening refreshment , while we should be simply bored by miscellaneous concerts , pot-pourris of the hackneyed sentimentalities or flash fancies of third and tenth rate composers . And if a man insist that this is all sheer self-illu // sion , and that we really do not like the thing we think we do , of what use can it be to argue with him ? Friend , be you true to your love , as we too would be true to ours ! We will not quarrel . Our point is simply : The great music has been so much followed and admired here , not by reason of any great musical knowledge in said followers not because we have any technical musicianship or proper musicality , but purely because the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such ; we love the music for the great life that is in it . Let the emphasis fall on the word great , - great music , - if you still find it hard to credit our capacity of pleasure in mere music pure and simple* From such beginnings , by degrees , and for a long time through the medium of very poor means of performance , - which only confirms our theory , that it was some inkling of the divine ideas , the life within the symphofly , that first caught the imagination of listeners not very musical , it might be , - there grew up here a pretty deep and general love of noble music ; until , at length , for better or for worse ( we think for better ) , music occupies this people 's time and thought quite largely , yet not so largely as it will and must do . What may be called a " musical movement " is making headway . Much froth about it , no doubt , there is ; much vainglory , splurge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extraordinary , for " big things . " Our great choral societies , for example , may shrink from the real great work , from the sincere , quiet , outwardly unrewarding tasks , which build up the artistic character , which are the true tests of sufficiency in art , in favor of the easier enterprise that carries with it more dclat and advertisement . They may postpone solid everyday excellence to exhibition splendors , festivals , and jubilees on some unprecedented scale . But all this implies a genuine heart-life in music somewhere . Where there is smoke there must be 325 fire . Fuss and feathers make the greater show and catch the vulgar ; but it is because heroes have been and will be again when God and a great crisis call . Do not charge all the egotism and vanity of musical artists , their catering to low tastes by cheap display , their grandiloquent announcements , their jealousies of one another , to music , or even wholly to themselves . r It is the speculating , sordid , money-getting fever of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers at loggerheads , lowers the standard of composers and performers , and tempts the artist soul to sell its birthright and become a travelling thaumaturgic virtuoso . Music would make all this better , could she become ten times the public mistress that she is . So much by way of introduction to the real purpose of this paper , which is to show THE WORTH OF Music TO THIS PEOPLE AS A MEANS OF CULTURE . But for the present we confine ourselves to culture in a general sense , too well foreseeing that it will require a special paper to exhibit music as a type of law , a revelation in its way of the divine organic movement through all spheres of matter and of mind , hence as a means of Intellectual Cu ! - lure ; and still another , to deduce from this the right of music to be regarded as a Universal Language , and therefore as the native language , pure and perfect , of what in man is universal and most human , The Relzgious Sentiment . Music must become a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . It has already gone too far for us to doubt it . Let its importance but begin to be appreciated , and the next Peabody will feel his way to general gratitude by liberal endowment of an art of vital interest to millions , where only tens or hundreds can know how to care for some of the learned branches for which professorships are founded . Money will Music a 11/cans of Cit/lure. // yet be poured out freely for true colleges of music , as it has been for those of literature and science . Is it not worth as much fostering as a boat-race , international or other ? i . Consider , first , the simplest , prima fade claim of music ; consider its civilizing agency , so far as it may become part of the popular , the public education . We , as a democratic people , a great mixed people of all races , overrunning a vast continent , need music even more than others . We need some ever-present , ever-welcome influence that shall insensibly tone down our self-asserting and aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , subdue and harmonize the free and ceaseless conflict of opinions , warm out the genial individual humanity of each and every unit of society , lest he become a mere member of a party , or a slave of business or fashion . This rampant liberty will rush to its own rain , unless there shall be found some gentler , harmonizing , humanizing culture , such as may pervade whole masses with a fine enthusiasm , a sweet sense of reverence for something far above us , beautiful and pure , awakening some ideality in every soul , and often lifting us out of the hard , hopeless prose of daily life . We need this beautiful corrective of our crudities . Our radicalism will pull itself up by the roots , if it do not cultivate the instinct of reverence . The first impulse of freedom is centrifugal , to fly off the handle , unless it be restrained by a no less free , impassioned love of order . We need to be so enamored of the divine idea of unity , that that alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real motive for assertion of our individuality . What shall so temper and tone down our " fierce democracy ? " It must be something better , lovelier , more congenial to human nature than mere stern prohibition , cold Puritanic " Thou shalt not ! " What can so quickly magnetize a people into this harmonic mood as music ? Have we not seen it , felt it ? The hard - working , jaded millions need expansion , need the rejuvenating , the ennobling experience of jo'e . Their toil , their church and creed , perhaps , their party livery , and very vote , are narrowing ; they need to taste , to breathe a larger , freer life . Has it not come to thousands while they have listened to or joined their voices in some thrilling chorus that made the heavens seem to open and come down ? The governments of the Old World do much to make the people cheerful and contented ; here it is all laissez faire , each for himself , in an ever-keener strife of competition . We must look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; we are open to that appeal ; we can forget ourselves in that ; we blend in joyous fellowship when . we can sing together ; perhaps quite as much so when we can listen together to a noble orchestra of instruments interpreting the highest inspirations of a master . The higher and purer the character and kind of music , the more of real genius there is in it , the deeper will this influence be . Judge of what can be done by what already within our own experience has been done and daily is done . Think what the children in our schoolsare getting through the little that they learn . of vocal music , - elasticity of spirit , joy in harmonious co-operation , in the blending of each happy life in others ; a rhythmical instinct of order and of measure in all movement ; and a quickening of the ear and sense , whereby they will grow up susceptible to music as well as with some use of their own voices , so that they may take part in it ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full bloom , say , on their annual file days ) shall our future choirs and oratorio choruses be replenished with good , sound material . Think what unconscious culture , what refining influence , the people of a city might breathe in with the common breath of life from concerts in the open air , from military bands , and , better still , from civic bands , if only our king and lord , the people aforesaid in its // corporate capacity , would make enlightened provision for these things , and institute a competent commission , or commissioner , a " Philostrate , master of the revels , " of real taste and judgment , to see to it that the bands be good ones , the programmes of a kind to elevate and civilize , and not demoralize by brutal bray of everlasting brass ; and that the r*y5erfoire be made I up of models of enduring beauty , instead of specimens of every foolish reigning fashion in its turn . Such an office should be of high honor , of careful appointment , and safe tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best enthusiasm , what enriching of the inner man 's resources , what a lift to thought and feeling , may be given , has been given , by great festivals of music , and even by " great jubilees , " could their ambition be a little sobered , and all the claptrap and extravagance left out . Think , above all , how much of the best kind of culture , though it be undefinable , undemonstrative , a silent absorption , as it were , through all the pores and into every finest spiritual fibre , may be found in the stated series of concerts of the highest order , where to listen well is to take part , and where every person present both in body and in soul " assists , " in the French sense of the word . All that is necessary to this is , that , besides rich material , there shall be a pure artistic s*irif pervadmo-the whole concert ; the programme b ought to be an art-work in itself , with nothing miscellaneous about it , it being not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so placed that they shall not jostle one another , each obliterating the impression of the last ; and that their spell shall not be broken by bringing them into incongruous company with things of so irreconcilable a spirit that one can carry home no clear impression of the concert as a whole . But of the good influence of music in the more popular and public way the half is not told* so long as we have not I*inted how much fitly chosen music may do , has done , though too seldom , as an element in public celebrations of great events in human progress , in commemorations of great men , or in aid of noble charities . On such occasions its chief efficacy depends upon significant , appropriate selections to be played or sung ; upon the close affinity or correspondence of each strain of music , both with the spirit of the hour and with whatever spoken thought or ceremony it may prepare or follow ; in a word , upon a certain artistic unity of programme , of which it catches by quick sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moulds all into symmetry , tenderly guards throughout the unbroken continuity of meaning , and serves as frame and background to the whole . She , Music , should be called in at the first inchoation of the plot as the most sympathetic , subtly appreciative , suggestive confidante ; and when it comes to the fulfilment , hers is the part of chief interpreter , as well as of disposer , of all minds to the right mood of expectation and the right impression after . Commonly we do quite differently . We call in music upon such occasions , not as an equal , a co-working intelligence , but rather as king 's jester , to supply a little idle recreation in the pauses . We employ a band of instruments , mostly military , to discourse loud polkas , pot-pourris from operas , or what not , selected without rhyme or reason , and so rudely break the spell and rob the hour of character and meaning . Art would reform this . Art knows nothing miscellaneous . We are not quite without examples of the better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been witness of a few which might be followed . Who that was present will forget that welcome to our noble Lincoln 's Proclamation of Emancipation on that first of January , when Emerson first read his thrilling " Boston Hymn " of liberty and justice ; and when music , furnishing first the darker prelude , in allusion to the days of bondage and of hope deferred , through the Overture to " Eg // mont , " and that exciting number from the " The Hymn of Praise , " in which to the anxiously repeated question , " VViIl the night soon pass ? " the clear soprano , like a stream of sunshine , startles with the cry , " The night is departing ! " and the glorious crescendo of the chorus floods the world with light and carries all before it in a blaze of high-pitched harmony and trumpets , - then proceeded in the lofty vein of heroism and of holy triumph , by making heard , in such significant connection ( not to name all ) , the glorious Fifth Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of comfort to the long-suffering , " He watching over Israel " ; Handel 's sublime Hallelujahs ; and finally the patriotic " sun-burst " of the Overture to " William Tell " ? Think , too , of the part that music bore the day we listened to the eulogy on our good Governor . How the organ whispered peace in those sweet strains of the concluding chorus , sung at the tomb of the Saviour , of Bach 's Passion Music ; and how the mournful effect of that grandest expression of a people 's grief , bereft of a true hero , the Funeral March from Beethoven 's Heroic Symphony , was tempered by the chorus , full of comfort , from " St. Paul , " " Happy and blest are they who have endured " ; then by the heavenly andante , reassuring and uplifting , from the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven ; and then , to sum up all in one grand lesson , the strong , confiding choral , harmonized by Bach , " What God does , surely is well done ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new beauty to that commemoration of a great man of science , when our Agassiz paid noble tribute to the life and labors of his great friend and teacher , Humboldt ; how the music and the spoken word shed light upon each other ; how Mozart 's chorus of the Priests of Isis sang of the consecration of the noble youth to Truth , wherever she might lead him ; and how the wondrous Overture to " The Magic Flute , " and the first movement of Beethoven 's Seventh Symphony , by their fascinating hint of the perpetuaL pursuit of unity through all the labyrinthine windings of variety , fitly prepared and followed a discourse of which that was the very theme ! Now out of all these ways of popular exposure to the influence of good music , as well as from private , even solitary communion with its master spirits , comes much valuable culture ; not in the sense of musical or any other knowledge , technical and special ; not a direct conscious culture , as such , of the memory or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegance of manners nor address ; not force of will or quickness of decision ; but , nevertheless , a culture mould-* ing us insensibly , a sort of atmospheric culture , weighing gently upon each and all , like wholesome air , expanding thechest , wal'ming the heart , putting the nerves in tune , disposing to unconscious courtesy and kindness , prompt-*-ing each to fill his place cheerfully and unobtrusively , forgetting self in the harmonious whole , weaving a sympathetic bond , making us all feel like happy , trustful children , free and not afraid . We may learn something from our German fellow-citizens in illustration of this important chapter in the art of life . We as a people seem somehow to have lacked this art . We court prosperity like anxious bond - slaves , fearing to call a moment of our lives our own , fearing to live , in our unceasing , feverish pursuit of the mere means of living . We are enterprising to a fault ; we go ahead faster than others ; but it is by a centaur-like contrivance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human self run down into the lower animal , or the machine that carries us . Why , 0 " live Yankee , " 0 proud Westerner , why waste your life in rivalling a steam-engine ! Man makes himself a mere machine for generating or accumulating power , and all for what ? And with what a solemn , sanctimonious , lean , hard-favored way he does it often ! With what a quasi-religious and self-righteous tone he quotes his business maxims ! How he amalgamates-. // unworldly orthodoxy with the most secular showman 's cant in the advertising of his wares ! How he practically confounds religion with his own self-love , as generalized into prudential maxims ! We esteem ourselves the freest people on this planet ; yet we have perhaps as little real freedom as any other ; for we are the slaves of our own feverish enterprise , and of a barren theory of discipline , which would fain make us virtuous to a fault through abstinence from very life . We are afraid to give ourselves up to the free and happy instincts of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good , conventional , approved way of business , or politics , or fashion , or intellectual reputation , or professed religion , we count waste . We lack geniality ; nor do we , as a people , understand the meaning of the word . We ought to learn it practically of our Germans . It comes of the same root with the word genius . Genius is the spontaneous principle ; it is free and happy in its work ; it is artist and not drudge ; its whole activity is reconciliation of the heartiest pleasure with the purest loyalty to conscience , with the most holy , universal , and disinterested ends . Genius , as Beethoven gloriously illustrates in his Choral Symphony ( indeed , in all his symphonies ) , finds the key-note and solution of the problem of the highest state in " Joy , " taking his text from Schiller 's Hymn . Now all may not be geniuses , in the sense that we call Shakespeare , Mozart , Raphael , men of genius . But all should be partakers of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all should live childlike , o*enial lives , and not *vear all the time the consequential livery of their unrelaxing business , nor the badge of party and profession in every line and feature of their faces . This genial , childlike faculty of social enjoyment , this happy art of life , is just what our countrymen may learn from the social " Liedertafel " and the summer singing-festivals of which the Germans are so fond . There is no element of national character which we so much need ; and there is no class . of citizens whom we should be more glad to adopt and own than those who set us such examples . So far as it is a matter of culture , it is through art chiefly that the desiderated genial era must be ushered in . The Germans have the sentiment of art , the feeling of the beautiful in art , and consequently in nature , more developed than we have . Above all , music offers itself as the most available , most popular , most influential of the fine arts , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , the sentiments , the spiritual instincts of the soul , and so becomes a universal language , tending to unite and blend and harmonize all who may come within its sphere . 2 . Such civilizing , educating power has music for society at large . Now in the finer sense of culture , such as we look for in more private and select " society , " as it is called , music in the salon , in the small chamber concert , . where congenial spirits are assembled in its name , - good music , of course , - does it not create a finer sphere of social sympathy and courtesy ? does it not better mould the tone and manners from within than any imitative " fashion " from without ? What society , upon the whole , is quite so sweet , so satisfactory , so refined , as the best musical society , if only Mozart , Men-. delssohn , Franz , Chopin , set the tone ! The finer the kind of music heard or made together , the better the society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaner , more prosaic natures are not drawn to it . Wealth and fashion may not dictate who shall be of it . Here congenial spirits meet in a way at once free , happy and instructive , meet with an object which insures " society " ; whereas so-called society , as such , is often aimless , vague , unedifying and fatiguing , for the want of any subject-matter . Here one gets ideas of beauty which are not mere arbitrary fashions , ugly often to the eye of taste . Here you may escape vulgarity by a way not vulgar in itself , like that of fashion , which makes // 330 wealth and family and means of dress its passports . Here you can be as exclusive as you please , by the soul 's right , not wronging any one ; here learn gentle manners , and the quiet ease and courtesy with which cultivated people move , without in the same process learning insincerity . Of course the same remarks apply to similar sincere reunions in the name of any other art , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , even if each listener find nothing set down to his part ( or even hers ! ) but ( acet. 3 W* have fancied ourselves entering a musical house together , but we must leave it with no time to make report , or picture out the scene . Now could we only enter the chamber , the inner sanctum , the private inner life of a thoroughly musical person , one who is wont to live in music ! Could we know him in his solitude ! ( You can only know him in yourself , unless he be a poet and creator in his art and bequeath himself in that form , in his works , for any who know how to read . ) If the best of all society is musical society , we go further and say : The sweetest of all solitude is when one is alone with music . One gets the best of music , the sincerest part , when he is alone . Our poet-philosopher has told us to secure solitude at any cost ; there s nothing which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great vice of our society , that it provides for and disposes to so little solitude , ignoring the fact that often there is more loneliness in company than out of it . Now to a musical person , in the mood of it , in the sweet hours by himself , comes music as the nearest friend , nearer and dearer than ever before , and he soon *flnds that he never was in such good company . I doubt if symphony of Beethoven , opera of Mozart , Passion Music of Bach , was ever so enjoyed or felt in grandest public rendering , as one may feel it while he recalls its outline by himself at his piano ( even if he be a slow and bungling reader , and must get it out by piecemeal ) . I doubt if such an one can carry home from the performance , in presence of the applauding crowd , nearly so much as he may take to it from such inward , private preparation .

Take down the volume of Sonatas , the arrangement of the great Symphony , the recorded reveries of Chopin , the songs of Schubert , Schumann , Franz , or even the chorals , with the harmony of Bach , in which the four parts blend their several individual melodies together in such loving service of the whole , that the plain people 's tune becomes a germ unfolding into endless wealth and beauty of meaning , and you have the very essence of all prayer and praise and gratitude , as if you were a worshipper in the ideal church . Nothing like music , then , to banish the benumbing ghost of ennui . It lends secret sympathy , relief , expression , to all one 's moods , loves , longings , sorrows ; comes nearer to the soul , or to the secret wound , than any friend or healing sunshine from without . It nourishes and feeds the hidden springs of hope and love and faith ; renews the old conviction of life 's springtime , - that the world is ruled by love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine end of life , and not a snare and an illusion . It floods out of sight the unsightly , muddy grounds of life 's petty , anxious , doubting moments , and makes immortality a present fact , lived in and realized . It locks the door against the outer world of discords , contradictions , importunities , beneath the notice of a soul so richly occupied ; lets " Fate knock at the door " ( as Beethoven said in explanation of his symphony ) , - Fate and the pursuing Furies , - and even welcomes them , and turns them into gracious goddesses , Eumenides ! Music in this way is a marvellous elixir to keep off old age . Youth returns in solitary hours with Beethoven and Mozart . Touching the chords of the Moonlight Sonata , the old man is once more a lover ; with the andante of the Pastoral Symphony , he loiters by // the shady brookside hand in hand with his fresh heart 's first angel . You are past the sentimental age , yet you can weep alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expressive and more worthy of your manly faith . A great grief comes , an inconsolable bereavement , an humiliating , paralyzing reverse , a blow of Fate giving the lie to your best plans and bringing your best powers into discredit with yourself ; then you are best prepared and best entitled to receive the secret visitations of these tuneful goddesses and muses . " Who never ate his bread in tears , He knows you not , ye heavenly powers . " *o sings the German poet . It is the vant of inward , deep experience , it is iinocence of sorrow and of trial , more tlan the lack of any special cultivation o* musical taste or knowledge , that doars many people - naturally most yong people , and all who are what we cal shallow natures - from the feeling anbenjoyment of many of the truest , deegst , and most heavenly of all the wons of music . Take the Passion Mus ; of Bach , for instance ; if you can sit d'tvn alone at your piano and deciphe strains and pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that inits quiet quaintness , its sincerity andtenderness , its abstinence from all stri'ng for effect , it speaks to you and entrines itself about your heart , like the weetest , deepest verses in the Bible , wen " the soul muses till the fire burns ' Such a anacea is this art for loneliness . Bu sometimes , too , it may intensify the ense of loneliness , only for more heavely relief at last . Think of the deep coposer , of lonely , sad Beethoven , wreaking his pain upon expression in those impatient chords and modulations , putting his sorrows into sonatas , and wringing triumph always out of all ! Look at him as he was then , morose , they say , and lonely and tormented ; look where he is now , as the whole world knows him , feels him , seeks him for its joy and inspiration , - and who can doubt of immor-tality ? Now in such private solace , in such solitary joys , is there not culture ? Can one rise from such communings with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without new peace , new faith , new hope , and good-will in his soul ? He goes forth in the spirit of reconciliation and of patience , however much he may hate the wrong he sees about him , or however little he accept authorities and creeds that make war on his freedom . The man who has tasted such life , and courted it till he has become acclimated in it , whether he be of this party or that , or none at all , whether he be believer or " heretic , " conservative or radical , follower of Christ by name or " Free Religionist , " belongs to the harmonic and anointed bodyguard of peace , fraternity , good-will ; his instincts all have caught the rhythm of that holy march ; the good genius leads , he has but to follow cheerfully and humbly . For somehow the minutest fibres , the infinitesimal atoms of his being , have got magnetized , as it were , into a loyal , positive direction toward the pole-star of unity ; he has grown attuned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violin , the walls of a music-hall , by much musicmaking , become gradually seasoned into smooth vibration . 7oli ; t S.
