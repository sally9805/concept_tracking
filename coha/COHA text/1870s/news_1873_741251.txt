txt The inadequacy of our laws to make suitable provision for what may be called intelligibly , if not quite accurately , criminal insanity , is sufficiently well known , and has been more than once adverted to in these columns . The difficulty is complicated by the unscrupulousness of advocates , the stupidity of juries , the pretentious ignorance or jealousy of medical experts , the general failure of the elaborate machinery we have devised to detect convicts and prevent crime . When a murderer , for example , is acquitted on the ground of insanity , the chances are about even that he is , or is not , of sound mind . If , being sane , he is committed to a lunatic asylum , we inflict on him a punishment worse than death , and utterly unjustifiable under our laws . Beside the torture of being confined with crazy people , the nameless horrors of daily and hourly contact with frantic maniacs or gibbering idiots , the sane prisoner so confined stands every chance of losing his own senses . The effect on sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . jLven physicians who make this a specialty , it is said , sometimes lose their reason . A few days since , Dr. THOMAS DUDLEY , for many years assistant physician of a lunatic asylum at Lexington , Ky. , committed suicide in a fit of mental aberration induced , it is supposed , by his long and intimate connection with his /demented patients . It would . almost seem as though there were in the constitution of the human mind a certain morbid sympathy ever eager to assume the hue and fashion of alien disease . If this be so , confinement of the sane with the insane is surely a refinement of cruelty which Christian and civilized justice can not tolerate . Yet murder has been done and must be avenged . Flow do we go about avenging it t By first pretending that the murderer is insane , and so irresponsible and not to be hanged ; then locking him up for a varying period  --  a week , a month , a year ? in a lunatic asylum ; then discovering him to be sane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood-guiltiness not yet wiped out . If we may believe a Western contemporary , this is the precise process which has been pursued , and is on the eve of completion , in the case of the well-known MARY HAnnrs . This young woman , it will be remembered , shot a clerk in the Treasury Department , at Washington , because he declined to marry her , and was acquitted on the ground of insanity . Since then she has been confined in an insane asylum near the capital , until a few weeks since , when she made her escape , but was shortly recaptured in Philadelphia and brought back to her old quarters . It is now asserted that she is not only not at present insane , but that she never was , and that measures are about to be taken to effect her release . One of our ablest lawyers , and one of our most distinguished psychologists , have lately expressed a decided opinion that insanity of the will such as obliterates the sense of right and wrong , and destroys the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many persons and almost all jurymen have suppose &; One of them goes so far as to say that many really insane criminals retain sufficient sense of right and wrong to be responsible and properly punishable for their unlawful acts . What , then , shall be done with a sane criminal , falsely alleged to be insane , on that score acquitted , and finally released after a year or two years ' confinement in an asylum " ? Is such confinement , exceptionally cruel as we admit it is , to be regarded as equivalent to the life imprisonment , or the loss of life inflicted on the sane criminal ; or will the law carelessly permit itself to be outwitted by cunning rogues and unscrupulous attorneys ? We have no desire to prejudice the case of MARY HARRIS , who , if sane , should certainly be removed from her present quarters at once . But to the minds of many , such a disposition of like cases will not seem so conclusive or satisfactory as society might desire , or as justice certainly demands .
