txt The conductor of one prominent contemporary journal in New-York may boast that there is always matter of interest in at least one of its columns . It is a column in which persons who are debarred from direct intercourse hold communication with each other , or in which strangers seek acquaintance without the tedious preliminaries required by the prejudices of an effete and corrupt society . Here the errant prodigal is told that , if he will return , his mother , if not his father , will fall upon his neck and kiss him ; hero the woman deserted by husband or by lover vents her agony and her reproaches ; hero the robber of the grave makes arrangement through eminent counsel for the restoration of his ghastly plunder ; here the leading cracksmau , having a pretty job in view , communicates with his pal or with his policeman ; and here Anonym throws out her lures for " an honorable gentleman of means . " These are but a few of the various subjects of a purely personal and private nature which , treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moralist and to the professor of social science , as well as to the votary of pleasure and to the detective who is " on the make . " There is one sort of advertisement which , if published at all , would naturally find its place in this consecrated column , and which has of late appeared there with increasing frequency . This is the advertisement for the return of stolen goods . In a single number before us we find three of this sort . In one of them , " the tinsmith who took the watch and chain from ? street on Friday morning . " is informed that " if he will send the pawn-ticket to the undersigned. all other efforts to recover it will be stopped ; " and then the undersigned gives , with his name , his business address . In another , the person who took an overcoat from a certain house , the street and number of which are conspicuously set forth , is advised that he is " welcome to the overcoat , " and that if he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no questions will be asked . " First , observe the daintiness of phrase in these notiacations . There is nothing said of a thief or of stealing . There never is in such communications . The addressee is simply a person , or , if ho is known or suspected , a tinsmith , or what not . Nor is he or she over said to have stolen or robbed on the occasion referred to , but simply to have " taken " the plunder . In this euphemism there is discretion . For it is remarkable that among thieves themselves , even those of the most abandoned and desperate character , the words " steal " and " rob " are never used . The word in favor ( when cant is not spoken ) is simply this general one " take , " which covers all kinds of taking . In olden times the word was " nim. " whence the name of Agin , in SHAKESPEARE 'S " Merry Wives " and " Henry V. " ** is a thief , and so is Pistol ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( jeweled , probably , ) Falstaff , for taking it upon his honor that they had it not , divided the spoils . " Didst thou not share ? " Pistol asks him . " Hadst thou not fifteen pence ' 1 " It is said that even officers of the detective force , when they arrest , do not give the crime which has been committed its name , but tell the culprit that he is " wanted " for such or such an " affair . " It is not improbable that these advertisers would lose the chances of recovering their goods if they addressed their offers to " the thief who stole . " This , however , is a matter of etiquette which doubtless is settled by the tastes and the practice of the more prominentmembers of the highercircies of thievery . What chiefly interests the public , is the matter-of-course way in which these sufferers from crime address themselves directly to the criminals , and offer , on certain conditions , to make things pleasant for them . The thief is told that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless to him , he may keep that which is valuable , or that if , after having got money at the pawnshop , he will send his pawn-ticket to his victim , that amiable person will take it upon himself to redeem the articles , I and that , as it is in all such cases , no ques-tions will be asked and no further stops will be taken . The person robbed seems to take but one view of the transaction , that it is one by which he has lost something , and to have but one purpose in regard to it  --  to get his property back again . The idea that the public , that society , that his neighborhood , that ' he himself , has an interest in any other treatment of the affair seems not to enter his mind . In most cases the person robbed does not even think that by such an advertisement as those in question he is entering into culpable negotiations with a thief , and becoming in fact , a participator in his crime . But that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to any reasonable man . Besides this , every such transaction is a temptation to theft , a premium , upon robbery . If a thief is reasonably sure that he will be allowed to retain the best part of his booty , if he will but return that which is of use to no one but the owner , and that if he makes this restitution of that which is worthless to him , ho will not only have that which is valuable , but be insured against criminal proceedings , what can be plainer than that the premium thus put upon crime is exactly the value of the articles which the thief is allowed to keep and  --  impunity . He goes unscathed and is paid for his trouble . Every such arrangement of affairs with a thief is a direct , positive wrong to society . It is an injury to every man and woman not of the criminal classes . For every such arrangement is a clear and unmistakable suggestion to the thief that if he will rob some one else , he may also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go unpunished . There is , however , most deplorably , no hope of any change in the feeling of which such arrangements with criminals are the product and the illustration . At a time when it has been declared that " patriotism is but an enlightened self-interest , " it is not to be expected that men will forego the chance of recovering lost property for the sake of elevating the moral tone of . society , or even of protecting their friends and neighbors against robbery . It is perceptible that public spirit diminishes year by year , even in regard to matters which do not directly affect the pockets of individuals . How much less may a high and sensitive public morality be looked for in matters so personal as the loss of property by robbery " Give me my money , " is the cry ; " I do n't care how I got it , so long as I myself commit no crime . " There is a very large proportion of men who will stick at no means , however base , however cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or property which is honestly theirs . If other moans fail , they will take dishonorable means of recovering what they call an honest debt . In a community in which such views prevail among any considerable number of persons , it is useless to preach against the old crime of compounding felony . There is no hope except in that gradual elevation of the moral tone of the mass of society , which , however slow it may be , does go on , and is the surest promise , if not the only promise , of good for the future .
