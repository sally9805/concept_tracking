Miss Jennie Brown Well , Mr Flint . ( Smiling ) . I 'm afraid you are not the best reader of faces in the world .

Why should I not sing ? Flint . Gabriel Flint Time enough , Little Sunshine .

He was at one time a valet to a noble lord , but got tired and became a cross cove . We were partners together and that 's why he 's going to give me a hundred without any circumlocution .

She is helping me some , but I ca n't control her like you could . Luke . Luke Davis Helping you here ? Lord M. Lord Mortimer You see the folks are rich , and I 'm going to marry the only child . There will be a party there to-morrow . You must get polished up and come along . I 'll introduce you as Sir Edward Hastings , I 've got plenty of friends . Luke . Luke Davis Capital !

Only a few hours since I was a miserable vagabond without a penny in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I find myself on the high road to fortune with both money and friends to back me . But , stop a bit , I know nothing about shoving the queer in this country . I did a little bit in that way at home but was not over successful there , and neither was Ralph Dobbs  --  his lordship , I mean  --  but he is vastly successful here , to judge from appearances . It must be a better business here than it is on the other side , but there is one thing about it , and that is that I must have somebody to help me  --  some innocent party who is not known to the police  --  Lily is the very one . Enter Lily , r 2 e . Well , Lily , you did not expect to see me again , did you ? Lily . Lily Davis I did not . Luke . Luke Davis You thought I was dead , did n't you ? And you hoped I was too , did n't you ? Come , be candid . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . I admire candour . I was always very candid myself , was n't I , now ? Lily . Lily Davis I did think you were dead , because it is so long since I heard either of or from you ; but I did not wish it . Whenever I have thought of you , I have wished that you might be living and a better man ; but that wish , I see , was vain . You have gone on from bad to worse , and I fear that there is no hope for you . Luke . Luke Davis Oh , do n't say that , Lily . Do n't say that , my little girl . You know what the old hymn says :  --  ' While the lamp holds out to burn The vilest sinner may return . ' I might live to be a church deacon yet ; or perhaps even a parson yet  --  who knows ? You should n't try to discourage a fellow like that . By the way , who was that young man that left here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily Davis A friend  --  ( dropping her eyes . Aside ) . Ernest ! Luke . L uke Davis Good thing . I 'm glad he is a friend , because he wo n't be apt to give me any further trouble ; especially if he is a very dear friend , which I am more than half inclined to believe he is . I tried to steal his watch awhile ago , and I was just thinking how awkward it would have been if he had succeeded in getting me arrested . He would have been obliged to compound a felony in order to get me liberated , would n't he ? and that would n't have been agreeable to him or to you , would it ? Lily . Lily Davis Oh , why have you come here to torture me ? Was it not enough that you left me alone to fight the battle of life , subjected to all the taunts of the heartless , and exposed to all the dangers of a great city ? Was it not enough that you cast me off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ? Could you not be content to stay away from me now that I am of an age to take care of myself , and not seek me out to degrade and curse me with your presence ? Luke . Luke Davis Well ! well ! well ! What next , I wonder ! If you ai n't the most heartless little piece of femininity that I never saw , then I 'm a Dutchman ! Here I 've been away from you for five years , knocking around the world trying to pick up an honest living ; and when I come to see you , instead of rushing into my arms and covering me with kisses , you treat me as if I were a beggar , and want to know what I sought you out for . Is this the way a dutiful daughter ought to greet a long-absent father ? Is this the return I ought to get for all the affection I have lavished upon you ? Lily , I 'm ashamed of you ! absolutely ashamed of you ! Oh , now I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serpent 's tooth , it is to have a thankless child . ' Lily . Lily Davis You have never acted like a father to me , nor have I ever felt for you a daughter 's affection . I never knew anything but degradation , suffering , and privation , while you were with me ; and although you left me in a tenement house , exposed to every peril and without a friend in the world , I felt a sweet relief when you were gone , and could have laughed for joy amid all my misery and squalor . And now your reappearance fills me with horror and disgust . I wish you no harm . I should rejoice to know that you had altered your life and were trying to do right ; but I neither love nor respect you , and never can . Luke . Luke Davis Oh , that 's the wav you feel , is it ? Then I must take some strong measures to bring you to a sense of your duty . For five long years I have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a sort of Ishmaelite whose hand has been against every man , as every man 's hand has been against me . Many a time the bloodhounds of the law have been on my track , and sometimes I have suffered imprisonment . Now , mark me , girl , I do not intend to mend my ways . I am none of your canting , whining hypocrites . I intend to live as I have ever lived , independent of all law ; but hereafter I intend to live in more security , and I intend that you shall aid me in doing so . Lily . Lily Davis Never ! never ! ( Rising . ) Luke . Luke Davis Softly ! softly ! Now  --  ( drawing revolver )  --  sit down . Lily . Lily Davis You would not kill your own child ? Luke . Luke Davis Altogether depends on circumstances . I do not hold my life at a pin 's value , and I value yours as little as my own . The youth who left here but a short time since loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are engaged , but you will never be married unless you do my bidding . Swear that whatever happens you will be my friend ; that whatever crime I commit , coming to your knowledge , you will not divulge it ; and that if I fly here for refuge when pursued by the hounds of the law , you will conceal me . Swear this , or neither you nor myself shall ever leave this room alive ! Swear ! Lily . Lily Davis I 'll promise . Luke . Luke Davis I want your oath . ( Points pistol . ) Lily . Lily Davis I swear . Luke . Luke Davis Good ! Now we understand each other . Be true to your oath , and all will be well with you ; try to evade it , and your life and his will pay for the perjury . Now give me some supper , I 'm almost famished . Lily . Lily Davis Oh , no , no ! I 'm not living here alone . A shopmate of mine is living with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect her every moment .
