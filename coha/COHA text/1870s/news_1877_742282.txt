txt To the American reader , remote from the scene of conflict , and absolutely impartial of judgment , the agreement just signed by the great powers of Europe must seem inconclusive and weak . It has the ap ' pearance of a vain attempt to postpone an evil day . By the Treaty of Paris , signed by all the principal European powers ( including Turkey ) at the end of the Crimean war , it was practically agreed that the Eastern question should not be seriously reconsidered without the concurrence of all the signatory powers . The Constantinople conference included a Turkish representative in its deliberations . That conference ended in nothing ' . Next , Russia , desirous of bringing debate to a determination , drew up what is called a protocol . It was practically a new tr9. , aty . The terms of th'Is convention arc now inade public . Briefly , wo have hero summed up the often-repeated declarations of the Christian powers that the non-Mussulman. subjects of the Porte must be protected , defended , and guaranteed certain reforms or privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ! conditions are complied with , Christian Europe will apply , other remedies to meet the case in hand .. Those who have.opposed all extreme measures in the case of Turkey have loudly asserted that ** of Paris k for-. bade any line of diplomatic action to which the Sublime Porte did not agree and consent . But by the protocol , which was signed the other day , Russia , England , Austria , Germany , Italy , and France have agreed to a certain policy to be hereafter pursued toward Turkey . Under the verbiage of the convention there was concealed a positive and distinct threat to Turkey . There was nothing to show that the compact implied in the Treaty of Paris was dissolved . There was nothing to show that Russia , for example , was hereafter free to act by herself whenever any specific exigency should arise . Bnt Turkey - was not asked , or expected , to be a party to this new agreement . If this is not a virtual and effectual abrogation of the Treaty of Paris , it is nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attached to the protocol certain declarations by Russia and England . The last of these is not now worth serious attention . The Russian declaration was to the effect that demobilization of the armies of the Czar would take place when Turkey showed itself ready to disarm , and  --  what is of more consequence  --  seriously to undertake the reforms mentioned in the protocol . Who is to be the judge of the serious intentions of Turkey ? Not England  --  the guardian of the Turk . Not even the allied . Christian powers . Russia expressly stipulates that an envoy may ho sent to St. Petersburg " to treat of disarmament , " when the Czar is satisfied of the honest intention of the Government of the Sublime Porte . In the first place , then , the compact signed at Paris in 1856 is dissolved . by a new agreement , to which Turkey , one of the original signatory powers , is not a party . In the second place , the whole question of disarmament , and of serious reform , upon which disarmament is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Turkey . and Russia . As we have said , this disposition of ' the case is utterly without result . It is a settlement which settles nothing . Nay , it rather enlarges the possibility of conflict . It takes the issue from the conclusion of a large body , where unanimity is a prerequisite , and gives it over . to the decision of two powers , either of which marprecipitato a fight . But after all , we need not bo disappointed at this unsatisfactory termination of a long and . laborious negotiation . It is as impossible for peace and safety to be established iu Eastern Europe under the rule of the Turk as it is for a man to appear vigorous and healthy while a malignant poison is coursing through his veins . Time and experience have proved that treaties , protocols , and agreements are but ropes of sand with which Christian Europe has essayed to bind the Turk . Or , to change the figure , all of these diplomatic expedients are only plasters which have concealed for a moment the outbreimks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian element in his Empire . The Mossulman will not treat the non-Mussulma , n subject as his equal , or otherwise than as an infidel dog and giaour ; when he does , ho ; cases to be a Turk and a Nussulman . On the other hand , the threatening character of the present crisis is very clearly shown in the animus of the famous protocol which has just been signed . Turkey is nominally an independent State . The cries of the Turkish leaders have been those of men who despised and derided all hint of outside interference . The spirit now dominant in Ottoman councils is One which haughtily repels the suggestion that any State , or any convocation of States , may dictate terms to the Sublime Porto . But the protocol notifies to Turkey the intention of the Christian powers to maintain an espionage over the welfare of Christian subjects of the Sultan , and . to interfere with condign punishment when these people are maltreated . It is assumed that the Turks have neither patriotism nor fanaticism . It does not seem difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless the spirit of Young Turkey is absolutely broken , or unless time dissimulating policy of the Porte can check the popular impulse of rebellion against to_the  --  eign interference , such terms as these will be indignantly spurned .
