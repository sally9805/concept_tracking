ARTICLE VIT. -INTERCOLLEGJATE CONTESTS . THE growth of learning and of the estimation in which culture and cultivated men are held naturally draws those organized institutions which represent and foster the scholarship of the country into closer and more cordial relations to each other . Their interests are seen to be substantially the same ; their work , a common work ; the ends they aim at , identical ; and the tendency to better acquaintance and cordial fellowship and a community of plans and measures keeps even pace with the increasing appreciation of sound learning an ( l the steady broadening of the field it may occupy and of the influence it may exert . it is one of the pleasing proofs of this large and most pervasive culture that senseless animosities and petty jealousies between different colleges are forgotten and buried out of mind , while with an emulous friendship they seek to outdo one another in the standards of scholarship and in actual attaiuments . The college system of the country is not yet thoroughly elaborated and settled ; it is indeed scarcely more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited improvement . The oldest colleges of the country are still in the formative state , conducting experiments in the modes of discipline and training whose value can only be determined by the result . The younger colleges are most attentive observers of every modification and supposed improvement in methods , and are prompt to avail themselves of every change whicli* has a demonstrated value . And it is not impossible that these newer colleges , from their more elastic organization , their comparative freedom from traditional and stereotyped methods , and the special forces gathered in them , may sometimes furnish hints of real value to the older schools . At least there exists this mutual relation and prompt intercommunication between the colleges of the country , as a marked feature of the times and a happy augury of the more varied culture and nobler manhood that shall proceed from // these schools in the years to come . The associations of college officers , and of teachers of all grades , for mutual acquaintance and consultation , for vigorous discussion upon a wide range of topics connected with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teaching , of discipline , and of administration , are at once the evidence and result of the drift of the times . Associations among the undergraduates in different colleges for various purposes have also lately appeared ; and those which have as their chief object the management of a public trial of skill and power are at this time attracting no little attention both in the colleges and in the outside world . And while there are many questions concerning the internal affairs and ordering of colleges which are almost wholly of local and special interest , there are yet many others in which the general public of intelligent men have a real concern and feel a vital interest . Such is the relation of the college to the interests of society at large , not merely to sound learning and a pure morality , but to social refinement , to literary taste , to civil order , to political capacity , that whatever affects the college , in any marked degree , is felt with gain or loss throughout the state or nation . It is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will *zain or suffer loss , according *s our colleges Inrsue steadily their proper end , or are drawn aside therefrom ; but the whole community has a vast stake in these schools of liberal training . And thus it is wholly appropriate and quite in their line for college officers carefully to co*nsider this comparatively new phase of undergraduate life in intercollegiate associations ; while the general public may also properly be invited to the same inquiry , as to a matter in which it has a real concern . Intercollegiate contests are public trials of power and skill , in which a certain number of colleges appear by designated representatives to determine the question of their relative superiority as to the particular matter of the contest . The subject of contest may be anything agreed upon . In this country it has actually been something involving a preparation that lies chiefly in the line of physical culture and the development of muscular skill and dexterity in specific directions ; or something // the preparation for which , or the performance of which , or both , chiefly occupies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former ; Chess , Composition , and Oratory , of the latter . In either case the objects of such contests are 1 . To test the powers of the competitors , their general culture , and their special training for that feat ; to test also the discipline afforded by the colleges which are parties to the contest . 2 . To develop and increase interest in special kinds and lines of mental work or of physical culture and sports , among those who engage in the contest , among the undergraduates in the colleges represented , and among men of learning and taste generally . 3 . To bring colleges and the men connected with them into better acquaintance with each other ; to promote fellowship on common grounds ; to dissipate groundless prejudices and narrow conceits ; and to effect a practical recognition of the community of interests which unite these schools of liberal culture . The physical contests have perhaps been most common , and are most in vogue in the eastern colleges to-day . The Annual College Regatta is a permanent feature in the associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the public recognition among the sports which the newspapers faithfully herald and report . The intellectual contests are just now rising into an unwonted prominence and importance , in the colleges of the interior and in those of the east also ; so that the question of their expediency is a matter of grave moment to the greater part of the colleges of the country . These contests , of both kinds , are likely to awaken an intense interest among the students of those colleges which are engaged in them ; they absorb a good share of thought and strength and time , and to this extent divert from the proper work and discipline of the college ; and thus they properly demand a careful examination of their advantages and disadvantages , and a thorough discussion of their merits . Are these contests , of either kind , a desirable feature of college arrangements and relations ? Is it expedient to provide for them and to encourage them ? Especially is it worth while // for colleges , that have never recognized the necessity or importance of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and include them among their permanent forces ? This is the question which it is attempted here to answer ; a question which has a practical bearing upon some of the more vital interests of all colleges , and which is receiving the special attention of many college officers at this time . For convenience , the advantages of these contests will be first presented , so far as they are usually urged , or may be clearly seen ; and then their disadvantages , so far as they have been proved to exist or can be seen to be inevitable . 1 . We name first among the things which may be urged in favor of these contests , the readiness and spirit with which undergraduates usually enter into them . It is the almost universal fact that young men are prompt to engage in these combats , and even lavishly free in their expenditure of time and labor in preparation for them ; and they follow them with the utmost zest . College Faculties do not need to urge their pupils to take their share in such exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dwell on their propriety or importance . Their interference , if called for at all , is needed rather in the way of regulating and restraining the excitement , spontaneously developed , within reasonable and healthful bounds . This fact is a presumption in favor of these contests , provided they are desirable on other grounds . It is a great gain in any proposed arrangement to be sure of the voluntary and hearty cod peration of those who are to be active in it . And one of the serious obstacles in the way of certain much needed college reforms is the deep prejudice of the students in favor of the evils to be removed , and the steady opposition which all attempts at their abolition are sure to call out . This ready interest of students in these contests is , therefore , in their favor , and will always make it easy to sustain them . Of course , it is not decisive as regards their absolute value . 2 . A consideration more relied upon in j ustification of these contests is this : that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercises and that kind of training which are involved in them . And this stimulus , and the benefit of it , are not confined to the competitors alone , // but are distributed generally among the students in the coleges joined in this association ; they even affect the methods and training of the colleges themselves , and to some degree , it may be urged , reach the community at large . The forces that concur to this result , and their action , are familiar . It is an honor to any student to be selected as the representative of his college in such a trial of skill . This selection is understood to be made on the ground of natural powers and acquired skill ; and the last is the more powerful factor . The possibility of winning this choice seems to lie within the reach of a large number of the students ; and thus that special training which is likely to win the prize is actually followed by very considerable numbers . And the special attention which these give to the matter in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked and unusual interest in the whole body of students . If Oratory , for example , is assiduously cultivatcd by a half or a third of the students in a college , this will give tone to the aims and efforts of all , and the other half or two-thirds , almost unconsciously , will be drawn to greater interest in this line of culture , and to greater improvement therein . And it is highly probable that this activity on the part of the pupils will react upon the instruction given in the college ; and the drill in Literature and Rhetoric and Elocution will be marked by increased attention and greater thoroughness . It may , perhaps , be thought that if this effect were to be produced in all or the greater part of the colleges in some considerable section of the country , an elevation of the literary standards and taste of the whole community might be reasonably anticipated , and the quality of public address very sensibly heightened . The force of this view depends on these assumptions : first , that the exercises called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the training of undergraduates ; and , secondly , that these exercises are not sufficiently favored by the ordinary coHege arrangements . If the object of the contest is objectionable in itself or in some one or more of its necessary circumstances , this special interest and attention which it evokes merely aggravates the evils and doubles the objections . Or if the regular drill of the college provides all the training // 1875. in these particular directions which undergraduates can profitably receive , under such regulations and with such incitements to thoroughness and excellence as long and varied experience has proved to be wise and wholesome ; any arrangement which carries the force that is given to such and such exercises beyond this due degree , that breaks in upon the just distribution of work iu the regular course of study , is by that fact proved to be inexpedient and highly undesirable . 3 . Another plea for these contests rests upon the fact that they bring different colleges together upon a common ground , and thus tend to promote acquaintance and kindly relations among these neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless ; and every college must see that its highest interest lies in this direction , and be disposed heartily to favor any arrangement that clearly promotes this end . It would seem that this must be , in a measure , the result of intercollegiate contests ; and so far this consideration makes in their favor . Some question might arise as to the kind and degree of the acquaintauce and fellowship to be thus secured ; whether it would not be confined chiefly to the students . the least permanent part of the college community , and to a small part of them ; whether the mutual knowledge thus gained would not be very superficial and limited to a few , and those not the most significant , points of common interest . Certainly the colleges are not shut up to this single mode of intercommunication , to this special basis of friendly relation . The various assoeiations of college officers throughout the land afford at least as sure a means of mutual knowledge and good fellowship as these contests. 4 . Kindred to this , yet distinct enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by bringing difthreut colleges into friendly rivalry and healthful competition these contests react favorably upon the general spirit and work of these colleges . Excellences and deficiencies in the training and regulations of the competing colleges will be made to appear in these contests ; and a very powerful influence will be developed by the publicity of the contest and of its result to correct the latter and extend the former . The colleges that afford superior facilities // for culture and secure higher results will be recognized as doing this , and will thus exert a wider influence in improving the educational forces of the country . The colleges that are deficient will be forced to mark the fact more distinctly , and will be incited to attempt and to accomplish more work and a higlier-style of work . The force of this argument seems to be confined to such contests as have for their object some exercise which is included in the regular drill of the college ; it can not apply in the case of regattas or matched games of base ball . If the contest involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of a competitive examination , there is real weight in the claim before us. o . It may sometimes be urged that these contests are of value as affording the public the means of comparing the relative merits of the colleges concerned in them . But any one who knows upon what almost incidental and trivial points the decision in such contests often turns , even when they are most fairly conducted ; how imperfect a reflection of the college and of its real work any single student , even though he be most judiciously selected , must necessarily be ; and how extremely few points in the training of a college can be brought out and made the subject of a contest ; anyone , observing these things , will be slow to give much weight to this.claim . Probably this claim is not often seriously maintained . Other claims may be made out for these contests ; but those already cited cover the essential points in the defence . We proceed , therefore , to consider their objectionable features , the dangers and evils that have already appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with them . 1 . We name first among the objections that lie against intercollegiate contests , that they necessarily distract the attention of those students who are at all interested in them from the regular daily work which the college requires , and engross an undue amount of time and strength and thought ; and the greater the interest in them the greater must be the diversion and distraction . Those who give enough attention to rowing or oratory to be successful in these special exercises are almost sure to fail in other points , and those such as are vitally connected with their success as students . // Thorough , broad , well compacte ( l scholarship , the style of culture the college is meant to yield , can be gained only by making it the leading and engrossing aim , by giving the best and largest part of one 's enthusiasm and strength to the prescribed work , and by making all things bend to this distinctly cherished end . Tn just so far as these contests call our students away from the patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all favor , the fixed habit of which is the best result our college system yields ; in just so far they are antagonistic to the very aim of the college training , an evil which it is difficult to see what possible good that comes from them can at all counterbalance . And that this is an almost unvarying result of these contests , the nature of the case makes certain , and well attested facts clearly demonstrate . And where this disturbing force affects any considerable number of the students in a college , the general scholarship of the classes and of the college can not but be more or less seriously lowered . Not individuals alone are affected injuriously , but the discipline arid culture of the whole college suffer actual loss . One who is thoroughly conversant with the facts of which he speaks , as they have appeared in Amherst College , says : " They ( the ilegattas ) have occupied so much of the time and engrossed so much of the thought and feeling of the rowers , that their scholarship has uniformly suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . They have been a source of irregularity in attendance on college exercises , and so of disturbance to the classes and to the college . " The demonstrated advantages of an arrangement that involves such mischief should be many and great to warrant its introduction or continued existence . 2 . Intercollegiate contests are also objectionable because they tend to exa*gerate the importance of certain kinds of skill and power to the disparagement of the many-sided generous culture which the college seeks to give . The latter is slow and difficult to win , and is not adapted to produce striking effects or make an imposing display . The former is comparatively easy to gain , and commands a prompt , if somewhat tinsel , reputation . A factitious value seems to centre in these special subjects , and the publicity of the trial and the honor that may // be won in them , make the ordinary work of the student seem dull and prosaic . A well known college officer in a western State , who has observed carefully the workings of the Intercollegiate Oratorical Contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generally favorable results thus far , adds ; " The thing that needs to be guarded against is the tendency to magnify the rhetorical work beyond its due proportion in the course of training , so as with some to hinder full fidelity to the regular drill . We hold all steadily to regular work , making no allowance for these special appointments . Still the tendency is revealed , and we are warned of a danger in that direction . " The ambition to be a good oar , or a fine writer , or a finished orator , will in many cases supplant the purpose of mastering all the branches of polite learning ; and weaken the powers , and wofully cripple the career of any one who yields to this tendency . And there is no thoughtful college officer who will not deplore this tendency as a very great evil ; one which the scholarship of the country can ill afford to encounter . We need to cherish every force that favors sound learning , wide and accurate and catholic culture , and that creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous fruits . Our college system , as it matures and consolidates , is working strongly and healthfully in this direction ; and we can not too zealously guard it from any modification or specious enlargement which shall turn it aside from its legitimate aim , or hinder its steady , sound development according to its fundamental ideas . If it were to be urged that rowing , for example , furnishes an excellent and manly exercise ; and that it is possible and even desirable to connect with the purely intellectual training of our colleges something which shall also train the body and keep it in wholesome condition , and yet not interfere in the least with the most faithful performance of regular college duties : or that oratorical contests simply call for the comparative exhibition of such skill and training in this art of oratory as the colleges secure , and that , therefore , these contests can be made to work in , naturally and with healthful effect , along with the stated requirements of the college : the answer in either case seems // to be obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But experience assures us that such limitations and due restrictions upon these contests , as would effectually guard against their interrupting the proper discipline of the college , would at once strip them of half their attractiveness and make it well nigh impossible to snstain them . They are rarely , if ever , conducted on such wise and moderate principles ; and if they were , the special interest they are meant to arouse would fail to be awakened , and it would require special governmental interference to keep them in operation . 3 . These contests can not well be kept free from personal rivalries and jealousies ; and judging from past experience , they are almost as likely to put colleges in antagonism and heated opposition to each other as to establish and cultivate friendly relations . This is not a necessary result ; is not at all an intended or anticipated result ; is probably not the uniform result in fact . Yet human nature remaining unchanged , with all the contingencies that must attend such public competitions , the facility , the ahnost certainty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision turns ; it is not unreasonable to apprehend that the mutual relations of the competing colleges might not be greatly improved by this kind of association . Not that colleges are natural foes to each other ; but that here the seeds of enmities see*n to be planted in the very substance of the intercourse it is proposed to establish between them . This evil might be much less and less imminent in those contests which involve only intellectual powers and acquirements ; and perhaps it might in all cases be effectually overcome . But it would require , to secure this , constant watchfnlness , an intelligent and determined purpose , on the part of all concerned in these contests ; a degree of steadiness and selfcontrol which undergraduates do not always exhibit . 4 . These contests are not a fair criterion of what the colleges do , or aim to do . The objects embraced in them must be vastly extended , and their conditions almost fundamentally changed , before this can be the case . Applying to special subjects , and those for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper work of the colleges , these contests // are more likely to stimulate conceit than to correct it ; and are I ) retty sure , if they affect public opinion at all , to give a false and partial impression in regard to the character and work of the colleges represented in them . The best criterion of what a college is , and of the work it does , is the result of its regular stated discipline as that is to be found in its graduates from year to year ; and this criterion is open to every one 's observation and is presented in a way to be most dispassionately judged . And by this standard , so far as there is any occasion for such a decision to be formed , the public will naturally determine the merits of the various colleges that come under their view . Thus colleges are already put upon a competitive trial on a grand s*cale before the general public , without any such special arrangements as these contests involve ; a trial which covers all parts of their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and is subject to revision as often as the changing facts in the case demand it . And this general trial reacts , in an effective and thoroughly healthful way , to correct faults , to overcome deficiencies , and to tone up the drill of the colleges to the highest attainable degree . 5 . Another feature of these contests which exposes them to danger , and must render their influence uncertain , is the fact that they are under the control of undergraduates , in circumstances where the public opinion of their own colleges or of the community at large can not make itself effectively felt ; men who are to a great extent irresponsible to any tribunal , liable to whims and caprices , not always having the good of their college or of the college system at heart . The good sense and genuine manliness of our undergraduates would greatly counteract this danger , so far as they could make themselves felt and heard . The force of public opinion might be expected to exert a check upon excesses , and positive obvious evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these checks , no one could be thoroughly assured that these contests would be steered clear of the manifold and marked dangers that lie along their course . Without enumerating other disadvantages , and conceding that there may be advantages of real weight not set down in // this discussion , we will leave the subject at this point . The weight of considerations seems on the whole to be against these contests ; at least , it is sufficient to make us hesitate before embarking , or encouraging our students to embark , in this kind of intercollegiate association . It is probable that some of these evils would be less serious in an Oratorical or Rhetorical contest than in a Regatta . It may be possible to combine the interest and work in preparation for such contests with the regular work of the college without detriment to the drill of the college or the culture of its students . But experience alone can make us sure of this , and for that we shall not have long to wait . The Literary Contests between Eastern Colleges , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a large scale and furnishing the means of a Soun ( l conclusion in this matter . The friends of colleges and of the genuine culture and manliness they are meant to nourish will follow this experiment with a careful eye , and will weigh , with dispassionate thought , its asceitained results .
