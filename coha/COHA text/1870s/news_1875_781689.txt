txt BRIGHAM YOUNG 'S case before Judge MCKEAN is a peculiar one . In fact , the original decision against the Prophet and in favor of ANN ELIZA , the nineteenth wife , was peculiar . This is all owing to the fact that Mormon marriage is an anomalous institution . The plea of BRIGFIAM YOUNG , in answer to ANN ELIZA 'S suit for divorce , was that she was not his lawful wife . It was argued by YOUNG 'S counsel that the woman whom he married in Ohio , in 1837 , ( the original Mrs. YOUNG , as we should say , ) was his only lawful and . wedded wife . It was further claimed that the tie which united ANN ELIZA , Number Nineteen , to him was a religious one , sanctioned by the Church of the Latter Day Saints . Judge McKEasr , however , decided that a divorce should . be granted to the applicant ; and he adjudged . that the Prophet pay the counsel fees ? $3,000-due from his now divorced wife , and also pay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been before the court nineteen months , BRIGHAM 'S accumulated . debt to his " false , fleeting " ANN ELIZA . is $9,500 , to say nothing of the fees . He failed to respond with the cash ; and , as the time for paying the counsel fees was limited by order of the court , he was adjudged to be , in contempt , and was fined $25 and sent to jail for one day . He paid the fine and the counsel fees , and . went to jail . What course he will pursue in regard . to the alimony decreed is not yet made known . It is not likely that he will pay it unless compelled by legal process . But if the spectacle of a Mormon prophet in jail is a queer one , the way by which ne reached it is stranger still . Whatever may have been the spiritual relation existing between Ass ELIZA and BRIGHAM YOUNG , she was never legally married to him . He was married , under the laws of the State of Ohio , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from whom he has never been separated . That woman being his lawful and . wedded wife , all contracts of a like nature with other women are void . There is no occasion for a divorce under the laws of the United States for the release of a woman whose husband is found to have a living wife from whom he has not been legally divorced . The original obligation is binding ; all others of a like character are vitiated . Judge McKBAN 's decision in Ass ELIZA 's favor practically legalizes all of YouNG 's extra marriages  --  and there are many of them . Moreover , no deception was practiced upon ANN ELIZA , so far as the fact of YOUNG 'S previous condition of marriage was concerned . When she accepted . him as her husband , she did it in full knowledge of his much-marriedness , if we may be allowed that word . To be sure , she pleads the " Baby act , " as it is called , claiming that she was too young to understand what she was doing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family relations of the head of the Mormon Church are well known throughout Mormondom . There is no flavor of Enoch Arden , male or female , about this matrimonial complication . Yet ANN ELIZA , after several years ' experience in the harem , suddenly finds that her husband has at least twenty other wives , and that she can not endure so many in one family . Moreover , the court , in divorcing ANN ELIZA , declares that she is Mrs. BRIGHAM YOUNG No. 19 , legally the wife of the said YOUNG , and therefore entitled to alimony and . due allowance for counsel fees in her suit for divorce from her late lawful husband . All this seems very absurd . A legal plural marriage is simply impossible in the United States . One of the weak points in the Mormon system was shown in the answer of YOUNG to the suit of ANN Eliza . He affirmed that he had but one lawful wife , married in Ohio years ago . This official and public declaration put the stigma of " concubine " on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lawfully married to the Prophet . Judge McICEAN 's decision practically marries them all . We shudder to think of the possible consequences to the Prophet if these houris of his harem should strike for their legal rights . Each one is entitled . to a divorce with alimony at the rate of $500 a month . Should any considerable number of the Mesdames YOUNG take the trouble to get a divorce , their combined demands for alimony would make a serious drain on the wealth in which BRIGHAM is popularly supposed to revel . And what with paving his own lawyers ' fees , and those of his recreant spouses , in case of a combined attack , the hapless Prophet would be brought to bankruptcy in his old age . He might better stay in jail out of harm 's way . But if these superfluous wives are satisfied to remain , they may rest easy , so far as all doubts about their legal status are concerned . In this country a woman can not secure a divorce unless she is a legal wife . As.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her associate Mesdames YOUNG were lawfully married . We commend this syllogism , and the accompanying case , to the patient student of the Mormon problem .
