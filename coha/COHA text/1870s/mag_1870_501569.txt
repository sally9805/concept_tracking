THERE are , who wonder whether , in the flight Which gracious beings make from star to star , They pause to mark our dim and distant earth , And speak with pity of the feeble folk Who dream their empty dreams of after life , Build temples for a host of warring creeds , And die ; and with their corporal substance lose All individual thought and memory . But what sad echo from that height of stars Started this dream of heaven 's contempt of men ? I 've stood at midnight when the world was still ; Nor cricket 's chirp nor rustling breath of trees Marred the vast stillness of the steadfast stars . Then , with my soul ' I 've swept those silent depths , That deeper grew still , as I soared within them . The glittering points strown on the face of heaven Rounded to worlds immense , receding , far In mighty ponderous flight through separate spheres , Each wide enough to gird a universe . Yet , as one wind breathes o'er the clustering heads Of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor timid nor elate , Breathed through those hosts of worlds , and filled the voids Betwixt the sundered orbs with human thought , Harmonious as praise . Then had I seen , Though far as Sirius , a shining train Of seraphs errant on the work of God , I would have hailed them with a brother 's speech I hail them now-though not with sight or voice ; Spirit to spirit speaks : " Hail , sons of God Who , mightier than we , can serve Him more , Yet are no more His sons . " Who hears their sighs Of taunting pity sifting through the air ? Who hears them tell us that our dying flesh Measures our greatness and predicts our end ? Or that , because our bodies soon must fail , Our separate souls , distinct and keen as theirs Must lose their individual hold of thought And merge in indistinguishable being ? When dropped that dismal gospel from the sky ? // Then who , the words unheard , shall claim the power To read them on the far unlettered scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confess That to the nature which he scans so well He stands compared as do the beasts to men ? The beast that guesses what a man can think Is beast no more , but fellow of the man . And when a human seer takes his flight To farthest heaven , only to bring back Heaven 's hypothetic scorn of human beasts , I wonder much at that strange , bestial flightThat mighty argument for impotence . Yet who shall tell ? May not the guess be true , Since knowledge of eternal things to men Is unrevealed , and at the best but breathes Through things created ; may not words like these Oft fall from seraph lips ? Alas , who knows ? I know- " I know that my Redeemer lives . " I ask no doubtful whisper from the stars . The round green earth , that hangs amidst their light , And gathers influence from all the sky , To warm and feed my weak and wasting frame , Has drunk a promise from the upper heaven , And keeps it for her sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from stately hills Nor whispering streams , she speaks that treasured word . But when men die , and to her friendly breast She takes their dust , then through the opened grave Steals forth the deathless cadence of that song Which Christ the victor sang among the dead : " I am the resurrection and the life ; He that believes in me shall never die . " So in the midnight when the world is still , And my rapt soul sweeps through the teeming stars Straight to God 's throne , I will not ask nor brook Pity nor scorn , though from a seraph 's lips . My conscious spirit shall converse with God , My dying flesh draw comfort from its tomb , And answering echoes from the earth and sky Meet in the air where my dear Lord shall come . Hark ! how the heavens grow silvery with song . The dark sky kindles into bloom of light . It is God 's host . See where the Prince of Life Rears his near throne amid their glittering ranks . He speaks the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In ranks as bright As heaven itself has poured through gates of pearl , Break from their tombs the hidden sons of God . Joy answers joy . The nearing anthems blend ; Seraphs and men meet at the throne of Christ ; And death is swallowed up in victory . H. D. GANSE. // THE Editor of THE GALAXY , in giving place to the subjoined letter from a well-known public man and jurist , reminds the reader of the principle upon which this magazine is conducted-that of giving free scope to the expression of individual opinions . To the Honorable HENRY WILSON , Senator from Massachusetts : IN the February number of the " Atlantic Monthly " appeared an article of yours entitled " Edwin M. Stanton . " It contains some statements which are very wonderful , if true ; and if false , they ought to be corrected . I ask you to review this production in the light of certain facts which I shall now take the liberty to mention . My principal object is to satisfy you that you have wholly misunderstood the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you supposed to be a panegyric . But before I begin that , suffer me to correct some of your errors about other persons . In your vituperative description of the Buchanan administration , you allege that " the President and his Attorney-General surrendered the Government 's right of self-preservation " and " pronounced against its power to coerce a seceding State . " You refer manifestly to the opinion of the Attorney-General , dated the 20th of November , i86o , defining the duties and powers of the President , and to the public acts of the President which show that he took the advice of the Law Department and squared his conduct accordingly . Upon this ground mainly , if not entirely , you denounce that administration as not only weak and unpatriotic , but wilfully wicked and treasonable . I propose to show that you have committed a cardinal error , if not something worse . The coarse way in which you charge the dead as well as the living with the highest crimes , would justify a reply in language much plainer than I intend to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind are so loose and inaccurate , that it is necessary to furnish you with an idea of certain elementary principles which to most other men are too familiar to talk about . i . The government of the United States is the Constitution and laws . 2 . The preservation of the government consists in maintaining the supremacy of the Constitution and laws . 3 . For this purpose certain coercive powers are delegated to the Executive , which he may use to defend the laws when they are resisted . 4 . But in this country , as in every other , except where the government is an absolute despotism , the authority of the Chief Magistrate is limited and his hands are tied up by legal restrictions , to prevent him from using physical for&amp;e against the life , liberty , and property of his fellow-citizens , unless in certain prescribed ways and on proper occasions . * . He is bound by his inaugural oath to keep within those limits ; if he breaks the laws , he destroys the government ; he can not stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else will strike it in the face . 6 . The government of the United States , within its proper sphere , is a soyerezgn , as much as the States are sovereign within their sphere . It acts immediately upon the people and claims their direct obedience to its laws . As a State can not make war upon a city , county , or town , and put all its inhabitants to the sword because some of them have acted or threatened to act illegally , so // the General Government is also restrained from exterminating the whole population of a State for the offences , actual or intended , of some who live among them . 7 . The so-called ordinances of secession in i86o- ' 6i were the declarations of certain persons who made them that they in/ended to disobey the Jaws of the United States . It was the duty of Congress and the President to see that forcible resistance to the laws , when actually made , should be met by a counter-force sufficient to put it down ; but neither Congress nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by anticipation , against all the people at once , and put them all in the attitude of public enemies without regard to their personal guilt or innocence . The opinion of the Attorney-General , which you have garbled , and the messages of President Buchanan , assert these principles in plain English words . We held that the whole coercive power of the United States , delegated by the Constitution to every branch of the government , judicial , legislative , and executive , including its military and naval force , might and ought , in the appointed way , to be used to maintain the supremacy of the laws against all opposers , to hold or retake the public property , and to collect the revenue . But we asserted , also , that powers not given ought not to be usurped , and that war upon a State , in the then circumstances of the country , would be , not only usurpation , but destruction of the Union . Of course , you can not be so ignorant of the fundamental Jaw as not to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never pretended - no man with sense enough to know his right hand from his left ever will pretend-that the President had constitutional or legal authority to make an aggr*ssive war against the States by his own act , nor had Congress any such power . But you think I ought not to have answered the President 's questions truly , and that he ought not to have been influenced by constitutional scruples . That is the rub . There is no dispute-never was , and never can be-about the law ; but Mr. Buchanan 's wickedness and treason consisted in obeying it when you think he ought to have broken it . For this cause you try to excite against his memory those bad party passions by which he was hounded and persecuted during all the last years of his life . I will make no effort to convince you that Mr. Buchanan was right in standing by the Constitution which he had sworn to preserve , protect , and defend . That I know would be altogether hopeless . The declared admirer of John Brown , the political ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate of general kidnapping and special murder by military commissions , the open supporter of measures which abolish the right of trial by jury and build up an Asiatic despotism on the ruins of free government-such a man would entirely misunderstand the reason ( simple as it is ) upon which I put the justification of a dead President for refusing to perjure himself . But , if I can not /us/ify , perhaps I can excuse him . I will offer some apologies which may possibly disarm your censure , or at least mitigate the severity of your righteous indignation . In the first place , then , Mr. Buchanan was born of Christian parents and educated in a Christian community . All his lifetime , and at the moment of his death , he felt that fear of God which a respectable authority has declared to be , not weakness , but the " beginning of wisdom " and the only source of true greatness . The corruptions introduced into the church by the political preachers of New England never reached him . He was simply a Christian man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament . Now , you know ( at all events you // must have heard ) that persons who adhere to that kind of religion always contract a habit of regarding the violation of an oath with inexpressible horror , whether it be committed by an officer or a witness ; whether the object of it be to destroy the character of a political opponent , to promote the interests of a party , or to enslave a State . All kinds of false swearing are alike to them . They stubbornly reject the reasoning which seeks to convince them that observance of oaths by magistrates and legislators is a mere question of expediency and selfinterest , varying with circumstances . Mr. Buchanan being a man of this class , I submit the question whether his prejudices against perjury ( unreasonable as you may think them ) are not entitled to some little respect . Apart from the religious obligation of his oath , he loved the Constitution of his country on its own account , as the best government the world ever saw . I do not expect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged . But can you not make some allowance for his attachment to that great compact which was framed by our forefathers to secure union , justice7 peace , State independence , and individual liberty for ourselves and our posterity ? Another thing : All his predecessors governed their conduct by similar notions of fidelity to the Constitution . In peace and in war , in prosperity and disaster , through all changes , in spite of all threats and provocations , they had kept their oaths and assumed no ungranted power . It was the most natural thing in the world for Mr. Buchanan to follow the example of such men as Washington , Madison , and Jackson , rather than the precepts of those small but ferocious politicians who thought their own passions and interests a " higher law " than the law of the country . Again : All his advisers-not I alone , but all of them-expressed the clear and unhesitating opinion that his view of the law on the subject of coercing States was right . His legal duty being settled , not one among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides : There was a question of natural justice , as well as legal propriety , involved in making war upon the States at that time . Nine-tenths of the Southern people were thoroughly devoted to the Union , and had committed no sin against it even in thought . Would it have been well to bring the visitation of fire , sword , and famine upon whole communities of innocent persons ? You will probably answer this in the affirmative . You think that no opportunity to shed the blood and plunder the property of men , women , and children who live b*-yond the Potomac ought ever to be lost . Mr. Buchanan might have seized that occasion to imitate John Brown on a large scale , and thus made himself an " heroic character " in your eyes . But you must be aware that he would have been regarded by the mass of men as a moral monster ; and the admiration of yourself and your party in Massachusetts would have been but a poor compensation for the eternal weight of infamy with which the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still : You know that the General-in-Chief of the army had reported five companies as the whole available force for operations in the South , and you never proposed to increase it . Yet you wanted war . Why ? You must have desired the Union cause to be disgraced and defeated , for nothing else could have resulted from such a war as you now abuse Mr. Buchanan for not making . You and your party in Congress were strictly non-committal . You did not recommend peace , nor offer your support to war . You would take neither the olive branch nor the sword . You refused to settle , and you made no preparation for a contest . But you reveal now what was then the secret desire of your heart-. // that the administration , in defiance of law and without means , would leclare war on its own responsibility . This would have been an expulsion of the Southern States from the Union , for it would have placed all their people beyond the protection of Federal law ; they would necessarily rise in self-defence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight ; before the fourth of March the independence of the South would be a settled fact . Moreover , as you and your party friends in Congress did not call for a war , the President had a right ( had he not ? ) to suppose that you approved of his determination to keep the peace . Perhaps your approval of his conduct is not very powerful evidence of its justice or legality . But here is the point : How can you have the face to denounce a man as a criminal , after he is dead , for public acts which you consented to by your silence at the time they were done ? But this is not all . You give your unqualified approbation to Mr. Lincoln 's administration . I do not say you were true to it ( for I believe the evidence is extant which proves that you were not ) ; but you have lauded it as strong and faithful . Mr. Lincoln adopted precisely the same legal principles with regard to the coercion of the States that Mr. Buchanan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond him . He avowed his intention not to make war or provoke it as plainly as his predecessor had ever done . Neither he nor his Attorney-General asserted their constitutional authority to commence aggressive and general hostilities for any cause then existing . He received commissioners from the Southern States . He pledged himself not to retake the forts , arsenals , dockyards , custom-houses , etc. , then in the hands of the secessionists . He promised to continue the mail service in the seceded States if they would permit him . He went further still , and publicly assured the Southern people that he would not irritate them by attempting to execute the Federal laws at any place where it would be specially offensive to them . All these were concessions to the South which Mr. Buchanan had steadily refused to make ; and if he had made them , you would no doubt have pronounced them treasonable . But the Lincoln administration did not stop there . That Cabinet voted six to one infa*vor of szerrendering Fort Sumter-Mr . Blair being the only dissentient . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have wavered a considerable time ; the Secretary of State was so sure of him that he caused the South Carolina authorities to be informed that the fort would be given us . You will not deny these facts , but you will continue , as heretofore , to say that the Buchanan administration weakly and wickedly favored secession , while that of Lincoln was firmly and faithfully opposed . The man who involves himself in such inconsistencies , whether from want of information , want of judgment , or want of veracity , is not qualified to write on an historical subject . I have given more time and space than I intended to this part of your paper . But I am addressing a man of peculiar character . To a person whose moral perceptions are healthy and natural , I could make my defence in a breath . But being required to apologize for not violating a sworn duty , some circumlocution is necessary . Your mere railing accusations against Mr. Buchanan are hardly worth a reply . The place he is destined to occupy in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . You have no knowledge whatever of his character . Morally , intellectually , and politically he was altogether too much of a man for you to comprehend . The world will look for its information concerning him to the acts of his life , and to the testimony of men who knew him and had minds large enough to take in his dimensions . I would not offer you the word of a Dem // ocrat ; but among those who were with him continually during the last weeks of*his administration are some who have since supported Radical measures with a zeal warm enough to make them good witnesses . Let General Dix speak his knowledge and say whether he saw anything of the treason , the weakness , or the wickedness which you impute so boldly and so recklessly . Mr. King , the Postmaster-General , can not be ignorant of any important fact which bears on this question . Mr. Holt has already , on several occasions , delivered his testimony . It is a fervent tribute to the " wise statesmanship and unsullied patriotism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm and generous support " which he constantly gave to men and measures approved by his conscience . The proofs of his great ability and his eminent public services are found on every page of his country 's history from 1820 to i86i . During all that long period he steadily , faithfully , and powerfully sustained the principles of free constitutional government . This nation never had a truer friend , nor its laws a defender who would more cheerfully have given his life to save them from violation . No man was ever slandered so brutally . His life 's life was literally lied away . In the last months of his administration he devoted all the energies of his mind and body to the great duty of saving the Union , if possible , from dissolution and civil war . He knew all the dangers to which it was exposed , and it would , therefore , be vain to say that he was not alarmed for his country ; but he showed no sign of unmanly fear on his own account . He nwt all his vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no case did he shrink from or attempt to evade them . The accusation of timidity and indecision is most preposterous . His faults were all of another kind : his resolutions once formed were generally immovable to a degree that bordered on obstinacy . On every matter of great importance he deliberated cautiously , and sometimes tried the patience of his friends by refusing to act until he had made up an opinion which he could live and die by . These characteristics explain the fact that his whole political life , from the time he entered Congress until he retired from the Presidency-all his acts , speeches , and papers-have a consistency which belongs to those of no other American statesman . He never found it necessary to cross his own path or go back upon his pledges . His judgment was of course not infallible ; and in x86r he announced a determination with reference to the South Carolina commissioners which I and others thought erroneous but unchangeable . Most unexpectedly , and altogether contrary to his usual habit of steadfast self-reliance , he consented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the circumstances which brought it about , Were alike honorable to his understanding and his heart . I admit that you were not the first inventor of these slanders ; but you ought to know that it does not become a man in your station to take up an evil report and repeat it , like a parrot , without stopping to consider whether it has any foundation or not . You are not content with traducing Mr. Buchanan himself ; you take up the heads of departments who served under him , and deal out your denunciations upon nearly all in succession . The Secretary of the Treasury , you say , was deranging the finances and sinking the national credit . Upon whom does this fall ? Was it Cobb , or Thomas , or Dix that committed that crime ? The charge is equally untrue whether made against one or another . You never saw a scintilla of evidence to justify it . You tell your readers that the Secretary of War scattered the army and rent guns and munitions to the secessionists . Whatever Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well established that he never did this . Numerous charges // have been , and others might be , made against that officer with sor*ie show of truth . It is curious that your appetite for scandal could be satisfied only by selecting one which is well known to be unfounded . You inform the country that the Secretary of the Navy rendered that arm *t5owerless . This is not a new charge . It has been made several times before , and solemnly investigated more than once . Not only has it never been supported , but it has uniformly been met by such evidence of Mr. Toucey 's perfect integrity that every respectable man among his political enemies acquits him without hesitation . In your present reiteration of it , you are simply bearing false witness against your neighbor , in flat violation of the ninth commandment . But perhaps the most extraordinary of all your averments is , that the Secretary of the Interior term it/ed the robbery of trust funds . You did not mean it to be understood that a robbery occurred which he knew nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as innocent as any other man . You intended to make the impression that he wilfully gave his permission to the criminal asportation of the funds in question , made himself an accessory to the felony before the fact , and was as guilty as if he had done it with his own hands . You could not possibly have believed this , unless you perversely closed your eyes against the light of plain truth . All the circumstances of the transaction to which you refer are as well understood as anything in the history of the country . A committee of Congress , consisting of members opposed to the Secretary , examined the evidence when it was fresh , and reported upon it . The correctness of them judgment has never been impugned . In the face of these recorded and well-known facts , you deliberately sit down and write out , or get somebody to write and publish to the world on your authority , the accusation that Mr. Thompson has committed an offence which should make him infamous forever . The force of mendacity can go no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the modern sense of the word , and a Senator in Congress from a most loyal State ; and it is equally true that Mr. Thompson was a rebel ; that he was for years an exile from his home and country , pursued wherever he went by an Executive proclamation which put a price on his head . This gives you an immense advantage over him . But the fact is still true that no department of this government was ever managed more ably or more faithfully than the Interior while he was at the head of it . You may have all the benefit of loyalty , and you may weigh him down with the huge burden of rebellion ; nevertheless , his mental ability , good sense , and common honesty put him so immeasurably far above you , that you will never in this life be able to get a horizontal view of his character . I come now to the more important part of your article , which directly concerns Mr. Stanton . Your attacks upon Buchanan , Toucey , and Thompson might be safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish if it be not defended against your praise . You give us the first information we ever had that Mr. Stanton , though acting with the Democratic party , was an abolitionist at heart almost from his earliest youth . For this fact you vouch his declaration to Judge Chase more than thirty years ago , at Columbus , Ohio ; and you attempt to corroborate it by citing his association at Washington with Dr. Bailey and other abolitionists . If you tell the truth , he was the most marvellous impostor that ever lived or died . Among us , his political principles were thought to be as well known as his name and occupation . He never allowed his fidelity to be doubted for one moment . It was perfectly understood that he had no affinities whatever with men of your school in morals or politics . His condemnation of the abolitionists was un // sparing for their hypocrisy , their corruption , their enmity to the Constitution , and their lawless disregard for the rights of States and individuals . ThUs he won the confidence of Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his business , and gave him office , honor , and fortune . But , according to your account , he was all the while waiting and hoping for the time to come when he could betray the Constitution and its friends into the cruel clutches of their enemies . For this cold-blooded and deliberate treachery you bespeak the admiration of ihe American people . You might as well propose to canonize Judas Iscariot . I maintain , on the other hand , that he was what he seemed to be , a sound arid sincere friend , political and personal , of the men who showered their favors on his head . He had at least the average amount of attachment for " the Constitution of the United States , and for the peace , good order , and happiness of the same . " As a necessary consequence , he dreaded the dishonest and destructive rule which he foresaw that you would be sure to establish as soon as you could . His democracy did not cease when the war opened . In the summer of x86i , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the kidnapping of innocent citizens , by the suppression of free speech , and by the enslavement of the press , he imprecated the vengeance of God and the law upon the guilty authors of those crimes with as much energy as any Democrat in the nation . Only a short time before his appointment as Secretary of War his love of liberty and legal justice impelled him to curse Mr. Lincoln himself with bitter curses . He called him by contemptuous names , and with simian , if not with " swinish phrase soiled his addition . " I admit that he changed these sentiments afterwards , but I deny that he had adopted your way of thinking while he pretended to concur in ours . His conversion was a real one , produced by what he regarded as " good and sufficient reasons him thereunto moving , " and it was accompanied , or immediately followed , by a corresponding change of his party attitude . He was not what you make him out , a mere fawning hypocrite . The issue is plainly made . The friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of the world , after death has disarmed him of the power of self-defence . You must prove the injurious allegations you make , or else accept the just consequences . If the Chief Justice will say that he knows Mr. Stanton to have been " in entire agreement " with the abolition party thirty years ago , his testimony may silence denial . But you . must not trifle with us ; we will hold you to strict proof ; hearsay evidence will not be received ; least of all will the fact be admitted , upon the second-hand statement of a person who thinks , as you manifestly do think , that deception , fraud , and false pretences are an honor to the man who practised them . Next in chronological order is your assertion that Mr. Stanton , while yet a private citizen , advised Mr. Buchanan that it was the duty and the right of the Federal Government to coerce seceding States ; that is to say , make war against all the inhabitants of every State in which an ordinance of secession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how plain a tale will put you down . Mr. Stanton never was consulted on that subject by the President until after he was Attorney-General ; and he never at any time gave such advice as you put into his mouth . He never entertained any opinion of that kind , for he was a lawyer of large capacity and could not believe an absurdity . He had too much regard for his professional character to maintain a legal proposition which he knew to be false . He certainly would not have so debased himself in the eyes of the // Jui* , administration with whom he was particularly desirous , at that times to stand well . On this point I wish to be very distinct . I aver that Mr. Stanton thoroughly , cordially , and constantly approved of and concurred in the constitutional doctrines which you denounce as timid and treasonable . He indorsed the opinion of his predecessor with extravagant and undeserved laudation ; he gave his adhesion to the annual message in many ways ; and the special message of 8th January , i86r , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read over to him before it was sent to Congresr , and it received his unqualified assent . The existing evidence of this can be easily adduced : it is direct as well as circumstantial , oral as well as documentary , and some of it is in the handwriting of Mr. Stanton himself . If you are willing to put the question into a proper form for judicial investigation , I will aid you in doing so , and give you an opportunity to make out your case before an impartial tribunal . If your statement be true that Mr. Stanton disbelieved in the principles to which the administration was unchangeably pledged , how did he come to take office under it ? Was he so anxious for public employment that he consented to give up his own convictions and assist in carrying out measures which his judgment condemned as the offspring of timidity and treason ? Or , did he accept the confidence of the President and the Cabinet with a predetermined intent to betray it ? Either way you make him guilty of unspeakable baseness . But conceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the consent of his advisers , give the appointment to a man whom they knew to be hostile to them upon points so vital not only to the public interests but their own characters ? That at such a time they would invite an undisguised enemy into their counsels , is a tale as wildly improbable as any that ever was swallowed by the credulity of the Salem witch-finders . Your own consciousness of this compels you to explain by attributing it to a special intervention of Divine Providence . Your impious theory is that Almighty God procured this appointment miraculously , in order that you , the enemies of the American Constitution , might have a spy in the camp of its friends . This will not serve your turn . Reason never refers a human event to supernatural agency , unless it be impossible to account for it in any other way . The mystery of this case is easily cleared up by the hypothesis that you have misrepresented it from beginning to end ; which is no miracle at all , but quite in the natural order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect accord with the administration , before and after he became a part of it , on every question of fundamental principle . He had unlimited confidence in the men with whom he was acting , and they confided in him . For his chief and some of his colleagues he professed an attachment literally boundless ; for all of them who stayed during the term , and for Thompson , who did not stay , he was warm in his friendship . You would now have us believe that these were merely the arts of an accomplished impostor ; that while he was , in appearance , zealously cooperating with us , he was reporting to you that " he saw treason in every part of the government ; " and that he was secretly using all the means in his power to stir up the vilest passions against us . Some overt acts of the treachery you ascribe to him are curious ; for instance , the Sumner story , which you tell with singular brevity and coolness . Mr. Sumner called on him at his office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not receive his visitor either with the politeness of a gentleman or the courtesy due to a Senator , much less with the cordiality of a friend ; but hustled him out of the building as if ashamed to be seen with him in daylight . He // told him expressly that he did not dare to converse with him there , but would see him at one o'clock that night . The hour came , and then , when the city Was wrapped in sleep , he skulked away to the meeting place , where , under the cover of darkness , he *vhispered the tales which he did not dare to utter in the hearing of the parties they were intended to ruin . And those parties were his friends and benefactors ! Into what unfathomed gulfs of moral degradation must the man have fallen who could be guilty of this ! But remember , this is another second-hand story , and you are not a competent witness . We will trouble you to call Mr ? Sumner , if you please . Let him testify what treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this midnight and secret information against men whom he was afraid to confront is consistent with Mr. Stanton 's character as a courageous , outspoken , and honest man . He said nothing whatever to us about the treason which he saw in every part of the government . He made no report of his discoveries to the President . He maintained unbroken his fraternal relations with his colleagues . By your own account , he admitted to Mr. Sumner that he did not dare to steak of such a thing even in his own office , lest it might reach the ears of his associates in the administration . Among the members of Congress whom you name as the recipients of his secret communications , not one man of moderate views is included ; much less did he speak to any friend of the parties accused . He cautiously selected their bitterest enemies , and poured his venom into hearts already festering with spite . The House raised a committee " to investigate treasonable machinations and conspiracies , " upon which there were members of both parties . Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor did he mention the subject to Cochrane , Reynolds , or Branch ; but he " made an arrangement by which Messrs . Howard and Dawes were informed " of whatever they wanted to know . It appears , too , that a committee of vigilance was organized by the more active Republican members of Congress ; in other words , the extreme partisans of both Houses got up a secret body of their own , not to perform any legal duty pertaining to their offices , not to devise public measures for averting the ruin which threatened the country , but to prowl about in the dark for something to gratify personal malice or make a little capital for their party . You were a member of that committee , as it was fit you should be , and Mr. Stanton gave you " warnings and suggestions " how to proceed . This is what you call " rising in that crisis above the claims of partisanship . " At night he assisted you to rake the sewers in search of materials to bespatter his colleagues , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his distinguished consideration . " It was thus that , in your estimation , " he consecrated himself to the lofty duties of an exa/ted patriotism . " What cargoes of defamatory falsehood he must have consigned to your keeping ! You do not break the foul bulk , but you have given us some samples which deserve examination . He denounced Mr. *1ucey as false to his country , inspired Dawes 's resolution against him , and expressed the belief that he ought to be arrested . Let us look at this a moment .. To Mr. Toucey 's face Mr. Stanton breathed no syllable of censure upon his official conduct as head of the Navy Department . To the President or Cabinet he expressed no doubt of his wisdom , much less of his honesty . He met him every day with a face of smiling friendship . Toucey certainly had not the remotest idea that Stanton was defaming him behind his back , or conspiring with abolitionists to destroy his reputation . He would as soon have suspected him of an intent to poison his food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stanton was the author of the Dawes resolution ? // That resolution is found in the " Congressional Globe , " Second S*ssion , Thir .. ty-sixth Congress , i 86o-6i , part second , pp. 1423-24 . The proceeding was begun , no doubt , in the hope of finding something on which the charge could be founded of scattering the navy to prevent it from being used against the South . But that failed miserably ; and the committee reported nothing worse than " a grave error " of the Secretary in accepting without delay or inquiry the resignation of certain naval officers . Even this had no foundation in law or fact . Its truth was denied and the evidence called for ; none was produced . The right to explain and defend was demanded , but the gag of the previous question was applied before a word could be said . The accusers knew very well that it would not bear the slightest investigation . Mr. Sickles said truly ( amid cries of " Order " ) that " censure without evidence disgraces only those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuriously affected by it in the estimation of any fairminded man . But you fish it up from the oblivion to which it has been consigned , and try to give it decency and dignity by saying that Stanton inspired it . You do not appear to perceive the hideous depth to which your assertion , if true , would drag him down . It is not true : the whole business bears the impress of a different mind . Mr. Stanton also suggested that his colleague and friend Toucey ought to be arrested . This could not have been a proposition to take him into legal custody on a criminal charge regularly made . That would have been utterly impossible and absurd . The Dawes committee itself could find nothing against him but an error of judgment . The suggestion must have been to kidnap him , without an accusation or proof of probable cause , and consign him to some dungeon without trial or hope of other relief . If Stanton attempted to get this done , he was guilty of such perfidy as would have shocked the basest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confute your libel upon Toucey and Stanton both , it is only necessary to recollect the fact that kidnapping of American citizens was at that time wholly unknown and absolutely impossible . We were living under a Democratic administration , the country was free , and law was supreme . Tyranny had not yet sunk its bloody fangs into the vitals of the national liberty . The systematic perjury which afterward made the Constitution a dead letter was not then established as a rule of political morality . Your whole account of the " Cabinet scene " at which Floyd , " raging and storming , arraigned the President and Cabinet , " and " the President trembled and grew pale , " and " Stanton met the baffled traitor and his fellow conspirators with a storm of fierce and fiery denunciation , " is a pure and perfectly baseless fabrication . It is absurd to boot . What was Floyd 's arraignment of the President and Cabinet for ? You say for violating their pledges to the secessionists ; and the charge against- the President and Cabinet of violating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had removed from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter ; and 4F/oyd was disa**ointed in Colonel Anderson , whom he " had expected , " as a Sou*ern man , to " carry out his purposes in the interest of treason . " This is mere drivelling at best , and it is completely exploded by the record , which shows that Colonel Anderson 's transfer of his force from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter was in literal obedience to orders from the President , which Floyd himself had drawn up , signed , and transmitted . Moreover , Floyd at that time was not in a condition to arraign anybody . He himself had just before that been not only arraigned but condemned , and the President had notified him that he would be removed if he did not resign . Was it this broken-down and powerless man who made the President tremble and grow pale // by complaining that a subordinate had unexpectedly obeyed his own orders ? You are not silly enough to say so . Was it Stanton 's " storm of fierce and fiery denunciation " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he then had to deal with . His language was habitually deferential , his whole bearing decent , and his behavior at the council board was entirely free from the insolence you impute to it . Your tales do not hang together . No one can give credence to your report of bold and stormy denunciation by Stanton in the presence of his chief and his colleagues , and at the same time believe what you say of him at another place , where you describe him as a dastard , skulking about in the dead of night to find a place of concealment remote enough to make him safe , and confessing that he did not dare to breathe his accusation in the face of day . The crawling sycophant  --  the stealthy spy-who bargained so carefully for darkness and secrecy when he made his rep*rts , must have been wholly unfitted to play the part of Jupiter Tonans in a square and open conflict . It is not possible that the fearless Stanton of your " Cabinet scene " could be the same Stanton who , at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toad " at the ear of Sumner , Essaying by his devilish arts to reach The organs of his fancy . I take it upon me to deny most emphatically that Mr. Stanton ever " wrote a full and detailed account of that Cabinet scene " by which you can have the least hope of being corroborated . I can not prove a negative ; but I can show that your assertion is incredible . That he should have coolly indited a letter , even though he never sent it , filled with foolish brags of his own prowess , which half a dozen me then living could prove to be false , was not consistent either with his prudence , veracity , or taste . Besides , he often spoke with me about the events of that period , and never in my hearing did he manifest the slightest disposition to misunderstand or misrepresent them . On the contrary , when a statement resembling yours about the Cabinet scene was published in a London paper , I suggested that he ought to contradict it ; and he replied , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was not worth a contradiction , for every man of common intelligence would know it to be a mere tissue of lies . You can not destroy Stanton 's character for sense and decency by cithg his own authority against himself . Nor can you find any other proof to sustain the story It is the weak invention of some scurvy politician , who sought to win the patronage of one administration by maligning another . Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Hath devised this slander . Your history of his appointment to the War Department is as erroneous as that which you have given of his conduct while Attorney-General . You say that he cordially indofsed Mr. Cameron 's recommendation to arm the negroes against the white people of the South ; that Mr. Lincoln disapproved this and required it to be suppressed ; that afterward , when Cameron " felt the pressure of the multiplied labor , " he proposed to resign , but coupled his offer with a condition that " some one should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of arming negroes , to which Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed ; that Cameron did resign upon these terms , and used the privilege conceded to him by suggesting the name of Stanton . Everybody who knows Simon Cameron will understand the object of dragging this thing by the head and shoulders into your article . In fact and in truth , there was no kind of connection between these two men-no sympathy nor mutual respect . Cameron did not resign ; he // was removed for good cause . He had no lo , * or part in naming his , successor . The removal and the appointment were both made before Mr. Cameron knew of either , and they were made because the President saw the necessity of having a man at the head of that department who was competent and incorruptible . The correspondence afterward published under the names of Messrs . Lincoln and Cameron was fictitious , and got up at the instance of the latter to give the affair a false appearance . It is morally impossible that Stanton could have given his approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was at that time a white man every inch of him , proud of the great race he sprang from , and full of faith in its capacity to light its own battles and govern itself . Nothing would have humiliated him more than to see the American people relinquish their rightful place in the front rank of the world , surrender their inheritance of free government , and sneak back behind the African for protection in war or in peace . Long after he was Secretary of War he told Mr. Mallory , of Kentucky , that he had not only refused to sanction the enlistment of a negro regiment , but had punished an officer for merely proposing it . I understand that you have promised to contradict yourself on this subject , and I hope you will keep your word . Your account of his raid upon the Treasury , in company with Governor Morton , would look very strange in a panegyric made by anybody else but you . I will restate the facts you have given , but without the drapery by which you conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by all men who believe in the obligation of any law , human or divine . In the winter of x863 , the Legislature of Indiana was dissolved before the appropriations had been made to carry on the State government or aid in putting troops in the field . Of course , Congress did not , and could not , make appropriations for carrying on the State government or putting troops in the field , which the State was bound to raise at her own expense . But the Governor determined to get what money he wanted without authority of law , and he looked to Washington for assistance . President Lincoln declined to aid him , because no money could be taken from the Treasury without appropriation . Mr. Stanton , being applied to , saw the critical condition of the Governor , and , without scruple , joined him in his financial enterprise . He ( lrew a warrant for a quarter of a million ofdollars , and gave it to the Governor to spend as he pleased , not only without being authorized by any appropriation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same money to another and a totally different object . If this be true , the guilt of the parties can hardly be overcharged by any words which the English language will supply . It was getting money out of the public treasury , not only unlawfully , but by a process as dishonest as larceny . It involved the making of a fraudulent warrant , of which the moral turpitude was no less than that corninitted by a private individual when he fabricates and . utters a false paper . It was a gross and palpable violation of the oaths which the Governor and Secretary had both taken . It was , by the statute of 1846 , a felonious embezzlement of the money thus obtained , punishable by fine and ten years ' imprisonment in the penitentiary . The parties , according to your version , were both conscious of the high crime they were perpetrating , for you make one say to the other , " If the cause fails , you and I will be covered with prosecutions and probably imprisoned or driven from the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whit by saying that the money was afterward accounted for . A felony can not be compounded or condoned by a simple restitution of the spoils ; and the law I have cited was made expressly to prevent officers charged with the safe keeping , transfer , or disbursement of public money from using it to accom // 829 modate friends in a " critical condition . " But what will be said of your frustworthiness as a contributor to history when the public comes to learn that this whole story is bogus ? I pronounce it untrue in the aggregate and in the detail-in the sum total and in every item . The truth is this In 1863 the Democratic majority of the Indiana Legislature were ready and willing to pass their proper and usual appropriation bills , but were prevented by the Republican minority who " bolted " and left the houses without a quorum until the constitutional limit of their session expired . The Governor refused to reconvene them , and thus , by his own fault and that of his friends , he was without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . He was wrong , but his error was that of a violent partisan , not the crime of a corrupt magistrate . He did not come to Washington with any intention to relieve his necessities by plundering the Federal Treasury . He made no proposition either to Mr. Lincoln or Mr. Stanton , that they or either of them should become his accomplices in any such infamous crime . His purpose was to demand payment of a debt due , and acknowledged to be due , from the United States to the State of Indiana . The money had been a**ro*riated by Congress to pay it , and it was raid according to law / I know not how Mr. Morton may like to see himself held up as a felon confessing his guilt , but I can say , with some confidence , that if Mr. Stanton were alive he would call you to a very severe reckoning . What must amaze the readers of your article more than anything else is the perfect sincerity of the belief which you express , directly or indirectly , in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Stanton is eminently praiseworthy . You seem to be wholly unconscious of defaming the man you meant to eulogize . But , if your facts be accepted , the honor and honesty of them will not be measured by your standards . It may be true that public opinion has of late been sadly debauched ; but the American people have not permanently changed their code of morality . Good faith between man and man , personal integrity , social fidelity , observance of oaths , and obedience to the laws which hold society together , have heretofore been numbered among the virtues , and they will be again . The government of God has not been reconstructed . Fraud or force may abolish the Constitution , but the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule are beyond your reach ; some persons have faith enough to believe that even " the gates of hell shall not prevail against them . " The odious character you have given Mr. Stanton is not merely unjust in itself , but , if uncontradicted , it must lead to other misconceptions of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and truth which you have enumerated and assigned to him for his glorification , he has been charged with others which , if established , must expose him to universal execration . For instance , it is asserted that , in the winter of x86i , when he was a member of the Cabinet , he gave to Governor Brown , of Mississippi , the most emphatic assurance of his conviction that secession was right , and urged him to " go on* ' with it ; that in 1862 , while he was writing the most affectionate letters to General McClellan , he not only maligned him at Washington , but maliciously plotted his defeat and the destruction of his army before Richmond ; that he refused in 1864 to receive the Andersonville prisoners when offered freely without ransom , exchange , or other equivalent , though he knew that if left there they must perish miserably for want of the medicine and food which their captors had not the means to give them . These accusations , you are aware , have often been made , with horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied and discredited them , mainly on the ground that his character was wholly above such imputations But you have done your full best to make this defence worthless . If he // wore the cloak of constitutional democracy with us , and put on the livery of abolitionism with you , why should he not assume the garb of a secessionist with men of the South ? If he tried to get his friend Toucey kidnapped , what moral principle could hinder him from contriving the ruin of his friend McClellan ? If he craftily exerted himself at your end of the avenue to bring on a bloody civil war , which according to his own declarations at our end was unlawful and causeless , what crime against human life was he not capable of committing ? If he wilfully left our prisoners to certain starvation , and then managed falsely to throw the odium of their death upon the political enemies of the party in power , and thus contributed very largely to the enslavement of the Southern States , was not that an act of " intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some others for which you have bestowed it ? Those who give credit to you will find it perfectly logical to believe the worst that has ever been said of him . Sejanus has passed for about the worst specimen of ministerial depravity whom we have any account of ; but nothing is recorded of him which might not be believed of Stanton , if you are regarded as credible authority ; for you have made it a labor of love to paint him as a master in the loathsome arts of treachery , dissimulation , and falsehood-unfaithful alike to private friendship and to public duty . With the talents he possessed and the principles you ascribe to him , he might have made an invaluable Grand Vizier to a Turkish Sultan-provided the Sultan were in the prime of life and had no powerful brother near the throne ; but in a free country such a character can not be thought of without disgust and abhorrence . In your eyes the " intense and abounding patriotism " of Stanton is sufficient to atone not only for all the faults he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals which the utmost fertility of your imagination can lay to his charge ; and patriotism in your vocabulary means devotion to the interests of that political sect which has you for one of its priests . This will not suffice . You can not safely blacken a man with one hand and neutralize the effect by daubing on the whitewash of patriotism with the other . Patriotism , in its true sense , does indeed dignify and adorn human nature . It is an exalted and comprehensive species of charity , which hides a multitude of sins . The patriotism of Washington , which laid broad and deep the foundation of free institutions and set the noble example of implicit obedience to the laws ; the patriotism of John Hampden , who voluntarily devoted his fortune and his life to the maintenance of legal justice ; the patriotism of Cato , who resisted the destructive madness of his countrymen and greatly fell with a falling State ; the patriotism of Daniel O'Connell , who spent his time and talents in constant efforts to relieve his people from the galling yoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , speaking in the cause of universal liberty , loudly rejoiced that America had resisted the exactions of a tyrannical Parliament  --  to such patriotism some errors may be pardoned . When men like these are found to have committed a fault , it is well that history should deal with it tenderly , And , sad as angels for the good man 's sin , Weep to record and blush to give it in . But the loyalty that tramples on law  --  the fidelity which stabs the liberties it ought to protect  --  the public zeal which expends itself in gratifying the vindictive or mercenary passions of one party by the unjust oppression of another-this kind of patriotism has less claim to the admiration of the world . It is a cheap thing , readily supplied to any faction unprincipled enough to pay for it . It is entirely too " intense and abounding ; " and its intensity and abundance are always greatest in the worst times . It does not sanctify evil deeds . If it be not // a sin in itself ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alls " the rascally * Mr. Stanton 's reputation is just now in a critical condition . He took no care of it while he lived , and he died , like Bacon , leaving a vulnerable name " to men 's charitable speeches . " He needs a more discriminating eulogist than you , *nd a far better defence than I am able to make . I have not attempted to portray his good qualities ; I intended only to protest against your shameless parade of vices to*which he was not addicted , and crimes which he never committed ; and this I have done , not only because it is just to him but necessary for the vindication of others . 3. 5 .
