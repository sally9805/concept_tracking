Tire ? law directed an investigation into the haunts , habits , and value of the fur seal , the condition and extent of the fisheries , statistics of the fur trade , and the condition of the people . We should judge from the report that the land must be Worthless for agricultural purposes ; that no extensive and well-stocked " cod banks " are to be found , though the canning of salmon , with which the rivers abound , may become a reasonably profitable industry . There is no evidence of mineral deposits of any commercial value . In short , our Arctic Territory , for which 87,000,000 in gold was paid , does not appear to be able to sustain any profitable industry other than annually catching and skinning a hundred thousand of the seals that frequent St. Paul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing sea otter , and a few other less - important fur-bearing animals . That portion of the report which relates to the Prybilov group of four small islands , which are the only haunts of theseal in the Northern Seas , is , therefore , especially interesting and important . The Prybilov Islands were discovered by the Russians in 1786-7 ? nearly a hundred years ago . They were then uninhabited . Six companies at once established themselves upon the islands . In 1799 a monopoly of the Alaskan trade was given to the " Russian-American Company . " The sealing business was very badly managed for a few years , till the company began to see that precautions must be taken to preserve the seals from annihilation , or that their monopoly would soon become valueless . The rules then established secured the object so well that they still continue in force . But for this foresight of the old Russian Company , the seal of the Northern seas would have been long ago exterminated . The'experience of the Russians should be a lesson to America . It appears ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perceptible diminution in the number of seals was observed , and they continued to decrease till 1834 . Then the management of the company was changed , and the rules above mentioned wore adopted , and the in : . crease of seals began and ' continued till 1857 . Mr. ELLIOTT thinks that since that time there has been little change in the numbers , and that the islands afford " hauling grounds " for few , if any more than now visit them each year . By careful surveys and estimates he concludes that the seals on the breeding grounds , or " rookeries , " last Summer , including the panne. , numbered 3,193,670 , and that the " bachelor " or male seals , from one to six or seven years old , which are not permitted by the breeding seals to come upon the same grounds with them , numbered 1,500,000 , making the whole number- of seals upon the islands nearly four and three-quarters millions . The law requires that only 100,000 " bachelor " or non-breeding seals should be annually captured . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law is strictly complied with , and that its violation is impossible . We suppose the Alaska Company would make the same arguments , and doubtless do make them . But we confess we should like to have some evidence of the correctness of the premises on which the arguments rest , besides the statements of the company and any one agent which the Government can send to the almost inaccessible isles . The only communication with the islands is by means of the company 's vessels and a Unitea States revenue cutter which pays an annual visit . No other vessels , except such as may be in distress , are permitted to land . The company has a monopoly , therefore , of all the trade , and has the power to reduce the people to a condition little better than slavery . Upon the company they are certainly all dependent . A letter from Mr. WILLIAM H. BALL , of the Coast Survey , who has lived nea , rly ten years iu the Territory , shows that the natives are in a wretched condition of ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of the traders , for which no means of redress are provided . Mr. ELLIOTT takes pains to controvert such of Mr. BALL 'S statements as reflect upon the Alaska Company , but we must say that Mr. DALL 'S letter reads like a manly and independent expression of views honestly entertained . Moreover , the condition which he describes is the natural result of the relations of the rich company to the poor and dependent people . The Government should protect every resource of our Arctic possessions , and secure the greatest annual revenues possible from them , to the end that they may repay at least the interest on the purchase money  --  if that is possible . Mr. ELLIOTT 'S xeport seems to us to illumine the dark subject just ' sufficiently to show the need of more light , and we hope that measures may be taken to discover . as speedily as possible the true ? condition of affairs in the Territory of Alaska . OUR ARCTIC TERRITORY . The report of Mr. HENRY W. ELLIOTT , who visited Alaska last Summer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seen printed at the Government Office . Cho volume , of nearly 300 pages , is entitled A Report Upon . the Condition of Affairs in the Territory of Alaaka . Lieut . WASIUIURN dAYNAItD , of the Navy , was associated with Mr. ELLIOTT , and was directed to mkt ) an independent report , of which we lave yet heard nothing . Mr. ELLIOTT was us Assistant Agent of the Treasury at St. ? iturs iu 1872 and 1873 . He has had opportuiities for making extensive observations , and le seems to have been a zealous and active , f not always a very accurate , observer . We ihould not , however , accept without quesion such of his conclusions as depend upon my process of reasoning , nor hastily adopt ds recommendations , especially when the nterests of the Alaska Commercial Company ire in any manner involved .
