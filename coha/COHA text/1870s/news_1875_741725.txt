txt The address of Prof. TYNDALL 'S successor at the meeting of the British Association ; his year will stir up none of the dissensions and controversie*s which arose and soon lied away again after the address on evolution last year at Belfast . The Presidency is now held by Sir Jour ; HAWKSHAW , whom the Earl of DUCIE described as the first civil engineer living . It was not to be expected that from such a man the association would be called upon to listen to a discourse upon abstract philosophy , or some of the topics which are of real interest , even to the unscientific ) , in the problems of DARWIN and . HUXLEY . Matters of a more immediately practical character were looked for , and so far the members were not disappointed . Whether Sir JOHN HAwKSnAw 's address will take rank with the best that have been delivered . on similar occasions before the association , at least on scientific and literary merits , may be doubted . It is , however , useful and instructive . Of late years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Formerly they ' usually contained an outline of the advances made by science in its several most important branches during the preceding year . This custom has now been abandoned . Science has advanced with such rapid strides in all directions , that it has been simply impossible to contain even the barest outline of it within so small a compass . Recent Presidents have , therefore , taken what may seem ' to many the more consistent course of limiting the picture they would draw to that particular section which is to each the most familiar . Adhering closely to this , Sir JOHN HAWKsHAW sketched the progress of engineering science . One lesson which he drew from this is worthy of special notice . In some respects , especially iu the ideal arts , he places the present generation no further in advance than the ancients . Even in that estimate he is possibly paying it too high a compliment . But as engineering is a practical science which grows out of experience , we ought to be , if we are not , far superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the greatest works of modern times , and . notably the proposed tunnel between France and . England , Sir JOHNHANVICSIKAW seeks strongly to impress the ' maxim that the magnitude of a work is not always to be taken as a sign of engineering skill . For come years ' it has been acknowledged . that ' Money is the only measure to estimate the possibility of works of ongineering , " i but the point urged by Sir JOHN implies more than this , by raising the profession to which he belongs to the rank of a true science , where the merits of results are to be tested. - not by their showiness , but by their absolute worth . The address is only disappointing from the absence of allusion to modern works in progress in which the public are taking an interest . The speaker dwells chiefly upon five topics , the telegraph , railway , gunnery , shipbuilding , and . needed improvements in the utilization of fuel as a source of force . The first of these occupied . the greater share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of the rapid utilizat4m of what was at first regarded by most men as a mere scientific idea . In reference to the three automatic machines chiefly in use , Sir JoHN HAWKSHAW gives the preference by far to that in use in England , the invention of Sir CHARLES WHEATSTONE . The speed with it is equal to 200 words a minute , and . the possibility of error is reduced to a minimum . Some of the statistics given are instructive . The length of deep-sea cables that have been made and laid is now 70,000 miles . The world 's telegraphic lines extend over more than 400,000 miles , and there are 160,000 miles of railroads , Estimating the modern engineering works of this kind at their money value , Sir JOHN HAWKSHAW considers that within the space of a generation and a half a sum not less than ? 3,340,000,000 have been expended on what may undoubtedly be designated as useful works . This shows not only a vast accretion of wealth , but a greatlyincreased power of making more wealth . It is estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather save , a greater amount annually than the gross amount of all the dividends payable to the proprietors , without ta.king ? into account the benefit arising from the saving of time . The conclusion drawn from this is that wherever a railway can be made at a cost at which it will soon yield . tho ordinary interest for money expended , it ought to be made . The national value is deemed sufficiently great to justify the nation in letting shareholders run some risk . It is a little remarkable that when the British Association held its annual meeting last at Bristol , where it met this year , Dr. LARDNER presided . Although not a civil engineer , as Sir JoHN IIAWKSHAW is , he was an authority in questions of natural philosophy , and he then stated his conviction that it would be utterly impossible for a steamer to cross the Atlantic or for a person to pass through a tunnel a mile and a half in length . Sir JonN ITAwKsii-Nw is more cautious . He makes no prediCtious ; he attempts none . Alluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no limit to their possible magnitude . But beyond this he promises nothing . At the same time , with the true genius of a practical disciple of modern science , ho is prepared for anything . Our present knowledge in physics is infinitesimal , when compared with what we do not know , and . he is not unwilling to venture the opi uion that even the discovery of a new force Is not beyond the limits of probability . When we compare the sketch he has given with the address to which we have alluded of Dr. LARDNER , we can understand the caution which a man of sound knowledge and . experience must feel in attempting to define the point to which physical science will , in forty years , have led the generation that comes after us . And if it be impossible to predict the future , it is hardly less easy duly to appreciate the past . The full mean , ing of it is rarely realized , except when the picture is recalled in such addresses as these before the British Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
