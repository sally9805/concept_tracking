txt We can not conceive any reason why the people of the Nineteenth Assembly District should want to be represented in the Legislature by Tou FIELDS . Why FIELDS wants to go to the Legislature is plain from the evidence on which he is now under arrest . His motive is doubtless the same as it was in 1869 . They ; he declared that be had no other business in the Legislature than to put through a very contemptible swindle . In that , however , he was mistaken , for in addition to the particular job of stealing referred . to , he was engaged prominently that year in a great many other jobs just as mean and just as dishonest , brought forward by various members of the Tammany Ring , including himself . The particular scheme to which he professed himself devoted exclusively was certainly among the worst . We invite the attention of the people of his Assembly District to the facts as recited bofore the Court which has ordered FIELDS ' arrest . From October , 1865 to January , 1868 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinly-settled part of the City above Fifty-ninth-street . The Fire Department paid . to each of these companies $1,000 a year , to meet their necessary expenses , which was regarded by the " men as payment in full for all claims on the City . On the 1st of January , 1868 , these eight companies were disbanded , and their places filled by paid companies . Tom FIELDS was at that time Corporation Attorney . He sent for a member of one of these volunteer companies , and laid before him a plan for getting allowed from the City full pay for the firemen 's services , as if they had been regularly hired . He even got introduced into the Legislature a bill authorizing such payment . It failed , through the opposition of the Fire Commissioners . FIELDS was not to be put off in that way . He renewed his scheme , and got his fireman friend to lay the matter before his companions and get their permission to make claims in their name , with an assignment to FIELDS of 83i per cent . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposition . They knew they had . no claim , and objected that the thing was a swindle . " Yes , " said . FIELDS , smilingly , " it is a swindle , " but he continued to push it . Some of the firemen , to their credit be it said , refused to have anything to do with FIELDS , or his plan for plunder . Many were over-persuaded by him , however , and he got a bill through the Legislature authorizing the payment of these claims in full , the total amount not to exceed $50,000 . He presented the claims as attorney of the claimants ; they were paid , and he pocketed between $16.000 and $17,000 , and divided the remainder . The next Autumn that of 1860 ? he went foorSii rip " placer " again . Again he aptroached the firemen , and told them that if he had been in the Legislature the Winter before , he would have got them a great deal more money , and that if they would help elect him that year and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get them full pay at the rates obtained by the actual employes of the Fire Department . After a good deal of persuasion . the firemen again became parties to the conspiracy . FIELDS went to the Legislature with the sole motive , as he declared . and undoubtedly with the direct motive , of " putting through " this swindle . That was the first year of TWEED 'S shameful reign . Frxims was high in favor in the depraved court of that powerful and corrupt ruler , and , in return for much very dirty work , his scheme was allowed to pass . On the 3d of June , 1870 , he drew the amount authorized , being $459,977 79 , of which he kept one-half or more , dividing the remainder among the fraudulent claimants . Probably there is not a man of viler character than FIELDS ? in the gang that have ruled this City under TWEED . He is now exposed . Unless the people of the Nineteenth District want to be represented by a swindler under arrest , whose yet unpublished crimes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trial , they will not send him again to the Legislature .
