ART . VI . - THE SESSION . THE first topic to which the mind naturally reverts , in connection with the recent session , is the Cr6dit Mobilier investigation , and the nature and extent of the corruption it has brought to light . The most important question suggested by this topic is whether the interest thus excited will result in any serious attempt to reform our politics , or purify the management of our great moneyed corporations . Our answer to this question will depend , not on the intensity of the public indignation against the real or suspected offenders of the past , but on the wisdom and efficiency of the measures the public shall take against a recurrence of like abuses in the future . In conducting a campaign against strongly entrenched abuses , as in the military field , it is necessary to proceed in a regular and systematic manner , to beware of having the attention diverted by false attacks , and carefully to avoid engagements with our own forces . We do not hesitate to say that if the just indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely expended upon the members of Congress known or suspected to be interested in that scheme , more harm than good will be done . If we wish to seek for that state of things which has made possible , not only the Cr6dit Mobilier , but all the other schemes which have brought American financial management into such deserved disrepute , we must look much deeper than the reports of investigating committees can carry us . The root of the evil is to be found in the vast accumulation of wealth during the past half-century , unaccompanied by any corresponding increase in the diffusion among the public of political and financial knowledge . Every citizen is now more or less dependent upon a multitude of joint-stock companies whose organization is complex to a degree never thought of in times . past . The old line of stages with a single owner is replaced by the modern railroad , with its paid-up stock , its purely nominal par* value , its watered stock , its preferred stock , its stock dividends , its bonds payable in gold , its bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leases , and every other device which ingenu // ity can suggest to prevent the public from understanding its financial condition . Against this we have no corresponding increase of financial knowledge to serve as a set-off . The average citizen of to-day knows little more of political economy and nothing more of practical finance than did his ancestors of the last century . Indeed , when we say that we no longer punish or denounce men for making the most profitable use they can of their labor and wealth , saving when they loan their money at exorbitant interest , we chronicle the only decided step in advance which we can claim to have taken . The general result is that a large portion of our national and individual wealth , and a portion in the m*inagement of which the poorest citizen has a deep interest , is in the hands of corporations of which the organization and operation are , to the masses , as great a mystery as Newton 's Principia . To this state of things neither the law nor the political economy of the past are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract principles . In the case of law we may hope to find these principles intelligently applied to suit the exigencies of the new state of things , because men are expected to make a profound study of them before entering upon the practice of the profession . But the abstract principles of political economy are held in contempt by the masses both of our citizens and statesmen , if one can properly be said to contemn a thing of which he has no correct conception , and which he would respect if he only knew what it was . The result is , that the students of political economy and finance are few in number , insignificant in direct influence , and not to be found among practical financiers . This state of things has given rise to a powerful class of agents , managers , and operators of a multitude of kinds , whose business it is , in the majority of cases , to turn the public ignorance to the best account . They are the financial quack doctors of the body politic . In their hands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary disorders of which they fully understand the symptoms and the treatment . Their remedies are as well adapted to any real disease as were those of Dr. Thomas Diaforus . Every intellectual weakness of the public tends in some way to facilitate or encourage their operations . They find the business of the country constantly // suffering from a lack of paper currency , and its industry from a lack of adequate encouragement on the part of Congress . They have complete systems of political economy and finance , ingeniously contrived to delude the public , but entitled to no higher rank among political economists than patent-medicine almanacs can claim among physicians . The worst of this class feel a direct interest in keeping the public from understanding their operations , and therefore increase their complexity in every way , and introduce some kind of financial legerdemain wherever it can be applied . To one who considers the extent of this evil , the number of temptations to prey upon the public , the wide applicability of Samuel Butler 's trite couplet , and the difficulty of obtaining precise information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find nothing worse than the Cr6dit Mobilier to show . As a matter of fact , the past half a dozen years have given rise to so many worse things on which public indignation might be profitably expended , that we may seriously inquire whether the attack on the Or6dit Mobilier is not to be deplored as a diversion of our attention from the points to which it ought to have been directed . The character of the Credit Mobilier , as a financial scheme , is germane to our subject only so far as we may suppose members of Congress to have been acquainted with it , and to have been influenced by the hope of profit to be derived from it . It does not appear that , at the time , it was known as anything more than a contracting company to build the Union Pacific Railway ; we need not therefore enter into any discussion of its legality , or of the moral category to which we are to assign it . The fact with which we are mainly concerned is essentially this : the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when the exact character of the operation became known public opinion would demand some adverse legislation on the part of Congress , sought to strengthen it by inducing a number of the strongest members to take small quantities of the stock . The plan had so much of the character of a snare , that it was essential to keep the object secret from the victims ; he therefore assured them there was nothing improper in the transaction , for the reason that no further legislation would be // asked of Congress . The latter statement was entirely correct , indeed , rather too true. , for further legislation on the subject was the very thing he wished to prevent . Some paid for the stock in cash ; to others he claims to have allowed credit until the accruing dividends paid or helped to pay for tho stock , when the surplus was bonded over to them . The latter cases seem , at first sight , to savor much more of bribery or corruption than the others ; but if we examine them we find that the transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict accordance with the customs of business and the law of contracts . The question of corruption is therefore , in these cases as in the others , ' to be decided entirely from accessory circumstances , if we admit that the contract to purchase was entered into really and in good faith . Since the existence of the contract lies at the base of the charges against the members in question , the prosecution can not object to its being taken for granted . But it is to be remembered that in all these cases , which include only those of Messrs . Garfield , Kelly , and Colfax , the evidence is very weak , and the facts seriously contested . Against Messrs . Garfield and Kelly the evidence of Mr. Gakes Ames is so uncertain and vacillating , and so completely unsupported by any collateral circumstances , that hardly any weight should be assigned to it , and the explanations of those gentlemen must , we conceive , be regarded as satisfactory . We do not , however , press this point because , granting the worst that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same footing with those who paid for their stock in advance , and all might still be considered together . After an exhaustive investigation , the conduct of which was marred only by an ill-advised attempt to keep the testimony secret during its pi*ogress , the Poland Committee found no evidence of corrupt intent on the part of any member who purchased stock of Mr. Ames . The most gratifying feature of this report is its unanimity , a feature which has not offered itself in a Congressional investigation of a political subject during the last twenty years . Judging from all recent precedents , we should have expected a majority report declaring the Cr6dit Mobilier a patriotic undertaking , and all the members of Congress who had been willing to invest their funds in it entitled // to the gratitude of the country ; and a minority report recommending every one of these same members for expulsion . Indeed , there are probably few sources of information to which the unpartisan public have , in recent years , attached less weight than to the reports of Congressional committees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one imperatively demanded to prevent Congress from falling into contempt , and it is to be earnestly hoped that the members of all future committees will adopt the very sensible view of Mr. Niblack : that desiring to vindicate the reputation of his party for purity , he will be more severe upon a delinquent of his own than upon one of the opposite party . With such , a report before us , and with the essential facts almost universally admitted , it might seem superfluous to enter into any discussion of the acts of those ten or twelve members who were rightfully or wrongfully suspected of purchasing Cr6dit Mobilier stock on the recommendation of Mr. Ames . But the public has such strong grounds for suspecting the existence of corruption in Congress , and the form which this corruption takes is one so different from that presupposed in all the law of the past , that there is a strong and highly commendable disposition to attack all parties who can be even suspected of improper motives in legislation . Now , the circumstances surrounding the operations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character , that their investigation seems to have dazzled the eyes of the public to nearly everything else . We must therefore ask permission to review some of the facts brought out in this case , and some of the general principles applicable to this and other cases . In doing this we shall not attempt to pass judgment upon , or even to consider , the case of each individual member , but shall confine our attention to those features which may throw light upon the nature of Mr. Oakes Ames 's project , or illustrate our system of political management . The most striking fact , and perhaps that which has lent most interest to the subject , is that so large a proportion of the members implicated have borne the highest character among the friends of reform as efficient and honest legislators , and that hardly one belongs to the class which a corrupt manager would // think of approaching with improper proposals . Indeed , the sprinkling of men whom such politicians as believe in using the powers of the government to further their personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is sufficiently remarkable to excite suspicion . The only explanation of this fact which seems to have been thought of is , that Ames selected only the strongest men , to give as much character and influence as possible to his project . If we grant this , it only lessens the probability of a corrupt motive . But there is another circumstance which tends to weaken this explanation . Every one knows that the general features of nearly all the non-political legislation of Congress tare decided on by the standing committees , and that the latter are especially potent in resisting legislation , because , in the ordinary course of things , every measure is in each House referred to the appropriate committee before being acted upon . If the committee do not think favorably of the measure , they can , in nineteen cases out of every twenty , kill it by simply making no report , and in the twentieth case their adverse report will carry that large portion of the House who , not having had time to examine deeply the merits of the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ames desired to guard against adverse legislation , his most effectual course would have been to make sure of the Pacific Railroad Committee , which was all the more easy and natural from the fact that he was himself a member of the committee , and therefore , it may be assumed , in daily confidential intercourse with the other members . Now , the second suspicious circumstance worthy of attention is , that not one of the members of Congress implicated in the Cr6dit Mobilier was , at the time of the transactions under consideration , a member of this committee , except Mr. Ames and Mr. Brooks ; and the latter , it must be remembered , was not implicated on the testimony of Mr. Ames , but was caught by an accidental sweep of the net during the examination of McComb . A third noteworthy circumstance is the disproportion of the supposed corruption-fund to the interests at stake . A half million for engineering a " job " of the magnitude of the Credit Mobilier through the New York Legislature would have been considered cheap at Albany ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no objection would have been made . Congress is certainly not so cheap a body as the New York Legislature . Yet , if the facts are correctly brought out , the whole corruption-fund was only some two hundred shares , and two of the principal managers quarrelled over the question whether a score or so of shares should be allowed to Congressmen . At Albany Mr. Ames would have been laughed out of the lobby . It is not credible that financiers so acute seriously attempted a great operation with means so insignificant , nor that the votes of Messrs . Garfield and Kelly could have been secured by apayment of $329 to each . When we consider that neither the characters , the antecedents , nor the positions of the members whom it is supposed that Mr. Gakes Ames attempted to corrupt would lead to their selection for such a purpose , and that the means used were ridiculously inadequate , one of two conclusions seems inevitable : either no serious attempt to influence Congress in an improper way was made at all , or , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put the public on a false scent after some of those members from whom corruptionists had least to expect . The report of the Poland Committee affords us no data for judging which of these suppositions is the true one . For such data we must refer to the report of the committee presided over by Mr. Jeremiah M. Wilson , in which eighteen large closely printed octavo pages are devoted to a concise description of the financial transactions between the Union Pacific Railroad Company , the Cr6dit Mobihier Corporation , several real and sham contractors , and any number of trustees and assignees . To any one who wishes to know what is the financial management of the present day , we commend the careful study of this report , warning him , at the same time , that any attempt to keep the track of the operations in his own mind will be entirely hopeless unless he goes through a course of preliminary training in the higher mathematics . It seems from all the facts of the case that the managers had no intention of invoking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small amount of the doubtful stock was handed over to Mr. Gakes Ames as trustee , to be used at his discretion // in strengthening the scheme before Congress and the country . It is not likely that any of the two parties had any definite ideas either of the best mode of doing this , or of the manner in which the benefit should accrue to them . The plan was inspired only by a vague fear of being called to account in the future , which suggested an equally vague idea that in such a case it would be a good thing to be able to point to Messrs . A , B , and C as stockholders in the project . Whatever view we may take of the motives of Mr. Ames in selling the stock to members of Congress , there are three facts which we believe to be undeniable , and which are conclusiv* of the whole question of Congressional corruption in connection with the operations alluded to . They are - 1 . That the true character of the relations between the Cr6dit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those immediately interested , and that it was to their interest that it should remain unknown . 2 . That when Mr. Ames sought to induce members of Congress to purchase his stock , he not only carefully concealed the fact that its possession by a member of Congress was of doubtfoi propriety , but avoided giving them any reason to suspect improper motives on his part . We must remember , in this connection , that no cloud then rested on his character , and that he appeared to the members in question only as a personal friend and successful financier and man of bu*iness willing to aid them by his advice . 3 . That it has never been shown or even claimed either that Mr. Ames had in view any specific emergency in which he expected to secure the votes of the members in question , or that their votes were in any case whatever influenced by their possession of the stock . Such being the case , no blame whatever can , it seems to us , be attached to a single member on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Oakes Ames . It has , indeed , been said that the large dividends received were sufficient to excite suspicion that something was wrong . But there is hardly a case in which it has been clearly shown that any member received the enormous dividends known to have been earned by the operation . We shall // not , however , discuss the facts , because we conceive that the code of political ethics by which , granting the facts , the judgment is reached , and by which the public has judged all the members suspected of owning the stock , requires important alterations , if not entire reconstruction . The case of Mr. Colfax affords an excellent illustration of what we mean . That gentleman was accused of making a profit of seven or eight hundred dollars by an investment in Cr*dit Mobilier . He secured a verdict of not proven by showing that during the year 1868 he had received private remittances amounting to four thousand dollars , towards defraying his personal and political expenses , from Mr. George F. Nesbit , of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for furnishing stamped envelopes to the Post-Office Department . Now , we claim that the simple fact that this contractor , an almost total stranger , Mr. Colfax says , should have been moved to such generosity toward him , is worse than the suspected profits from Mr. Gakes Ames . This is not saying a great deal , for the difference between Mr. Colfax disgraced by Cr6dit Mobilier and Mr. Colfax triumphant over it is so small that great subtlety of comprehension is required to grasp it . Both he and Mr. Ames tacitly agree upon these salient facts , that about December , 1867 , he agreed to take two thousand dollars ' worth of the stock , and to pay that amount for it , plus interest , minus dividends , as soon as he was able . In the following spring , an eighty per cent dividend in Union Pacific bonds having been meanwhile declared , Mr. Colfax was found indebted to Mr. Ames on account of the stock . to the amount of $534.72 , which he paid , thus becoming absolute owner of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that effect . During the following summer , finding that the company was involved in litiga-. tion , he made a verbal surrender of the stock to Mr. Ames , because he did not wish to be engaged in a lawsuit in any way whatever . But before this surrender an additional dividend of sixty per cent in cash was declared , which Mr. Ames asserts that he paid , while Mr. Colfax denies all knowledge of it . The whole question of Mr. Colfax 's guilt or innocence has been made to turn on his reception or non-reception of this divi // dend , - a matter of no importance whatever , because if he did not receive it , he had a clear legal right to it . The intrinsic improbability that he had any corrupt motive has been already shown by the consideration that it was necessary to the success of Mr. Ames 's plans that any corrupt mbtive on his part should be concealed from his victims , and if there was anything wrong in the investment , the plea that after all it proved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be long before a faculty for losing money in bad investments will be esteemed a desirable qualification in a legislator . On the other hand , when Mr. Colfax proceeds to tell the public how he got the $1200 which he deposited in a bank two days after the date of Ames 's check , he tells a story suggestive of political corruption in one of the most common and insidious forms which it now takes . So far as Congress is concerned , the day of bribery , as defined in the statute books , has passed by . The operator no longer bribes a member of Congress or a judge . He manages matters so as to own him in fee simple . The most common tie by which he holds his property is that of gratitude . He makes liberal contributions towards filling his private purse , and defraying the expenses of his election . He takes good care of two things : first , that the beneficiary shall know from whom the money comes ; secondly , that the gift shall be accompanied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of office or favor , and that it is prompted solely by his admiration for the high personal character of the man in whom he takes so deep an interest . And yet he knows very well that if an occasion should arise to afford the latter an opportunity to get his benefactor out of some difficulty , he will not be so lost to all the ties of gratitude as to refuse to lend a helping hand . Hard hearted indeed must be the man who would object to the return of bread thus cast upon the waters . Men who have large money transactions , either directly with the government , or with the public through channels over which the government may have some control , know very well that a friend in need is a friend indeed , and if he can be secured by a present , the latter may prove a good paying investment . It s*ms quite likely that Mr. Nesbit 's overflowing liberality // was of this calculating kind . He made no attempt to prevent his left hand from knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom confidential contributions toward the election of any officer can be sent , to render it necessary , in any case , to make the candidate himself the medium of transmission . There are plenty of ways in which a friend can diminish the expenses of a government officer to the amount of a thousand dollars , without the officer knowing who did it . That Mr. Nesbit had strong reasons for choosing none of these ways is pretty clearly shown by the statement , which we believe is admitted , that Mr. Colfax did have it in his power to do him or his heirs one or more little favors through his influence with the Post-Office Department , and , we may fairly suppose , did thus prove the wisdom of Mr. Nesbit 's investment . If anything more is wanting to show the entire absurdity of the test by which Mr. Colfax has been tried at the bar of public opinion , it is found in the fact that neither he . nor his friends glaim for him any higher merits than ignorance of the wellestablished fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased , and such aversion to litigation that he threw away valuable property rather than be a member of a corporation engaged in a lawsuit . He does not claim that he would have refused the dividend had it been tendered him , or that he threw away the stock because it was wrong to keep it . The former would have looked very foolish , after accepting so many pecuniary favors from Mr. Nesbit ; and the latter would have exposed him to the charge of knowing or suspecting the wicked doings of the Cr6dit Mobilier , without trying to expose or stop them . The defence is simply maudlin sentimentality . To prove his trustworthiness , he had much better have shown that he kept the run of his dividends with care and precision , and collected them promptly when due . We are sure that a conscientious legislator is much more likely to be found in one who would spend a hundred dollars in a lawsuit rather than be defrauded out of five , than in one who would throw away two thousand dollars ' worth of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of failure to apprehend the real danger and evil of the situation is afforded by the report of th*Senate // Cr6dit Mobilier Committee on the cases of Senators Patterson and Harlan . In the case of the former the report seems to us unjust in a degree that can only be accounted for by extreme haste of preparation , joined with the excitement which the subject had caused in the public mind . Indeed , the former is sufficiently evinced by the structure of many of the sentences . To show that the Senators were treated with unwarrantable severity , it is hardly necessary to go behind the statement of facts presented by the committee . A person who had not read the newspapers during the investigation might read the indictment nearly through without forming any clear idea of what the wrong consisted in . The detailed narrative of Mr. Patterson 's transactions and the final summing up bear strong internal evidence of being the work of different hands . The salient facts , as stated in the narrative , begin with the statement that in August , 1867 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobilier , paying for them three thousand dollars , which the committee distinctly state was at that time its market value . It must be admitted , at the outset , that inducing a member to purchase stock for cash at its market value is a novelty in the annals of bribery . On this stock he drew large dividends in February and June , 1868 , and afterward , iii cash , stocks , and bonds . The magnitude of these dividends was the only ground he had for supposing anything wrong ; and , in animadverting upon them , the committee seem deeply imbued with the idea that , in stock speculation , it is morally much worse to make a good investment than a bad one . The final summing up and the narrative disagree upon two important points . While the latter states that the price paid was the market value , the former states that it was far below the " esteemed " value . According to the latter all corrupt purposes were carefully concealed , even the expected increase of value of the stock being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dividends ; the former asserts that he had full knowledge of the corrupt objects of Mr. Ames in thus dealing with him . As the whole weight of evidence and probability is on the side of the committee 's narrative and against their summing up , we must hold that there is no proof whatever of any corruption on Mr. Patterson 's part in holding the question // able stock . The only serious fault of which he can be reasonably accused is that of wilfully making a false statement before the House committee ; and , as he admitted its incorrectness as soon as confronted with the proof , the only question is , whether he wally knew it to be incorrect when he made it . As this i8 not a question in which any political principle is involved , we shall dismiss it with the single remark that while it may , from a hasty glance at the case , seem very improbable that he was not aware of the fact , there are several accessory circumstances which lessen this improbability , and make it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . We find that there was a gentleman to whom Senator Harlan stood in the same relation in which Mr. Colfax stood to Mr. Nesbit , leaving it with our readers to apply to that relation such general name as they may consider appropriate . This gentleman was Mr. Thomas 0 . iDurant , who was at the same time vice-president of the Union Pacific Railroad , director of the Cr6dit Mobilier , and trustee of the Gakes Ames contract . He had paid Mr. Harlan ten thousand dollars to enable him to get elected senator from Iowa . In almost every point Mr. Harlan 's case is worse than that of Mr. Patterson . They were on an equality only on the single point of no evidence being found that their votes as senators were in any specific case influenced by the transactions referred to . But in Mr. Harlan 's case there was no pretence that the gift was a dividend on stock he owned ; he had , therefore , far more reason to suspect corrupt motives than Mr. Patterson had . What was yet worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he must have known would be embarrassing if the latter should want his vote , while Mr. Patterson was under no such obligation to Ames . In the absence of proof that Mr. Harlan , in his capacity of senator , had done any thing corrupt for Mr. Durant , the committee can not be blamed for acquitting him . But no one will believe for a moment that a railroad man will pay ten thousand dollars to secure the election of a senator , without having good reason to know that it is to his pecuniary advantage so to do ; though whether the consideration was paid for services rendered in times past , or for some specific service to be rendered // in the future , is not definitely settled . The case may be taken to illustrate the insufficiency of the ethical standard by which the public mind measures such transactions . For example , in some very excellent quarters the committee have been criticised for not examining more closely whether Mr. Harlan did not apply Mr. Durant 's money to his own private use , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is implied that the distinction between the two modes of applying the money is one of public importance , as affecting the purity of the transaction . In fact , however , it is of no importance at all . Mr. Harlan 's election probably cost him more than the sum given by Mr. Durant , so that this sum was an equal relief to his own pocket , in which way soever it was applied . If it was not so , the senatorship was a gift equivalent to the money . The man who makes a senator certainly owns him more than he who simply makes him a gift . If financial managers are to be allowed to carry senatorial elections in this way , we had better transfer to them the duties of the election , so that their power shall be accompanied by its full share of responsibilty . The stress which the Morrill committee lay upon the fact that there was no corrupt contract between Mr. Harlan and Mr. Durant , and no understanding that the former should , after reaching the Senate , vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the exigencies of the situation . The fact is true , but there was no understanding simply because none was necessary . Mr. Durant , considered as a representative man , had no intei*tion of engaging in any scheme which would shock the moral sense of the community to such an extent as seriously to compromise the standing of his supporters . He only wanted help in matters where it might be given without incurring great public displeasure . And he knew Mr. Harlan well enough to be fully aware that he could rely upon his gratitude to his benefactor in any case of this sort a which might arise . We need only add that nearly all the great financial and political abuses of the day are of the sort alluded to . Our views of the principles involved in the recent charges of corruption may . seem to differ so widely from those usually taken as to render a more categorical statement of them neces // sary . We claim that the financial corruption of the present day , as exhibited in Congress , does not consist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into corrupt agreements where their votes come in as an element , but in placing them in such a position that they feel under a moral obligation to vote as they are desired to , unless doing so would wholly violate their sense of right or of honor . Our position is , therefore , that no member of Congress , present or prospective , should allow himself to be placed in such a situation . He should accept no present from any one when he has the slightest reason to fear that the donor may ever wish for any influence in return . In regard to every individual and every interest which is likely to be seriously affected either by legislation or by governmental influence , public opinion must place legislators in the same position with judges , whom it forbids to receive valuable presents from parties engaged in litigation . We have tried each member whose case we have considered by these rules , condemning them where they seemed to be violated , and exonerating them in the opposite case . The future of our Senat6 is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members of using dishonest means to secure their election . We occasionally see indications of a tendency on the part of the House to overshadow the Senate in the same way that the British Commons overshadows the House of Lords . We hold it of great importance to the stability of our government that the Senate should be able to resist this tendency , and this it can not do unless its honor is above suspicion . From this point of view the escape of the Kansas Senators is hardly less than a national misfortune , not merely because they go unpunished , but because the Senate was thus deprived of the opportunity of proving that it was determined to preserve its purity at all hazards , - a determination which , at the present time , it is urgently necessary should be exhibited . The public has good reason to fear that if Mr. Caldwell had not resigned , he would have been allowed to retain his seat , and that thus the Senate is quite prepared to establish , in practice if not in theory , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one gained in any other way . We say this , admitting that the evidence // against him was scarcely such as would suffice to convict a man of good character of an infamous crime . But it is as strong as we can ever hope to obtain in any case of the kind . We must always encounter the difficulty that , as a general rule , only bad men are concerned in the business or know anything positively about it , and that if their evidence is on the side of the prosecution it necessarily criminates themselves . Important as was the question of fact in this case , the points of law made by Mr. Conkling and others in the Senate are of vastly more importance , especially when taken in conjunction with those made by Mr. Butler in the House , in the case of the proposed expulsion of Messrs . Ames and Brooks . The point of law sustained by Mr. Conkling is briefly this : When an election of senator is conducted in exact accordance with the legal forms in such case made and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of the election are all genuine and in due form , the Senate can not invalidate the election by going behjnd it and inquiring into the motives of the electors in voting as they did . This legal principle was sustained by a curious combination of extremes ; Mr. Conkling being joined by a number of leading Democrats , who feared that granting such power to the Senate would afford a dangerous precedent for interfering with senatorial elections in general , when the dominant party might be dissatisfied with the result . Mr. Butler 's point of law is , that a member can not be expelled for any act committed before his election . The subject to which we wish to call attention is the splendid field which this law opens to the briber . He has only to reverse his usual mode of proceeding , by making a written contract with each member of the legislature , specifying that , in consideration of a certain sum , the member agrees to vote for him as senator , and to pay over the sum named , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , when it is all found out , if the Senate undertakes to expel him , he ex*hibits his documents and produces his evidence showing that the transactions occurred before his election as senator , so that , under Mr. Butler 's law , the Senate has no right to expel him . If an attempt to invalidate his election is made , Mr. Conkling 's law comes to his aid , by showing that his certificates are all // genuine and in due form , and that no one has a right to inquire further into the matter . Indeed , he can very easily arrange the matter so as to avoid all necessity for citing Mr. Butler 's law , and escape under Mr. Conkling 's law alone . He has only to sell himself secretly in advance to some corporation , and let the latter make all the arrangements with the members of the legislature . Not a shadow of wrong can then be thrown on his own good name ; he has been elected in due form , it is not his fault if another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to him under the law in question . We do not propose to discuss the legal question with Mr. Conkling . To do so would be as puerile as to argue whether a city on fire might lawfully burn down . That such a principle , under such circumstances , should have been propounded by a prominent member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , that it should have been supported by a large body of able men in the Senate and by leading journals in the interest of the dominant party , and that the country should finally have been left in doubt whether it would not have been seriously accepted and acted upon by the Senate itself , are altogether the severest blows which the honor , dignity , and influence of our highest legislative body has ever received , no matter how strong the legal arguments by which it may be sustained . We have said that the evidence against Mr. Caldwell was scarcely such as would convict a man of high character of an infamous crime . At the same time we have held that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's committee invalidating his election , without giving him a chance to escape by resignation . These two propositions may call for some explanation . The Senate has , in recent years , fallen into suspicion to an extent that should inspire its members and the whole country with alarm . In the normal state of things , the assertion that a senator had gained his seat by corrupt means ought to be received by the public with universal incredulity , as something inexplicable and most improbable . This state of things is tacitly presupposed when we extend to cases like that of Mr. Caldwell the maxim of criminal law : better that twenty guilty men should escape than that one innocent one should suffer . But the actual state of things is very different . // The public know or believe the legislatures of one third of the States of the Union , perhaps we might say one half , to b* more or less corrupt , many of them thoroughly corrupt . Where there are corrupt legislatures , there will always be corrupt men to manage them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate will not be received with incredulity , but will be looked upon as things not at all improbable , however difficult it may be to prove them . In this very opinion , apart from all evidence to sustain it , we have a loss of public confidence in the Senate which should alarm every thinking man . The danger is all the worse for belonging to that class which men are most prone to overlook , - dangers arising from hidden causes which give no striking evidence of their existence . The average politician thinks nothing of changes in public sentiment , unless they are accompanied by some popular outbreak . He defends his edifice against direct assault ; the possibility that it may be completely undermined without his knowing it until too late , never enters his mind . When the public so strongly suspects the purity of one third of the Senate , it will not do for the latter to wait for unattainable legal evidence before exhibiting a determination to purify itself . When we have confided to a man so great a trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we suspect his purity , it will not satisfy us if investigation is only able to bring to light evidence so contradictory on the part of his associates that ' we hardly know what to believe . When , from the very nature of the case , unimpeachable evidence can not be obtained , and when action of some sort is urgently demanded , we are obliged to act on probable evidence . The hesitation of the Senate to take action in this case proceeded , not merely from a failure to apprehend the gravity of the situation , but from a mode of viewing the subject which is at the bottom of many of our political abuses and notably of those in the civil service . We have gradually fallen into the habit of looking upon an office as a piece of p*rsonal property , owned by the person who is so fortunate as to come into possession of it , or by the officer who possesses the appointing power . Probably the majority looked upon ' Mr. CaIdwell as // they would have looked upon a man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now proposed to oust from possession , so that a great moral wrong was about to be done , unless it was clearly proved that he had forfeited his right . We hold that this view is fundamentally wrong . The republican idea of an office is not that of a right with which the office-holder is invested , but of a trust which he is executing for the benefit of others . The principal difference between a king and a president is , that the former professes to hold some divine or other right to his position , while no such right is possessed by the latter . That men should think of tenure of office as a right shows how difficult it is , even in this advanced stage of civilization , to seize in all their breadth and apply to *ll cases the fundamental ideas of a representative government . The senatorship being a trust which Mr. Caidwell was executing for the people of Kansas , and not a right with which he was invested , no moral wrong would have been done him by depriving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done to the people of Kansas , and they had ample opportunity to rectify it before Congress again met by re-electing him . Admitted corruption is not the only bad feature of our politics . The decay in the public sense of delicacy and propriety is equally striking , and perhaps equally worthy of attention ; because , even if a less evil than positive corruption , it is more easy to remedy by a healthy public sentiment . By the sense of delicacy and propriety we mean that instinct which revolts not merely at the thQught of breaches of the statute law , but at the idea of any act which can give rise to a reasonable suspicion of selfish , sinister , or improper motives . Until a quite recent period the respect for this instinct shown by our public men in their relations to the public was a highly gratifying , though almost unnoticed feature of our politics . But when the war of the Rebellion broke out , every other idea was 8ubordinated to that of its vigorous prosecution ; and before we had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with President Johnson assumed a phase in which official propriety looked like child 's play . This state of things culminated during the impeachment trial in the scandalous spectacle of the very man who was to assume the President 's // office , in case of Johnson 's removal , being allowed to vote for his guilt . As if to return to their constituents with the worst possible name , the Forty-third Congress signalized , its closing hours by a grave offence of like character with those above stated , in voting about a million and a half from the public Treasury into the pockets of its members . The impropriety of the act consisted less in its wrongfulness from a moral point of view than in the contempt shown by Congress for its own good name . After the ordeal it had passed through , one would have expected to find it on its good behavior during its closing days , instead of which it took pains to show that a reputation for good behavior was the last thing it cared for . With respect to their sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be divided into three classes : those who supported it on its merits , those who opposed and fought it to the end , and those who , while opposed to it on principle , yielded rather than endanger the Appropriation Bill to which it was appended . The first class would seem to have been in a considerable minority in the House , so that the provision was put into the bill against the wishes of the majority . This was done under a system of whit*h some complaint has recently been made , namely , that which gives committees a controlling voice in legislation . The final committee of conference on the Appropriation Bill in question was composed of six members , three from each house , and it would seem that only one out of the six , Mr. Garfield , was opposed to the back pay . The committee reporting in favor of the measure , there was no course but to accept it , or to call for a new committee of conference . The closing hour was so near that this course would have endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though opposed to the measure , were unwilling to do this was sufficient to s&amp;cure its acceptance . These men , we conceive , deserve sympathy rather than reproof at our hands , for the reason that they seem likely to be the worst punished . Of the original supporters of the measure , the most either had nothing to lose politically or represented constituencies who care little for the character of Congress . The really good men , who felt themselves forced to join them , made , we conceive , a grave mistake ; but if we reflect that by // continuing the contest , they might have had 4o face their constituents with the charge that they had made an extra session of Congress necessary , we may admit that the mistake was only one of judgment . The system which ga*ve rise to such an act is one which it is much easier to criticise than to find a remedy for . Bad as it sometimes looks , he would be a bold man who should attempt to contrive any better mode of discussing and passing laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general tone of Congress must be sought rather by a better mode of choosing members . An excellent beginning toward a better state of things will be made if the public will relieve candidates for office from the degrading business of personally engaging in efforts to secure their nomination . We all remember the time when , if *a candidate for Congress was in the town where a nominating convention was held , his friends kept him carefully concealed from public view , to be sent for only in case he was successful . The disposition now seems to be to look upon all this as mere formalism ; but the customs of civilized society have their origin in a sense of public propriety and in a feeling of mutual respect , which can not be set aside without speedily depriving society itself of the marks of civilization . The spectacle presented in Massachusetts , two years ago , of a gubernatorial candidate endeavoring to force his own nomination through a convention was , comparatively , as great a blemish on our civilization as if our people should all throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this direction is one of the easiest things in the world to carry out ; it is only necessary to adopt the rule of voting for nobody who is on the ground soliciting votes or influence . This reform is demanded on grounds much more cogent than those of simple good taste . The frequency , we might almost say the universality , of bargains , expressed or implied , between candidates and political leaders , is probably at the bottom of more corruption than is commonly supposed . Even where there is no bargain , the consciousness , on the part of an officer , that he owes his election , not to the spontaneous action of his constituents , hut to the working capacity of a few friends , must be demoralizing . If these friends have private interests which they wish him to employ his offi // cial position in promoting , and if their support was given on his personal solicitation , he can preserve his purity only by an act which his political supporters may look upon as one of base ingratitude . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should begin by saying that every reform must have its origin in a healthy public sentiment , which can be produced only by a very slow and gradual process of education , the proposition might seem too trite to be formally propounded . We mention it to show that one of the most needed reforms is that of the press . The daily and weekly journals are now our great educators . To say that the great majority of them admit of a decided improvement in the tone of their comments on publi9 affairs must not be taken as an unqualified reflection upon their conductors . If we consider how numerous are the private and party interests which are willing liberally to reward a journal for supporting them , and how slow in comparison are the returns from a single-minded devotion to the public interests , we shall find more cause for congratulation that our press is as pure as it is than for complaint that it is not better . There is , however , one class of journals to which this consideration can not be applied , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals are legitimate subjects of criticism , because most of them are in great part supported by the national government , and may therefore be fairly taken as specimens of governmental contributions to journalism . They are , in fact , employed to advertise proposals for services and supplies to be rendered all over the Union . In papers the existence of which is hardly known outside the District of Columbia , we find announcements at full length of sales of mules in Nebraska , old stoves in Kentucky , and grain sacks in Kansas , with whole columns inviting proposals for furnishing woods hay , oats , and straw in New York , Pensacola , St. Paul , and San Francisco . A fourth part of the entire paper is frequently thus occupied with useless advertisements , which are kept in up to the very morning on which the time expires , *o that the reader will frequently see an announcement that a government sale of old stores is taking place in Texas or Dacotah at the very time he is reading . // It is difficult to conceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journals thus favored in the work of " supporting the government . " It is needless to say that they do this to the best of their ability , but it is a serious question whether their support is not a greater source of weakness than of strength to the administration . Must not the latter suffer by being associated in men 's minds with journals which have distinguished themselves only by the defence of every corruptionist and every abuse that has been exposed during the past few years , and by attacks on every effort to correct such corruption and abuses ? The fact is , that Washington has got to be a sort of national cockpit in which the two parties pit their opposing papers and organizations against each other for their own gratification . The contests are of hardly more importance in politics than those of the sporting world are in civilization , yet they are kept up at the expense of the nation . The wrong thus done is intensified by the fact that the national capital offers a splendid field for a high class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first class , published on the spot , has an opportunity of following the daily current of political events , and becoming intimately acquainted with the inner working of the governmental machinery which can not be enjoyed by one published elsewhere , while , at the same time , it reaches the immediate leaders of public opinion in every part of the Union . Such a journal would now find the government competing with it by the support of papers of the lowest class . We may expect something from civil service reform in promoting , not only general purity of administration , but legislative efficiency . The member of Congress has hitherto had so much to do with the disposal of offices and other political matters belonging to the executive department of the government , that he has had too little time and attention left him for his legislative duties , and this is one of the principal causes from which legislation has hitherto suffered . Another object of the reform is to stop the bargaining and sale of offices by unscrupulous men for the purpose of securing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is carried under the old system is entirely unknown to the public , // because , as in any other case of bribery , it is for the interest of the parties concerned to hide their transactions . Among the practices not positively criminal at which the efforts of reformers are now aimed , the abuse of the civil service is the solitary one which does not admit of any defence whatever . It may be claimed , without positive unreasonableness , that the facile politician , trimming his sails to suit every breath of political opinion , is the one who has most respect for the views of his fellow-men , and who seeks to represent the exact feelings of his constituents , while the representative whom we praise for his conscientious adherence to what he believes to be for the best , against any amount of outside pressure , is , after all , only an obstinate man who considers his own opinion worth more than that of the public . The astute manager may be defended as one who can best divine the wishes of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ; and if they'snffer themselves to be led by a dozen men , it may be claimed that it is because this dozen know exactly what ought to be done . That large and often mischievoiis class of working politicians who never seek office for themselves admit of eulogy as unselfish patriots , and the value of their work may be defended by arguments not unworthy of notice . But the use of the appointing power to forward the political objects of its possessors is not seriously defended by any one worth listening to , for the simple reason that no valid defence is possible . When we claim that the consciousness , on the part of a public officer , that he has gained his office , not by especial fitness for it , but by doing work for the dominant party , and that its tenure depends , not on the manner in which he performs its duties , but on the satisfaction he gives to a set of men who have no interest whatever in it , is totally demoralizing to the public service , we claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their position only in an indirect way , by attacking every one who proposes to effectually change the practice , and every measure which tends to such a change . These attacks are urged on by so influential a party , that a brief statement of what we believe to be the position of civil service reformers may not be out of place . Offices are created , not for the benefit of the appointing // power , or of the holder , but for that of the public . Since the number of offices is very small compared to the number of citizens ready to fill them , a selection must be made from the latter . Among those equally well qualified and willing to accept , the appointing power should select the one who , by his intellectual capacity and wide intelligence , is most likely to prove a valuable officer in the future . Every man who admits that intellectual capacity and wide intelligence are qualities of the highest value in every servant of the government down to the lowest , and who conscientiously desires to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a civil service reformer , whatever be his opinions of the best mode of testing the possession of the qualities sought for . We only demand that he shall accept the logical consequences of the principles he professes to hold . The first consequence is that the test must be a competitive one . In the case of those minor offices which can not be filled by men of wide reputation , it is impossible to learn who is best qualified except by inviting every one whom there is reason to believe competent to come forward and make known his qualifications , in order that the best obtainable officer may be selected . The only point on which opinions can reasonably differ is the choice of the proper test . On this we shall only say , that there is no surer mark of the possession of those qualities which make a man valuable to his fellows than the propensity to acquire superfluous knowledge . We might claim that all human progress is due to this propensity , and that the civil service reformers are fully justified in making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an officer to the government . From this point of view , the fears entertained by a large body of the public lest candidates shall be examined on matters not germane to the duties of the office they seek are simply pitiable , and the only fault to be found with the civil service examinations is , that they indicate too deeply the influence of this fear . Outside of the regular routine of legislation , two of the most important bills before Congress were those for the restoration of the currency and the revival of American commerce . We believe the former is the only subject on which all parties are // unanimous , it being universally conceded that specie payment is an excellent thing . We are indeed aware that Mr. Butler proposed to dispense with all allusion to a material basis tf any sort for our currency , by having the government issue " certificates of value , " each of which should certify that it was a real dollar ; and we have heard that some one followed up the idea by proposing the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a loaf of bread : such exceptions are , however , too rare to be counted . But we no sooner approach any measure looking to the attainment of this desirable end , than unity becomes diversity . We are first met by the Philadelphia school of political economists . They do not possess the faculty of making their ideas clearly understood by others , but so far as can be gathered from their arguments , they consider the end in view too excellent to be even sought for until a much more advanced stage of human progress is reached , and deem it , at present , much more advisable to move in the opposite direction . We then meet a class , including a large proportion of the business community , who fear the effect of the change on the business of the country ; and then a yet larger class who do not see how specie payments can be reached ; and yet another who would rather wait until we are better prepared for the change ; and , finally , a class who think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test question is reached , only a very small party is left in its favor . It is difficult to say whether there is most to encourage or discourage us in what was done by Congress , or rather by the Senate , during the three days devoted to the discussion of the subject . It is , we believe , the first occasion on which any measure even looking to a restoration of our currency has actually come before either house of Congress since the war . This would seem to indicate that public sentlinent is really advancing in this direction . But when we examine the debate in the Senate , we find so complete a failure to grasp the problem in its practical bearings , that it might seem almost hopeless ever to expect intelligent action on the subject in Congress . To make this clear , it is only necessary to show what are the most important practical questions involved in the problem . Specie payment means the redemption by the government , // 208 July , in coin , of every legal-tender note of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , the first step on thepart of the government , and the step to which all others must be subordinate , is to provide the necessary coin to pay all the notes which are likely to be presented . To make intelligent provision for taking this step , and , indeed , to form any intelligent judgment whether it is practicable to resume at all , we must be able to form some rough estimate of the probable amount of greenbacks which will be presented for redemption . If they are all to be presented within a short space of time , a corresponding quantity of interest-bearing bonds must be thrown upon the market , and the problem is , in consequence , one of great difficulty , politically and financially . If , on the other hand , they come in so slowly that they can be absorbed by the surplus gold revenue of the government , the policy of resumption is so simple and easy that there is no valid excuse for deferring it a single day . Therefore , the great practical question involved in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we adopt a policy which , while in no manner abridging either the right of every holder of a greenback to receive coin for it or the obligation of the government to pay it , shall reduce the amount which will be presented for payment to a minimum ? This is the first test by which every proposed plan must be tried , because , until we have some idea , however vague , of what is involved in the plan , we can form no intelligent judgment of our ability to carry it out . Not only is this test the first one by which to try the financial feasibility of any plan , but also to try its political advisability . In fact , the great political difficulty involved in resumption arises from the fears of the business and moneyed classes that there will be a great withdrawal of greenbacks from circulation , to be followed by some sort of financial cataclysm . The smaller the amount of greenbacks presented for payment , the smaller the basis for these fears . Keeping these considerations in mind , the unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that not only was this first and main question not raised at all , but not a single speaker gave any evidence of // seeing that it was involved in any proposed plan of resumption , or that the quantity of greenbacks to be redeemed could be in any manner affected by any financial policy the government might adopt , and that the principal measure proposed by the bill was one the effect of which would be to increase , to the largest possible extent , the amount of greenbacks which would be presented for redemption , and thus to make resumption as difficult as possible . Debate was almost wholly confined to the details of certain changes proposed in the National Banking law , and the question of the expediency of any definite plan for resuming specie payments was really not reached at all . To make an intelligent survey of the field presented to our view by the proposal to resume specie payments , we have first to examine the facts and principles involved . By the public debt statements of the last few months , it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in round numbers , about $ 360,000,000 , of which about $ 110,000,000 are held by the National Banks and the Treasury as the legal reserve against the bank circulation and deposits , leaving about $250,000,000 in actual circulation among the people . To this we are to add $330,000,000 of National Bank notes , making the total paper circulation of the country about $580,000,000 , exclusive of fractional currency . By the policy of resumption this whole mass will become redeemable in coin , - the greenbacks directly , the bank-notes indirectly , because the holders can convert them first into greenback8 at the banks , and the latter into coin at the Treasury . Now , are there any principles or any facts of experience by which we can judge how much of this $ 580,000,000 is coming in for redemption ? There are not , indeed , any mathematical rules by which a precise mathematical determination of the amount can be made ; but there is a general principle , founded on experience , by which a judgment may be formed . This principle is briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulating medium of the country is nearly constant so long as the amount of business to be transacted does not vary ; and when business increases , the aggregate value of the currency must increase with it . This principle is so frequently misunderstood YOL . Cxvit. - NO. 240. 14 // and misapplied that some explanation of it is necessary . We use the term " absolute value " instead of " volume " of the currency , because the latter expression is entirely deceptive . It is commonly used to denote the entire number of dollars in circulation , but this would not properly express the sum total of the currency . If one should compare the circulating media of England and America , and conclude that we had five times as much circulation as England because we had five times as many dollars as England had pounds , reasoning on the supposition that the pound and the dollar were the same , every one would smile at the blunder . But the dollar of to-day and the dollar of fifteen years ago differ as much iii kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , and it is almost as serious a blunder to confound the two former as the two latter . The dollar of 1860 , 1864 , and 1871 are as distinct as if they had been called by different names . The only way to compare them is by their average purchasing power . We thus find that , although the gold dollar , when measured by the current stan*dard , is worth some eighteen per cent more to-day than it was fifteen years ago , its absolute value is really less now than it was then , because it will purchase a less average amount of commodities now than then . Therefore , when we speak of the absolute value of the entire circulating medium , we mean its total purchasing power , and not the number of dollars . By the principle in question , if we increase the volume of the currency , we shall sooner or later diminish the purchasing power of each individual dollar in the same proportion , unless the change is prevented by some counteracting cause . So , also , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding some outlet for the surplus currency which will then be in circulation owing to fewer dollars being necessary to transact all the business of the country on the new basis . We conceive that the principle in question has , been frequently misapplied through a misconception of what ought to be taken as forming the aggregate circulating medium of the country . It is customary to include under this term only what we may , for the sake of distinction , call material currency ; namely , specie and circulating notes . But a little consideration will // show that simple bank deposits should be included in the same category . If we inquire why it is that there is any limit to the total volume of currency which can be kept in circulation without depreciation , we shall find it to be because the money does not yield interest to the individual holder . The sum total of " money on hand , " which one has at any moment , according to his own estimate , consists of two portions , first , bank-notes , coin , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly , funds which he has deposited to his credit in a bank . He always tries to arrange his business so as to have this sum total as small as possible , because it does not bear interest either in the safe or the bank . Now men almost universally think that money in the bank is of the same kind with money in the safe , only in another place . But the amount of bank deposits can be increased indefinitely , without any corresponding'increase of circulating notes , by simply discounting the notes of individuals ; and we know , as a matter of fact , that the bank deposits of New York far exceed the amount of notes either in the bank vaults or in circulation . It follows from this that the comparative estimates of the amount of circulating medium in different countries and at different times , as usually presented , are quite deceptive , because the important item of bank credits is usually omitted from the aggregate . The following is a statement of the probable aggregate circulation of this country , either averaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - First Period , 1854 to 1857 , inclusive . Average amount of bank-notes in circulation $ 200,000,000 amount of bank deposits 205,000,000 Amount of gold in actual circulation ( estimated ) 50000,000 Total average volume of the currency , . . . $ 455,000,000 Average population , . . . . 27,000,000 Average circulation per head , . . . $ 17 Tho*crisis of 1857 was followed by a great falling off in the volume of the currency , which , however , was made up again during the year 1858. // 212 Second Period , 1858 to 1861 , inclusive . Average amount of bank-notes in circulation , amount of bank deposits , . Amount of gold in actual circulation ( estimated ) , Total average volume of currency , Average population , Average circulation per head , July , . $189,000,000 . 239,000,000 . 50,000,000 . $478,000,000 . 30,500,000 . . $ 15.66 The estimated amount of gold currency is very uncertain . It should include only that held by individuals for daily use . Thirdly , at the date of February 28 , 1873 . Legal-tender notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank deposits Total volume of currency Population ( probably ) , Circulation per head $248,000,000 330,000,000 656,000,000 $1,234,000,000 41,000,000 $30 . It appears that our nominal circulation per head of population is now eighty-five per cent greater than the average during the eight years which preceded the war . If we adopt , without modification , the principle of constant ratio between prices and circulation , we should conclude that the average scale of prices was about eighty-five per cent higher now than before the war . But several causes conspire to change this ratio , and , as a matter of fact , average prices* have not risen so much . In a general way we may say that agricultural products , excepting cotton , have scarcely risen at all , while manufactures of all sorts have risen from fifty to one hundred per cent . The average rise is probably not far from fifty per cent , and , if so , we have the difference between one hundred and fifty and one hundred and eighty-five to be accounted for by other causes . Two causes , which conspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hope that the government may provide for the redemption of the currency in specie or bonds , which makes the dollar a little more valuable than it would otherwise be . 2 . The curtailment of the credit system . Credit being a great economizer of money , any cause which diminishes it increases the necessity for currency proper . // The principle we have discussed affords the ' means of forming a judgment on the amount of legal-tender notes which will probably be presented for redemption . The premium on gold during the past four years has ranged between ten and thirty per cent . Hence , if the purchasing power of gold remains unaltered by the change of policy , which we have reason to believe , the purchasing power of the legal-tender dollar will be increased by a corresponding percentage . We may conclude , therefore , that probably between ten and twenty-five per cent of the total paper circulation of the country would come in for redemption ,  --  the amount varying with the state of business , and especially of the foreign exchanges . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export , the Treasury may disburse legal-tender notes without any coin redemptioii being demanded . Its stock of gold will then accumulate . When gold is wanted more than notes , the latter will be presented for redemption . We shall probably not be far from the truth in estimating that the sum total of legaltender notes presented by individuals for redemption within the first year would range between fifty and one hundred and twenty millions . The stock of coin on hand and the surplus gold revenue would probably suffice to meet this demand , and , if it did not , the amount of bonds to be issued in order to meet all demands of this class would not be very great . The most important conclusion to be drawn from the principles of currency alluded to is this : if there were no National Bank notes in circulation , specie payments might have been resumed long ago without any difficulty at all , because the legal-tender notes would all have been absorbed in the business of the country without sensible depreciation . There was no financial measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound basis than that of allowing private corporations to issue three hundred millions of paper money at the very time when the government had already been obliged to issue such quantities that its value had depreciated one half . One irredeemable currency would have been bad enough ; two , the one floating on the other , are now far worse than either would have been alone . Had the banks been allowed to issue currency when they pleased , subject however to the // requirement of redeeming it in coin ou demand , the measure would not have been so open to criticism . We say this , not to lament the past , but to enter our protest for the future against any power whatever , and especially private corporations such as the banks , being allowed to issue any more currency which they are not bound to redeem in coin , and to call attention to the fact that , if the diminution of circulating notes , in a restoration of specie payments , could all be made to fall on the banknotes , there would hardly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes for private individuals . It is hardly worth while to call attention to any especial way of doing this , because it may be regarded as politically impracticable . In any contest between the interests of the public and those of the banks , it may be safely assumed that , in the present state of affairs , the former will go to the wall . In the preceding discussion we have coiisidered only that portion of the legal-tender notes kept in circulation by individuals , or procured by them for the purpose of being converted into coin . We have now to consider the $115,000,000 held by the banks as part of their twenty-five per cent of legal reserve against circulation and deposits . If the government offers to pay these notes in specie on demand , without any restriction or any alteration of its policy toward the banks , the latter must be expected at once to exchange their legal-tender reserve for specie . This would at once throw a demand upon the Treasury which it would be entirely unable to meet . We may therefore regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it shall include some provision which shall make it for the interest of the banks to keep their reserves in the form of legal tenders , rather than to demand their exchange into coin . With these considerations before us , we are in a position to examine intelligently the bill for the restoration of the currency reported to the Senate by Mr. Sherman from the Committee of Finance . The original bill was introduced by Mr. Buckingham , and we regret not having space to print it in full , with notes on each sentence , as a curiosity of legislation . It did not contain a provision which was not either mischievous , ineffective , or of doubtful or impossible construction , and its passage , even if the Executive could have made up his mind what // it required him to do , would have put specie payments further off than they are now . As reported back by Mr. Sherman , it was hardly recognizable , being shorn of its objectionable features , and so worded that th' reader could judge what it meant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent consideration in the debate , made two very important changes in the National Banking system . The amount of circulation which the banks might issue was no longer restricted , and , so long as they redeemed their notes in legal tender whenever demanded , they were no longer required to keep a definite legal-tender reserve . In a normal state of financial affairs , both these measures would be steps in the right direction . Under the present system the banks are prevented from adapting their operations to the wants of business . The great mass of their circulating notes is kept out at all times , and when more are wanted no more can be had . The banks always have plenty of accommodation when no one wants it , because their reserves then increase . They lower their rate of interest so as to keep the reserves down very nearly to the legal limit , so that when a call is made upon those reserves , they are immediately debarred from giving further accommodation . Unfortunately , however , financial affairs are not in their normal state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be redeemable in coin . As matters actually stand , it is practically irredeemable ; for the system of redemption in irredeemable paper , which we now have , is like anchoring a vessel at sea by fastening her to a large ship which is herself drifting unanchored . Both may go to ruin together . Redemption in coin , or something else having absolute value independent of the needs of the money market , is all that can , in the absence of restriction , prevent the banks from expanding indefinitely . Every bank can find borrowers for all the notes it can issue , and there is no serious danger of their coming back for redemption , because a legal-tender note now serves no purpose which a bank-note would not serve equally well . The result of the proposed legislation would therefore have been , that whenever the government commenced to redeem its notes they would all have been presented for redemption , // July , wlether held by individuals or the banks . Those held by the banks would have been presented because , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , and no inducement , direct or indirect , would be held out to induce a preference for notes . Thbse held by individuals would have come in because driven in by the now unlimited issue of bank-notes . It was , no doubt , in view of the difficulties which might thus arise that Mr. Sherman 's bill , instead of providing for specie payment of the greenbacks , provided for their conversion into specie or five-per-cent bonds at the option of the Treasurer of the United States . Such options constitute one of the bad features of our legislatioii , and there was nothing in the law to prevent his furnishing the more valuable of the two to such persons or institutions as he wished to favor , while paying the less valuable to others . We suppose , however , that the understanding was that the least valuable should always be paid , and in this case the redemption would probably be made in bonds alone for some time to come . Under the law as it now stands , these bonds could not be used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to keep their legal-tender notes until the Treasury actually commenced redeeming in coin . In favor of this system of redemption in interest-bearing bonds many sound arguments can be urged . The strongest objection to it is that it would be too much at the mercy of politics and too much affected by the state of the government credit , and this objection is serious enough to render its permanent adoption unadvisable . But it would be as much better than our present system as a poor security is better than none at all ; and the conditions of its successful adoption are therefore worth inquiring into . The first and most necessary condition is , that the bonds shall bear sufficient interest to make them worth par in gold , because otherwise the currency based on them will inevitably depreciate . To attain this end the interest must be as much as five per cent . A lower rate may indeed answer a temporary purpose , if the amount of bonds issued is very small ; ' but if made the sole basis of the currency , the depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest falls short of this rate . For instance , if the rate were only 3*%* per cent , the bonds would only be worth from seventy to eighty // cents on the dollar , unless the principal were payable incoin at a not distant day . In other words , the premium on gold might rise to thirty or forty per cent without being checked by the conversion of notes into bonds bearing * interest . Every plan for restoring the currency must give rise to so much discussion of minute details , the arrangement of which is triply complicated by the complexities of our National Bankbig system ; and the interests to be provided for , or which will insist on being provided for , are so numerous and conflicting that we may well despair of anything effective being done until some higher view than that of merely regulating the currency is taken . Such a ground is afforded by the necessities of the national credit and the national honor . The legal-tender notes were issued ten years ago on the credit of the nation . The understanding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth par as soon as the emergency under which they were issued had passed . On each note the United States promises to pay the bearer the amount named on* its face . What does this promise mean ? This is a question which every voter in the land should ask himself , and , after careful reflection , try to answer . Is the government under any obligation to keep this promise ? If it is , it is violating its faith every day it neglects to fulfil it . If it is not , the promises of our government do not mean anything ,  --  a fact which the quicker the world finds out , the better ie will be . Two answers may be made to ' these questions . One is that the government is not bound to any specified time of payment , and therefore need only pay when it pleases . This is the same thing as saying that it will never pay at all . For it is always more convenient to defer payment till next year than to make it now ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never to come , all talk about payment may as well be abandoned . A note payable without interest in one hundred years is worth very little , but payable only at the pleasure of the drawer it is worth much less , no matter how sound the draw.er may be . This question of payment of the public obligations expressed in the legal-tender notes is one which should be energetically taken up by the friends of the public credit . We should no // longer allow ourselves or our opponents to close the eyes to the true state of the case . No denunciation on the one hand nor apologetic phrases on the other will cover up or change the fact that the legal7tender notes are either dishonored obligations of the government or tnere pieces of waste paper , according as the promise to pay expressed on their face does or does not bind the government to fulfil it . If we take the ground that the government is bound to tender payment for these notes without further delay , - and , as we have just shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the promises of our government mean nothing and imply no obligation ,  --  then no question of supposed expediency should be allowed to make us hesitate . In fact , however , the argument of expediency is wholly on the side of payment . The dangers to which the finances of the whole country are exposed by the present system , though entirely overlooked , are of the gravest character , while those feared by the opponents of specie payments are almost entirely imaginary . A fear of imaginary dangers , with a corresponding disregard of real ones , is indeed a common characteristic of imperfect knowledge under all circumstances . First among the imaginary dangers stands the fear that any cause which diminishes the number of dollars in circulation will be productive of disaster to the moneyed interests through a deficiency in the volume of the circulating m*dium . To show fully the entire groundlessness of this fear would require a consideration of the whole subject of money and exchange ; we shall therefore only indicate briefly two reasons , one founded on the nature of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " coiitraction " pure and simple , that is , contraction without reference to the wants of business , and without any corresponding appreciation of the dollar , except what might be forced by the contraction itself the fear in question , though without sufficient foundation , would not be devoid of plausibility . But the simple offer of the government to pay coin or interest-bearing bonds for its legal-tender notes will not necessitate the withdrawal of a dollar of these notes from circulation . If any notes come in for redemption , it will not be because the holders are forced to bring them in , but // because there is no use for them in business so profitable as that of the gold or bonds in which they are redeemable . Our calculation that one hundred millions , more or less , would come in for redemption , is founded on the probability that fewer of the appreciated dollars would be necessary to transact the business of the country . Should such not be the case , then none will come in . The great advantage of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , over enforced contraction , lies in this : that in the former case every one will know exactly what is coming , and business and prices will adjust themselves in advance to the new order of things , without shock , difficulty , or uncertainty ; while in the latter case the future value of the currency will be as uncertain as ever . The effect of the former policy would probably be to ease the money market , that of the latter to tighten it . As a fact of experience we may say that no one has ever brought to light an instance of any community being for any length of time without a sufficient supply of circulating medium to effect all its exchanges , for the simple reason that no definite quantity of such a medium is necessary for this purpose . A circulation of a thousand million cents could be made to effect all our domestic exchanges just as well as one of a thousand million dollars , and one of ten times the latter amount would effect them no better . Indeed , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borrower the more of it is issued , so that every issue is followed by a stronger demand for more . Prices then go up faster than the volume of currency increases ; every one who borrows hopes to pay in money still more depreciated by further issues , and the apparent rise in values fosters speculation , to carry on which requires more and more money . While men thus allow themselves to hesitate before dangers which are purely imaginary , one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the prosperity of a wealthy nation stares us in the face . It is one so difficult of comprehension when nakedly stated , that we shall have to employ an analogy . If a man should purchase the title to a farm in the West , for the support of himself in his old age , or that of his children after his // July , de*jth , he would want some assurance as to the size of the farm . If a considerable portion of the wealth of a community was invested in such title-deeds , knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . If it should be found that they had . made the investments without this knowledge ; if their deeds assured them of nothing but one farm , " without any specification of the size of it ; if the latter was to be determined in the future , partly by legislation and partly by accident , and might be one acre just as well as a hundred , - we should wonder at their folly in so investing the funds which were destined for the future use of their families . Now , the place filled by the word " farm " in these deeds is precisely that filled by the equally vague word " dollar " in nearly all the moneyed associations of the country . A lifeinsurance policy , for instance , only entitles the heirs of the owner to a certain number of " dollars . " It gives no assurance whatever of the real value of the dollars he is to receive , these being entirely at the mercy of Congress . If specie payments are resumed and adhered to , the dollar will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . If this total volume of the currency is confined to its present limits , and the present restrictions upon bank deposits are kept up , there is no serious danger of a depreciation of the dollar below sixty or seventy per cent of its present value . If all restrictions upon the issues of currency and on bank expansion are thrown off we have no assurance that the dollar of thirty years hence will have the purchasing power that the cent has now . Whenever irredeemable paper dollars are allowed to be issued , there will always be a demand for more , and the temptation to increase their number becomes stronger and stronger . If this temptation is yielded to , the number of dollars will go on increasing until they will be as plenty in every one 's - pocket as nickels are now , and small services will be paid for in tendollar bills , as they are now in ten-cent notes . This change need not seriously interfere with the transaction of current business , - because , as we have already remarked , the exchanges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of eagles , dollars , or cents . The sufferers would be the bond-holder , who would find that the principal of his // hundred-dollar bond would only buy him ten soda-water tickets , and the heirs of members of life-insurance companies , who would find that a year 's interest on their policies , instead of keeping them from want , would not buy a barrel of flour . Under our present system we not only have no guaranty against this state of things happening , but several causes conspire to bring it about . In the first place , all that class who have to pay the dollars have a direct interest in bringing it about , and that class includes nearly all the influential financial managers . For instance , if the men who build a railroad on borrowed money can get the dollar reduced to one half its absolute value , they are thus relieved from half their debt . The men who employ the money of others in ' this and other ways , though not the most numerous class , are generally those able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of the business ability of the country . The class of investors , though far more numerous , and hence able to crush their creditors if they only knew how to do it , are prevented both by apathy and lack of business ability from organizing any effici9nt plan of resistance .. Indeed , the policy of depreciation will be for the most part a popular one , because there is a corresponding nominal rise in the value of every kind of property , except bonds or other forms of indebtedness ; and as there is no nominal depreciation in these , nobody is dissatisfied unless he has the acuteness to see through the cheat which is practised . The policy is destructive to national wealth for the same reason that it is popular . The imaginary increase of wealth which is so fascinating and the enormous sums to be made by speculation discourage further production and encourage extravagance , until the inevitable bursting of the bubble shows the true state of affairs . Then men . mourn the loss of their imaginary , wealth , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataclysm ; while the fact is , that the real wealth of the country was going to waste during the whole period of depreciating paper money , its loss being concealed by the constantly diminishing value of the dollar by which all was measured . Such is the danger which continually threatens us so long as the present state of things continues , and against which it is // July , the bounden duty of all to call on Congress for protection . No measure can be too radical for the situation . The absolute repeal of the legal-tender law , with a withdrawal by the government of all pretence of making its irredeemable notes money , would be far better than following , as we now are , in the track of Russia , Austria , revolutionary France , and revolutionary America . At the same time , the danger may be greatly diminished without adopting any radical measure . If the government will not allow the issue of any more bank-notes , except on the condition that they shall be payable in coin on demand , and will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own notes , the financial situation will be greatly strengthened . To do this in a way which , though imperfect , will answer the purpose , is very easy . Assuming that five-per-cent bonds , principal and interest payable in gold , will continue to be worth nearly par in gold , it is only necessary to provide that all holders of legal tender shall be entitled to exchange them for five-per-cent gold bonds after a date to be fixed . As the bonds may bear a premium , even in coin , it may be ad*isable to adopt that feature of Mr. Sherman 's bill which leaves it optional with the Treasurer to rideem in bonds or coin . To allay the fears of those who think the notes may be wanted for the purpose of currency , it may be provided that all the notes thus received shall be kept in the Treasury as a reserve fund , to be paid out again in exchange for the bonds , whenever holders of the latter shall desire to part with them at a small discount , say one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly safe first step , against which no sound objection can be urged . It-is not worth while to enter into a detailed discussion of any plan at present , because the great want is not a plan but a determination to reach the end sought . Indifference to the latter is at the bottom of all the difficulty in deciding on any mode of reaching it . Let Congress and the public once waken to a sense of the national dishonor involved in allowing the promissory notes of the government to stand year after year without any provision at all being made to honor them , and to the danger of the system under which nearly all the bond-holders and life-insurance companies of the country will be compelled to accept these or // any other notes which any future Congress may see fit to authorize in payment of their claims , and the work of providing a remedy will prove very easy . And until a sense of the exigency of the case is reached , no arrangement of plans for restoring specie payment can be expected to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
