txt The Village of Hollisterville , 20 miles from this city , just over the Wayne County line , although one of the most prosperous and attractive places in North-eastern Pennsylvania , has for many years borne a very unenviable reputation , in consequence of crimes that have been committed there and in the vicinity , in a manner which left no doubt that they were the work of an organized gang of rogues , with head-auartars in the village . Masked burglaries , highway robberies , and mail and express robberies , accompanied in some cases with deadly assaults , were , until 1867 , common occurrences around Hollisterville . In that year E. B. Hollister , a Justice of the Peace in the village , one of its most prominent citizens , who had for years been suspected of being concerned in many criminal operations , was arrested , charged with committing burglary . He was convicted and sentenced to the Penitentiary , but escaped through a technicality . Since then , and until last year , lawlessness ceased thereabout . In November , 1878 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrests of suspected . persons wore made . Another dastardly outrage was attempted in Hollisterville a few nights since , and although its perpetration was , happily , frustrated , the circumstance will have nb little effect in the trial of the accused persons mentioned above , as one of the indictments growing out of the crime of November , 1878 , the trial being set down for ; the December term of court at Honesdale . Theodore H. Baker is the Postmaster at Hollisterville . He is a well-to-do merchant , and the son of Judge Baker , of Susquehanna County . His store and residence is opposite the residence of Squire a B. Hollister . In August of last year a mortgage for about $3,000 that Baker held against Hollister came due . Baker 's story of what occurred afterward is substantially as follows : Although the money was due he was not ' anxious that it should be paid , as Hoilister 's property was more than ample security for it . Hollister was anxious to have it paid . On the 8th of November , 1878 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an assignment of the mortgage and paid Baker the money . Hollister paid Curtis $200 for negotiating the transfer , and gave 0 . H. Bunnell , of Honesdale , $20 for furnishing Curtis the money . The $3,000 was taken by Baker and placed in his wallet . The same afternoon , however , Baker asserted that a friend warned him against keeping the money in his house , and he placed it in the custody of the friend . A girl named Fanny Van Gorder , the 17-year-old daughter of a neighboring farmer , who had lived in Baker 's family , came to his house about tea-time on the 8th , and , according to Baker 's story , requested Mrs. Baker to allow her to remain all night , which request was granted . The girl went to her room about 9 o'clock . Baker and his wife retired soon afterward . He laid the wallet which had contained the $3,000 , but which then had only $150 in it , upon the bureau in his bedroom , as was his custom . About midnight Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told Baker to hurry on with his clothes , as there was a big fire near by . Baker jumped from bed , and he asserts that he noticed that the girl was dressed just as she was when she went to her room in the evening , even to the ribbons in her hair . Baker ran to the fire , which proved to be in C. M. West 's barn , some 30 rods distant . A great many people were there , but Baker noticed that none of the Hollisters were on the ground . The barn and its contents could not be saved . The loss was about $3,000 . Baker remained at the fire a half an hour or so , and then walked back home . It was bright moonlight , and when he was nearly home he insists that he saw Fanny Van Gorder enter Squire Hollister 's front gate and walk through his yard on toward the residence of a man named Meyers . Although she was but 15 or 20 feet from Baker , and saw him , she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as strange , but a few minutes afterward he thought it very remarkable , for when he reached home he found his wife in a state of excitement bordering on insanity . Her face was bloody . and the face of his 7-year-old boy was covered with blood . She said that after her husband went to the fire she placed her little boy on a chair by a window , where he could look at the fire . Fanny Van Gorder was in the room . A minute or so after Mr. Baker left the house , the door was thrown open and a man sprang into the room . He had a cloth over his face from the middle of his nose down . He knocked Mrs. Baker down , but not before she recognized the man as George Burns , a brother of Squire Hollister 's wife . He heat her until she was unconscious . Fanny Van Gorder made no effort to aid her , and did not seem surprised at the entrance of the robber . When Mrs. Baker regained consciousness there was no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her boy , who had been struck by the masked man , and who was lying on the floor bleeding at the nose . The pocket-book was gone . The news of the masked robbery and assault at Baker 's house soon spread , and the excitement at the fire was forgotten . To the crowd that assembled at his house Baker declared that he had been robbed , and that " Hollister and George Burns were the men that did it . " It was at once believed that the fire had been started to draw Baker from his house , where the $3,000 was supposed to be , in order that the money might be secured . Hollister and Burns were suspected because of their antecedents and of the peculiar circumstances connected with the obtaining of the $3,000 and its payment to Baker . George Burns bad left Hollisterville some years previously , it being suspected that he was concerned in a masked burglary and other crimes in the village . He had returned to the village a few weeks before the fire and masked burglary of Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay him the money in order that he might have it stolen back , and , not knowing that it had been sent away by Baker , the plan has been carried out in all its details except the capturing of the $3.000 . Detectives Bates and Slocum , of Scranton , were set to work on the case , and were to be liberally paid if they brought the guilty parties to conviction . The detectives obtained from Joseph Stanton and Frank Bailey , two notorious characters , the remarkable statement that in October previous to the Hollisterville affair they became acquainted in Scranton with a young man from Hollistervilla named Will Meyers . He told them that he knew aman who intended to pay another man $3,000 in November , and that it would not be paid until arrangements had been made to steal it back . The parties lived in Hollisterville , and Meyers said that his girl lived in the , family of the man who was to receive the money , and she would help get it , and would die before she would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to assist in stealing the money . but they declined to take the risk . Will Meyers was a young carpenter , who lived near Baker 's , in Hollisterville . Fanny Van Gorder was his sweetheart . Baker did not remember to have seen young Meyers at the fire on the night of the 8th until it was nearly over , and a person was found who said that he saw Meyers come around the corner of West 's barn a few minutes before the fire broke out . Hollister , Burns , Meyers , and Fanny Van Gorder were arrested , charged with being the iparties concerned in the crime . Hollister , it was charged , planned the affair . Fanny Van Gorder had been summoned to go to Baker 's on the day the money was paid and remain there all night , in order to make sure that Baker was alarmed and sent out of the house . Meyers was the man selected to start the fire , and Burns was assigned the task of securing the plunder . They were all bound over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Baker paid was caused by the knowledge that Baker intended to sell him out , and that he was using his mortgage as a threat in an endeavor to debauch Hollister 's daughter . It was to protect his property and his family against Baker that he was willing to pay a bonus to a man to loan the amount of the mortgage , and another large fee to a second person for accepting the loan and making the transfer . Baker would not agree to assign the mortgage to Curtis until Hollister delivered up to him letters written by him to Hollister 's daughter making dishonorable proposals . The four prisoners were indicted for burglary , conspiracy , arson , and robbery . They were tried in February last on the burglary charge . An important bit of evidence on the part of the prosecution was that Will Meyers had carried a letter to Fanny Van Gorder on the 8th of November , which was alleged to be the notice to her that she was to be on hand at Baker 's that night . The defense desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the girl while she was an inmate of his tamily which had led to criminal intimacy between them , and that the letter was sent to Miss Van Gorder by Baker himself , making an appoiniment with her . The court would not admit the testimony . Evidencesubstantially as above was given against the prisoners , and a verdict convicting Will Meyers and Fanny Van Gorder and acquitting Hollister and Burns was rendered , to the astonishment of the community . A new trial was granted to the girl and her lover , and they were admitted to bail . Meyers did not appear at the last term of court . Fanny Van Gorder appeared , was retried and acquitted , and a nollo prosequi entered in the other indictments against her , and she was discharged . So much for the first chapter in this strange story of crime . The later events add new interest to the affair . On Wednesday , the 13th inst. , the wife of T. H. Baker left Hollisterville to visit relatives in Luzerne County . Miss Hattie Spangenberg , daughter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to take charge of Mrs. Baker 's household affairs during her absence . On Thursday night , as she affirms , atter she had retired , Baker called to her that he had a letter foe ? her , and told her to come down stairs and get it . She told him to put it on the table and she would get it in the morning . Shortly afterward he came to her room door and demanded admittance . This being refused , he broke the door in . Miss Spangenberg called loudly for aid , and Baker hastily withdrew . The frightened girl ran down stairs . and was escaping from the house in her night clothes , when Baker seized her . After a terrible struggle she managed to get away from him and out of the house , and . ran barefooted to her father 's house . where she fell insensible . When the news of this attempted outrage became known , the indignation of the villagers was so great that summary proceedings against Baker would have been taken with little urging . Baker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is likely that criminal proceedings will be taken against him . Many of the charges made against Baker by Squire HolHater now find ready believers , and the moral effect of the recent affair in the coming trial will be greatly in favor of the prisoners . It is considered extremely doubtful that Baker will press the case now , and no one will be surprised if a folio prosequi is entered .
