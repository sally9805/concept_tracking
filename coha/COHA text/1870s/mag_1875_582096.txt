EDUCATION AND FREE THOUGHT . XVHETHER it is possible to bring up a child intelligently without any convictions whatever on religion , and whether true intellectual freedom and habits of mental independence are interfered with by religious teaching in early life , are two questions of the greatest importance to parents and educators . Mr. Webster 's argument on the former question-in the Girard College Caseis famous . We have a plethora of argument nowadays on the latter question , and the world has just at this moment one striking instance of parental training and education dissevered in tab from all religious tenets , and all religious practice , from which to judge if it has any advantages as to freedom of thought . Mr. Mill is very frank in his Autobiography as to the paternal influence upon him against religion . After describing the views and habits of his father in this respect , he says : " It will be admitted that a man of the opinions and the character above described , was likely to leave a strong impression on any mind princ45ally formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference of this impression with freedom of thought , both absolutely and comparatively . This will be done in this paper in both ways . Mr. Mill admits that , " in a degree once common , but now very unusual his father , threw his feelings into his opinions . " This is precisely what has long been urged against those who give to their children or pupils a Christian education . We have been told , with endless reiteration , that it must needs interfere with liberty of opinion in others . But " it is difficult to understand , " says Mr. Mill , " how any one who possesses much of both ( opinions and feelings ) can fail to do " as his father did . If this can be vindicated , however , where both head and heart are hostile to religion , it can where both are friendly . It is affirmed , further , that " none but those who do not care about opinions will confound this with intolerance , " which is as just , if just at all , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of unchristian ones . Moreover , we are assured by Mr. Mill that " the forbearance which flows from a conscientious sense of the importance to mankind of the equal freedom of all opinions , is the only tolerance which is commendable , or to the highest moral order of minds possible ; " which sounds vastly like an old " orthodox " position , maintained among Puritan thinkers from John Milton 's and John Robinson 's day , and plentifully assailed now by some newspaper critics and a few preachers . Moreover-disavowing malevolence and ill-doing for opinion 's sake-Mr . Mill goes so far as to admit-what would be perilous for an " Evangelical " writer-that " those who , having opinions which they hold to be immensely important , and their contraries to be prodigiously hurtful , have any deep regara for the *general good ; will necessarily dislike as a class , and in the abstract , those who think wrong what they think right , and right what they think wrong , though they need not therefore be , nor was my father , insensi ble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this is to excuse or defend the style and amount of forming power which his antitheistic parent exerted over himself But one rubs his eyes on reading it , and looks again to see if it is not charged upon some Edwardean or Hopkinsian divine , or some " orthodox " person at least . But no ! it is an account of James Mill by his son , John Stuart . Translate opinions into " creed " oi " belief , " as used in well-established religious circles , and what would come of it ? Now this father , who so impressed his son and had such an agency in forming and fastening upon him his opinions , held that right and wrong " are qualities solely of conduct-of acts and omissions ; " that " feelings are no proper subjects of praise or blame . " " He refused to let his praise or blame be influenced by the motive of the agent , " which even intense utilitarianism would allow him to do , the motive being , supposably , utility . But the refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as to entertain religion as a system of the highest and best motives . Yet James Mill judged character by motives , though never acts  --  a curious logical and ethical inconsistency . His moral convictions were " wholly dissevered from religion ; " " his aversion to religion , " as might be anticipated , " was of the same kind with that of Lucretius . " " I have a hundred times heard him say , " testifies his son , " that mankind have gone on adding trait after trait " ( to the character of the gods they believed in ) " till they reached the most perfect conception of wickedness which the human // 45 ' mind can devise , and have called this God . This ne plus ultra of wickedness he considered to be embodied in what is commonly presented to mankind as the creed of Christianity . " The mere holding of this notion , *s a personal opinion , did not interfere at all , it is clear , with his son 's adopting a juster and more correct opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so /aug/z4 along with perversions of Christian sentiment , as to make candor , at least , impossible . For the example given in the Autobiography of what is " commonly " believed by Christians , is the idea , in its baldest form , of creating men for the sake of eternal punishment ! And this led the father to reject all religion , and to require his son to do so . He taught him , to be sure , " to take the strongest interest in the Reformation as the great and decisive contest against priestly tyranny for liberty of thought . " But he taught him , also , to reject the truths , for the sake of which , and in loyalty to which , liberty of thought was won by the Reformers , and to hold them responsible for the perversions above stated . And a mere vague passing allusion to what seems to be the intended teaching of Christ on the law of love , does not make Christ 's teaching a religion to the son , or anything* better than a human protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of God , as a being infinitely cruel . The approach of death , the son is careful to assure us , did not cause his father " the smallest wavering in his convictions . " He lived and died rejecting , " not only the belief in revelation , but the foundations of what is commonly called natural religion. ** Yet he might have allowed his son to think for himself ; and form some sort of reiigious belief independently . How this was prevented is a curious revelation of the ways of " free-thinkers . " Stuart Mill , in this respect at least , was the mere creature of James Mill . " It would have been wholly inconsistent with my father 's ideas of duty , " he testifies , " to allow me to acquire impressions contrary to his convictions and feelings on the subject of religion . " He says , therefore , of himself ; that he " never had " any " religious belief "  --  and how could he acquire one in the circumstances ? " He impressed upon me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence was a subject on which nothing was known . " The theoretical atheism of both at this point , in respect to the Author of the world , was as complete and blank as their moral atheism in respect to its Governor . The pupil thus tampered with from the very beginnings of thought , or perhaps we should say , thus tyrannized over , confesses that he " looked upon the modern exactly as upon the ancient religions , as something which in no way concerned " him , and pronounces skeptics , Deists , and those whose notions fall " far short of Deism " - evidently including his father , if not himself  --  the brightest ornaments of the world , " truly religious , " more genuinely religious " than Christians . It is easy for the reading and literary public to accept the book in which this is done as " The Autobiography of an Atheist . " How complete the mastery of the elder Mill over the younger was , can be seen openly in the timid way in which the one differed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been rigidly brought up on Malthus , Ricardo , Bentham , and the " Theory of Government . " His logical education did not secure independence here , as might be supposed . It began with the " Organon " of Aristotle , and Latin treatises on the scholastic logic . This was followed by the study of Hobbes . He confesses that he profited little by the " Posterior Analytics , " but maintains strongly the value of " an early practical familiarity with the school logic . " " I do not believe that any scientific teaching ever was more thorough , or better fitted for training the faculties , than the mode in which logic and political economy were taught to me by my father . " " He gave me his explanations not before , but after , I had felt the full force of the difficulties . " In the logic of atheism , however , the parental method was quite different ; the difficulties were never canceled by explanations . The practical part of logic seems to have been taught by the examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after having been well stocked with the ideas and reasonings of Ricardo , the young student was set to find the fallacies in the arguments and the errors in the conclusions . His instrnctor was vigilant in detecting whether he understood what he had read , and in training him to analyze it . He went through the whole of political economy in this way . " I thought for myself ; almost from the first , " he says , " and occasionally thought differently from him , though for a long time only on minor points , and making his opinion the ultimate standard . At a later period I even occasionally convinced him and altered his opinion on some points of detail . " But no such thorough work and no such scru // tiny-even in the lesser things of detailwere ever applied to religion . No difference on any point appears , or would have been allowed . The son blindly followed the father even in concealing his atheism , quite down to the time of his election to Parliament . That so eminent and applauded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual bondage in the story of his life , has astonished not a few of its readers . Let us now trace the education of three men of great and not dissimilar intellectual ability-resembling Mill mentally , resembling each other-with special reference to logical training and the formation of opinions about religion . Let us take men whose belief was positive just where Stuart Mill 's was negative  --  or was disbelief-yet who cherished a " deep regard for the general good , " unequaled by that of either Mill , and whose teachers held their opinions " to be immensely important and their contraries to be prodigiously hurtful . " Nothing can be more equitable than this . Let them be three whose education was obtained half a century earlier than his , and in circumstances far less favorable in much ,  --  three Americans , theologians by profession and logicians by habit , - far less likely on the former account to acquire independence of mind , some may think , but deserving far more credit for it , if they did . Let us see if they lost this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the necessities of a Christian training in logic and truth . They were men more open to the influence of other minds , through the freer contact and varied associations which American colleges afforded a hundred years ago , than Mill ever was in the secluded and solitary pupilage in which he was trained . But waiving this , let the investigation be simply as to the intellectual liberty secured in their religious instruction during the forming period of belief and conviction . One of the three was a thinker of whom Dr. Channing , who sufficiently disliked his views , testified : " In forming his religious opinions he was superior to human authority ; he broke away from human creeds ; he interpreted God 's word for himself ; he revered reason , the oracle of God within him . " " In accordance with his free spirit of inquiry , we find him making not a few important modifications of Calvinism . " In particular Channing testifies that in accepting predestination , as he understood it , " he believed it to be sustained by profound metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human mind : so that in receiving it he did not abandon the ground of reason . " This untrameled logician and believer said of himself : " I hope I shall never be guilty of referring to any uninspired man as an authority . " He went so far as to refuse " the weight of a straw " to the dictum of " the wisest and best men that ever lived , " in comparison with what he deemed a higher word than man's . " I now declare , " he said again , " I had much rather publish New Divinity than any other . And the more of this the better , if it be true . Nor do I think any doctrine can be too strange to be true . ' I should think it hardly worth while to write , if I had nothing new to say . " His biographer , Dr. E. A. Park , says of him : " He studied more profoundly and more freely at the base of Monument Mountain than he would have done amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New World ; and , therefore , if true to his calling and position , he must have examined the truth for himself . " He derived from the style of religion in which he was brought up , says the same keen critic , in his elegant memoir , " one of its chief *Aessings-an impulse , as well as a liberty , to believe according to evidence , rather than according to prescription . " This great and profound investigator alarmed reasoners of less boldness by exploring in the most daring style the deepest and most difficult questions . This unhesitating reformer , of whom James Mill and his son probably never heard , published books of more subtle and penetrating discrimination than theirs , founded theology and reform alike upon the preference of the general good , * and denounced slavery in a great slave mart , before philanthropists had thought of the subject , and half a century before their day . This was Samuel Hopkins . How was he educated ? Whence came all this free and fearless vigor ? He entered Yale College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , according to Prof. Kingsley , " claimed the principal attention " of students , and skill in syllogistic disputation was the chief attainment aimed at by Yalensians . Burgersdicius , Ramus , Crackenthorp , and Keckermann furnished the text-books . Freshmen began logic in the last month of the first Mrs. Stowe 's inartistic anachronism in respect to his giving up the attractive object of a strong attachment from disinterested benevolence , is still true to the life . The incident is told in Park 's Memoir , p. 55. // college year . " Logic was the sole study of the first four days of the week during the second year . All resident bachelors were required to dispute syllogistically once a week , and all undergraduates , after they began to read logic , five times a week . Fridays were devoted in all the classes to ethics , rhetoric , and the theology of Wollebius . Ames 's Medulla was recited on Saturday mornings , and on Saturday evenings the Assembly 's ' Catechism in Latin . " President Woolsey says that an effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is " to repress originality of thinking , to destroy individual peculiarities , and to produce a general sameness among those who are educated . " Most manifestly Hopkins 's education produced no such effects on him ! It led him , says Dr. Park , " not so much into various learning , as into deep thinking . It sharpened his reasoning powers . It cultivated his taste for the abstract sciences . " It did not leave him such a slave to Ames or Wollebius , as Stuart Mill was to James Mill . It enabled him to show " that theology is something better than a superstitious faith . " In an age often ignorantly stigmatized nowadays as one of servitude to great names , it made of this powerful and intrepid logician a master and prince in one of the freest movements of mind philosophical history can show . He does not even quote Edwards , his great instructor , as Mill quotes his father . It prompted him to say : " It is very weak and ridiculous , if not something worse , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by appealing to the judgment of any man . " Did Stuart Mill ever advance so far as this in becoming an atheist ? or , had he done so when he wrote his Autobiography even ? One of the other two was the younger Jonathan Edwards . We know little , to be sure , of his father 's method of teaching . It hardly needs to be said that the elder Edwards was immeasurably superior in power and depth of thought to the elder Mill ; the second volume of Ueberweg 's " History of Philosophy " is authority for the statement that " he was familiar with the course of speculation in the mother country , reading the writers of all schools with equal ardor ; " but he was more an author than a teacher , even in the case of his own children . His biographer says that he " took much pains to come at the books of the most noted writers who advanced a scheme of divinity most contrary to his own principles ; " " he called no man Father . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an original . " That such a man would start his pupil , Hopkins , and his son , in a searching , exhaustive , self-reliant style of study ,  --  that he would beget in them a generous breadth and scope , exemption from dogmatism , individuality of intellectual life , was absolutely certain . The son excelled as a Latin , Greek , and Hebrew scholar ; made remarkable vernacular attainments in Indian dialects ; was chosen Professor of Languages and Logic at Princeton , but shone most in the philosophy of mind and kindred studies . He was conspicuous for logical and philosophical power **-is the characterization given in Ueberweg . He was , like Hopkins , without brilliancy , as Mill was , and a master of profound and patient investigation . Comparison in his case is singularly fair . Turning now , as before , to the testimony of those who knew best the results of his education-on the very point in question , one of these , a Professor at Union , says : " He obviously sought nothing but truth undisguised . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision and firmness , because they were deliberately formed after patient and thorough investigation . " It has been observed that " it was something mortifying , not to say provoking , to an opponent , in the writings of the Edwardses , that they would anticipate more objections than he ever dreamed of himself . " About the time Stuart Mill was born , a biographer , who knew Dr. Edwards well , wrote : " He was ever ready to follow where truth led , to detect the errors that might have insinuated themselves into his own reasoning , and to abandon the conclusion unless it could be supported by other and substantial arguments . " In " Patten 's Reminiscences " it was said of him  --  and this is not the only record to the same effect- " he was amiable in his temper , but prompt and self-opiniona/ed , " just the error which great freedom of thought engenders . Mr. Mill was opinionated , but not-touching religion , with his father 's stamp on him as he confesses itself-opinionated . Going back now to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps it can hardly be said that the course of study there was so rigorously logicalalthough the elder Edwards was then President of the College-as that which Hopkins received at New Haven tv* nty-four years before . He lived in his father 's family ; hnd so much is clear , that neither by his parental nor by his college training was the indepen // dence of his mind at all crippled . So far as the formation of opinions was concerned , his two years after graduation , before he became tutor at Princeton , were probably the most critical . He was then nine months a pupil of Hopkins , and three months a pupil of Bellamy . It illustrates the free and selfreliant character of both teacher and student , that Hopkins placed in his hands first a new manuscript treatise of President Edwards , then deceased , the doctrine of which the son had already controverted . He had never seen this manuscript , however , but at once made vigorous and searching objection to its contents . Dr. Hopkins explained , defended , and strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned to the assault next day , but found " that the subject required a deeper investigation . " Dr. Patten says . " Under a conviction of conscience " -I do not know but the Mills would pronounce this an interference with intellectual operations , but it was purely from within , and conscience is itself partly intellectual-he changed his opinion , " and made rapid proficiency in that belief in doctrines for which he could give a reason . " And of this result , certainly , even the Mills could not complain . In gaining a new opinion , moreover , he did not lose individuality and independence ; for years after , in a letter to Hopkins , criticising freely his new " Body of Divinity , " he takes occasion to say on one point : " I do not believe what President Edwards has written on this subject in his " treatise on Religious Affections ' " Dr. Hopkins once applied to him an Indian preacher 's phrase , " Me made him , " I. e. , not made his opinions for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing and in changing them . Of Dr. Bellamy 's logical and theological methods we have more continuous and sufficient information . He gave his students lists of questions , and questions demanding spontaneous , unhindered thought , covering all the deep subjects and hard points in religion ; he made them acquainted with the ablest treatises on these , of whatever shade of opinion ; " he then spent his evenings in examining them as to their views , " after they had formed them for themselves , " solving the difficulties they had found , suggesting and solving others ,  --  closing by giving his opinion and the reasons for it , and then leaving each student to digest and write out his own impressions of the entire subject . The dissertations thus prepared he examined , pointed out what arguments were insufficient and what satisfactory , stated the objections of opposers , and suggested the answers that would be conclusive against them . He also directed them to read the writings of the most learned and acute opposers of the truth , on the various points of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions and reasonings . " It will not be pretended that even on political economy Stuart Mill 's training was as all-sided and perfectly fair as this . What would-at least , what m*ght-such a training have done for him in religion ! There remains another great student and debater , the third of these athletes , whose Christian education , in regard to mental freedom , is to be compared with that of the English Autobiographer . He was born in the same year with the second , being five weeks his senior . He graduated at Yale two years after Edwards graduated at Princeton . The New Haven curriculum was then much the same as when Hopkins came forth from it twenty-six years before . Logic retained its prohilnence , running through the freshman and sophomore years . The seniors studied ethics , metaphysics , and divinity . The President lectured on Civil Government , the British Constitution-for Connecticut was still a colony- " the various kinds of courts , the several forms of ecclesiastical government , " etc. , " upon every subject necessary to qualify young gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not impair the rugged , stalwart , and irrepressible independence of Samuel Hopkins-though he became a natural theologian , a Christian , and a teacher of Christianity-impaired that of his younger fellow-alumnus , with all the acuteness and salient idiosyncrasies of the latter , as Stuart Mill 's paternal tutelage impaired his , is not to be assumed at all . This young Yalensian also became a great Christian teacher ; but the name of Nathaniel Emmons is a synonym for penetrating , tireless , and stubborn free-thinking . He was ever just what Berkeley called himself when he assailed Anthony Collins , " a free-thinking anti-freethinker . " Let us see what manner of man he came to be . He was widely renowned for sharp , novel , unique ideas . Though he disclaimed originality , he left behind him a reputation for insight , for understanding more of the most baffling subjects , and understanding them better than other men , which is hardly to be distinguished from it . No thinker this side the sea ever had ways of looking at truth more utterly and peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of truth are these : " Never try to avoid difficulties in theology , but seek for them . " " Read a few of the best authors on each side . " " Habituate yourself to examine the evidence of everything you believe , without trusting to education , former opinion , or the assertion of others . " " Follow not too strictly the path of any particular divine or divines , for by following them you will never overtake them ; but endeavor , if possible , to find out some new , nearer , and easier way by which you may get before them , and really add some pittance to the common stock of theological knowledge . " - Dr . Park 's Memoir . After he had long been a teacher of theologians himself he recommended a list of books for reading to another teacher , which , he observed , contained " heterodox as well as orthodox writers on each question . " That was after his own method of reading and of instructing , and he taught more than forty years at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical faculty in one person to more than a hundred preachers . At the age of twenty-four , when examined for a license to preach , his spurning of all constraint and leadership was so pronounced and prominent that some good men protested against approving him . It was still more so sixty years and more later , when he surrendered public duties . He investigated in that long ahd busy interval a great variety of subjects . " Few men in his profession ever read more books , " and he studied more than he read , i. e. , gave more time to it . For sixtyfive years , utterly neglecting all ordinary occupations , he sat with book or pen in hand . His practice was " to pursue a subject until completely satisfied he had found the truth . " It was a saying of his that he learned most by wrestling with difficulties which others had neglected or failed to throw light upon , and that of all the authors he consulted those who wrote most forciblj against his own sentiments helped him most . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said against Christianity by its most successful assailants than from what was advanced for it by all its friends . One of his autobiographical statements is : " I have made it my practice to read extensively , and to examine as critically and impartially as I could all ancient and modern errors and innovations in relig ion , which I have never seen any reason to repent . " The production from which this is taken abounds in brave and strong things like this . It is as unique as Stuart Mill's* far less dreary , and full of higher evidences of fearless thought . If it were not a Christian autobiography it would be read more than his , perhaps . Dr. Smalley , to whom Emmons went as a pupil after graduating , used to ray rf young ministers : " If they would ever do anything in the world , they must learn to walk alone . " No American ever learned to do that more positively than Nathaniel Emmons . He went to Smalley an Old Calvinist ; he came away a New Divinity man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and passion for original thought . To teach him , as Emmons himself said , to throw away his crutches . In his long life of theological controversy afterward the disputants he wrestled with were always the strongest and most expert among public men . He held , as did those I have named before , that great discoveries and improvements are to be expected on all subjects of human inquiry , especially religion , and that every generation should advance beyond all that have gone before ; and he held his mind free at every point , every hour , to contribute to that advance . Eager for truth on all subjects , and intensely active in exploring in every direction for it , he foreclosed against it in no one field as Stuart Mill did in religion . That would have been an unintellectual denial of the birthright of freedom , of which his education made him so conscious . Looking at these three bright outstanding examples together , we see in all the common law-digest impartially and completely all hostile opinions . They did this more thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evidence that Mill , in all his multitudinous and multifarious youthful reading , ever looked into a work on religious opinions , theological or other , or into any religious book , save McCrie 's " Life of John Knox , " two now unknown histories of the Quakers , Mosheim 's " Ecclesiastical History , " and Thomson 's " Seasons . " Of the world 's teachers on these topics , the great masters and the lesser lights alike , he was , when he formed his opinions , utterly ignorant . He confesses that he infused a " sectarian spirit " into the singular psychology derived from his father ; and , without confession , it is clear that the parental atheism  --  or anti-theism-received // the same virus when it was fastened upon him . But in all the battles of thought , touching metaphysics , theology , or religion , that raged about the three whose education has been compared with his , where shall be found the traces of such a spirit ? Because of the injustice and suffering Divinity tolerated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly investigated and prbfoundly felt these evils , without allowing them to tyrannize over reason , or extinguish the light of God 's existence and unconstraining rule over free beings , or blind their vision to it . He was " imagina/ively very susceptible , " he thinks , to " high enthusiasm for ideal nobleness " - whatever such a susceptibility may be , but never mentions the character of Christ , as though spell-bound here against such an enthusiasm by some preventing cause . No farther does he ever go in the direction of God than to commend in unbelievers some " ideal conception of a Perfect Being , " far higher , in his judgment , than the real God , perfect in every quality , whom religious men worship and obey And save in that controversial menti&amp;n of the mere conception , this ideal never appears in any disclosure he makes of his own mind , character , or life . At one period his progress " consisted " - he is frank enough to confess- " in rediscovering things known to all the world which I had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these were practical working truths , for which he had a singular inaptitude , innate , inherited , or educatedhis own philosophy would perhaps require him to say educated ;  --  but he never so far recovered from early atheistic enslavement of thought , feeling , and purpose , as to be at liberty to rediscover the working truths of Natural and Revealed Religion . While those with whom he has here been contrasted held to utter and thorough-going mental freedom as the basis of responsibility for human opinion and action , no glimmer of this breaks upon the darkness and bondage of Mill 's mind . He never escaped intellectually from the meshes of Necessitarianism . So he declares himself , p. x o8 . Is there any advantage in such a culture as his over its opposite on the score of freedom ? Are not the results immeasurably less and less desirable in his case than in the others here sketched ? Putting the quantity of truth severally attained out of the account entirely , and looking at the single point of exemption from constraint and restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of liberty ,  --  what must a fair judgment decide ? It . may be said , to break the force of the facts , that the three men , whose training has been set over against his , were exceptionally great men . The objection lacks force and pertinency . This is not a question of power , but of liberty alone . Perhaps , too , any one who would raise this objection in Mill 's behalf would insist that Mill was exceptionally great also . Any way , there was nothing in greatness to give either the advantage in respect to something entirely differentliberty . And certainly , a mind not great enough-if there be any meaning in what we now say  --  to acquire independence under one kind of training , would not , so far as that goes , acquire it under another . This leaves the facts to stand in their own unaffected strength . Mr. Mill 's " Three Essays on Religion " supply certain illustrations of what is here maintained , which were not available when what is above written was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to trace the servitude of one mind to another much beyond the adoption of ready-made beliefs on specific subjects , as all know well who have searched in any direction the history of opinions . And if the topics , in respect to which one mind has imposed itself upon another , are many and diversified , even candid critics may seriously disagree as to the amount , at least , of intellectual domineering on the one side , and of slavishness on the other . In the present case the topics have a unity sufficient to prevent disagreement among reasonable men . A glance at the " Three Essays " will plainly enough disclose Stuart Mill taking both results and processes on religious topics from James Mill . In one of these papers the writer affirms the " tremendous power " of early education , probably quite unaware that the application to his own case is singularly easy and forcible . His special object in his reasoning here is to strip religion of its beneficial influence and transfer it to education ,  --  a very legitimate thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it is perfectly immaterial what is employed for the purpose , or what one is educated in . His proposition is that " early religious training has owed its power over mankind rather to its being early than to its being religious , " which , if it is true , only opens the way , and gives crushing force to the proposition that early irreligious training , like that his father // gave him , has an equally wondrous and " tremendous " power , due simply-aside from any natural bias  --  to its being early . Indeed , he admits this by instancing the case of Greece as " the only one in which any teaching other than religious has had the unspeakable advantage of forming the basis of education ; " adding that " though much can be said against the quality of some part of the teaching , very little can be said against its effectiveness . " We should say the same of his father 's in his own case , and that however his reasoning diminishes responsibility in either instance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After saying that nearly all who have been brought up by parents , or by any one interested in them , have been taught from their earliest years some kind of religious belief , and some precepts as the commands of the heavenly powers to them and to mankind , he adds that " any system of social duty divorced from religion " would have the same advantage and power . Was there ever a more perfect illustration than himself in the way in which he became-as he describes himself in the Autobiography-an example of " one who has not thrown off religious belief ; but never had it ? " He specifies in the Essay , moreover , as characteristic of early education , the control it obtains over the feelings ; and in the Autobiography he relates how his father , " in a degree once common , but now very unusual , threw his feelings into his opinions , " and how his " various opinions were seized on with youthful fanaticism by the little knot of young men of whom I ( the son ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , " he adds , alleging that his father was free from this-of which we can judge from his writings  --  a spirit not lacking certainly in his own eager and harsh prejudices against religion . That the feelings do not entwine " with anything like the same force ' ' round conclusions formed on personal investigation later in life , as about those instilled in childhood , is very true ; and the example is at hand in the Vehement , if not vituperative , terms he employs against the truths he was led by his father to deny , compared with the perfectly frigid coldness he preserves touching the probability and hope of a Divine origin and government of the world and a destiny for man after death , which were in some sort his own ripest conclusions . If it be suggested that to discuss for him such subjects at all-after the paternal incul cation that he had " no concern " with them - is some evidence of release from his first slavery of thought , it may be answered that it is rather evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a subject with which all have to do . Unquestionably it was the father 's sway prolonged that kept him from even looking in that direction when that crisis came in his mental history , at little more than twenty years of age , which is depicted with so little evidenc* of any true comprehension of it , in Chapter V. of the Autobiography , and when the great loss and sorrow of his life overtook him forty years after in the death of Mrs. Mill . " Early education , " he observes in the second Essay , " operates through men 's involuntary beliefs , feelings , and desires . " How inadequate an account this is , we can not stop to show ; but so far as it is true , nothing better exemplifies it than his own atheistic training . In general it is obvious that the " Essay on Theism " embodies , with additions , what his father did and did not " allow " him to accept concerning the origin of the world , and what flowed therefrom : the " Essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions of the character of God ; and the " Essay on the Utility of Religion , " his denials of the Divine government of men by influences such as Natural Religion and Christianity employ . It is in connection with the fundamental question of Theism , and their joint repudiation of all belief and all grounds of belief in the existence of God , that Stuart Mill acknowledges the iron hand that . shaped his " convictions and feelings respecting religion , " absolutely preventing all deviation . That repudiation by James Mill was on moral grounds , " more than intellectual , " grounds drawn from the course of the world under Divine government to prevent any discernment of the Divine existence . From one sort of nescience he concluded to another . The description answers equally well for Stuart Mill , save that he was never " educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism , " and was not led " by his own studies and reflections to reject not only Revelation , but the foundations of Natural Religion , " and set up as Atheist . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon as absurd ; " but " he yielded to the conviction that concerning the origin of things nothing can be known , " dogmatically assuming that all other minds have been and are as dark as his own . " He impressed upon me from the first that * * * // the question , Who made me ? ' can not be answered , because we have no experience or authentic information from which to answer it "  --  a principle that would sweep away the larger part of modern knowledge at a blow , including all " the speculative conclusions drawn by physical science . " For these are manifestly beyond either " experience or authentic information ! " But when this principle of nescience was enjoined upon the future author of " Nature , " " The Utility of Religion , " and " Theism , " the result of the last-named essay , nearly half a centur*y later , was simply a foregone conclusion . One of our finest American thinkers , not of any evangelical school-ex-President Hill , of Harvard-has recently said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that might well be bound up with Mill 's , that " we have a higher warrant for believing in God than for believing in any other truth whatever ; " which must obviously be so if ; though there are truths of which the whole world of matter is evidence , and others of which the whole world *f mind is evidence , this is the only one that is a truth of the Infinite , to which the whole universe-including both matter and mind-gives evidence . On the contrary , Mill asserts in his " General Result , " that " there is evidence , but insufficient for proof , and amounting to one of the lower degrees of probability . " That this is what he was obliged to say by a large advance of knowledge-and probably also of thought-beyond his father 's , and that he was kept from saying more than this for Theism , by the nescience saddled on his youthful mind , there can not be a doubt . The same thing appears in his brief preliminary treatment of the evidences as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair examination to both , " he at once pronounces the former unscientific , characterizing them as pursuing a method " which infers external objective facts from ideas or convictions of our own minds , " and denying that the principle on which even the latter rest-that of cause and effect-is " a truth of reason apprehended intuitively in its own light . " We should be led too far aside if we should say a word here of his life-long mistakes on these points , or of the destructive effect of these two positions upon all science itself ; of whatever character ; but it is enough to indicate that they are the direct result of his father 's dogma touching " experience " and " authentic information . " For adequate illustration of this , we should be obliged to draw largely on the " Analysis of the Human Mind " and the " System of Logic , " the family relation of which is as manifest as their authors ' . There can no more be an posteriori argument on that dogma than an i*priori one . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have just quoted , nor can it follow , as is asserted therein , that " the rational attitude of a thinking mind toward the supernatural is that of skepticism , as distinguished from belief on the one hand and atheism on the other ; including under atheism the negative as well as the positive form of disbelief in a God ( this is unbelief ; more accurately , as the Bible has it ) , viz. : not only the dogmatic denial of His existence , but the denial that there is any evidence on either side . " The latter may be as dogmatic as the former , but it is the legitimate progeny of nescience , and in this the son was the echo of his father , only perhaps more consistent . Turning briefly to details , the examination in " Theism " of the two arguments from c9nsciousness and from the general consent of mankind must be passed by as not covered by the confessions of the " Autobiography . " We confess , however , that the general family relationship of error on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tempting theme , but it would lead us into a discussion too elaborate and abstruse for this place . There remain the criticisms of the two other arguments-for a First Cause , and from Marks of Design in Nature . The essayist 's assertion that " causation can not be legitimately extended to the material universe itself ; kut only to its changeable phenomena ; " or , in other words , to mere events or changes  --  and his two silent assumptions that only known changes or events are such at all , and that the existence of apparently permanent objects never has been an event or change-are altogether in the line of what he had been taught . They simply beg the question . His distinction between existence and beginning of existence is introduced for this purpose . And our ignorance of the latter-in the case of elementary substances and their propertiesis taken for disproof of any cause of either ! It is quite unimportant whether either Mill believed in the eternity of matter in any of its forms ; the fact that " within the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the beginning in question is not a known beginning , is sufficient for the conclusion per sal/urn , " consequently no cause ! " That this whole argument about a beginning // of the world or of substance comes , of course , in place of positive knowledge where such knowledge is impossible , as in all reasoning ; that the question still remains : Are we warranted to believe in the beginning of the substances and properties we call matter , and so in their Cause ? is not noticed . The distinction between objects and events , existence and beginning of existence , is really unavailing to skepticism , for existence itself where it was not before is an event or a beginning ; and if one does not really believe in the eternity of matter , he must believe in its existence as such an event or beginning at some point in time . It was easy , after this kind of fallacy , to recognize the proximate causes of the changeable phenomena of the universe , and assert that there is no other of these or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen and hydrogen , has a cause , for it is known , but oxygen and hydrogen are not to be believed to have any-which is the very question ! Then the assertion that we have no experience of the creation of force by volition leads the way to elbowing a First Cause out of the universe , and putting Force and Matter in his place . Mind , however , has had a beginning if these have not ; but the mere theory of the unconscious production of mind by matter opens a ioophole of escape even here-notwithstanding " experience ' * and " authentic information ' * of so marvelous a " change ' * are fatally lacking . But what else could be expected of one who took the parental dictum " that the manner in which the world came into existence was a subject on which nothing was known " as equivalent to disproof of any belief that it came into existence at all ? The argument from design Mr. Mill is not quite able to meet with the paternal objection that we have no experience on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at first as to allow himself to allege that it " amounts only to the inferior kind of inductive evidence called analogy . " Clearly he had discovered no othei- distinction between 4analogy and induction than difference of degree ; but in this misfortune a great many writers on the side of Christianity since Butler keep him company . Looking , however , at the special character of " Marks of Design in Nature , " he admits that there is material for induction of a stronger quality , and a " large balance of probability in favor of creation by intelligence , " leaning strongly , nevertheless , toward the notion of evolution in the particular form of " survival of the fittest , " which was but in the gristle when he wrote . He deems this " in no way whatever inconsistent with creation , " though " it would greatly attenuate the evi&amp;'nce for it . " Dr. Hill observes that " logically the arguments from the external world " ( morphological and teleological ) " are unassailable , and the being of an intelligent God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustains the law of gravitation or the correlation of forces . " The American reasoner is as much Mr. Mill 's superior in free movement of thought as in the handling of scientific materials . Both take Socrates 's instance of the human eye . Dr. Hill says : " As we run over this complicated series of the adaptations to sight , the presumption that eyes were made for seeing becomes absolute certainty . The French encyclopedists answer No , they were not made at all-they grew . ' And the men of the present day undertake to tell us how they grew-how the sensitiveness to light diffused over the whole surface of the zobphyte , being a little more concentrated in spots upon some individuals , gave them an advantage in seeking prey or avoiding danger , and thus , by natural selection , favored those that tended ( / ) to have eyes and to multiply them ; and this process , after millions of repetitions , gradually formed the perfected human eye . If these dreamy speculations were as true as they seem to me false ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me absolutely baseless , thc*y would not confute the teleological argument . Such a process of developments could not take place by chance ; the result is such as to show that intelligence presided over every step , whatever the steps may have been , and howsoever numerous . " What intellectual glamour , or almost mechanical habit of thought , or superinduced feeling outrunning logic , was it that prevented Stuart Mill from seeing this likewise ? He remarks that " sight is connected with the production of the structure as final cause , " ( i. e. , end ) , through " an antecedent idea of it , " and " this at once marks the origin as proceeding from an intelligent will . " This is " what Induction can do for Theism . " Why did he shrink back from it ? Would he , could he have substituted for creative forethought accidental variation and the happening at last , through its advantages , of so " extraordinary a combination of structures and functions as are seen in the eye " - admitting that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for the // commencement of sensation , " thus snatching the problem out of the hands of Design and flinging it back again unsolved  --  but for the Lucretian " aversion to religion , " and the denial that a wise being is the Maker of the Universe under whose cold shade he grew up ? The leading purpose of the " Essay on Nature " is to show that if it discloses at all the attributes of God , they are such as man can derive no instruction from . It is no divine or even rational guide to him . The pall of nescience is stretched to cover the whole domain of Providence . Even the light that breaks from the processes and properties of Nature is not suffered to pierce it . Man is represented as set or setting himself to thwart , alter , and improve everything , without any hint as to how he is to learn to do it . That either Nature must teach him-including in that word his own nature  --  or the Author of Nature-in either of which cases Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed his thoughts . The discussion of the Divine Attributes is by no means confined to this paper . It occupies also some twentypages of that on Theism , and crops out continually in the paper on the Utility of Religion . One can not fail to see that the aroused feeling and indurated prejudice of both father and son concentrated specially on this topic . The former " found it impossible to believe that a world so full of evil was the work of an Author combining infinite power with perfect goodness and righteousness . " The latter spends all his strength in striving to oppose these qualities in our Maker to each other . He labors no point more than this ; sets none in more varied lights . He holds that the world allows us no choice whether to follow the constitution and order of things or not or else gives us a rule that is irrational and immoral . " The physical government of the world , " he protests , " being full of things which when done by men are deemed the greatest enormities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide our actions by the analogy of the course of nature . " This decision comes from the chair of the Utilitarian Philosophy , which , by both thinkers , is made the tribunal of supreme appeal . By this , God , as well as man , is judged . Curiously enough , in carrying out the argument from premises early supplied him , Stuart Mill objects , in the third essay , to the order of nature as casting any light on the character of a Creator who may cause good by means of evil , in a strain , which , if it does not collide with evolution , bars it out of this field of argument . At least , it forbids a Theist from being an evolutionist . " It may be said , " he observes , " that this capacity of improving himself and the world was given ( man ) by God , and that the change which he will thereby be enabled ultimately to effect in human existence will be worth purchasing by the sufferings and wasted lives of entire geological periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God could not have given him these blessings at a less frightful cost , is to make a very strange supposition concerning the Deity . It is to suppose that God could not , in the first instance , create anything better than a Bosjesman or an Andaman islander with the power of raising himself into a Newton or a Fen6lon . We certainly do not know the nature of the barriers which limit the Divine Omnipotence ( barriers he is very certain exist ) ; " but it is a very odd notion of them that they enable the Deity to confer on an almost bestial creature the power of producing by a succession of efforts what God himself had no other means of creating . " It is significant that after using evolution previously , in a stress of argument , against Theism , he shouki give it this furious backstroke , perhaps to prevent others from ever using it for Theism , as some now attempt to do . We invite them to consider together his denial that it is consistent with Omnipotence , and his assertion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if James Mill had lived in the days of Spencer , and Tyndall , , and Darwin , he would have eagerly borrowed from them and from other evolutionists any hints toward Atheism ; but we question whether that grim speculator would ever have performed a feat of logical vaulting so agile and adroit as this . But both reasoners seem logically color-blind in the same way in respect to the legitimate inferences from the evils of the world . The sophistry of drawing from indications of character a conclusion against the existence itself of the being whose character is indicated , both seem powerless to discover . And equally so the sophistry of inferring from experience of present evil anything , except it be liability of evil hereafter . Dr. Hill says : " As for arguing the divine malevolence from suffering , as readily as the divine benevolence from happiness , the assertion will not bear a moment 's examination ; " - suffering as a means of higher good is the logical inference on teleologic grounds . Neither Mill could be // expected to see this ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of justification for inferring , on grounds of Natural Theology alone , that benevolence is one of the attributes of the Creator , " adding that we have no warrant " to jump from this to the inference that his sole or chief purposes are those of benevolence , and that the single end and aim of Creation was the happiness of his creatures , "  --  a position quite consistent with all Christian theology , save those peculiar forms of it which try to base themselves on some phase of Utilitarianism Whatever the attributes of God are , and whatever the philosophy that underlies any one 's theology of His attributes ,  --  it has always been seen by Theists that the use of evil anywhere by a Creator and Governor opens the way to its employment for proper purposes anywhere else ; and both Mills have done something to help Theists to see this more clearly and strongly , though they can not see it themselves . Quite as unable are they to see that if mere benevolence or pleasure-giving is not the sole attribute of God here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes of Deity besides wisdom and goodness , Nature is as " perfect a blank " to the younger as to the elder . The latter wondered that the Sabiean or Manich*an doctrine of the everlasting struggle between the good and the evil-with denial to the good of aught that would constitute Godhad not been re-established ; and all the arguments of the former on Natural Religion favor this doctrine , though in the second essay he pronounces it too slightly founded to be a substitute for the new " Religion of Humanity . " In that-essay the virus of bitter feeling infused into one of these minds by the other , touching the government of God by influences , specially discloses itself . We do not quote again from the Autobiography the paternal caricature of the creed of Christianity on this point ( see the fifth paragraph of this article ) ,  --  or the assertions of its demoralizing influence in the very nature of things ,  --  or the denunciation of " an Omnipotent Author of Hell " as a " demon , " " a being eminently hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently written , the sympathy of the writer with the anger described , sufficiently account for all the reasonings in the essays against the influence of a future life with its issues , and the elaborate endeavor to work out a secular scheme of living for the general good as a quasi religion . All this consists with his ascribing the power of religious fear to disappointments in life , melancholy , and hypochondriacal disease . How it is logically consistent for utilitarians to reject a plan of Divine government in the interest of virtue addressed to the love of good and fear of evil in man , we will not inquire ; men have been deemed utilitarians for maintaining this ; there have been theologians who have argued therefrom the existence of infinite and perfect goodness ; but here are exemplary utilitarians  --  and one of them claiming to hold the better , the unselfish utilitarianism - who did reject it . It was certain if the one did so that the other would . The one regarded Christianity not as a " mere mental delusion , " but as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sweeping and daring assertions of its malign power when legitimately working , of its good results only when its believers and followers are inconsistent , made by the one , are reproduced by the other . " The power of education , " says the second essay , " is almost boundless ; there is - not one natural inclination which it is not strong enough to coerce , and , if needful , to destroy by disuse . " Whether these last words are true or not , there could hardly be found a clearer example of a coerced natural inclination than is betrayed in the author 's admission , very near the close of the same essay , of the advantage supernatural religion has over the " Religion of Humanity " in holding out to human hopes the prospect of a life after death , and of a reunion with those dear to us . The loss of this last element , he even confesses , " is in many cases beyond the reach of comparison or estimate , and will always suffice to keep alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , if there is nothing to prove , there is as little in our knowledge and experience to contradict . " This was written between 1850 and 1858 , before the death of his wife , and though it is hardly possible to consider his nature as specially sensitive , and though a hope of immortality has often been born , after such a domestic loss , in men and women who were distinctively lacking in this regard , there is not a trace of any such result in him . Writing in r86x , he says : " Her memory is to me a religion ; " her ideas were the rule of his life , her approbation " the standard of all worthiness . " But this because she " would have wished it so , " not from the least anticipation of reunion . And writing again ten years or more after her // death-between i868 and 1870-having lived every year near her grave at Avignon , because this enabled him to " feel her still near , " he pronounces the doctrine of immortality a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express revelation , in neither of which he believed ) ; he removes it from the region of belief entirely , as well as from that of knowledge , conceding only that hope is " legitimate and philosophically defensible " - provided it is clearly recognized that there is no ground for more , and that the grounds for this , even , are of the very lowest probability . In other words , immortality was with him mere matter of imagination , and thus of allowable aspiradon ; but even so , entirely without rewards or punishments , or anything better than natural improvability by our own efforts . He saw only " a total absence of evidence on either side , " which-as he declares of another religious truth- " for most practical purposes amounts to the same thing as if it had been disproved . " Could there possibly be a more dreary outcome from the parental dogmatism and his youthful tuition in it ? Mrs. Mill died when her husband had passed sixty ; at half that age his father died , whose " principal satisfaction , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the thought of what he had done to make the world better politically and philosophically , after his own views than he found it . " He had placed in the hands of his youthful son the volume disputing the temporal usefulness of religion , under the pseudonym of Philip Beauchamp , drawn from some manuscripts of Bentham , and itself then in manuscript , which gave him a life-long prejudice against the C-hristian doctrine of immortality , and is the basis of all the skepticism on the subject contained in these essays . We deem it a real service to the theology , to say nothing of the philosophy , of our times , and the days coming , that these remarkable essays have followed so remarkable an Autobiography ; and if they are instrumental in eradicating weak elements from each and both , their usefulness will be very marked . Their own weaknesses in psychology and logic will readily'appear on examination-hardly any recent production is more sure of a very searching one-and very various , doubtless , will be the methods of meeting their elaborate skepticism in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wont to use the permitted evils of the world as a foil and defense on certain theological points , will find a more radical , direct , and subtle assault on the power , skill , and love that rule the world in respect to these very evils , than they are accustomed to encounter . Students of philosophy will watch keenly to see how this fierce utilitarian denial of a supreme disposition in God to make His creatures happy will be met , especially by theological utilitarians , and those who hold that all virtue consists in this disposition . But it does not lie within the purpose of this paper to review the essays at large , or the metaphysical and religious convictions which they so sturdily assail , attractive as the subject is ,  --  but simply to show that their ideas and spirit are the necessary outcome of the bondage in which the author was trained . If some recasting of statement and of view is found necessary in some quarters , both sides the Atlantic , in order successfully to answer them , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm will result . If some light is thrown on the metes and bounds of mental freedom , and the infringement of these by the dogmatism of unbeliefoften unsuspected-great good will be done . ICE . ICE and frozen snow were known as luxuries as far back as history records , the latter being mostly in use in the East . The mode of gathering it in winter , and transporting it for use in summer , and the method of preserving it in those intensely hot climates , was truly primitive , and frequently involved great labor and cost . In many portions of Asia the snow was gathered in sacks , far up in the mountains , and trans ported to the principal cities on the backs of mules , there preserved in cisterns sunk in the earth , and packed carefully between layers of straw . This method still prevails in some sections . But up to the commencement of the present century , in those climates where the temperature never reaches the freezing point , ice was a luxury that few beyond the wealthiest could indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
