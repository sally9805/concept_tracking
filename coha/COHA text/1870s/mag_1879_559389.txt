A STATESMAN OF THE COLONIAL ERA . As the Greeks were reminded that brave men existed before Agamenmon , so it may be well for the present generation of Americans to reflect that our land produced great statesmen in the past , whose memory should be cherished . The populace , and especially in republics , has ever been attracted by the glitter of the soldier , the clang of whose martial shout deadens the footfall of the statesman , as the bray of the ass the song of the nightingale . Ignorant savages crowd in adoration about the loud , criarde colors of a sign-painting , while the masterpieces of Raphael or Correggio pass unnoticed . Napoleon wished to go down to posterity with the " Code " in his hand , but posterity forgets the great lawgiver , who made France , in despite of revolutions and calamities , the first of industrial and economic nations , and remembers Lodi and the Pyramids , Marengo and Austerlitz . Many , who have heard of Blenheim and Malplaquet , are ignorant of the fact that Marlborough was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his skill was required to keep the frugal Dutch , the greedy Germans , and the selfish Austrians true to the " grande alliance . " In popular estimation Washington is always crossing the Delaware or receiving the sword of Coruwallis . His lofty patriotism , his pure motives , his calm civic wisdom are measurably overlooked , though his capacity as a commander did not reach mediocrity , and was far below that of Greene , the only general produced by our Revolutionary struggle . The character and composition of our population strengthen this tendency . Many thousands of our citizens migrated from despotic governments , where they had dreamed of liberty as " monks of love . " Without capacity for discrimination , they have mistaken for heroes , soldiers whose only triumphs have been over their own countrymen ; for patriots , selfish place-hunters , and for statesmen , unscrupulous partisans . Vituperation has passed for eloquence , slan // der for truth , denunciation for argument , and the practice of using official station as a means to private fortune has been regarded as evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure as the home of national liberty , as the asylum of the nations ; if the Federal authority is to be a beneficent agent for all and a tyranny for none , leaving the right of self-government to the people in their several communities , wo must recur to the principles and methods of the founders of the republic , study their characters and acts , and emulate their examples . Among the wise and good who in the past century secured the independence of our country and founded its government , GEORGE MASON , of Virginia , holds a place second to none . Of all pursuits in which men engage , agriculture best promotes sound minds in healthy bodies , when she is a kindly handmaid , not an exacting taskmistress . The yeoman , compelled to follow his plow-tail from dawn till dark , has little time for thought , less for study , and usually falls into that bovine condition characteristic of his class ; but the proprietor who superintends his estate , and whose capital absolves him from the necessity of constant labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with mother earth is as refreshing as was that of the classic giant . To such proprietors England and America are deeply indebted . They conceived and brought forth the true spirit of liberty , liberty of thought , of speech , of action ; whose limitation was at the point where its exercise intrenched upon the rights of others . Equally opposed to the tyranny of monarchs and majorities , they asserted the rights of individuals , and , controlled by dignity and self-respect , accorded to the persons and opinions of others the same courteous consideration which they claimed for their own . To this class in England belonged Eliot , Vane , Hampden , and , in America , George Mason . His ancestor , of the same name , came to Virginia in 1651- ' 52 . A Staffordshire gentleman of fair estate , he sat in the House of Commons in the reign of the first Charles , whose arbitrary measures he steadily opposed , but , like Clarendon , Falkland , and many others , joined the royal army at the outbreak of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal cause went down at Worcesterthe " crowning mercy " of Cromwell-when he escaped the country and established himself in Virginia . A younger brother-William - accompanied him . This William settled at Norfolk , Virginia , where he married and died , leaving a son who removed to Boston , Massachusetts . It is pleasant to think of the formal but kindly // fJIE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . intercourse that was doubtless kept up between the Virginia and Massachusetts cousins after their separation . Codfish , chow-chow , and chutney-for Salem and Boston were early traders to the East Indies-were exchanged as tokens of kinship for hams and tobacco , and with all the stately phraseology marking the friendship between the houses of Waverley and Bradwardine . Now , " nous avons ckang* tout cela , " and it requires some effort of the imagination to recall a time when there was sympathy between Virginia and Massachusetts . A great-grandson of the royalist colonel , and of the same name , married in 1726 Miss Anne Thomson , a relative of Sir William Temple , the wise and virtuous minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between England , Holland , and Sweden , to curb the ambition of the fourteenth Louis ; George Mason , the subject of this memoir , was the first child of the marriage , and was born near the close of 1726 , at Doeg 's Neck , in Stafford ( now Fairfax ) County , Virginia . His childhood and youth were passed on the paternal estate , amid the wholesome and cheery influences of the country life of the period , when horse and hound , rod and gun filled a large place in the daily life of the Virginia gentry . The practice of sending youths of birth and expectations kome , across sea , to be educated , was not followed in his case , but he was most carefully instructed at home , imbibing a taste for books and habits of study which he retained throughout life . Especially was he versed in English history , from Magna Charta to Somers 's " Declaration , " adopted by the convention calling William and Mary to the throne , and the struggles and methods by which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In the experience of our English fathers assaults upon liberty were to be apprehended from executive power , and hence they sought to protect it by limitations of the authority of the Crown ; but Mason distrusted the nature of all power , its greed and tendency to encroachment , and in the Constitution of Virginia-largely his work , and the first written constitution of a free commonwealth in history-adopted on the 29th of June , 1776 , he restrained legislative and judicial as well as executive powers . He succeeded to the family estate of Doeg 's Neck at the death of his father , who was drowned by the accidental upsetting of his sail-boat in the Potomac . Subsequently , he married Miss Ann Eilbeck , of Charles County , // Maryland , and built a new mansion on his property , which he called Gunston Hall , in honor of the seat of his maternal ancestry in England . The estate consisted of seven thousand acres , and lies on the Potomac next below Mount Vernon . With his neighbor and devoted friend , . Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . Absorbed by the care of an increasing family and a great estate , Mason was averse to a public career , but no man in the colonies more closely watched the current of events , or held more decided opinions as to the rights of the people and the duty of asserting them . In 1766 the merchants of London addressed a public letter to the planters of Virginia , to which Mason , in the London " Public Ledger , " replied , defending the position maintained by the colonists , and concluding with- " These are the sentiments of a man who spends most of his time in retirement , and has seldom meddled in public affairs ; who enjoys a moderate but independent fortune , and , content with the blessings of a private station , equally disregards the smiles and frowns of the great . " When Parliament subsequently asserted the right to tax the colonies " in all cases *wkatsoever , " Mason wrote a tract entitled " Extracts from the Virginia Charters , with some Remarks upon them . " From this many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn . In a letter to a friend in England , dated 1770 , he writes : " We will not submit to have our money taken out of our pockets without our consent or that of our representatives ; because , if any man , or any set of men , without such consent , take from us one shilling in the pound , we have no security for the remaining nineteen . " In 1769 he prepared the non-importation resolutions which were offered by Washington in the Virginia Assembly , and unanimously adopted . Among these resolutions was one not to import or purchase any imported slaves after the 1st day of November ensuing . It may be said that Mason was the only leading man of the time to foresee the difficulties and dangers of the slave question . At a meeting of the people of Fairfax , held on the 18th of July , 1774 , and presided over by V'fashington , Mason made his first public appearance on the theatre of the Revolution , by presenting a series of twenty-four resolutions , which embraced a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground of controversy with the Crown was reviewed , a Congress of the colonies recommended , and the policy of non-intercourse with the mothercountry urged . These resolutions , conspicuous in our annals , were // transmitted to the first Virginia Convention which met at Williamsburg in the following August . They were sanctioned by that body , and substantially adopted by the first general Congress on the 20th of October of the same year . Mason first appeared in the public councils as deputy from the county of Fairfax to the Virginia Convention in 1775 , when he was elected a member of the Committee of Safety , and , at an early period of the session , pressed by Peyton Randolph , Pendleton , Jefferson , and others to accept a seat in Congress . This last he declined . The recent death of his beloved wife , leaving to his care nine children , made him unwilling to go abroad . To one of Mason 's warm affections and domestic habits this bereavement was especially heavy . In a letter to a friend , written four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Convention of 1775 adjourned on the 29th of August , leaving the administration of the government in the hands of the Committee of Safety . It reassembled on the 6th of May , 1776 , but Mason , detained by an attack of gout , did not take his seat until the 18th . The resolution instructing the delegates of Virginia in Congress to propose independence had been adopted three days before , when the committee to prepare a declaration of rights and a plan of government was appointed . He was immediately placed on this committee , as well as on three others , Propositions and Grievances , Privileges and Elections , and for the encouragement of the manufacture of salt , saltpetre , and gunpowder . That a private gentleman of a retiring disposition should , on his appearance in council , have been charged with such responsibilities , is proof of his reputation , and of the general confidence reposed in his judgment and patriotism . The Declaration of Rights was reported by the committee to the Convention on the 27th of May , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous vote . This great instrument , the first of its kind , the work of a scholar , statesman , and patriot , in which may be found the history of English and American liberty , is here given : DECLARATION OF RIGHTS . DRAWN BY GEORGE MASON . A DECLARATION of rights made by the representatives of the good people of Yirginia , assembled in full and free convention ; which rights do pertain to them and their posterity , as the basis and foundation of government , unanimously adopted by the Convention of Virginia , June 12 , 1776 : 1 . That all men are created equally free and independent , and have cer // tam inherent natural rights of which they can not , by any compact , deprive or divest their posterity ; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty , with the means of acquiring and possessing property , and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety . 2 . That all power is by God and nature vested in and consequently derived from the people ; that magistrates are their trustees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . That government is , or ought to be , instituted for the comrn6n benefit , protection , and security of the people , nation , or community . Of all the various modes and forms of government , that is best which is capable ot producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety , and is most effectually secured against the danger of administration ; and that whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes , a majority of the community bath an indubitable , unalienable , indefeasible right to reform , alter , or abolish it , in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal . 4 . That no man , or set of men , are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community , but in consideration of public services ; which , not being descendible , neither ought the offices of magistrate , legislator , or judge to be hereditary . 5 . That the legislative and executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judicial ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from oppression , by feeling and participating the burthens of the people , they should , at fixed periods , be reduced to a private station , and return unto that body from which they were originally taken , and vacancies be supplied by frequent , certain , and regular elections . 6 . That elections of members , to serve as representatives of the people in the Legislature , ought to be free , and that all men having sufficient evidence of permanent , common interest with and attachment to the community , have the right of suffrage ; and can not be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent , or that of their representatives so elected , nor bound by any law to which they have not , in like manner , assented for the common good . 7 . That all power of suspending laws , or the execution of laws , by any authority , without consent of the representatives of the people , is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised . 8 . That in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demand the cause and nature of his accusation , to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses , to call for evidence in his favor , and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage ; without unanimous consent he can not be found guilty , nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself ; and that no man be deprived of his liberty , except by the law of the land , or the judgment of his peers . 9 . That excessive bail ought not to be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted . 10 . That in controversies respecting property , and in suits between man // and man , the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other , and ought to be held sacred . 11 . That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty , and can never be restrained but by despotic governments . 12 . That a well-regulated militia , composed of the body of the people trained to arms , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ; that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided , as dangerous to liberty ; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power . 13 . That no free government or the blessing of liberty can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice , moderation , temperance , frugality , and virtue , and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles . 14 . That religion , or the duty which we owe to our Creator , and the manner of discharging it , can be directed only by reason and conviction , not by force or violence ; and , therefore , that it is the mutual duty of all men to practice Christian forbearance , love , and charity , toward each other . This is from the manuscript written by Mason , to which he added , " This Declaration of Rights was the first in America , " and herein are to be found all the principles of the subsequent " Declaration of Independence " and the declaratory enactments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which free government rests are more perspicuously and forcibly stated by Mason than by his followers and copyists . In a letter to a friend , written more than two years after , an allusion is made to the " Declaration , " and , as it exhibits Mason 's opinions at a critical period , as well as his style , the letter is here given : YnuuKIA , Gu*sToN HALL , October 2 , 1TT5 . M* DEAR Sin : It gave me great pleasure , upon receipt of your favor of the 23d of April ( by Mr. Digges ) , to hear that you are alive and well , in a country where you can spend your time agreeably ; not having heard a word from you or of you for two years before . I am much obliged by the friendly concern you take in my domestic affairs , and your kind inquiry after my family ; great alterations have happened in it . About four years ago I had the misfortune to lose my wife : to you who knew her , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to describe my feelings . I was scarce able to bear the first shock ; a depression of spirits , a settled melancholy followed , from which I never expect or desire to recover . I determined to spend the remainder of my days in privacy and retirement with my children , from whose society alone I could expect comfort . Some of them are now grown up to men and women ; and I have the satisfaction to see them free from vices , good-natured , obliging , and dutiful ; they all still live with me and remain single , except my second daughter , who is lately married to my neighbor 's son . My eldest daughter ( who is blessed with her // mother 's amiable disposition ) is mistress of my family , and manages my little domestic matters with a degree of prudence far above her years . My eldest son engaged early in the American cause , and was chosen ensign of the first independent company formed in Virginia , or indeed on the continent ; it was commanded by the present General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the year 1775 he was appointed a captain of foot in one of the first minute regiments raised here ; but was soon obliged to quit the service by a violent rheumatic disorder , which has followed him ever since , and , I believe , will force him to try the climate of France or Italy . My other sons have not yet finished their education ; as soon as they do , if the war continues , they seem strongly inclined to take an active part . In the summer of 1775 I was , much against my inclination , dragged out of my retirement , by the people of my county , and sent as a delegate to the General Convention at Richmond , where I was appointed a member of the first Committee of Safety ; and have since , at different times , been chosen a member of the Privy Council and of the American Congress ; but have constantly declined acting in any other public character than that of an independent representative of the people , in the House of Delegates , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my country more service there than in any other department , and havc ever since devoted most of my time to public business , to the no small neglect and injury of my private fortune ; but if I can only live to see the American Union firmly fixed , and free governments well established in our Western world , and can leave to my children but a crust of bread and liberty , I shall die satisfied , and say , with the pvaimist , " Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace . " To show you that I have not been an idle spectator of this great contest , and to amuse you with the sentiments of an old friend upon an important subject , I inclose you a copy of the first draught of the Declaration of Rights , just as it was drawn and presented by me to the Virginia Convention , where it received few alterations , some of them I think not for the better : this was the first thing of the kind upon the continent , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid our new government upon a broad foundation , and have endeavored to provide the most effectual securities for the essential rights of human nature , both in civil and religious liberty ; the people become overy day more and more attached to it ; and I trust that neither the power of Great Britain nor the power of hell will be able to prevail against it . . . . To talk of replacing us in the situation of 1763 , as we first asked , is to the last degree absurd and impossible : they obstinately refused it while it was in their power , and now that it is out of their power they offer it . Can they raise our cities out of their ashes ? Can they replace , in ease and affluence , the thousands of families whom they have ruined ? Can they restore the husband to the widow , the child to the parent , or the father to the orphan ? In a word , can they reanimate the dead ? . . . The die is cast , the Rubicon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of returning to her government , is impossible . . . . As long as we had any well-founded hopes of reconciliation , I opposed , to the utmost of my power , // all violent measures , and such as might shut the door to it ; but when ree** onciliation became a lost hope , when unconditional submission or effectual resistance were the only alternatives left us , when the last dutiful and humble petition from Congress received no other answer than declaring us rebels and out of the King 's protection , 1 , from that moment , looked forward to a revolution and independence as the only means of salvation ; and will risk the last penny of my fortune and the last drop of my blood upon the issue . . . God his been pleased to bless our endeavors in a just cause with remarkable success . To us upon the spot , who have seen step by step the progress of this great contest , who know the defenseless state of America in the beginning , and the numberless difficulties we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is passed , we seem to have been treading upon enchanted ground . The case is now altered . American prospects brighten and appearances are strongly in our favor . The British ministry must and will acknowledge us independent States . The well-balanced intellect , the noble independence of character , the unselfish patriotism of the man stand forth in every sentence of this letter . Indeed , all the opinions of George Mason , written or spoken , deserve attention . A collection of his writings and speeches would be an admirable text-book , wherein the student could find the true meaning of civil and religious liberty , the duty of a citizen in a free state , and the proper limitations of government . After the adoption of the Constitution , Mason was appointed chairman of the committee to draft the oaths to be taken by the Governor and Council , and was subsequently made a member of the committee to revise the laws . It is remarkable that a man without professional training should have been placed at the head of committees , consisting of the ablest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . The last duty assigned him by the Convention of 1776 was to assist in the preparation of a seal for the new Commonwealth , and the present seal of Virginia , with the " Sic semper tyrctnnis , " was recommended and adopted . At this time Mason was fifty years of age , his dark hair sprinkled with gray , but retaining all the fire of youth in his bright eyes . Nearly six feet in height , his frame was massive , yet , despite of his hereditary gout , his step was elastic and free . His love of fieldsports preserved the activity of his limbs , and exposure to the open air had deepened his swarthy complexion . His contemporaries seem to have been much impressed by his dignified bearing . This description of his personal appearance is confirmed by his portrait , which was preserved at Clermont , Fairfax County , Virginia , resi // deuce of the widow of General John Mason , fourth and last surviving son of George . In the first Virginia Assembly under the new Constitution Mason 's talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conspicuously displayed in many warm discussions . Assisted by Jefferson he brought forward , and carried through , measures for the repeal of all the old disabling acts , and for legalizing all modes of worship , releasing dissenters from parish rates . Madison declared him the ablest man in debate that he had ever heard ; and Jefferson , near the close of his life , wrote : " I had many occasional and strenuous coadjutors in debate ; and one most steadfast , able and zealous , who was himself a host . This was George Mason , a man of the first order of wisdom among those who acted on the theatre of the Revolution , of expansive mind , profound judgment , cogent in argument , learned in the lore of our former Constitution , and earnest for the republican change on democratic principles . His elocution was neither flowing nor smooth ; but his language was strong , his manner most impressive , and strengthened by a dash of biting cynicism , when provocation made it seasonable . " In 1777 Mason was elected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence and consultation about public affairs with leading men , but took no conspicuous part until 1787 , when he was chosen a member of the Federal Convention to frame the Constitution of the United States . Devoted to his home and children , he preferred privacy , and a sense of duty alone could induce him to accept public station . He took the lead in the debates on the formation of the Constitution , and always on the liberal and democratic side . When the question was discussed whether the House of Representatives should be elected directly by the people , he maintained that no republican government could stand without popular confidence , and that confidence could only be secured by giving to the people the election of one branch of the Legislature . He also favored the election of the President directly by the people and for one term , with ineligibility afterward , but opposed the project to give the Federal Legislature a veto on all State laws . He denounced the proposition to make slaves equal to freemen as a basis for representation , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy he spoke against the clause in the Constitution which prohibited the abolition of the slave trade until 1808 , declaring slavery to 1e a source of national weakness and demoralization , and that it was essential for the Ceneral Covern // ment to have the power to prevent its increase ; this by a Virginia planter , himself a large owner of slaves . The Convention defeated some of Mason 's efforts to render the Constitution more democratic ; and , an enemy to all implied and constructire powers , he was especially dissatisfied with the extended and indefinite authority conferred on Congress and the executive , declining for these reasons to sign it . On his return to Virginia he was chosen a member of the Convention called to ratify or reject the Federal Constitution , where he led the opposition to ratification , unless subjected to amendments . Those proposed by him were a Bill of Rights and some twenty alterations in the body of the instrument . Several of these amendments were subsequently adopted by Congress and the States . In this debate Mason , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther Martin in that of Maryland , clearly pointed out the danger of implied and constructive powers , and foretold the evils that would come . He was elected the first United States Senator from Virginia under the Constitution , but declined the position and retired to Gunston Hall , where he passed the three remaining years of his life with his children and books , preserving his fondness for field-sports to the last . He died in the autumn of 1792 , and was buried at Gunston Hall . A plain marble slab , inscribed with his name , date of birth and death , marks the spot ; but , with those of other illustrious Virginians , his statue stands at the base of Crawford 's statue of Washington in front of the Capitol at Richmond . The following extract from his last will and testament is characteristic " I recommend it to my sons , from my own experience in life , to prefer the happiness of independence and a private station to the troubles and vexations of public business ; but if either their own inclinations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , I charge them , on a father 's blessing , never to let the motives of private interest or ambition induce them to betray , nor the terrors of poverty and disgrace , or the fear of danger or of death , deter them from asserting the liberty of their country , and endeavoring to transmit to their posterity those sacred rights to which themselves were born . " But the limits of a " Review article " are too restricted to give more than a sketch of Mason 's public career . To be appreciated by the political student , who desires to understand the principles of free government and the formative history of the Federal Constitution , his work must be sought in the // journals of Congress , in the Declaration of Rights , Constitution and revised Code of Virginia , and in the debates of the Federal and Virguiia Conventions , as must his affectionate nature in such letters to children and friends as have been preserved ; and it may be safely asserted that no one can carefully exhaust these sources without doubting whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to George Mason in all the elements of greatness . " Bon sang ne peut. mentir , " says the old French proverb , and the stock planted in Virginia by the ex-colonel of royal horse proves its truth . George Mason declined the position of Senator . His nephew , Stephen Thomson Mason , was a Senator from Virginia in 1794-1803 . Another nephew , John Thomson Mason , was offered the position of Attorney-General of the United States by Jefferson , and again by Madison , but declined . A grand-nephew , Armistead Thomson Mason , was elected a Senator from Virginia in 1815 , but fell in a duel with his cousin , John Mason McCarty , at the age of thirty-two . A grandson , Richard B. Mason , colonel and brevetbrigadier in the United States Army , was the first civil and military Governor of California . Another grandson , James Murray Mason , was sent to the Senate by Virginia in 1837 , and remained a member until the ciyil war , when he went as Confederate commissioner to England . Descended , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Virginia , who was Secretary of the Navy under Tyler , held the same office , as well as that of Attorney-General , under Polk , and died in Paris , whither he had been sent by Pierce as United States Minister . Few families have furnished as many distinguished men to the service of the republic . On the soil of Virginia rests the tomb of George Mason , within sound of the Capitol of the Union which he labored to establish , while pointing out , and in vain endeavoring to strengthen , the weak places in its foundation . A Virginian to the core , his sympathies extended to the uttermost limits of the colonies , and were as deeply stirred by the sufferings of Massachusetts as were those of her own great patriots , the Adamses , Warren , Hancock . Mayhap there lurks some germ of truth in the weird superstition that disembodied spirits keep watch and ward over the resting-places of their mortal remains . What changes has the spirit of Mason witnessed since his body was returned to earth ! As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfillment of his own predictions . He strove for a Union of consent and love . He has seen one of force and hate . He urged independent States to // create a common servant , the Federal Government , as a useful agent . He has seen the creature they called into being rend , like Frankenstein , its creators , disperse their assemblies at the point of the bayonet , deprive their citizens of every legal right . This he was prepared for ; this he foretold . While his mind was pregnant of the Union , like the Queen of Ilium , he dreamed of firebrands , knowing the greed of all power and the necessity for its limitation . But even he must be startled as he listens to the sentiments of the representatives of New England uttered in the halls of Congress ; and more , as he hears those of the representatives of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , whose States were formed from territory so generously donated to the Union by Virginia . With a sadness surpassing that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South destroyed by unlettered multitudes from the interior of the continent , directed by the fanaticism of the East . But time is as naught to immortal spirits , and he may witness a similar fate overtake the East , either through the physical force of these same multitudes , or through wild schemes of currency and finance , derived from the savage tribes which they have so recently displaced . The r51e of Cassandra is not a pleasant one , but any calamity may be predicted of a land wherein millions of people have forgotten George Mason , to worship " old John Brown . " Yet a pilgrimage to the shrine of Mason may restore to their first affections hearts alienated from our Union , and teach those whose devotion to it savors of fanaticism and intolerance the beautiful lesson of charity and love . The blood of our English fathers spilled in the " Great Rebellion " had not dried before Puritan and Cavalier were in earnest council to cement the fabric of England 's greatness . The leaders , who had often met in mortal strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unflinching endurance of Cromwell 's " Ironsides , " while the Puritan mother crooned her babe to sleep with songs of knightly Cavendish or Stanley . That it may speedily be so with us is the fervent prayer of every true American heart ; and then , should the cry arise that the republic is in peril , the only rivalry between the sons of the North and those of the South would be , as in days of yore , who could carry the common banner deepest into the ranks of the common foe .
