txt The Silver bill was not reached to-day in the House , and still lies on the Speaker 's table . By a special order made last week , the Louisiana election case was set down for to-day , which excluded all other business . Before the debate on the election case was commenced to-day , Mr. Stephens gave notice that after the pending question should be disposed of he would move to go to the Speaker 's table for the purpose of reaching the Silver bill , and should that motion prevail that he would move to concur in the amendments made by the Senate . This announcement was received with applause and cries o f " Good " from both sides of the House . Mr. Bland approved of the course proposed by Mr. Stephens , and promised to second his motion . Mr. Buckner . Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency , stated that he would move to refer the bill to his committee . It is uncertain whether the bill can be reached tomorrow , as the indications are that the Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion to go to the Speaker 's table can not be entertained until after the expiration of the morning hour , which will not begin until the election case has been disposed of . It is plain that the feeling to dispose of the bill without referring it to a committee is gaining strength , and it is very probable that the motion to concur will prevail . There are parliamentary reasons why this course should be pursued , which do not seem to be appreciated by Mr. Ewing , who is earnestly in favor of reference , and who is distracted because of his lack of familiarity with the rules of the House . So long as the bill remains on the table it occupies the beat position possible , and is always within control of the majority , who can reach it any day after the morning hour and dispose of it finally . Should it be referred to a committe , it could not be reported back until the committee should be called in regular order , and then it could only be considered in the morning hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour until the following day . This is a dangerous position in which to have a bill placed , as the minority are given peculiar advantages to delay its progress . The bill to repeal the Resumption act was put in this position by Mr. Ewing 's blunders , and was only extricated by making the concessions demanded by the minority . In view , therefore , of the advantages presented by the present position of the bill , it is likely its friends will refuse to refer it , and proceed to concur in the Senate amendments , after allowing a reasonable time for discussion . Any expectation that the bill will encounter serious difficulties in the House which will interfere with or delay its final passage is without foundation . It may possibly not be acted upon this week , since the ordinary course of business may prevent any opportunity for making the necessary motions upon it , but the longer it is left on the Speaker 's table the stronger will grow the feeling in favor of immediate action , and the less likely to succeed will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority will , of course , under any respectable leadership , do what it pleases with the bill , and it is almost certain that a majority favors the passage of the bill as it stands .
