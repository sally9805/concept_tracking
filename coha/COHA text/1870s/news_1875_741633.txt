txt The State Senate would have done well not to have given the Governor a chance of vetoing such another bill as that providing for the regulation of Coroners ' inquests , and " for the payment of services rendered by scientific persons as experts . " We pointed out the objectionable features of this bill during its passage through the Assembly , and the Governor has unquestionably performed a public service in refusing to sign it . lle has saved the tax-payers front a. charge . which ought to be paid out of the already ample fees of the Coroners ; he has placed himself li in emphatic opposition to the practice of auditing claims at Albany , and he hat shown that he can act independently of the dictation of a powerful and arrogant see ? tion of his own party . It is reassuring to find that GOT . TILDE has courage enough to take up such a position . But the public would feel somewhat safer if the State Senate had continued to fill the position which it has maintained with almost nni ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which this Assembly has fur . nished so abundant a supply . There are certain measures on whose chances of being stopped by au Executive veto we should not like to be too confident , but about whose claim to be vetoed there can be no question whatever . Among these is the bill for creating t we extra Police Justices , for the ostensible purpose of providing for continuous sessions of the Court of Special Sessions . The bill was introduced by Senator Fox , for no other obvious reason than to make a place for his brother-in-law ex-Justice HOGAN . It was favorably reported from the Senate Committee on Cities , apparently because the other place is to be " traded " off to a Republican . In a slightly amended form , it was rushed through the Senate , eagerly taken up in the House and passed , and is now awaiting Executive approval . It is bad enough to find a measure like the City Judge bill , in favor of which it seems that something can be said on the score of public necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tammany Hall , and of quartering upon the City a disreputable politician out of employment . It is a little worse to find a bill , for which there is no public necessity whatever , being able to secure the support of both Democrats and Republicans simply because it is expected to provide for an active politician from each party . The theory that the public Treasury exists for the purpose of mhintaining political " workers , " who have not ability enough to earn au honest living by private business , may be very excellent Democratic doctrine . It is hardly a principle which the responsible representatives of the Republican Party should have in domed . It has been suggested by some of the friends of this bill that the present Board of Police Justices has more work than it can Properly attend to . That fact certainly does not appear from the first annual report of the board . There are five District Courts on the island , with ten Justices to conduct them ; there is a sixth for the new wards , the duties of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the reports of the several courts we find the following stereotyped phrase repeated : " During the year the court has been open every day , from not later than 8 o'clock A. M. until 12 o'clock noon , except upon such days as the business to be done therein did not require said court to be open for such a period of time . " Making allowance for the short afternoon sessions , a daily average of five hours ' work certainly represents the , outside limit of the labor devolviug on the Police Justices . As the vast majority of the cases brought before them require summary disposal , it is hardly necessary to add that the leisure of a Police Justice is not seriously infringed on by the study of disputed points of law . It has never been pretended that the necessity of assigning three Justices to hold the several terms of the Court of Special Sessions has interfered with the regular discharge of the business of the District Courts . In fact , two Justices wont to Albany the other day for the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired any additions to their numbers . Under these circumstances , it would be difficult to imagine a less defensible bill than one compelling the City to maintain two new Police Justices . So far , the Republicans in the Senate have maintained a record to which their friends can point with all but unmixed . pride . If would be unfortunate if they should contrive to throw away their good reputation , by lending themselves to the passage of any more petty political jobs during the closing hours of the session . In addition to the certainty of being cheated in any prearranged " trade " with Tammany Hall , they owe it both to their party and to the public to defeat all such measures , and so maintain the sharp contrast which has been kept Up during the session between their methods of legislation and those favored by the " responsible majority " in the Assembly . If the ( 4overnof chooses to identify himself with the kind of legislation of which the Special Sessions bill is a very good sample , so much the worse for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it is his duty to defend .
