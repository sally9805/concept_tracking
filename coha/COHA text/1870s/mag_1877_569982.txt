ARTICLE V.-UNRECOGNIZED FORCES IN POLITICAL ECONOMY . POLITICAL ECONOMY has much to gain in the way of popular favor . Practical men ( listrust it as theoretical and benevolent men call it unsympathetic . A majority of cultured persons know and care but little about the science which has to do with their daily bread . In so far as this results from ignorance and prejudice , time and increasing intelligence are the remedies ; but the science itself may be responsible for a portion of it . There may be economic forces at work which have , as yet , received no adequate recognition ; and , if these forces are not exceptional but regular , not mean but noble , if their effects are already great and promise to increase with time , the demand for their investigation is imperative . To show the existence of such forces and to point out some of them is the object of this paper . Economic laws depend on the voluntary action of men , and the science therefore professes , in effect , to teach how men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the ultimate determining forces , and a misconception as to the nature of these motives is liable to vitiate any conclusion thus attained . The accuracy of the conclusions of Political Economy depends on the correctness of its assumptions with regard to the nature of man . If man is not the being he is assumed to be , there is no certainty that the conclusions will be even approximately correct . It is more than can be here undertaken , to prove , by the analysis of leading works , that the motives attributed to men have been , in fact , erroneous . That must be done by the reader for himself , by the study of the works themselves . It is , however , believed and asserted that a candid reading of the leading works on this subject will produce the conviction that the writers have troubled themselves very little with anthropological investigation . Their attention has been employed , and well employed , elsewhere . They have assumed , as the // basis of their science , a certain conception of man , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social labors of this assumed being . The premises have not been adequately verified ; the system is , in so far , an i ( leal one , and it is , therefore , a matter of some chance whether its results are correct or not . Economic science has never been based on adequate anthropological study . Inaccuracies in the science which result from inadequate conceptions of man are not to be rectified , as has been asserted , by a proper allowance for " disturbing forces . " The actual course of a cannon ball may be determined by a mathematical computation followed by the proper allowance for atmospheric rcsistance ; but the social activities of men can not be accurately determined by assuming that man is a being of a certain kind , elaborating the conclusions with nicety , and then endeavoring to introduce subsequent allowance for the fact that man is , after all , a being of quite a different kind . As Mr. iRuskin has well said , such disturbing forces are rather chemical than mechanical . " We made learned experiments upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very manageable gas ; but behold the thinn which we have practically to deal with is its chloride , and this , the moment we touch it on our established principles , sends us with our apparatus through the ceiling . " The only right course under such circumstances is to begin at the beginning and determine by investigation the nature of man , the subject under consideration ; and this course should be adopted whether existing conclusions be true or false . The object is not so much to attain different results from those already reached , as to attain the same ones by a more legitimate method . The process which changes some false results will verify many true ones . The image which the scientist has constructed as the subject of his discussion may or may not resemble the man whom God has created ; the latter only is the true subject of Political Economy . The science , which has rested on a temporary blocking of assumption , needs to be built on a permanent foundation of anthropological fact . Having determined the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely the creature of assumption , consideration will farther develope the fact that the // assumed man does not , in fact , resemble the real one in several important respects , and that there is not only a possibility , but a moral certainty that some erroneous conclusions have resulted from this discrepancy . The assumed man is too mechanical and too selfish to correspond with the reality ; he is actuated altogether too little by higher psychological forces . What is true of a laboring machine requiring only to be housed , fed , and supplied with fuel as a motive power , a creature actuated only by selfish motives , and scarcely conscious of spiritual forces , will certainly not be altogether true of a laboring man in modern society . The recognition of the inadequate basis on which the traditional economic system rests and of the too theoretical character of its methods has led , in Germany , to the originating of a new method of treatment , in which the laws of Wealth are founded rather on recorded facts than upon assumption and deductive reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the old , in distinction , the " Ideal . " So complete a change of method may not be necessary . It is on its anthropological side that the traditional science is chiefly defective , and , by adequate studies in this direction , - esults may be attained which History will verify . A broad field is thus opened for occupation . The first steps may be slow ; it is easier to view a promised land from a mountain top than to capture it from the Canaanites . The richness of the soil is not to be estimated by the first results of its culture ; what is thus gained is not the decreasing harvest of an exhausted field but the first sod-crop of a new one . What is here attempted is rather to point out this field than to occupy it to any al ) preciable extent . The little that is done in the latter direction is scarcely more than an illustration of the foregoing statements . It is proposed to consider certain facts relative to the nature of man , selecting those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stated to be admitted , and then to apply these facts to some familiar questions of Political Economy . If any light is thus thrown on questions now in doubt , if any new starting-point seems to he attained for future investigation , or if any modification results in economic principles as now understood , much // greater and more valuable results may be expected from more extended inquiry . The simpler and more obvious the anthi-opological facts here cited , and the more familiar the economic questions to which they are applied , tbe stronger is the inference as to the ultimate value of completer anthropological studies . Such studies would give a new character to Political Economy ; they would verify its truths , correct its errors , impart to it a kindly and sympathetic quality , and elevate it to a recognition of those higher soul-forces which it has heretofore practically ignored . Political Economy treats of man , not as he was created , but as he has become by ages of social development . An organism is a structure in which each part exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social development means the uniting of mankind in an organism of which the individual man , the highest of simple organisms , is the molecule . Division of labor is the differentiation of parts in the social organism , and , by its greater or less degree , marks , as in the animal kingdom , the grade which the organism has attained . The higher the organism , the greater is the differentiation . The individual man , the molecule of the system , becomes transformed in his entire nature by this unifying process . The simple organism is made in every way higher and better by hecoming a part of the social organism . The changes which take place in the individual differ , in the case of different ones , according to the position which each assumes in the organic whole , and social distinctions arise , which are not the result of ignorance or pride , but are founded on fundamental distinctions of social function . The individual man who , in the development of society , becomes a molecule of the brain of the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those experienced hy the man who , in society , is simply a molecule of the nutritive organ . The scientist differs in mental and physical development from the tiller of the soil . So-called differences of social position have their true foundation in differences of function in the social organism , and are accompanied by real differences in the individual . Low organisms of every sort have few and simple wants . Low social organisms , the mollusks and radiates of the social // classification , have few wants in the aggregate , and in like manner , the individual members of the low social unity have correspondingly few . Multiplicity of wants marks the grade of the society and of the individual . Simple food , little or no clothing , and the rudest of shelter , suffice for the tropical savage . iNomads require more varied appliances , the rudest * riculturists still more , and the civilized man of the present has an indefinite variety of wants and possessions . It appears to have been the acquiring of knowledge that awakened , in Adam , the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knowledge has brought new wants into active exercise . As men differ from each other in the number and character of their wants , according as they belong to a lower or a higher social organism , so they differ from each other according to their position in the same social organism . Those who do the thinking for the social unity will have their own intellectual wants developed , while those who simply nourish and clothe it will find their lower wants in the ascendancy . The man of culture desires books , pictures , music , and intellectual as well as physical nourishment , while the rude and ignorant man is chiefly conscious of the need of sensuous comforts and pleasures . The lowest wants are susceptible of complete satisfaction ; the higher are indefinitely expansive . Appetite ceases to act when sufficient nourishment has been taken , and the sense of cold , when the body has been sufficiently clothed . The pleasurable sense of taste is capable of less complete satisfaction ; the savage eats long after hunger has ceased , and , even in civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the desire for personal adornment causes the wardrobe to be increased and varied long after the need of simple protection has been fully met . The aesthetic desire for personal comeliness , and the desire for social consideration , are wants which expand indefinitely and are seldom completely satisfied . Wants of this medium sort are indefinitely expansive but decrease in intensity as the desired objects are supplied . Pleasures of this kind tend to cloy . The first gratification is an object of intenser desire than the second , and the second than the following . An indefinite number of such acquisitions would each afford some gratification , but in diminishing degree . // The highest wants of man are not only indefinitely expansive , but afford undiminished or increased gratification at each successive attainment of the objects of desire . The scientific , aesthetic , and ethic wants of man 's nature are , certainly , as well worthy of recognition as the animal desires . These wants as certainly lead men to labor for that which is true , beautiful , and good , as the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . These higher wants increase in intensity with increased gratification . The more a man knows , the more ardently he seeks knowledge and the things which secure knowledge . The more the sense of the beautiful is cultivated , the more it is developed and increased . The better a man becomes , the more earnestly he strives after everything that tends to develope character . These ideal wants are unselfish . Science , beauty , and moral worthiness are loved and desired each for its own sake . The man who is under the influence of such desires can never be a being striving solely for personal advantage , and the economic activities of a community of such men can never present an ignoble scramble for profit , each man for himself . These wants find no adequate recognition in the systems of Political Economy most widely prevalent , in which it is tacitly assumed that selfishness is at the basis of all economic action . Have such motives ever been carefully discussed as regular forces producing economic results ? In so far as they have attracted attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? In modern times the " disturbances " which they create are of colossal magnitude . Wealth is given , not exchanged , under their influence . It is not " do ut des " but simply do where these motives are in control . Scientific needs have caused colleges to be endowed . Ethical wants have covered the land with churches and institutions of which morality is the object . Aesthetic desires have secured to the country something of the enjoyments of art . Each of these motives has caused vast amounts of wealth to be diverted into ways of which no adequate account can be taken in a system where each man is supposed to seek only his own selfish ends . Moreover , the action of these unselfish and supersensual motives is not confined to activities in which they completely predominate , but appears , mingling with other motives , // in every activity of life . They cause higher impulses to mingle with the greed of gain in every department of industry . They soften the edge of hard bargains , and make business relations compatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers with generosity , and that of laborers with gratitude . Traced farther and deeper , such motives are the roots of commercial honor ; they make combination of effort possible , and are the life of the social organism . Such results can hardly be ignored in any system of Economy , but the ideal and unselfish motives that produce these effects may be tacitly ignored , or may receive an inadequate recognition as a disturbing element . Such motives , however , are not occasional and exceptional , bat constant and regular . They tend to increase with time and civilization , and , if classed as disturbing forces , promise eventually to overshadow those classed as normal . There is , in fact , nothing whatever of a " disturbing " nature about them . Their whole action tends to harmony . They are essential to those " economic harmonies " which Messrs . Cary and J3astiat think they have discovered in the unrestrained action of selfish motives . " Every man for himself " is the principle of disorganization and chaos ; " every man for mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of such motives increases , the more harmoniously and rapidly will social development proceed , and the more speedily will the best and highest activities of the individual man be called forth . Such motives demand the first attention and the profoundest investigation , and not bare recognition as a disturbing element . The general varieties of wants from the lowest to the high . est exist , in some degree , in every man . No man is so rude as not to experience wants of the higher order , nor so cultured as to entirely rise above those of the lower . Classes of men differ in the relative intensity which their higher and their lower wants exhibit . Low wants , strongly marked , character . ize ignorance and rudeness , and higher wants indicate education and refinement . Feeble aesthetic desires indicate gross . ness , and stunted ethical desires , bad moral character . The scale of relative intensity of the different wants varies in every individual , but a certain general classification is noticeable // according to the relative predominance of animal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here attempted , and the results of such more extended inquiry WOul ( l be interesting and useful . Some wants nature satisfies freely for all men and , here , differences of enjoyment depend on differences of capacity among individuals . The cultured man enjoys more of the free gifts of nature than the ignorant . Aside from the wants thus freely supplied , men gratify their desires in the order of their intensity , as far as their means permit . It is impossible to look into a man 's nature and distinguish the relative intensity of his different wants , but it is practicable , in a general way , to observe those which he seeks to gratify . The man who is both nneducated and poor will have neither the disposition nor the ability to obtain many other than animal gratifications and a low order of the intellectual . If he be in the extreme of poverty , he can obtain , aside from what is free for all men , only what is necessary for the maintenance of life and strength . If he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no gratifications markedly higher in kind , but only an increased quantity of the lower . He will desire food for nourishment , clothing for protection , and a dwelling for shelter , but will care little for the comeliness of person or dwelling . Should such a man become wealthy without becoming more cultured , he will desire only a quantitative increase of gratifications characteristic of the lowest social type . Personal vanity and love of display are stronaly marked in the lowest social grades , and these motives will make themselves manifest in his new surroundings . His dwelling will be more showy , especially on the exterior . For purposes of display it may be of a size which does not increase , hut rather diminishes the comfort which its owner takes in it . The furnishings of the interior will exhibit a desire for brilliant effects unregulated by taste . It is such men as this who order libraries according to shelf room , by the linear foot independently of contents , and who cover their walls with pictures in which brilliant coloring and framing strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with refinement and education , and , where these exist , a widely different course of life is noticeable // as wealth increases . In such a case the clothing and dwelling will be comely and cleanly from the first , and every increase of means will be marked by an increased gratification of the higher intellectual wants . The dwelling will probably not be larger than convenience requires , but it will be tasteful within and without , and taste and not vanity will guide in the selection of furniture and decorations . Thus certain broad lines of classification may be drawn between the members of a community , and the condition of the various classes in this respect , will determine the employments of the community . Wants are either latent or developed , according to the intellectual condition of the person ; when developed , they admit of three distinct conditions of activity , according to his ability to gratify them . The desire for what is decidedly beyond the possibility of attainment , is not , in a healthy nature , either constant or active . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at most , a desultory and transient wish to be its occupant . Such a wish is a day-dream ; it stimulates to no effort , and its non-fulfilment occasions little discontent . In passing a dwelling slightly better than his own , tbe laborer may experience a desire of a different and more effective character . The desire for that which is attainable by effort , is active , and stimulates to exertion for the attainment of the object . The failure to obtain such an object , occasions lively disappointment . When such an object has been attained , the want of it ceases , and the active desires extend themselves to higher and remoter objects . Wants admit of these three conditions ; they are quiescent when the object of desire is nnattainable , active , when it is attainable , and in a different manner quiescent when it is attained . rl7he first condition is necessary to contentment , the second to ambition , and the third to tranquil enjoyment . Contentment , ambition and tranquil enjoyment are not inconsistent with each other , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states is the natural and healthy condition of the mind . Discontent and despondency sometimes exist in fact , as other unhealthy conditions exist ; but they are not , in active life , the prevailing states . In any prosperous community men // tend to contentment , hopefulness , and enjoyment , and the opposite conditions are the exceptions . These results are conditional on the distribution of property in the natural way . Should the natural conditions he disturbed by an artificial distribution , disastrous results in all these respects would follow . The habit would be acquired by many of coveting what , in the natural way , lies beyond the possibility of attainment , and the desire for such acquisitions would no longer be quiescent . The conditions of contentment would be destroyed and general discontent would be the probable condition of those who were likely to gain by the reallotment . As acquirement would no longer depend on successful exertion , the springs of ambition would be destroyed , and an eager and hungry waiting for a gratuity would be substituted for that natural condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of effort put forth , expectation would have no natural limit , and the receiving of the gratuitous allotment would be followed by repining at its smallness . The losers in the redistribution would be deprived of what would be the object of an active and intense desire , and would experience great positive unhappiness , which would be intensified to despair by the impossibility of rising again by effort . All the above results would be indefinitely increased if there were a prospect of a periodic repetition of the reallotment . Absolute communism would be followed by the worst results conceivable , and any approach to it would be attended by a corresponding approximation to them . The results of anthropological study may be applied to so many specific questions of Political Economy that to make the applications would require a review of the science . There are few economic questions which do not stand in a clearer light when preceded by adequate studies into the nature of man and of society . We need to make only one or two applications for the purpose of illustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient reward for attentive consideration . Such a principle is that of demand and supply . Clearness in the apprehension of this law requires a correct conception of effectual demand . Adam Smith has shown that desire for anything unaccompanied by the possession of sufficient // means for its purchase , produces no effect in the market and is not effectual , and his definition of effectual demand is desire accompanied by the possession of sufficient means for the purchase of the object . Every man would , thus , be an effectual demander for a thing if its price did not exceed his entire available means . A laborer with a small accumulation of savings would be an effectual demander for many luxuries which it is certain , in fact , that he never will purchase . The beggar spoken of by Adam Smith , will , probably , never purchase the coach and six , even though his savings be sufficient . Desire accompanied by ability to purchase is an inadequate conception of effectual demand . It will be convenient for our purpose to state the results of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between individuals for simplicity , let A , B , C , D , and E represent the different commodities which are the objects of desire of a class of persons . Let the intensity of the respective desires vary in a scale from 5 to 1 , that for A being the most intense . Let the cost of each be represented by a single unit of value . The table will be as follows : A , B , C D E - Different objects of desire . 5 , 4 , 3 2 1 - Relative intensity of the different desires . Individuals will satisfy their desires in the order of their intensity . The man with one unit of means available for present use will purchase A , one with two units , A and B , one with four , A , B , C , and D. In the case of each there will be a definite point where purchases will cease , and it is certain that the person will not purchase what is above the limit . Moinentary caprices cause the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat fluctuating one ; but , ignoring these variations , and supposing that the intensity of the desires at the time is represented by the flgures indicated , the result is certain . The man with three units of means will not purchase D ' nor E , though he has abundant means for the purpose . Men only purchase what is the object of the most intense unsatisfied desire ; there is always a purchase-limit determined by the nature and intensity of their wants and the available means in their possession , and they are effectual demanders only for what comes within this limit . // If a quantity of goods be offered for sale in the market at such a price that only a portion of the community find them within their purchase-limit , a portion will as certainly refrain from the purchase as if their entire means were inadequate for the purpose ; and , if a portion remain unsold , and the necessity for its sale exists* its price must fall until it comes within the purchase-limit of more persons , or until an increased quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously purchased . How much the price must fall to accomplish these results is an interesting inquiry on which , it is believed , our discussion of wants will throw light . The amount of decline in price necessary to secuie new customers depends on the nature of the want which the commodity in question satisfies . If it be a want low in the scale it will be general in the community , and a smaller fall will be necessary than if the want be higher in the scale and experienced only by persons of a certain grade of culture . The amount of decline necessary to secure increased consumption by the same customers also depends on the nature of the want , but , here , the higher wants have the advantage . We have seen that they are more expansive and a small reduction in pm-ice may bring a much greater quantity within the purchaselimit . The increase in the quantity would have been desired from the first , but would have been kept above the limit by its price . The desire for wheat is not expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired for consumption , and it must fall much in price before the same persons will purchase more of it . A small reduction in the price of a luxury may gieatly increase its sale . The same causes which necessitate a large decline in price in case of an over-supply , secure a correspondingly large advance in case of an under-supply . A short crop of wheat advances so greatly in price as to be worth more , in the aggregate , than a large one . Intellectual wants are highly expansive , and , in their lower grades , are very general in a civilized community . Low prices of books of amusement , papers , concert and lecture tickets , &amp;c. , secure , within certain limits , a more than proportionally increased patronage . The leading English writers on Political Economy have introduced a distinction between so-called " productive and unpro // Unrecognized Forces in Politgcal Economy . Oct. , ductive consumption , " the former being the consumption of those things , the effect of which is to enable a man to labor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without imparting laboring capacity . This distinction is chiefly of interest from the high authority on which it rests , and from the important questions which it is sought to solve by its use . The economic effects of luxury and of frugality are the real questions at issue in the discussion of what is termed productive and unproductive consumption . Mr. Mill conveys the impression of taking peculiar pleasure in this distinction and of conceiving that light has been thrown on important questions by its use . The employment of this distinction for the purpose indicated is unnecessary , and involves inaccuracy of thought . Profuse expenditure differs from frugal living , not in producing less wealth , but in destroying more . Consumption is never , in itseig productive , but is more or less destructive . Moreover , the distinction itself will hardly bear analysis , if the nature of man he taken into consideration . It would doubtless be conceded by those who make use of this distinction that it would be impossible to rigidly apply it in actual life . To draw , in practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for productive effort , and that which does not , would be impracticable . Comforts , as well as necessities , may increase the ability to work , and necessities , as well as comforts , may give gratification . The food of nearly every man satisfies wants higher in the scale than that of simple nourishment ; most articles of food impart a sensuous gratification which is distinct from their nutritive action . The clothing of any one above destitution satisfies higher wants than those of warmth and protection , those , namely , of personal adornment and social consideration . So with the dwelling and the entire surroundings . To consume only productively , one must eat the cheapest food that will adequately nourish , wear the simplest clothing that will completely protect , and live in the rudest dwelling that will satisfactorily shelter . All higher wants , in short , must remain unsatisfied , and the man must become a machine , content with the fuel that keeps him in motion . Such a result would demand an entire change in the nature of the being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realized in fact , is self-evident ; that it should ever be conceived of in thought , is an evidence of how little trouble even great writers on Political Economy have given themselves concerning the real nature of the being with whose actions they deal . If the laborer is an engine , his motive power is fuel ; but , if he is a man , his motive power is hope . It is psychological rather than physiological forces which keep him in motion . He is to be lured , not pushed , in the way of productive effort . Ambition may have feeble sway in individual cases , but , this side of the gate of Dante 's Inferno , it is never entirely extinct . We have seen what wants on the margin of actual possession are the active incentives to effort . Civilized man struggles no longer for existence , but for progressive comfort and enjoyment . It is progress that makes contentment possible , as distinguished from sullen submission to unavoidable hardship . Progress has limits , and many wants must remain forever unsatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally quiescent . Other wants near to the border line of actual possession must be active with a prospect of satisfaction by effort , if happiness is to be attained . It is the want of things which lie far above the line of necessities and the consumption of which would be classed as unproductive , which is the constant motive power in industrial progress . It is the so-called " unproductive consump. tion " which is , if soul-forces be recognized , immediately productive of wealth . Systems of Economy are colored by the sentiments of the land where they originate , and a system like the English could scarcely have originated elsewhere than in a country where the traditional practice , in dealing with the laboring class , is by the method of repression . Only , in such a country could the socalled " stationary state " be held up as an attractive picture of the laborer 's future condition . In a country habituated to more of progress the necessity of progress would be more clearly recognized . Such theorising as that which we are criticising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the barrier where hope is left behind ; it will hardly apply to the laboring class in a free and progressive country . // The ultimate foundations of Political Economy lie deeper than the strata on which existing systems have been reared . The point of divergence between the present science , and the true science lies farther back than ordinary inquiries extend . The Economist of the future must begin at the beginning of all knowledge and , with Socrates , pass through the portal from which diverge the various paths of scientific inquiry , and over which the master has written " Trc3*z *avr5i ' . " Self knowledge is the beginning of every science , but it is , likewise , the middle and the end of a science which treats of the activities of man , and of the social organism of which men are members .
