ARTiCLE VII . - BELOIT COLLEGE . ITS ORIGIN AND AIMS . JUST forty years ago , the famous Indian Chieg Black Hawk , let loose the dogs of war-his Sacs and Foxes-against the power of the United States . The military operations that followed were little more than a wild chase of the savages , from central Illinois up through the valley of iRock River into central Wisconsin and thence westward to the Mississippi , where the struggle terminated in the capture of the wily leader . In the midst of the region thus traversed , lies the site of Beloit College , once a favorite camping-ground of the Indians and a chosen , perhaps sacred , spot with the race that preceded them . Within the college enclosure are still preserved some fifteen or twenty earth-works of the mound-builders . The brief strife of arms brought into notice the wonderful beauty and fertility of this country , and steps were taken immediately to open it for the inflow of emigration and Christian civilization . The town of Chicago was organized in 1833 , with only twenty-eight voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in 1835 . In the same year , the first public sales of land within the boundaries of Wisconsin took place . Then through the two lake-ports a flood of settlers poured in to occupy the prairies and openings between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river , with a rapidity up to that time unexampled in this or any other land . Wiscoiisin was organized under a distinct territorial government in 1836 . Its whole population then numbered about 11,000 . In 1838 it had become 18,000 , - in 1840 , 31,000 ,  --  in 1842 , 47,000 ,  --  in 1845 , nearly 120,000 , and , by the census of 1870 , it is over 1,000,000 . The same movement filled up with like rapidity the northern part of Illinois , a tract of country homogeneous in all its physical features , and fitted also , by the homogeneous character of its incoming population , to be united with Wisconsin in one field for the work of higher education . The course of emigration runs naturally on the lines of latitude , and Yankee eyes are quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a large infusion of New England elements in the stream of human life which poured in and spread itself over this attractive field . Puritan ideas of the home , the school , the church , and the college , were thus transplanted and took root here with the first upturning of the prairie sod . Those sent out as missionaries to take possession of this goodly territory in the name of the Lord Christ , were especially moved by the rapid crystallization of society under their eye and the evident necessities of a very near future , promptly to organize as best they could all the forces of Christian civilization Among these they regarded a Cbristian college of prime impor tance . So within ten years of the time when the Indian council-fires were extinguished by the Black Hawk war , we find these men in council , as did the New England fathers , praying together and " thinking on a college " - " a colledge , " as Cotton Mather says , " the best thing that ever New England thought upon . These thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of northwestern churches in convention at Cleveland , in June , 1844 . They became defined and matured in four successive conventions held in that and the following year , for the specific purpose of considering what could be done to found a college . In these deliberations were heartily united the ministers and churches of Wisconsin and northern Illinois , who ; in association , presbytery , or convention were joined to maintain the one pilgrim faith in this region , made one by its geographical necessities and the common characteristics of its growing population . The main question was settled in the third convention , which met May 27th , 1845 . There were in attendance forty-two ministers and twenty-seven laymen , representing all the Congregational and Presbyterian ecclesiastical bodies then in this region . They were aided by the counsel of several college officers and pastors of churches from other parts of the country . If it is considered how feeble and scattered were the churches in that day , and how few and poor the facilities for traveling , it will be understood how deep and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question brought before them . With great carefulness and prayerfulness , they studied the present and prospective wants // of the field , and what the Lord would have them do to meet these wants in respect of means for high inteflectual. i*oral , and Christian culture . It was an hour of thrilling interest , never to be forgotten by those present , when , with hearts enlarged and harmonized by contemplating the great common object , after an hour of special prayer , they gave expression to their unanimous judgment , approving and confirming the resolution of the first convention- " That the exigencies of Wisconsin and Northern Illinois require that there be a college and a female seminary of the highest order located in this region , one to be in Northern Illinois contiguous to Wisconsiu and the other in Wisconsin contiguous to Illinois . " In accordance with this action , Beloit College and iRockford Female Seminary were established . Such was the origin of Beloit College . No individual ambition-no local interest or money speculation-no partisan zeal - no crotchets of radicalism-no wild conceits of eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patient , thoughtful consideration on the needs of human society , the grand purpose of God 's redeeming providence , and the instrumental agencies by which God 's good-will to men is carried out in the progressive advancement of Christian civilization towards its final consummation of peace on earth and glory to God in the highest . It was the child of the churches-cradled in prayer and faith and the holy consecration of love for truth and right-for God and men . It stahds , from its beginning , identified with the world-wide interests of Christ 's kingdom among men . Like this , in all essential respects , was the origin of nearly all the institutions of these young States to which the Western College Society has extended its fostering care . It is not our purpose to follow out , in detail , the unfolding of the enterprise thus begun . A concise outline must suffice . A charter for the college was obtained from the Territorial Legislature of Wisconsin in 1846 . In the summer of 1847 , the corner-stone of the first *college building was laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first class was received as 1 ? reshmen for the prescribed course of study . The central idea in the whole movement was to provide for the true work of an American college according to the main features of the New // England model-that is , the thorough discipline and liberal culture of young men for four years in the transition period froi*i youth to manhood . It was designed at first to hold the institution strictly and exclusively to this proper college work . But it was soon found that , for lack of classical academies or their equivalent in the region , a preparatory school must be provided as a necessary adjunct . The commencement in July next will be an anniversary of special interest , because it will mark the completion of the first twenty-five years in the life of the college . Leaving a full review of the period to be more fitly presented then , we may state now that during this quarter of a century nearly 2000 young men have been for a longer or shorter period under its culture . Nearly two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these , both the partial and the complete fruits of its direct work , may be reckoned as a clear addition to the results of higher education in the land . For in this time , partly through its indirect influence , as many young men , probably , have gone from this field to seek the benefit of older colleges at the East , as would , without the presence of this institution , have sought a liberal education anywhere . Nine-tenths of all who have enjoyed in any degree the culture of this college , have found their life-work in the West The remaining tenth are scattered over the wide earth , many of them filling places of important trust in connection with the pulpit , the public press , and the work of Christian missions . During this period of twenty-five years , the financial resources of the college have grown , from the gift by the people of Beloit , according to their early pledge , of a site and first building , in value not less than $10000 , till , through the benefactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college has accumulated a permanent property estimated at more than $225,000 ,  - -  its running expenses having been , mean time , kept up , by close economy and careful management , without incurring debt This sounds small by the side of the millions set down to some of the New England colleges . But here , it is a sign of some strength . It answers well the purposes of the " dimension stones ' * at the bottom of a foundation , on which the walls of a goodly structure , yet to be builded up , may safely rest . Its // value is enhanced by the consideration that a great part of the funds thus far gathered , is the fruit of real self-denyi%ng devotion to the great interests which the college represents ; and rich spiritual blessings , above all price , have come in answer to the fervent prayers which accompanied and followed the gifts of God 's people . But we must turn from this glance at the past to consider the future of Beloit College . We shall attempt only a concise statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its wants . The object of the college , distinctly contemplated in the outset , kept steadily in view through all its history , and regarded in the policy of its administration now , with a profounder sense of its importance than ever before , is to make thorough work with young men in the training part of a liberal Christian education . To expand and explain , we say , with young men , under the conviction , confirmed rather than shakeli by the prevalent discussions respecting the co-education of the sexes , that the culture of true manhood is best carried on in an atmosphere essentially masculine , as that of true womanhood is in an atmosphere essentially feminine . Whether or not individual excep tions need to be recognized and provided for , we will not stop here to discuss . We speak confidently of the general rule for the general quality in either case . We say again , " in the training part " of young men 's education , to distinguish a period in the life and a stage in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which immediately precede the time when the man , adult in body and in mind , is left to his own free choice and independent action . By common understanding and consent , a man comes of age on completing twenty-one years of his life . Peculiar circumstances may hasten or postpone the time which one shall give to college work ; but for most , the best period , no doubt , is that which lies between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one . And the process contemplated for this period is a systematic , widely varied , and precise drilling of all the powers of the mind by actual exercise in the great leading departments of human thought and learning . The end sought is not so much to make great acquisitions of knowledge , as to gain facility in the manifold // operations of which the mind is capable , so that all its faculties shall be trained , brought under command , and made reliable for any purpose . Considerable knowledge will be acquired in the training process ; but the best part of it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines-starting-points and guides for the more specific and exhaustive studies of a later stage . For , as there is presupposed a previous elementary education , through which some knowledge has been gained and the powers have been somewhat developed , so there is anticipated an advanced stage , when , in some defined line of effort , the man will furnish himself for his life-work of investigation or achievement . Such training all true leaders of men must and will get . If they have not opportunity to come under the prescribed regimen of a college , they will subject themselves to self-imposed task work , as did Franklin and Lincoln , to gain the same end , at considerable disadvantage . To make this training thorough and efficient , it must be carried on under a prescribed intellectual and moral regimen , close and severe . It properly belongs to that time of life when the man is under tutors and governors . It is not consistent with permitting its subject , to any great extent , to follow his own inclination merely and exercise his own option as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will attempt ; for the object of the training is to bring out the neglected faculties and strengthen the weak ones , so as to secure a symmetrical development of the man , with a willpower that can , if need be , overcome aversion and cross inclination . We speak of thorough work , referring not to the completeness of a finished result , but to the process as involving work , mental exertion , strained up in each effort towards the limit of the mind 's ability . To accomplish this , the method of teaching must be chiefly by recitation in which the student is held to a daily accountability , to test both his faithfulness in application and the style of his mind 's action in appropriating , assimilating , and expressing truth . Only by thorough exercise are the powers of either body or mind expanded or strengthened . Only by such actual tests does one come to the knowledge and full possession of his own powers or acquisitions . No man knows that // he knows a thing , till he can express it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close application , to accurate investigation , to sound reasoning , and to clear statement , is a work of patience and perseverance with both learner and teacher . To consider and treat it otherwise is to encourage shams . They who go to college just " to have a good time " make an egregious mistake , and the regimen of the college ought to be such as to reveal and correct the mistake . But under the law of habit , that which is begun as task-work grows easy , till , at length , work itself becomes play ,  --  the most satisfactory and enjoyable play to which a man can give himself . One has " a good time " in college just in proportion as he is by his own efficiency under its regimen molded to this habit , so that he can find pleasure even in task-work because he takes hold of it conscious of his power and with heartiness . We speak of this as part of a liberal Christian education , recognizing the tendency of this culture to bring the mind into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian truth to all other forms of truth which are made the subjects of study , and the value of Christian precepts to keep the soul in all its action true and right under a sense of accountability to God , its Father . The soul gains freedom , not by breaking away from all law , not by declaring its independence of all external authority , not by casting aside , as of no account , the results of human thinking , accumulated through the ages ; but by a full understanding of the laws of its own being and the free exercise of its powers in conformity with those laws , by willing subjection to the rightful authority of God , its moral governor , and by the grateful acceptance of that which the world 's masterminds have wrought out as food for its thinking , to be digested and assimilated and made part of its own life and growth . The fetters which need to be broken are the clogs of laziness , the bands of ignorance , the cramps of prejudice , the narrowness of restricted observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to particular research . With respect to his special line of work , the man loses nothing ; with resjiect to the proportions of his character and the grandeur of his general movement and influence , he gains much by this liberalizing culture . To give the balance of complete development , the // poise of noblest manhood , Christian truth and morality need to be infused through all the educational process . And we emphasize the word Christian in this connection , to indicate further the intent that the results of the culture given shall be , as fully as possible , consecrated to the propagation of the truth and the extension of the power of Christianity in the world , by directly increasing the number of able preachers of the gospel . We are aware that these thoughts are not new-quite otherwise . As old ideas perhaps , in the love of novelty which characterize our times , they have been too much set aside and lost from view . We can not believe that the world has outgrown them , or can outgrow them , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wants . We bring them together here , to make definite the object which Beloit College aims at . It appears an object quite distinct from that of the common school or the academy on the one side , and from that of the professional , the technical , or the scientific school on the other . We can not see that it is properly embraced within the purview of a true university . Because the object is so clearly defined and so important in itself and its relations , it may fitly be made the chieg not to say the single object of . an institution or class of institutions . It seems likely to be best realized when prosecuted as a specialty . Up to a comparatively recent period , this was the chieg the peculiar work of Yale College , and great and blessed have been her achievements . Whether under the transformation which is changing Yale College into Yale University , just this work through which her glory in the past has been won , will be as well and fitly accomplished , remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every college should be ambitiously pushing in the same direction . It would seem , too , that the object defined must be but imperfectly attained , when made , as it is in many institutions , only an adjunct to an immense variety of miscellaneous work , mostly of a lower grade . However it may be elsewhere , the aim at Beloit is steadily fixed on perfecting a true college work in the line indicated . ig in the future , the college shall be called to undertake some higher , broader work , it will be only as she shall have proved herself true to this her pre8ent mission . // To success in this mission , she now bends all her energies , content with the work and with such honor as may come from its faithful performance . There are embarrassments which hinder the attainment of this object , especially as respects the numbers of those who come into and go through the full course of training . Prominent among these is the fact that the object itself is but partially understood or appreciated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now probably a population of one and a half millions . It has grown to this number within thirty years , chiefly by immigration . The barly emigrants were mostly young people , characterized by general intelligence , great energy , and indomitable spirit ; but the proportion of liberally educated men among them was much less than was found among the early pilgrims of New England , or than is now found among the citizens of the Eastern States . Many strong , vigorous minds have been developed by a practical training under the pressure of immediate responsibilities thrown upon them . They have done well , and are highly to be honored for what they have made of themselves . Yet through the whole frame-work of society , there is an obvious lack of those ideas and sentiments which are the fruit of broad , liberal culture . Hence the aim of the college fails to be fully appreciated , and the value of its work is underrated . Not many parents seek its benefits for their sons . Not many young men set their aspirations in this direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . The last remark suggests another embarrassment from the want of academies and schools in which young men can be prepared for admission to college . If this region were dotted here and there , as New England is , with institutions like the two Phillips Academies and Williston Seminary , the embarrassment just referred to would be very much relieved . These would be so many centers of influence working all the time on the public mind , in full harmony and co-operation with the college , and sending year by year recruits for college classes already initiated in the training process . But this help is , in great measure , wanting . Four-fifths of all who have been graduated at Beloit , were dependent on the college for the preparatory as well as for the advanced culture . During these // twenty-five years , public school systems of a high order have been established in eac1*i of the two States . These are doing much to promote general intelligence . The friends of the college have been foremost in helping on this movement , and none rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be confessed that not mn*h aid comes from this quarter to further the ' direct object of the college . So much are the teachers of all grades , even those in the High schools , under the general influences first referred to , that in very many cases a boy 's thought and desire for a collegiate education would be repressed rather than encouraged . Through the thotightful and timely suggestions of teachers , hundreds of bright , active minds might be induced to seek that liberal culture which would expand and enrich their own souls and send into society trained leaders , whose influence would leaven the mass with elevating and refining elements . We will name only one other embarrassment . It comes from the rapid development and material prosperity of the region , in the form of a strong temptation to young men to cut short the time given to their intelectual training , that they may hurry into active business . Amid the distractions of bustling enterprise around them , with the prizes of wealth , office , and power , apparently within their reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , it is not strange that many , started on the college course , should grow impatient of the long road before them and turn aside , and that many others should be deterred from starting at alL It happens thus that college classes , on an average , lose half their numbers on the way , and it is sometimes difficult to sustain the interest and spirit of those who remain . These are real embarrassments ; yet there is a brighter side even to this condition of things . The life and activity characteristic of a new country furnish excellent material for the college to work upon , when brought within its range . Those who come to college , come of their own accord and with a purpose , and they respond kindly and heartily to the efforts put forth for their thorough training . The people generally , if their ear can be gained and the merits of the case can be fairly laid before them , are quick of apprehension to take up right ideas ; // and many of those in prominent stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early education , conscious of their own deficiencies , join with earnest zeal in commending and supporting a genuine college work . Sustained by these encouragements , amid the embarrassments named , the college has held on its way , true to its own ideal , confident that the surest way to success was to keep the standard well up . The results which already appear are very cheering , and exceed the brightest expectations of its founders . By the steady maintenance of its standard , and through the influence of its alumni and others who , in attendance on its instruction , have understood its aim , the community has been in a cousidGrable degree educated to appreciate its object and divine its advantages . And now for its future enlargement and increased usefulness , its immediate wants may be indicated in a general way under three particulars . There is needed , first , the active influence of educated men , especially of ministers of the gospel , in the region , to give to parents and their sons right ideas of what a liberal education means and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much aided in this way , but vastly more would be done if all felt a personal responsibility in this matter . Why should not each pastor charge himself with the duty of seeing that his flock , however small , be constantly represented in the college by at least one earnest student ? Why should he not enlist the teachers in the public schools to cooperate with him for this end ? The effectiveness of such influence has been abundantly illustrated in the history of older colleges in the East . The considerations before suggested , make it of the highest importance for all true college work in the West . The second immediate want of Beloit College is a distinct foundation on which its preparatory school can be set up , separate from the college , yet under the direction and control of the college trustees and faculty . This is needed that the legitimate object of the college , as defined in this Article , may stand out to the apprehension of both students and the public in its distinctive characteristics . With such an arrangement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one set of instructors and one routine of duty , prompting the // student to break off in mid career , will be relieved . Faculty and students will engage with more zest and zeal in the studios of the college course , the standard of scholarship will be raised and the thoroughness of the training will be enhanced . It is believed that the moderate sum of $25,000 will provide for this object . Is there not some one among the readers of this Article who will love to give his money and his name to such a foundation ? Then there is the great want , ever pressing , of additional endowments , for the immediate relief and for the necessary enlargement of the college . With the closest economy , the current expenses of the institution exceed th' reliable income by nearly $2000 each year . The deficiency has been met by the avails of outstanding general subscriptions and miscellaneous property  --  a resource which must be soon exhausted . Rightly to fulfill its object , the college must rapidly enlarge its operations : a foundation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its corps of instructors must be increased , that the pressure on the members of the faculty of double duty in daily exercises may be relieved , so , that they can advance their own culture , and come with ever fresh life and interest to their work . Such enlargement is essential to keep the prestige already gained , and to give the institution steady growth , proportioned to the growth of all things around it . The very life of a college , as of all other living things , depends on such growth . To meet . deficiencies and to provide for this necessary enlargement , that the college may have a fair start for its next quarter-century of living progress , the sum of $100,000 , to be added to its permanent endowments , is imperatively needed , and earne*t1y sought for . What safer place for permanently productive investment can be found ? What nobler monument can a faithful steward , entrusted of God with wealth , desire , than to have his nain* and . memory identified with the life and growth , and perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
