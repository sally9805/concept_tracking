The day itself was not propitious ; heavy clouds overhung the sky ; the air was not foggy , or exactly misty , but yet charged with a heaviness of moisture not stimulating to the spirits , even when the fine rain did not actually fall . But what sent the pedestrian 's spiritual mercury down to a lower degree was not the absence of bright sun and the presence of gray cloud , but the blackness and sombreness generally of the throng of masculine passers by which he was surrounded .
