THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1796 . EIGHT bushels of wheat to the acre is not brilliant agriculture ; nor could the production of eighteen bushels of Indian corn to the acre , at the present time , be thrown in the face of a rival farmer with any reasonable hope of abasing his pride . But , in 1796 , when Mr. Jefferson had been two years at home after retiring from the office of Secretary of State , and was showing his home farm to an old French friend , the Duke de la Rochefoucauld , these were the figures he gave as the utmost he could then extract from his lands in the garden of Virginia . The land was cheap enough , however , - four or five dollars an acre ; and wheat sold in Richmond at two dollars and a half a bushel . Mr. Jefferson boasted that the wheat grown upon his mountain slopes was whiter than the lowcountry wheat , and averaged five or six pounds heavier to the bushel . Overseers , during his ten years ' absence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fashion of old Virginia . The usual routine was this : XV hen the forest was first cleared , laying bare the rich , deep , black virgin soil , the slow accumulation of ages of growth and decay , tobacco was grown for five successive years . That broke the heart of the land , and it was allowed to rest awhile . Then tobacco was raised again , until the crop ceased to be remunerative ; and then the Lelds were abandoned to the crops sown by the methods of Nature ; and she made haste to cover up with a growth of evergreens the outraged nakedness of the soil . But Jefferson had , long before , abandoned the culture of the exacting weed on his Albemarle estate . His overseers , therefore , had another rotation , which exhausted the soil more completely , if less rapidly . They sowed wheat in the virgin soil among the stumps ; next year , corn ; then wheat again ; then corn again ; and maintamed this rotation as long as . they could gather a harvest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acre ; after which Nature was permitted to have her way with the soil again , and new lands were cleared for spoliation . There was then no lack of land for the application of this method of exhaustion . Out of Mr. Jefferson 's five thousand five hundred and ninetyone acres and two thirds in Albemarle , less than twelve hundred were under cultivation . His estate of Poplar Forest was nearly as large , but only eight hundred acres were cleared . The land upon which the Natural Bridge was situated , one hundred and fifty-seven acres in extent , was a wilderness though he always hoped to build a hut there for retirement and repose , amid a scene which awoke all his enthusiasm . This system of agriculture wasted something more costly than Virginia land , namely , African muscle . One hundred and fifty-four persons called Thomas Jefferson master ; equivalent , perhaps , to a *vorking force of eighty emcient field-hands . Give an Illinois or Ohio farmer of ability the command of such a force , on the simple condition of maintaining it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he could be a millionnaire . But , on the system practised in Albemarle in 1795 , the slaves had two years ' work to do in one . No sooner was the wretched crop of the summer gathered in , and the grain trodden out with horses , and the pitiful result set afloat in barges bound for Richmond , than the slaves were formed into chopping-gangs , who made the woods melodious with the music of the axe during the long fall and winter . All the arts by which the good farmer contrives to give back to his fields a little more than he takes from them were of necessity neglected , and the strenuous force of the eighty 542 May , // hands was squandered in an endless endeavor to make good the ravage of the fields by the ravage of the woods . Mr. Jefferson 's eight bushels of wheat , his eighteen of corn , and his scant ton of clover to the acre , was the beginning of victory , instead of the continuation of defeat . It was on the i6th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AlbemarIe estate from the summit of Monticello . Every object upon which he looked betrayed the ten years ' absei*ce of the master : the house unfinished , and its incompleteness made consl ) icuous by the rude way in which it was covered up ; the grounds and gardens not advanced beyond their condition when he had last rambled over them by the side of the n*other of his children his fields , all lying distinct before him like a map , irregular in shape , separated by zigzag fei*ices and a dense growth of bushes ; outhouses dilapidated ; roads in ill repair ; the whole scene demanding the intelligent regard which he was burning to bestow upon it . Never was there a Yankee in whom the instinct to improve was more insatiable and seldom , out of old Ireland , has there been an estate that furnished such an opportunity for its gratification as this one in old Virginia . " Ten years ' abandonment of my lands , " he wrote to General Washington , " has brouTht on them a degree of degradation far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years and a half , the Duke de la Rochefoucauld saw a different prospect from the portico of Monticello . The summit , indeed , was disfigured with the litter of building for , as the exile informs us , Mr. Jefferson , who had formerly studied architecture and landscape - gardening in books only , had since seen in Europe the noblest triumphs of both , and was endeavoring now to improve upon his original designs . Monticello , the Duke remarks , had been infinitely superior before to all other homes in America but , in the course of another year , he thought , when the central dome would be finished , and the new designs happily blended with the old , the house would rank with the most pleasant mansions in France and England . And how enchanting the panorama ! Nothing to break the view to the ocean , from which , though it was a hundred and fifty miles distant , the cooling breeze reached the mountain on a summer day about two in the afternoon . The traveller thought the prospect faultless except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little water . His European eye craved a cultivated expanse , - craved castle-crowned heights , the spire piercing the distant grove , the farm-house , the cottage , and the village clustering in the vale ; and without a mass of water , he thought , the grandest view lacks the last charm . In the whole world it had been difficult to find men who had more in common than these two , - the exile from distracted France , and the American who never loved France so much as when the banded despotisms of Europe had driven her mad . Jefferson had last seen the Duke when , as President of the National Assembly of 1789 , he was striving , with Jefferson 's cordial sympathy , to save kingship and establish liberty . It was La Rochefoucauld who sought the King 's presence at Versailles on a memorable occasion in July , 1789 , and laid before that bewildered locksmith the real state of things at Paris . " But this is a revolt , then said the King . " Sire , " replied the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Bastille was in the hands of the people . Besides the political accord between Jefferson and his guest , they were both improvers by nature , and both most zealous agriculturists . For years the French nobleman had had upon his estate a model farm for the purpose of introducing into his neighborhood English methods of tillage and improved utensils . He bad maintained also an industrial school , and endeavored to plant in France the cotton manufacture which was beginning to make the world tribtitary to England . In a word , he was a citizen 1873. 543 // after the best American pattern , which is another way of saying that he was a man after Jefferson 's own heart . We can easily imagine the family group as they would gather on the portico to see the master of the house and his guest mount for a morning 's ride over the farms . Jefferson was now approaching fifty-three , and his light hair was touched with gray ; but his face was as ruddy , his tall form as erect , his tread as elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at twentyone he had galloped from Shadwell with Dabney Carr . From his youth temperate and chaste , keeping faith with man and woman , occupied always with pursuits worthy of a man , neither narrowed by a small ambition , nor perverted by malignant passions , nor degraded by vulgar appetites , equable , cheery , and affectionate , he only reached his prime at sixty , and shone with mellowing lustre twenty years longer , giving the world assurance of an unwasted manhood . The noble exile was fortynine , with thirty-one years of vigorous life before him . The eldest daughter of the house , at home now because her father was at home , the mother of three fine children , had assumed something of matronly dignity during her six years of married life ; and her husband had become a perfect Randolph , - tall , gaunt , restless , difficult to manage , and not very capable of managing himself . He vented superfluous energy , Mr. Randall tells us , in riding eighty miles a day through Virginia mt*d , and , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bridge , would swim his foamino- steed across a river in full flood . If making cavalry charges* were the chief end of man , he had been an admirable specimen of our race but , for life as it is in piping times of peace , he was not always a desirable inmate , despite his hereditary love of botany , and his genuine regard for his father-in-law . Maria Jefferson , now seventeen years of age , attracted the French traveller ; and he easily read the open secret of her young life . " Miss Maria , " he ob serves , " constantly resides with her father ; but , as she is seventeen years old , and is remarkably handsome , she will doubtless soon find that there are duties which it is sweeter to perform than those of a daughter . " " Jack Eppes " may have been one of the Monticello circle during those pleasant June days of 1796 , when the Duke de la Rochefoucauld surprised Mr. Jefferson in the harvest-field under a scorching sun . Perhaps the guest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he recorded in his narrative . He may even have accompanied the remark with the nearest thing to a wink which the politeness of the ancien re*girne permitted . " Mr. Jefferson 's philosophic mind , " observes the exile , " his love of study , his excellent library , which supplies him with the means of satisfying it , and his friends will undoubtedly help him to endure this loss ; which , moreover , is not likely to become an absolute p ivation , as the second son-in-law of Mr. Jefferson may , like Mr. Randolph , reside in the vicinity of Monticello , and , if he be worthy of Miss Maria , will not be able to find any company more desirable than that of Mr. Jefferson . " But the horses await their riders . We may be sure that both gentlemen were well mounted . Virginia took the lead of all the thirteen Colonies in breeding horses ; and Jefferson , though he differed from his countrymen in things more important , surpassed them in his love of fine horses . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was ever known to show anything of that spirit of domination which marks some varieties of common men . With a pilfering negro , an uncomfortable neighbor , a refractory child , or a perverse colleague , his patience seemed inexhaustible ; but let a horse rebel , and the lash instantly descended , and the battle never ceased until the animal had discovered which of the two held the reins . 1-fe always loved the exhilaration of a race , and did not permit false ideas of official decorum to prevent his attending // races near the seat of government , no matter what office he may have held . The saddle alone was his test of the quality of a horse , the trotting-wagon being unknown in the land of corduroy roads . Jefferson and the horsemen of that age liked to share the labor and peril of the ride with the horse , seeking no vantage-ground of a vehicle from which to exercise mastery over him . He liked a horse , fiery and sure-footed , that could gallop down his mountain on a dark night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next village , while a negro would be fumbling over the broken bridle of his mule . On this occasion , however , there was no need of haste , and the two gentlemen descended at their ease the winding road to the country below . The French agriculturist was too polite to hint that his American brother 's methods were defective ; and yet he appears to have thought so . Mr. Jefferson , he intimates , was a book farmer . " Knowledge thus acquired often misleads , " the exile remarks , and " yet it is preferable to mere practical knowledge . " In arranging his new system , Mr. Jefferson had betrayed a mathematical taste . All the old , unsightly fences , with their masses of bushes and brambles , having been swept away , he had divided his cultivated land into four farms of two hundred and eighty acres each , and divided each farm into seven fields of forty acres , marking the boundaries by a row of peach-trees , of which he set out eleven hundredandfiftyone during his first year at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation , which embraced seven years : first year , wheat ; second , corn ; third , peas or potatoes ; fourth , vetches ; fifth , wheat again ; sixth and seventh , clover . Each of the four farms , under its own overseer , was cultivated by four negroes , four negresses , four horses , and four oxen ; but at harvest and other busy times the whole working force was concentrated . Upon each farm , Mr. Jefferson had caused to be built a great log-barn , at little cost except the labor of the slaves . 545 He did not fail to show his guest the new threshing - machine imported from Scotland , where it was invented , - the first specimen ever seen in Virginia . It answered its purpose so well that several planters of the State had sent for machines , or were trying to get them made at home . " This machine , " records the traveller , " the whole of which does not weigh two thousand pounds , is conveyed from one farm to another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one hundred and fifty bushels a day . " Mr. Jefferson showed him , also , a drilling-machine . for sowing seed in rows , invented in the neighborhood , with the performance of which the master of Monticello was well pleased . Doubtless , the two farmers discussed again that plough of Mr. Jefferson 's invention for which he had received , in 1790 , a gold medal from France . During his European tours he had been struck with the waste of power caused by the bad construction of the ploughs in common use . The part of the plough , called then the mould-board , which is above the share , and turns over the earth , seemed to him the chief seat of error ; and he spent many of the leisure hours of his last two years in France in evolving from Euclid the mould - board which should offer the minimum of resistance . Nothing is more likely than that he had discussed the subject many a time in Paris with so ardent an agriculturist as the Duke de la Rochefoucauld .. Satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of mould-board , he sent a plough provided with one to the Royal Agricultural Society of the Seine , of which the Duke was a member . The medal which they awarded it followed the inventor to New York , and , eighteen years after , the society sent President Jefferson a superb plough containing his improvement . An agreeable incident in connection with that plough-invention has been reported . Among the many young Virginians who were educated under the direction of Mr. Jefferson was the late The Presidential Campaz*n of I 796. // William C. Rives , born almost in the shadow of Monticello . In 1853 , when , for the second time , Mr. Rives was American Minister at Paris , he was elected a member of the Agricultural Society , then temporarily dishonored by the prefix " Imperial " to its name . In his address at his public reception , Mr. Rives alluded to the prize bestowed by the society , half a century before , upon one of his predecessors . " Yes , " said the president , " we still have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson . " The French traveller was interested in seeing at Monticello a principality of two hundred inhabitants almost independent of the world without ; for Mr. Jefferson showed him a cluster of little shops wherein his own negroes carried on all the necessary trades , such as carpentry , cabinet-making , shoe-making , tailoring , weaving . The masonry of the rising mansion was also executed by slaves . There was a mill upon the estate for the accommodation of the neighborhood . For many years the making of nails had been one of the winter industries of American farmers , all nails being then of the wrought description ; and Mr. Jefferson , too , had his nail forge , wherein a foreman and half a dozen men and boys hammered out nails for the country roundabout . When James Monroe built his house near by , it was from his former instructor that he bought his nails . At times Jefferson had as many as ten nailers at work , - two fires and five hands at each fire , - and he supplied the country stores far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . His weaving-house grew , also , into a little factory of sixty spindles , producing cotton cloth enough for all his plantations , as well as a redundancy for the village stores . Some of the black mechanics whom the exile saw on his friend 's estate were among the bes , t workmen in Virginia . One man is spoken of as being a universal genius in handiwork . He painted the mansion , made some of its best furniture , repaired the mill , and lent a hand in that prodigio us structure of the olden time , a family coach , planned by the master . The Duke bears testimony to the kind , considerate way in which the slaves were treated . They had not only substantial justice , he tells us , but received special reward for special excellence . In the distribution of clothes , Mr. Randall adds , it was a system at Monticello to give better and handsomer garments to those who lived decently together in families than to the unmarried ,  --  an expedient which had obvious good results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that period , there was room and chance of welfare for every kind of creature , excepting a free negro . The exile remained a week at Monticello in June , 1796 , and then left his brother farmer to pursue his labors . " On several occasions , " the Duke records , " I heard him speak with great respect of the virtues of the President , and in terms of esteem of his sound and unerring judgment . " H eadds these remarks " In private life , Mr. Jefferson displays a mild , easy , and obliging temper , though he is somewhat cold and reserved . His conversation is of the most agreeable kind , and he possesess a stock of information not inferior to that of any other man . In Europe he would hold a distinguished rank among men of letters , and as such he has already appeared there ; at present he is employed with activity and perseverance in the management of his farms and buildings ; and he orders , directs , and pursues , in the minutest detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the midst of the harvest , from which the scorching heat of the sun does not prevent his attendance. ** At present ! Had he , then , really accepted this plantation life as a career for the remainder of his days ? In the first exultation at his recovered ease and liberty , in 1794 , he thought he had . " I return to farmino " he wrote to his old friend and colleague , John Adams in the midst of the joyous April work of that year , " with an ardor // which I scarcely knew in my youth , and which has got the better entirely of my love of study . Instead of writing ten or twelve letters a day , - which I have been in the habit of doing as a thing in course , - I put off answering my letters now , farmer-like , till a rainy day , and then find them sometimes postponed by other necessary occupations . " At first , too , he was even indifferent to the newspapers . Young Buonaparte ( he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannonaded the English out of Toulon Harbor a few weeks before ; and though his name was still unknown , his genius was making itself felt in the organization of the French armies . The great Toulon news , which reached Monticello by private letters a month after the master 's return , recalled him to his old self for a moment . He even indulged in a little sanguine prophecy . " Over the foreign powers , " he wrote in April , 1794 , " I am convinced the French will triumph completely . " The French , led by Napoleone di Buonaparte , a general of alien race , did triumph over the foreign powers ; but the rest of Mr. Jefferson 's anticipation , happily , was not realized : " I can not but hope that that triumph , and the consequent disgrace of the invading tyrants , is destined , in the order of events , to kindle the wrath of the people of Europe against those who have dared to embroil them in such wickedness , and to bring , at length , kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so long deluging with human blood . I am still warm whenever I think of these scoundrels , though I do it as seldom as I can , preferring infinitely to contemplate the tranquil growth of my lucerne and potatoes . " Nor did the lapse of a long summer change his mind . General Washington naturally concluded , that the coming retirement of Hamilton fi-om the Cabinet would remove the cause of Jefferson 's aversion to a Cabinet office ; but it did not . In September , 1794 , when an express from Philadelphia dismounted at his door , bearing an in- 547 vitation from the President to resume the office of Secretary of State , he replied that no circumstances would ever more tempt him to engage in anything public " I thought myself per fectly fixed in this determination when I left Philadelphia ; but every day and hour since has added to its inflexibility . " The President was sorely embarrassed . The aristocratical sentiment which had fixed the &amp;alaries of the higher offices at such a point that only rich men could accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it always difficult to fill them aright , and sometimes impossible . Jefferson sympathized with him , but felt himself justified in refusing . " After twenty-five years ' continual employment in the service of our country , " he wrote to a friend , " I trust it will be thought I have fulfilled my tour , like a punctual soldier , and may claim my discharge . " These words were written in November , 1795 . In June , 1796 , when the Duke de la Rochefoucauld discovered him in the scorching harvest-field , he was the candidate of the Republican party for the Presidency . It was the year of the Presidential election , and the noise of that quadrennial uproar was beginning to resound in every village . General Washington was going out of office in March , 1797 . Where was the American citizen indifferent to the mighty question , Who should succeed him ? In 1796 , for the first time , there was a contest for the first office ,  - -  for Washington never had a competitor ; and we can all imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ardor a young Republic , in peril between two such powerful belligerents as France and England , would spring to a contest so novel , so interesting , so momentous . How are we to reconcile the habitual language of Jefferson in 1794 and 1795 with his position before the country in 1796 ? It is not necessary to reconcile it , since it is permitted to every man to change his mind ; and considering the limits and defects of that portion The Presidential Can*paz*rn of 1796. // of our organization , what can we do better with our minds than change them ? But the discrepancy was much more apparent than real . In predicting the future , Jefferson 's hopeful disposition frequently led him astray ; but his judgment concerning the issue of a contested election was remarkably sound . His conviction was , that the time had not yet come for a national triumph of the Republicans . The bloody lapse of the French Revolution was too recent , the tide of reaction too strong , the vis inerti*z ' of ancient habit too general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy now , and had dropped the Italian u from his name ) , the French Directory was too touchy , and the French marine too indiscriminate in the matter of prize-taking on the ocean , to afford a Republican calculator ground for expecting an immediate triumph of . his half-organized party in the United States . Nor had the Federalists yet filled up the measure of their errors , nor attained that advanced degree of madness which immediately precedes destruction . The country , too , was getting rich by supplying the belligerents with flour , beef , pork , fish , fruit , potatoes , and rum . Those square , spacious , handsome houses , which still give an air of mingled comfort and grandeur to the old towns on the New England coast - Newburyport , Portsmouth , Salem , Portland - and others , were begininng to be built . As President Washington remarked in March , 1796 , in a letter to Gouverneur Morris , " No city , town , village , or even farm , but what exhibits evidence of increasing wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Jefferson , therefore , felt that he was in small danger of being torn from Monticello by an election to the Presidency . Vice-President , indeed , he might be , through that absurd relic of Hamilton 's mischievous ingenuity , the electoral college , which , even now , in 1873 , waits to be swept into oblivion . By the system as then established , the candidate receiving the next to the highest number of electoral votes was declared to be Vice-President ; so that there was always a probability that the Presidential candidate of the party defeated would be elected to the second office . That office , however , happened to be the only one , in the gift of the people or of the President , which Jefferson thought desirable in itself : first , because the salary paid the cost of four months ' residence at the seat of government ; secondly , because it gave the occupant eight months ' leisure ; and thirdly , because it enhanced a man 's power to disseminate and recommend principles , without his joining in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new character , one of the most trying to human virtue , digestion , nerve , and dignity ever contrived by mortals for a mortal , - candidate for the Presidency ! To him , partly because he was a Democrat , partly because he was Jefferson , it was less trying than to any other man that ever was subjected to it . At once , without effort , without a precedent to guide him , without consultation with friends , he comprehended the morality of the situation , and assumed the proper attitude toward it . His tone , his demeanor , his feelings , his conduct , were all simply right ; and , since a considerable portion of the inhabitants of the United States expect one day to stand in the same bewildering relation to the universe , it may be useful to some of them to know how he comported himself . His grand advantage was , that he did not want the office . He was in the position of a belle who is wooed , not in that of the pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an immense thing , if you have property to dispose of , to be able to stand serene in the market , not caring whether you sell it this year or next , or never . Nor was this anything so very meritorious in such a man . All men , it is true , love power , who are capable of wielding power ; but there are grades and kinds of power . All men love ; but each man 's love takes the quality of // his nature . The noble love nobly ; the base , basely ; the common , commonly . The feeling that bound together in sweet and sublime accord Goethe and Schiller , the noblest pair of lovers since Socrates and Plato , was only called love ; and the instinct that originally drew Bill Sikes to the side of Nancy was also love , of the Sikes quality , the best he had to bestow . In like manner , power is of as many grades as there are grades of men . Rude physical strength is power in the dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars is power . A refinement upon this crude form was that mystical device of former ages , now no longer potent , styled Rank . Great ministers , like Richelieu , were an advance upon the men of mere pedigree , as the Leader of the House of Commons is an advance upon them . Latest and highest is that power which Jefferson craved , - that of governing men and moulding institutions by the promulgation of heartfelt truth . Valuing power , but not place , he found it easy to adhere to the rule which he adopted : To avoid writing or conversing on politics during the contest , except with two or three confidential friends . According to Mr. Adams , it was in 1793 , soon after the publication of Jefferson 's correspondence with Genet and Hammond , that the movement began which ended in his nomination . Boston , of all places in the world , originated it ! Bostpn , too , enjoys the credit of having originated the method by which it was done , as well as the word which describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Mr. Adams , " had a caucus in 1793 , and wrote to Mr. Jefferson , upon his resignation of the office of Secretary of State , that , if he would place himself at their head , they would choose him at the next election ; and they organized their party by their correspondences through the States . " Whatever civil reply the candidate may have made to these gentlemen , he did ; iot place himself at their head , but remained passive and silent from that 549 time until the question had been decided . These Jeffersonian rules will guide any man with safety and dignity through the thousand snares of such a contest : i : Do n't want the office ; 2 . Utter no syllable concerning it beyond the narrowest circle of tried confidants . It was the Jay treaty of 1794 , ratified in 1795 , and executed in 1796 , which embittered politics during this strife for the control of the administration , and nearly gave it to Jefferson . Who shall now presume to judge between the able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this treaty ? Having sent Mr. Jay to England to negotiate , we can easily admit that the President did well to ratify the treaty which resutted ; but the difficult question is , Was it becoming in the United States to send a special envoy , the chief judge of its highest court , to negotiate with a country from which it had received and was hourly receiving indignity and wrong ? , It was no more becoming than it is becoming in a man , creation 's lord , to make terms with a lion that has got his hand in its mouth , or with a bull which has obtained prior possession of a field . It was not becoming in Galileo to kneel submissive before the herd of infuriate Inquisitors who had power to roast him . But it was right . He had been a traitor to his class and to his vocation , to science and to man , if he had allowed , those tonsured savages to rack and burn an aged philosopher . His lie was a wiser fidelity to truth . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoiler and his victim which suspends the operation of some moral laws in favor of the victim , and makes a device justifiable which , in ordinary circumstances , would be dastardly . It is difficult for us to realize the weakness of the country over , which George Washington presided . If its four millions of people had all been cast in the heroic mould , capable of Spartan discipline , like-minded , demanding for their country , with unani // mous voice , only untarnished honor , with or without prosperity ; even in that case it had been a doubtful question ; for there would still have been a hand in the lion 's mouth , - Detroit and the chain of lake-posts occupied by British garrisons , the mouth of the Mississippi held by the Spanish , and no single port of the coast capable of keeping out an armed sloop . But the people of the United States only had their fair share of heroic souls ; and there was the most honest and irreconcilable difference of opinion among them as to which of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Washington was as right in sending Mr. Jay to London as the Republicans were right in opposing it . The President , surveying the whole scene from the watchtower of his office , weighing all the circumstances , hearing all opinions , considering all interests , felt it admissible to court a power he could not crush . Republicans , considering only the obvious facts of the situation , longing to see their country joining heart and hand with France in her unequal strife , yet willing to be neutral , could not but lament a policy which looked like abasement to a powerful foe , and abandonment of a prostrate friend . The modern student of those mad times finds himself at thi , conclusion : " If I had been Washington , I should have made the treaty : if I had been Jefferson , I should have held it in execration . " What a struggle it cost the President to choke down this huge bolus of humiliation is revealed in his letters . If he had put off the departure of the envoy a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off forever , and the course of events in the United States had gone otherwise . While Mr. Jay was upon the ocean , Colonel Simcoe , the Governor of Upper Canada , published a protest which claimed jurisdiction over a wide expanse of territory of the United States which the posts commanded . The President , during the whole of his administration , never wrote an official letter showing such warmth May , of indignation as the one which he instantly penned to Mr. Jay , hoping to send it by a vessel on the point of sailing from New York . The best of Washington 's letters are those which we know he must have written with his own hand ; and this is one of them . It is the letter of a man , not of a secretary . Smooth and polished it is not ; but it has the eloquence of deep emotion struggling in vain for adequate expression . He begins by saying , that , on this irregular and high-handed proceeding , he would rather hear what the ministry of Great Britain will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Mr. Jay , that , although this amazing claim of Colonel Simcoe is the most audacious thing yet done by British agents in America , it is by no means the most cruel . To this the President adds a paragraph which contains ten years of bloody history : - " There does not remain a doubt in the mind of any well-informed person in this country , not shut against conviction , that all the difficulties we encounter with the Indians , their hostilities , the murders of helpless women and innocent children along our frontiers , result from the conduct of the agents of Great Britain in this country . In vain is it , then , for its administration in Britain to disavow having given orders which will warrant such conduct , whilst their agents go unpunished ; whilst we have a thousand corroboratIng circumstances , and , indeed , almost as many evidences , some of which can not be brought forward , to prove that they are seducing from our alliance , and endeavoring to remove over the line , tribes that have hitherto been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense , and who have no causes of complaint , except pretended ones of their creating ; whilst they keep in a state of irritation the tribes who are hostile to us , and are instigating those who know little of us or we of them , to unite in the war against us ; and whilst it is an undeniable fact that they are furnishing the whole with arms , ammu The Presidential Campaz*'n of 1796. // nition , clothing , and even provisions , to carry on the war ; I might go further , and , if they are not much belied , add men , also , in disguise . " Thus , General Washington , in August , 1794 . Mr. Wendell Phillips was much censured a few weeks ago for expressing a similar opinion on the platform . The President proceeded to declare that nothing short of a surrender of the posts could prevent war between the two countries ; and Mr. Jay was to say to the Ministry , Give up the posts ,  --  peace ! Keep the posts , - war ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , Parliament , Ministry , people , king , all desirous of a better understanding . And who could have been better chosen for such an embassy to such a country than John Jay , a devoted member of the English Church , a friend of Wilberforce , a gentleman whose virtues , tastes , foible* , and limitations were as English as if he had been born and reared in a rural parish of Sussex ? The king smiled benignantly upon him , and told him he thought he would succeed in his mission . After five months ' negotiation , a treaty was concluded which Mr. Jay was willing to sign ; not because he thought it good and sufficient , but because he knew it to be the least bad then possible , and , upon the whole , better than none ,  --  better than drifting into war . The posts were to be surrendered . Commissioners were to be appointed - two by the king , two by the President , and one by these four - to award damages to the owners of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of the English creditors of American merchants . American vessels of seventy tons ' burden could trade between the , West Indies and the United States , but not carry West India produce to any other country . American ships could trade with the East Indies and other distant British possessions , on possible terms . But whatever could feed a French soldier , or equip a French ship , was declared 55 ' contraband ; and an American captain obtained from the treaty neither any limitation of the right of search , nor the slightest additional protection against the press-gang . No compensation was made for the loss of millions of dollars and many hundreds of lives through the eleven years ' lawless retention of the posts , and none for the negroes carried off from New York and Virginia after the peace of 1783 . In the innocence of his heart , Mr. Jay supposed at first that the concessions of the treaty were due to a revival of friendly feeling on the part of the English people . On the eve of his departure for America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which the leading Cabinet ministei*s and two hundred merchants assisted . When the health of the President was proposed , the company could not express all their enthusiasm in the " three cheers " prescribed by the chairman , but prolonged them to six . Every toast , Mr. Jay reports , which referred in a friendly manner to America , was received with " general and strong marks of approbation . " At length , an incident occurred which threw light upon the unconscious motive of the cheerers . " Toward the conclusion of the fe4st , " Mr. Jay relates , " I was asked for a toast . I gave a neutral one , namely , A safe and honorable peace to all the belligerent powers . ' You can not conceive how coldly it was received ; and though civility induced them to give it three cheers , yet they were so faint and single , as most decidedly to show that peace was not the thing they wished . These were merchants . " If Mr. Jay had desired to hear thunders of applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have given , War eternal , and British bottoms forever ! The treaty was received in the United States with what must have seemed , at the time , universal execration . Even Hamilton , though he favored ratification , pronounced it , and justly pronounced it , " execrable " ; nor was he The Presidential campaign of 1796. // entirely wrong in saying that Mr. Jay was " an old woman for making it . " It was because Mr. Jay possessed some of the traits which we revere in our grandmothers , that he was able to make the treaty . Posterity 's verdict on this matter is one in which each successive student of the period will finally acquiesce : That a President of the United States has seldom done an act more difficult , more wise , or more right than the ratification of the Jay treaty of 1794 , which procured the surrender of the posts , inaugurated the policy that naturally issued in arbitration , made some slight beginnings of reciprocity and free-trade , and postponed inevitable war for eighteen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf was t*tter than no bread , surely it was this . But the agonizing want of the other half of the loaf justifies the opposition . That was the time when collections were still made in churches for the ransom of American mariners in captivity among the Algerines ; when the whole crew of an American vessel was frequently impressed by a J3ritish man-ofwar at out-of-the-way places , like the Barbadoes ; when a neutral vessel had no rights which a " dashing " British captain would aUow to stand between himself and his object ; when a suiy5idon that a schooner containing provisions was bound for a French port often sufficed to condemn her . A search in the old garrets of Salem , Gloucester , Newburyport , New London , or any other old town on the coast , would discover hundred of letters like those given by Mrs. E. Vale Smith in her History of Newburyport . One captain of a schooner writes home , in 1794 , from Martinico : " We are continually insulted and abused by the British . The Commodore says , All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unloaded , stripped , and plundered of everything . Nineteen American sail here have been libelled ; seven of them were lashed together , and drifted ashore , and stove to pieces . " Worse outrages occurred in 1796 , when The Presidential Campaign of 1796 . May , the Republicans were concentrating all their forces upon defeating the appropriation needful for the execution of the Jay treaty . How grand in Washington to ratify it ! How pardonable the execrations that form a great part of the glory of the act ! It was in April , 1796 , that the battle of the treaty was fought in the House of Representatives . The man that saved it was , as tradition reports , Fisher Ames of Massachusetts , whose speech in its defence , delivered to a concourse of people , lived in the memory of that generation as the greatest achievement of eloquence which the American Parliament had yet exhibited . He was just the man to plead for such a treaty ; for he was a conservative by the nature of his mind , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after had already overspread his face with pallor and tinged his mind with gloom . A man so gifted as he was . if in robust and joyous health , might have been brought to vote for the treaty , but he could not have defended it with such warmth and pathos . His appearance , as he rose to speak , was that of a man with one foot in the grave , and his first words gave the impression to the audience that they were assisting at a scene like those in which Chatham , swathed in flannel , had risen in the House of Lords to . speak for the rights of Englishmen violated in America , or to rebuke the employment of savages in a war upon brethren . " I entertain the hope , " he faltered , " perhaps a rash one , that my strength will hold me out to speak a few minutes . " He was not , however , as near death as he looked ; and as he went on , speaking in a peculiar reserved tone , low but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spoke for an hour in a manner which enthralled every hearer . Toward the close occurred the famous tomahawk passage , in which he foretold the consequences to the frontiers of a longer retention of the posts by the English . On reaching this subject , the orator was no longer an inva // lid . He was transfigured . His words seemed fraught with passionate apprehension , and drew tears from the eyes , not of women only , but of judges grown gray on the bench . Such poor sentences as these fell from his lips in tones that disguised their poverty and irrelevancy - " By rejecting the posts , we light the savage fires , we bind the victims . This day we undertake to render account to the wido*vs and orphans whom our decision may make , to the wretches that will be roasted at the stake , to our country , and , I do not deem it too serious to say , to conscience and to God . The voice of humanity issues from the shade of the wilderness . It exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject this treaty , the other grasps a tomahawk . I can fancy that I listen to the yells of savage vengeance , and the shrieks of torture ; already they seem to sigh in the western wind ; already they mingle with every echo from the mountains . This treaty , like a rainbow on the edge of the cloud , marked to our eyes the space where the storm was raging , and afforded at the same time the . sure prognostic of fair weather . If we reject it , the vivid colors will grow pale ; it will be a baleful meteor portending tempest and war . " When by such appeals as these he had wrought upon the feelings and the fears of his auditors , he again , by a stroke of the orator 's art , drew attention to himself . " I have , " said he , " as little personal interest in the event as any one here . There is , I believe , no member who will not think his chance to be a witness of the consequences greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass to reject , and a spirit should arise , as it will , with the public disorders to make confusion worse confounded , even I , slender and almost broken as my hold upon life is , may outlive the government and Constitution of my country . " The last stroke completed the subjugation of his audience . " My God ! " exclaimed Irish Judge Iredell ( of the Supreme Court ) to Vice - President Adams seated at his side , " how great he is ! how great he has been ! " " Noble ! " cried Adams . " Bless my stars ! " broke in the judge , after a pause , " I never heard anything so great since I was born ! " " Divine ! " chimed in the Vice-President . And so they continued their interchange of interjections while the tears rolled down their cheeks . " Not a dry eye in the house , " Mr. Adams reports , " except some of the jackasses who had occasioned the oratory . These attempted to laugh , but their visages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , wished the orator 's soul had a better body . Forty-eight hours after , the treaty was carried by a vote of fiftyone to forty-eight . It is not unlikely that Fisher Ames 's appeal to the apprehensions and sympathies of the House , supported by his artful allusion to the interests involved , may have added the needful votes to the side of the administration . He did not disdain to remind his auditors on this occasion that " profit was every hour becoming capital , " and that " the vast crop of our neutrality was all seed wheat and was sown again to swell almost beyond calculation the future harvest of our prosperity . " He was right there . Seldom has there been a treaty that brought in a larger return of profit , and never one that yielded less honor . Many interests united in the demand for the treaty . It was only the honor and digfflty of the nation that could be sacrificed by accepting it ; and they were only saved by the hard necessity of the case . A hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of necessity to get out ; and on the ist of June , 1796 , when the posts were surrendered , that indispensable preliminary to a fair fight was accomplished . From the airy height of Monticello Jefferson surveyed this troubled scene with the deepest interest . He held the treaty in abhorrence . He thought the honest part of its friends were influenced by an excessive , unreasonable // dread of the power of Great Britain ; and the dishonest , by the vast pecuniary interests involved . He speaks of one person , high in office , who was possessed in turn by a mortal fear of two bugbears , - a British fleet and the Democratical societies . Years after the storm of this controversy had blown over , he still adhered to the opinion that , " by a firm yet just conduct in 1793 , we might have obtained a respect for our neutral rights . " Not being a military man , having , indeed , no military instincts , the recovery of the posts did not strike his mind as a compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country which shared the perils of the situation , but not its *ros*erity ; which bore the shame of a violated flag without deriving profit from the commerce that escaped interruption , he desired ardently the rejection of the treaty . Once , in the heat of the controversy , he declared that General Washington was the only honest man who favored it . Silence , however , became a candidate for the Presidency ; and , though he lent the aid of his experience and knowledge to Madison in private conferences , he uttered not a word designed for the public ear or eye . After the final acceptance of the treaty in April , 1796 , he passed a quiet , pleasant summer in the congenial labors of his farm and garden , and in building his house , never going seven miles from home . To secure the influence of General Washington was one of the objects of both parties . The President could have decided this election by merely letting it be distinctly known which of the two candidates he preferred for his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few months after Jefferson 's return home , in 1794 , Governor Henry Lee of Virginia , a recent convert to Federalism , felt it to be his duty to do a dastardly act : he was constrained by his conscience to report to the President a question which Mr. Jefferson was said to have addressed to a guest at his own house . Lee was not present when this awful question was asked ; but he had received his information from the " very respectable gentleman " of whom Mr. Jefferson had made the inquiry : " Was it*ossible that the President had attached himself to England , and was governed by British influence ? " General Washington , though he stooped to reply to this small infamy , marked his sense of it by immediately ( two days after ) sending an express to invite Jefferson back to his old place in the Cabinet . And now , in the summer of 1796 , we find him writing to Jefferson in the most frank and friendly manner , as of old , though evidently smarting under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wrote , that Mr. Jefferson had represented the President as being too much under Hamilton 's influence . " My answer , " said he , " has invariably been , that I had never discovered anything in the conduct of Mr. Jefferson to raise suspicions in my mind of his insincerity ; that , if he would retrace my public conduct while he was in the administration , abundant proofs would occur to him , that truth and right decisions were the sole objects of my pursuit ; that there were as many instances within his own knowledge of my having decided against as in favor of the opinions of the person evidently alluded to ; and , moreover , that I was no believer in the infallibility of the politics or measures of any man living . " At the same time , he bitterly complained that he should be rewarded for an honest attempt to avert a desolating war , by being assailed " in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero , a notorious defaulter , or even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have hated " filthy Democrats " with all the ardor of a lady of the old school , sent her " best wishes " to the chief Democrat on this occasion . Indeed , nothing like a breach ever occurred between the two families or the two men ; and Jefferson never failed , on any occasion , to the last day of his life , to do justice , not alone to the // integrity of Washington , - which was never questioned , - but to his mind and judgment , which Hamilton underrated , if he did not despise . To Jefferson 's pen we owe the best characterization of Washington which comes down to us from his contemporaries . The strife of parties continued during the summer and autumn of 1796 . The contest was unexpectedly close . The Jay treaty , though the remoter commerce of the young nation was almost created by it , seemed , at first , to the great damage of its friends , only to give new audacity to the dashing British captain . " Three hundred American vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the year following its ratification Such was the statement of the Republican press of the period . Long lists of seizures lie before me , - not three hundred , it is true , nor one hundred , but enough to stir the indignation of those who read the particulars , even at this late day . Nor was the news from France reassuring . Republicans , in 1796 , could point to France , after exhibiting the catalogue of British impressments and captures , and say , with alarming appearance of truth The Jay treaty , which has not conciliated our most dangerous enemy , has alienated our only friend . James Monroe replaced in Paris the brilliant aristocrat , Gouverneur Morris , a few days after the execution of Robespierre had broken the spell of terror . The National Convention received the young Republican with every honor which enthusiasm could suggest . Reiterat4l plaudits greeted his entrance , and followed the reading of a translation of his address . The chairman of the Convention replied in a style of rhetorical flourish that made Monroe 's plain speech seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the President , at length , " should I delay to confirm the friendship of our republics by the fraternal embrace I am directed to give you in the name of the French people ? Come and receive it in the name of the American people ; and may this scene destroy the last hope of the impious band of tyrants ! " Mr. Monroe was then conducted to the President , who , as the Moniteur of the next day reports , " gave the kiss and embrace in the midst of universal acclamations of joy , delight , and admiration . " Republican Paris smiled upon the new minister . He found it not difficult to procure the release of Thomas Paine from the Luxembourg . He wrote consolingly to Paine in his prison , claiming him as an American citizen concerning whose welfare Americans could not be indifferent , and for whom the President cherished a grateful regard . He received the sick and forlorn captive into his house , and entertained him for a year and a half . All went well with Mr. Monroe until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hour to the Convention of i8oo , the relations of the United States with France had but one course , from bad to worse ; French captains , at length , surpassing the English in dashing exploits upon schooners hailing from the American coast . It was for these reasons that the voters were so evenly divided in November , 1796 , between the candidates of the two parties : Adams and Pinckney , Jefferson and Burr . Jefferson had the narrowest escape from being elected to the Presidency : Adams 71 , Jefferson 68 , Pinckney * , Burr 30 , Samuel Adams is , Oliver Ellsworth ii , George Clinton 7 , Jay 5 , Iredell 2 , George Washington 2 , John Henry 2 , Samuel Johnson 2 , C. C. Pinckney i . It was a geographical result . For Adams , the North ; for Jefferson , the South , - except that Jefferson received every Pennsylvania vote but one , and Adams seven from Maryland , one from Virginia , and one from North Carolina . Hamilton might well say , that Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the three votes that elected him were , so to speak , unnatural , eccentric , contrary to all rational expectation , against the current of popular feeling in the States which gave them , namely , Pennsylvania , North Carolina , x873. 555 // and Virginia . According to the Constitution , not then amended , Mr. Jefferson , having received next to the highest number of electoral votes , was elected Vice-President . Deceiyiber was well advanced before he knew the result . His feelings on learning it were fully expressed in a confidential letter to his other political self James Madison . He said the vote had come much nearer an equality than he had expected , and that he was well content with his escape . " As to the first office , " said he , " it was impossible that a more solid unwillingness , settled on full calculation , could have existed in any man 's mind , short of the degree of absolute refusal . The only view on which I would have gone into it for a while was , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be thrown too much to leeward of her true principles . As to the second , it is the only office in the world about which I am unable to decide in my own mind whether I had rather have it or not have it . Pride does not enter into the estimate ; for I think with the Romans , that the general of to-day should be a soldier to-morrow if necessary . I can particularly have no feelings which would revolt at a secondary position to Mr. Adams . I am his junior in life , was his junior in Congress , his junior in the diplomatic line , his junior lately in our civil government . " Nay , more : " If Mr. Adams can be induced to administer the government on its true principles , and to relinquish his bias to an English constitution , it is to be considered whether it would not be on the whole for the public good to come to a good understanding with him as to his future elections . He is , perhaps , the only sure barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of state , he proceeds to discourse upon a parcel of books which Madison had lately sent him . In this letter to Madison he enclosed an open one to Mr. Adams , leaving it to Madison 's discretion to forward or return it . Jefferson 's doubt as to the propriety of sending this letter arose from the awkwardness of professing indifference to public honors . Not one man in five could then believe such professions sincere ; and we see , in all the campaign frenzy of those years , the most unquestioning assumption that Jefferson 's every act and word had but one object , - the Presidency . He desired to say to Mr. Adams how satisfied he was , personally , with the result of the election , and to congratulate him upon the honor his country had done him . " I leave to others , " he wrote , " the sublime delight of riding in the storm , better pleased with sound sleep and a warm berth below , with the society of neighbors , friends , and fellow-laborers of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , will congratulate you with purer disinterestedness than myself . The share , indeed , which I may have had in the late vote , I shall still value highly , as an evidence of the share I have in the esteem of my fellow - citizens . But still , in this point of view , a few votes less would be little sensible ; the difference in the effect of a few more would be very sensible and oppressive to me . I have no ambition to govern men . It is a painful and thankless office . " Upon reflection , Mr. Madison deemed it best not to send this letter . The " ticklish temper " of Mr. Adams , the consideration due to those who had so vehemently contested his election , and the probable future necessity of opposing his measures , induced him to keep the letter till Mr. Jefferson 's arrival at the seat of government . At the same time , Mr. Madison admitted " the duty and policy of cultivating Mr. Adams 's favorable disposition and giving a fair start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this long contest was known , an imaginative paragraphist evolved the report , that Mr. Jefferson would not deign to accept the second office . The rumor rapidly spread itself over the country . Madison wrote to Monticello , suggesting that the best way to dispel so absurd an imputation was for . Mr. Jeffer // son to come to Philadelphia and be publicly sworn in on the 4th of March . It was one of the " cold winters " of the century . On the very day upon which Madison wrote this letter , the shivering lord of Monticello , in the course of a long meteorological letter to Volney ( in exile at Philadelphia ) used these words " It is at this moment so cold , that the ink freezes in my pen , so that my letter will scarcely be legible . " It is to be feared that the remodelled mansion was not yet weather-proof . For so healthy a man , Jefferson was curiously susceptible of cold , and he once wrote that he had suffered during his life more from cold than from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , as he told Madison , to appear in Philadelphia on the day of the inauguration , " as a mark of respect for the public , and to do away with the doubts which have spread that I should consider the second office as beneath my acceptance . " The journey , however , he owned , was " a tremendous undertaking for one who had not been seven miles from home since his resettlement . " Jefferson 's aversion to ceremonial was manifested on this occasion . It was an article of his political creed , that political office stood upon the same footing as any other respectable vocation , and entitled the holder to no special consideration ; no respect except that which justly rewards fidelity to any important trust ; no etiquette except such as that very fidelity necessitates ; no privileges except those legaIly to facilitate the discharo'e given of public duty . Holding this opinion , he wrote to Mr. Tazewell of the Senate , asking him to prevent the sending of a costly and imposing embassy to notify him of his election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were first elected . Better drop a letter into the post-office , said he in substance ; it is the simplest , quickest , and surest way . He begged Madison , also , to discourage anything that might be proposed in the way of a public reception at Philadelphia . " If Gover. nor Muffin " ( of Pennsylvania , a pronounced Republican ) " should show any symptoms of ceremony , pray contrive to parry them . " When John Howard was appointed high-sheriff of his county , he conceived the novel idea of inquiring what duties were attached to the office . The duties of a high-sheriff , he was informed , were to ride into town on court days in a gilt coach , entertain the judges at dinner , and give an annual county ball . But Howard pushed his eccentricity so far as to look into the law-books , to see if there might not be something else required at the hands of a high-sheriff . There was : he was to inspect the jail He inspected the jail ; and his inspection had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt ; he smelt ; he tasted ; he weighed ; he measured ; he questioned . The reformation of the jails of Christendom dates from that incongruous act . So Jefferson , soon after his election to an office that made him chairman of the Senate , awoke to the fact that he was , from twelve years ' disuse , " entirely rusty in the parliamentary rciles of procedure . " He had once been well versed in those rules . Among the many curious relics of his tireless , minute industry which have been preserved to this day , is a small , well - worn , leather-bound manuscript volume of one hundred and five pages , entitled Parliamentary Pocket-Book , begun by him when he was a young lawyer , expecting soon to be a member of the parliament of Virginia . This work , which contained the substance of ancient parliamentary law and usage , he now fished from its hiding-place , and upon it , as a basis , he gradually constructed his Manual of Parliamentary Practice , which still governs our deliberative bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aided by the learning and experience of his ancient master in the law , George Wythe , he left it in manuscript to the Senate , as the standard by which he " had judged and was willing to be judged . " i873. 557 // The opening paragraph betrays the habit of his mind and shows from what quarter he habitually expected danger : " Mr. Onslow , the ablest among the speakers of the House of Commons , used to say , It was a maxim he had often heard , when he was a young man , from old and experienced members , that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of administration and those who acted with a majority of the House of Commons , than a neglect of or departure from the rules of proceeding ; that these forms , as instituted by our ancestors , operated as a check and control on the actions of the majority ; and that they were , in many instances , a shelter and protection to the minority against the attempts of power . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compact with the brief results of wide research . This sentence startles one who now turns over its pages : " WHEN THE PRIVATE INTERESTS OF A MEMBER ARE CONCERNED IN A BILL OR QUESTION , HE IS TO WITHDRAW ! " In 1797 , it was still ten days ' ride from Monticello to Philadelphia . When Mr. Jefferson 's man , Jupiter , drove his chaise round to the door on the 20th of February , the master did not forget that a few weeks before he had been elected president of the Philosophical Society ; and , accordingly , he placed in the carriage some bones of the mastodon , lately come into his possession , the size of which had filled him with special wonder . With the Parliamentary Pocket-Book in his trunk and these bones under the seat , he was well set up in both his characters . From Alexandria he took the public coach , and sent his own vehicle home ; not omitting to record in his diary that the stage fare from Alexandria to Philadelphia was $ I 1.75 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud . Mr. Madison did not succeed in parrying the symptoms of ceremony ; for we read in a Philadelphia newspaper of the time , that , on Thursday , the 2d of March , " the company of artillery welcomed that tried patriot , Thomas Jefferson , with a discharge of sixteen rounds from two twelve-pounders , and a flag was displayed from the lark of artillery bearing the device , Jefferson , the Friend of the People . ' " The inauguration of a new President , like the accession of a young prince to a throne , is naturally a time of joyous excitement ; but the present occasion was clouded with apprehension . Every newspaper of those early weeks of 1797 , which contained news from abroad , had from one to a dozen items like this : " The ship Eliza , on her passage from Liverpool to New York , sprang a leak , and was obliged to bear away to the West Indies . In sight of Martinico she was taken by a French privateer and run ashore , where she was totally wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released without trial . " This , from the only power in the world which could be regarded as the natural ally of the United States ! This from the native land of Lafayette ! And now the great character which had stood between contending parties , himself no partisan , was to withdraw from the scene , leaving the crisis to be dealt with by men untried in the responsibilities of government . Good citizens might well be anxious for their country . On reaching Philadelphia , Jefferson went at once to pay his respects to Mr. Adams , who , the next morning , returned the call , and started immediately the topic that was upon every man 's mind and tongue , - the danger of a rupture with France . The President elect said that he was impressed with the necessity of sending an embassy to that country . The first wish of his heart would have been to intrust the mission to Jefferson ; but he supposed that waS out of the question , as it did not seem justifiable for a President to send away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident to himself , nor decent to remove from competition one who was a rival for the public favor . He had resolved , he said , to send an imposing embassy of three dis // tinguished persons , - Elbridge Gerry from New England , from Virginia James Madison , from South Carolina C. C. Pinckney . The dignity of the mission , he thought , would satisfy France , and its selection from the three great divisions of the country would satisfy the people of the United States . Mr. Jefferson agreed with the President elect as to the impropriety of his leaving the post assigned him by the people , and consented to make known his wishes to Madison . Mr. Adams was all candor and cordiality on this occasion . In the elation of the hour , he evidently regarded Mr. Jefferson as a colleague with whom it was but natural for him to consult . In his swelling moments during these first days of his elevation , he liked to compare Jefferson 's position in the country with that of prince royal or heir-apparent to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent on any mission . On the last day of Washington 's term , Jefferson was one of the guests at the dinner given by the President to the conspicuous persons of the capital with whom he had been officially connected . It was a merry dinner ; for , on this occasion , he who was to lay down the burden of power was happier than they who were to take it up . On Saturday , the 4th of March , occurred the memorable scenes of the inauguration so often described . At eleven , Mr. Jefferson , in the Senate chamber , was sworn into office , assumed the chair , and delivered the usual brief address . He concluded with a cordial tribute to Mr. Adams : " No one more sincerely prays that no accident may call me to the higher and more important functions which the Constitution eventually devolves on this office . These have been justly confided to the eminent character which has preceded me here , whose talents and integrity have been known and revered by me through a long course of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninterrupted friendship between us ; and I devoutly pray he may be long preserved for the gov 559 eminent , the happiness , and prosperity of our common country . " The Senate , with Mr. Jefferson at their head , then proceeded to the Representatives ' Hall , where Mr. Adams took the oath , and delivered his robust inaugural , so worthy of him and of the occasion , so little appreciated by the party leaders who were to deceive , mislead , and destroy him . General Washington 's fine sense of propriety was shown on this occasion in a trifling incident that caught every eye and dwelt in many memories . After Mr. Adams had left the chamber , the General and Mr. Jefferson rose at the same moment to follow him , and Mr. Jefferson , of course , stood aside to let the ex-President take the lead in leaving the chamber . But the private citizen pointedly refused to accept the precedence over the Vice-President . Mr. Jefferson was obliged to go first . That afternoon there was a mighty banquet given in honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attended by the President , the Vice-President , members of Congress , the Cabinet , the foreign ministers , and a great company of noted citizens . The circus was converted into a banqueting-hall , to which the company marched , two and two , from the great tavern of the day . The toast given by Jefferson was very significant to the men of that time , little as it conveys to us : " Eternal union of sentiment between the commerce and agriculture of our country . " Benevolent readers will be pleased to learn that , in accordance with a kindly custom of the period , " the remains of this festival were given to the prisoners in the jail and the sick in the hospital , that the unfortunate and afflicted might also rejoice . Sunday passed . If we may judge from the vituperation of after-years , Mr. Jefferson took the liberty of attending the Unitarian chapel , where Dr .. Priestley might then be occasionally heard , instead of exhibiting himself at Christ Church , which had been more politic . On Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they chanced to leave at the same moment , they walked together until their ways diverged , and Mr. Jefferson seized the opportunity to inform the President that Madison declined the French mission . The topic had evidently become an embarrassing one to the President . Objections , he said , in his honest , tactless manner , had been made to the nomination of Mr. Madison ; and he continued o stammer excuses till the welcome corner of Market Street and Fifth Street gave him an undeniable excuse for breaking off the conversation . Mr. Adams never again consulted the Vice-President on a political measure . They exchanged punctually the civilities which their situations and their ancient friendship demanded but never again did they converse on a measure of the administration . Mr. Jefferson , as he strolled along Fifth Street in the silence and solitude of a Philadelphia evening , mused upon the cause of the sudden change in the President 's tone on the subject of the French mission . He arrived at a probable solution of the mystery : Mr. Adams had met the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France ! What a proposition to make to a knot of Federalists , sore and hot from the strife of 1796 !
