MANY letters have come to me during the last few years asking what seems to me a very strange question-How to read Shakespeare . My answer would naturally be : the way to read Shakespeare is  --  to read him . The rest follows as matter of course . If you read anywhere , you will know a new delight ; you will read more ; you will go on ; in your eager reading you will consume the book . Having read all , you will read again , and now will begin to ponder , and compare , and analyze , and seek to fathom ; and having got thus far , you will have found an occupation which lights with pleasure the whole of your leisure life . This seems to me to be the natural way of reading Shakespeare . It is the way in which I have found that most of the truest lovers of Shakespeare came to know him , to delight in him , and finally to wait upon him with a kind of intellectual worship . It is hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without intelligence and education , and who read , who have not read Shakespeare , or who having read a little of him do not read more . But there are such men ; and there are still many more such women . On the whole I am inclined to think that Shakespeare is not a woman 's poet . He deals too largely with life ; he handies the very elements of human nature ; he has a great fancy , but is not fanciful ; his imagination moulds the essential and the central rather than the external ; he is rarely sentimental , never except in his youngest work . Women , with the exception of a few who are not always the most lovable or the happiest *f the sex , like something upon a lower plane , something that appeals more directly to them , because it was written to appeal directly to some one else ( for in literature that which is directed to one point always keeps its aim ) ; they like the personal , the external ; that which seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason the sex as a whole looks upon Trollope as the greatest novelist that ever lived . It is chiefly by pleasing women that he has made his fortune . Shakespeare 's humor , which is equalled by no other , but most nearly approached by Sir Walter Scott 's when he is in his happiest moods , is appreciated by still fewer women than the number who find pleasure in his poetry and in his dramatic creativeness . They receive it in rather a dazed fashion , and do n't know exactly what it means . All this , just as they would rather look at a woman of the first fashion in one of Worth 's dresses than at the Venus of Melos or her of Medici . Then there are people who read Shakespeare as an elder acquaintance of my boy years read him . He asked me if I would lend him my Shakespeare . Stripling as I was , I thought it a strange thing for a fellow who lived in a big , handsome house to borrow ; but I lent it of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , with the remark that he " liked it very much , " which I heard with mingled amusement and amazement . Yet he was an intelligent young man , did well in life , and in one department of sesthetics developed " quite a taste . " Perhaps if he had had some advice about reading Shakespeare he would not have returned the volume of his entire works after thirty.six hours ' possession , with just that expression of approval . Most of those who have asked this advice are , I am inclined to think , very young , as indeed some of them say they are , and a large proportion are plainly girls just beginning to feel their way in literature , and they ask , in the words of one of them , " How shall I begin ? // and which plays shall I read first , so as to be sure to like them and their author ? " Such uncertainty , I must confess , does not promise any genuine strong taste for Shakespeare . Boys are of slower intellectual development than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no boy who is a born Shakespeare lover needs to ask such a question as that at sixteen . He has then already stepped in too far to pick his way or to turn back . In beginning to read Shakespeare the first rule  --  and it is absolute and without exception  --  a rare rule indeed , like him to whose writings it is applied-is to read him only . Throw the commentators and the editors to the dogs . Do n't read any man 's notes , or essays , or introductions , bibliographical , historical , philosophical , or philologicaL Do n't read mine . Read the plays themselves . Be absolutely unconcerned what is their origin , what the date of their production , or what the condition of their text . Do n't attempt criticism , either aesthetic or verbal ; above all keep your mind entirely free from the influence of what this or that eminent critic has said about them . Read it first chiefly for the story ; that is , for the dramatic development and interest of the plot . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that it takes hold of you at once . But do n't hurry through a play as you would through a society novel , skipping the unessential , or what seems to you to be so . Do n't skip anything ; even the briefest scene or the most trivial speech of the most unimportant personage . Shakespeare flung abroad his wealth ; for his hand was full . The lips of his very peasants and beggars drop jewels , like those of the girl in the fairy tale . But until you have mastered the story , and have a clear and strong apprehension of the dramatic relations of the personages , do not stop any longer than you must to admire even the matchless beauty of his utterance . There is time enough for that . That is a pleasure that will last your whole life , and grow greater as you grow older . Look at the men and women that he sets before you , and see the way of their moral and mental growth , and the way that they work upon each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they do . After you have read all the plays in this way , with a few exceptions which I shall point out , you may then begin to study Shakespeare as a poet , and with the help of critics to observe his use of language-that which is peculiar to him and that which is peculiar to his time ; to inquire into the allusions that he makes to subjects which are new to you because they are old ; to examine the construction of his plays , and the manner in which they were developed from the tales , the chronicles , and the older plays upon which they are founded . In a word , you may then enter upon the critical study of Shakespeare , for which of course a critical edition is necessary . But first , and above all , begin by reading him , pure and simple , and in an humble and receptive spirit . When you meet with anything , either in language or in the action of the personages , that you do not understand , or which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonce at least , that Shakespeare , or even his editors , may be right and you wrong ; do not waste much time in beating your head against the difficulty , but leave it as a subject for future consideration , and go on with the play . The plays which you would do well to pass over in your first reading are , " Titus Andronicus , " " Pericles , " " King Henry VI. , " and perhaps " Love 's Labor 's Lost . " The reasons for the omission of these plays from your acquaintance-making with Shakespeare are : that " Titus Andronicus " is a horrible , coarse , and rudely constructed tragedy , filled with bombastic language and bloody deeds  --  a play with which Shakespeare had very little to do , it being chiefly the work of Christopher Marlowe , and probably Robert Greene , two playwrights contemporary with Shakespeare , with // whom he worked more or less in the beginning of his theatrical life ; that " Pericles , " although it is rich , particularly in the later acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not planned by him , and was written by him only in part , and can not be read as an example of his dramatic characterization , or with much pleasure by a novice in Shakespeare reading , because of its very unskilful construction and repulsive , puerile story ; that " King Henry VI . " is open to exceptions of the same kind as to authorship , the particulars of which need not be given here ; and that " Love 's Labor 's Lost , " although it is Shakespeare 's beyond question , and his probably without the interpolation of a single line by another playwright , lacks dramatic interest , is very artificial ( as opposed to natural ) in its construction and its dialogue , and is full of cold conceits and of personages more like dramatic puppets than those which appear in any other of Shakespeare 's undoubted works . The reason of this is that it is his first play ; an almost boyish production . And yet his worthy reader will find in it not only signs and tokens of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom , and of humor , which could have come from no other hand . Its chief lack , regarded even as a youthful work , is , considering who wrote it , imagination . Of knowledge of human nature it displays a remarkable store in one so young as its author was . The reading of it ought not to check the enthusiasm of a true Shakespeare lover at any period of his pupilage . At what time of life this reading of Shakespeare may be begun with profit and with pleasure , it is hard to say . One thing is sure : it is never too late to begin , and however late , always begin in just this way . The young reader may begin Shakespeare reading at the first temptation to do so . A onevolume edition of Shakespeare 's plays is a good book to leave in the way of young people . It may do them a great deal of good ; it can do no one of them any harm . There is no art or mystery in reading Shakespeare . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to come by nature ; for if it come not in that way , look for it in no other . I have said that most boys who are Shakespeare lovers have the love strongly upon them before they are sixteen . Such I know was my own case . I was not fifteen when , to my father asking , as he saw my delight in my hand , which of Shakespeare 's plays I liked best , I answered , " King Lear " ; surprising him , as I found , for he had supposed that I would say " Romeo and Juliet . " But I had been brought up on the Bible , which I had read until even at this day I know it better than I know any other book , and this with the " Pilgrim 's Progress " and the Waverley novels , both of which I read over and over again , had made poor books distasteful to me , and awakened in me a greed for the good , for which good fortune of my boyhood I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning an acquaintance with Shakespeare on the ground of youth , or through fear of not understanding him . True , all young people will find much in his pages that they can not fully comprehend , and some things that they may not quite apprehend ; but so will old people ; there is always some new revelation to be received from Shakespeare . So I was told in my youth by old people who had loved and read him from youth to age ; and so I have found myself as years have gone by . As to the play with which it is best for a young reader of Shakespeare to begin , I should not hesitate to say that the first play in most editions , " The Tempest , " is as good as any , although it is among the last productions of his latest years as a dramatic author . Its charming story , its striking and clear characterization , its simple construction , and its exquisite although not involved or too finely wrought poetry , make it a creation that no one capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with // delight . If not this , " As You Like It " might first be taken up ; then " The Merchant of Venice " and " Much Ado about Nothing . " To these " Romeo and Juliet " might well succeed , after which a return to the comedies would be advisable , among which the reader could not now well go astray , except that I should recommend that " All 's Well that Ends Well , " " The Winter 's Tale , " and " Measure for Measure " should be left until the last , and indeed until the reader shall have made further acquaintance with the tragedies , and read at least two of the histories  --  the First and Second Parts of " King Henry IV . " To these it would be well to pass from " The Merry Wives of Windsor , " because of Falstaff , whose humor appears in its lowest ( yet high ) form in " The Merry Wives , " and in its highest in the " Second Part of Henry IV . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should advise that the Roman and Grecian plays should be left until the last , " Troilus and Cressida " being read last of all , not because of any superiority , although it is one of Shakespeare 's greatest works , but because of a peculiarity which I shall speak of further on . The plays ( with the exceptions named ) having been read in this way once ( but two or three times would be better ) , the Shakespeare lover will wish to know them more intimately , to study their language , to understand their construction , to fathom their thought and their feeling . But before doing this he should read the poems , remembering that " Venus and Adonis " is a very youthful production , and not in Shakespeare 's manner , but in the manner of the time , and that " Lucrece , " although freer in style , is open to the same criticism . One reading will suffice for these . The Sonnets are of an altogether different cast . Whatever was their occasion , they came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and not read them again and again , borne on and up by their strong flow of feeling , lost in thefascinating mystery of their allusions , has not the root of the matter in him , and may as well attempt to see no further into Shakespeare than a very little way below the surface . This done , in the more thoughtful rereading of the plays it will be well to take a course which follows the development of Shakespeare 's mind , reading his plays in the order of their production , so far at least as that has been discovered with reasonable probability . For we know so little about Shakespeare that even the order in which he wrote his plays must be determined* by inference from internal and ( very little ) external evidence . It is as a guide to such a course that the following remarks upon the plays are offered . The reader who , having mastered and enjoyed the whole of the plays , although only in outline as it were , returns to " Love 's Labor 's Lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , will see one of the most striking examples in all literature of the difference that exists between mature and immature genius even of the highest order . The whole play is stiff and raw ( remember that we are standing upon the Shakespearian plane ) ; its personages show germs of character or imperfect outlines , rather than character ; they are book-made , and , like most very youthful work , show reminiscence with little of that modification and enrichment by which greatly gifted minds , imparting their gifts , render reminiscences their own. * The play is constructed upon a fantastic conceit , and indeed , with " The Comedy of Errors " and " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , " belongs to the region of pure fantasy . The first and last of these three plays are almost like glorified fairy pieces or masks ; the " Errors " being like a glorified burlesque . He doubtless formed it in a measure upon the model of the court comedies of his elder contemporary John Lilly , the author of " Eu * In the Introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this view and what follows are more particularly set forth . // phues , " a very clever book , little read , less understood , and therefore much misrepresented . But fantastic and jejune as the play is , observe in the drawing of Borowne and Rosaline , stiff and formal although it is , like one of Raphael 's early Perugine Nadonnas , tokens of the hand which afterward drew Benedick and Beatrice with such freedom and such strength . Note the worldly wisdom which appears in this work of a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four ; of which I can take room to cite only three so well known because surprisingly sagacious lines : A jest ' 8 prosperity lies In the eaz* Of him that hears it , never in the tongue Of him that makes It . But remark chiefly the wisdom with which Rosaline disciplines Berowne , almost " chastising him with the valor of her tongue . " She preaches at him too much , it is true ; but none the less it is great sermonizing to come from a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the remarkable distinction of being the only one which contains a passage in praise of woman  --  a theme upon which other poets have been so copious . Shakespeare 's women are far beyond the creative power of other poets and dramatists ; but only in this play does he speak in praise of the sex , and that with no very exalted feeling , so that it does not amount to praise of women in the abstract . This neglect to pay tribute of praise to the sex , and the fact that passages of an opposite bearing may be found in Shakespeare 's works , can not be without significance ; and I attribute it to his ill fortune in his wife and afterward in his mistress-that beautiful dark woman whose infidelity to him with his best friend he reproaches so bitterly in the Sonnets . For that the more important of those Sonnets were not written as an expression of personal feeling is to me improbable to the verge of incredibility . The next play of this little group , " The Comedy of Errors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the likeness of two twin masters and two twin servants who have been separated since childhood . It is an imitation of Plautus 's " Men*chmi , " which Shakespeare took as a mere playwright , and worked it over into something that would please his audience and bring money to his theatre , which , it should be constantly remembered , was his only purpose in writing his plays . They became what they are simply because he was born with the gift of writing them . If he wrote at all , it was as easy for him to write as he did as to write in any other way . It was thus that he saw man , and men , and nature ; it was thus that he thought of them ; and thus seeing and thus thinking , fortune , happily for the world and for him , decreed that he should become an actor , a theatrical proprietor , and a writer of plays . That is the whole story . In this " Errors " the thought is of lighter weight than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Love 's Labor 's Lost " or " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " Naturally it is so from the character of the plot , which is not only , like those of the two others , impossible in reality , although supposable , but merely farcical rather than fanciful . It is a burlesque of the supposable impossible . Yet observe how , notwithstanding this , in the serious passages which merely serve as a stable framework for the fantastic fun , a knowledge of human nature crops out as it had done in no other play written before by a modern dramatist . Here is Shakespeare 's first exhibition of jealousy , and it is the woman who is jealous . And indeed women only are truly jealous . To this rule for men the exceptions are very rare ; sexual jealousy being essentially a feminine passion . This we shall see when we come to consider the cases of Othello , Claudio , and Leontes . Adriana , being jealous of her husbandthat is , suspicious that she has not his love , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to her sister : // I can not nor I will not hold me still . My tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will . lie Is deformed , crooked , old , and ears , ill-faced , worse-bodied , shapeless everywhere ; Vicious , ungeutle , foolish , blunt , unkind , Stigmatical in making , worse in mind . To which the sister thus unanswerably replica : Who wouldbe jealous then of such a one ? No evil lost is wail 'd when it is gone . Then comes the fine feminine touch : Ah 1 but I hold him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse . Far from her nerd the lapwing cries away : My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse . Woman is very concretely faithless in this matter , and will slander , some times to her rival , the very man she dotes upon , in hopes that thereby she may keep him to herself . The passage just quoted is very rude work for Shakespeare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he in his later plays deploys any passion , particularly on the part of a woman . But nevertheless , as a whole this is a revelation of natural feeling in speech superior to anything of the kind written before by a dramatist in any modern language . And afterward the abbess of a convent in which Antipholus takes sanctuary , he being supposed to be mad , talks with Adriana about her treatment of her husband ; tells her that she did not reprehend him enough for his wanderings , or at least not roughly enough , or only in private , and again , not enough ; by which she craftily leads Adriana to this strong plea of sell-justification : It was the copy of our conference . In bed he slept not for my urging it ; At board he fed not for my urging it ; Alone It was the subject of my theme ; In company I often glanc 'd at it ; Still I did tell him he was vile and bed . Whereupon the Abbess , having ingeniously got at the truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came It that the man was mad . The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poison more deadly than a mad dog 's tooth , etc . Nothing like this had been written in a modern play , and we might almost safely say in modern ) . iterat4re .. And Shakespeare , when he wrote this WIS only about twenty-six years old . True , he married when he was but eighteen a woman eight years older than himself , and lived with her some three *r four years before he escaped to London , where he lived , not with her , until he was about forty-eight . " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , " although in the same category with the two plays already remarked upon , shows a great advance upon them , and in my opinion was written , or at least completed , some three or four years later than either . Because it belongs to the same fanciful or fantastical school in its construction , some critics have inferred that the three were written in close succession . This , however , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a playwright , if not of a poet . Must we assume that Shakespeare adhered to one method so strictly , and exchanged his style so suddenly and so absolutety that there was a violent and visible rupture , and that he wrote nothing in his fanciful style after a certain year , and nothing in another school before it ? Is it not rather according to the common course of intellectual development that such changes should be somewhat gradual ? Certainly great painters and poets , great masters of all arts , have not unfrequently reverted , to a certain degree at least , to a former manner before they abandoned it entirely . This course of events is intellectual growth ; the former would be intellectual transmutation . " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " may have been one of its author 's earliest dramatic conceptions , but in its execution it shows , both in thought and in structure , and no less in poetical form , a marked mental development in the author of " Love 's Labor 's Lost " and the " Errors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in structure entirely Shakespeare 's . No prototype of it is known either in drama or in story . And it is in these respects of very much higher quality than either of the othus . Like them , indeed , it is fantastical and // impossible ; but unlike them , it has a real human interest , while its satire is that of a man who has had opportunities of studying his fellow men widely as well as closely , and its poetry is very far beyond theirs in beauty both of form and of spirit . For the first time we have here a personage whose character has made him an accepted type . The conceited , pretentious man of some ability , who is yet an ass , has in iNick Bottom his earliest and also his most admirable representative in literature . On the other hand , we have in this comedy the first manifestation of its author 's exquisite fancy , and of his ability to clothe his fancies in phrases of delicious beauty , the sweetness of which never palls upon ear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest example in poetry of fancy pushed to the verge of extravagance , and yet kept within the limits of good taste . But although the most admirable pas* sage of its kind in the comedy , it is only one of many of that kind . Two or three lines of it are very familiar ; but its highest beauty is in the sustained grace and elevation of the whole ; and for that reason , and for another important one , I quote the whole : Oberom. - Thou rememberest , Since first I sat upon a promontory , And heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back littering such dulcet and harmouious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song , And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid 's music ? Pack. - I remember . Oleron. - That very time! saw , but thou couldst not , Flying between the cold moon and the earth , Cupid all arm 'd . A certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west , And loos 'd his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred thousand hearts . But I might see young Cupid 's fiery shaft Q*iench 'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon ; And the imperial votaress passed on , In maiden meditation , fancy-free . The last line is the most beautiful example in all literature of the beauty of alliteration  --  a trait of style which may become , and generally does become , pestilent . But turning for the m*mient from this passage , the beauty of which is of a kind that appears in a marked degree in no earlier play of Shakespeare 's , and indicates a rapid development of high poetic faculty , I direct the reader 's attention to another manifestation of mental growththat poetical sententiousness which is so peculiar a trait of Shakespeare ; that faculty of welding together truth , wisdom , and fancy in such a closely wrought unity that they are essentially one , and that it is impossible even to distinguish the one from the other . Such , for example , is the passage upon imagination , with its fine distinction between apprehension and comprehension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a long step in advance of anything of its kind that Shakespeare has attained before . And thus the whole play , although as a whole it bears the marks of youth  --  the youth of Shakespeareand although it belongs to the class in which fancy predominates , and the fantastic-impossible is the groundwork of the action , and the depths of man 's nature are left unsounded , rises into the upper , although not the topmost , heaven of dramatic poetry , and is the first of the works of its author which lift him into a place which others only approach . The observant reader of these three comedies ( whom I suppose to have made himself generally acquainted with the whole of the plays ) will be struck by the form of their poetry . They contain a great deal of rhyming verse . This is an outward and visible sign of Shakespeare 's youthful work ; a sign which , taken in connection with his tone of feeling and his cast of thought , enables us to classify his plays according to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his taste purified itself , and his hand acquired dramatic power and freedom , he cast off the fetters of rhyme , so that oven in the plays of his second or middle period it rarely clogs the dramatic utterance of his personages . But there is another external indication of poetical progress , even in these three // early plays . The blank verse changes in character . Read the passage quoted above from " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " with careful attention to its structure , and mark its easy flow . See how the pauses are varied , how the course of the thought and of the rhythm is carried on beyond the end of a line to find a pause or a half pause in the body of the next line . See how the answer of Puck completes a verse left incomplete by Oberon . There is no blank verse of corresponding variety and beauty in " Love 's Labor 's Lost " or in the " Errors . " In them the pauses and the ends of the verses almost always coincide ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I have already remarked , is another trait of Shakespeare 's poetical growth . The change in the rhythm of his blank verse is one of the guides to the period of the production of his several plays ; one which we can not trust absolutely , and which indeed has itself to be studied and determined in connection with facts which establish or at least limit the dates of production , but which , when once we have thus got upon its trail , rarely fails to lead us aright . About the same time that Shakespeare wrote these three plays he entered upon another dramatic fieldthat of the comedy of society-and produced " The Two Gentlemen of Verona , " which should be taken up next by the reader who wishes to follow the course of his dramatic and poetic development . Whether it was written before or after the time when " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " was completed and produced , we can not , I think , be sure . I am inclined to the opinion that the latter , as we hiz*ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Gentlemen of Verona , " which , although of a higher sort , is much inferior in point of art to the former . It is one of the weakest of Shakespeare 's plays ; but yet it is a better comedy in every respect than had been written before . It has some charming passages and some fine touches of pure Shakespearian humor . But it lacks thoughtfulness ( for him ) ; it is unfinished , feeble in characterization , and improbable and almost offensive in some of its incidents . The lovers , except sweet Julia , do not seem to be thoroughly in earnest , or to be touched with the fine fire of that passion as it is generally exhibited by Shakespeare . It shows that Shakespeare had not freed himself from the influence of the prose romancers of his early day , in whose tedious and unnatural tales such incidents as Silvia 's giving the rejected Proteus her picture , Valentine 's giving up Silvia to Proteus , and Proteus offering violence to Sylvia , are not uncommon . It has rhymed dialogue ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best blank verse of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " Still it is the first comedy of society in our literature which is at all tolerable as a representation of the daily intercourse of real human beings . It is to be remarked that in no department of the drama , comedy , history , tragedy , is there extant any play earlier than Shakespeare which is even acceptable as a whole because of its intrinsic value . And this not because we are so dazzled by the splendor of his genius that we are blinded to the lesser lights that rose upon the world before him , but because they failed entirely to do what he did supremely . lie was really first as well as greatest . From these comedies the reader would do well to turn to the earliest historical plays , which were produced about the same time with them , or soon after , and which will next engage our attention .
