VOICES OF POWER . To every one who considers the matter , it must be evident that the voices of power are numerous . The novelist , the essayist , the critic , the orator , the singer , the poet , the merchant , the financier , has each his organ . But there are some sources of influence which all acknowledge , partly because they are established , partly because they are prominent , partly because they are universally popular . One or two of these will here be touched on . There is a current impression that the days of pulpit influence are numbered ; that preaching is out of date ; that the Sunday orator has had his time , - a most important and influential time , it is admittcd , but still a period that is ended , to be succeeded in the future by a new dispensation , in which the spoken word will be less and less indispensable to human needs . It is the fashion in some quarters to speak of pulpit oratory in terms of criticism , disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are told of the small number of churches as compared with the population of the cities , of the relatively thin attendance , of the listless audiences , of the lowered standard of refinement on the part of hearers , of the diminished spiritual force of speakers , of the declining tendency to confess authority in doctrinal affairs ; and the intimation is freely given out - supported sometimes by argument , sometimes by facts , not seldom by sarcasm - that the whistling of idle wind and the creaking of officious pulleys have taken the place of the once trumpet-toned gospel . For this belief there are good reasons , - better than can be expressed in the form of statistics . It is very true that other agencies have to a great extent supplanted the pulpit and taken away a large portion of its ancient office . The preacher is no longer the educated man of the community , the instructor in science , philosophy , literature . He is not , of necessity , the best scholar , the most accomplished writer , the deepest thinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole advantage ef academic training . In a period quite within the recollection of living men there were few books , no magazines or cheap papers . Public libraries were almost unknown , - wholly inaccessible to the multitude . There was scarcely any literature , or wide-spread knowledge . The clergyman 's collection of printed volumes was mainly theological . He alone propounded questions , and gave answers to them . He alone was acquainted with prevalent thoughts . Learning was expensive , and hard to get outside of great universities , where the minister was educated . The day is not so very far distant in the past when it was a matter of personal distinction as well as of professional necessity to accumulate wisdom . Clergymen were thus educated to speak , - the only people who were well qualified to express an opinion , not on subjects of religion only , but on topics of society and politics as well . They were the oracles of the period , the educated and richly furnished minds , the possessors of the science and sagacity of their age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are multiplied ; magazines are cheap ; newspapers are published by the myriad ; people read as they run ; information , knowledge , intellectual stimulus , may be had in large measure outside of churches , - more readily outside than inside . Moreover , there is the institution of the popular lecturer . Here is a speaker who travels over the country , drawing audiences from all classes , dealing with secular themes , and mingling wit with wisdom according to ability . He does // not appeal to authority ; he does not resort to tradition . He aims at instruction ; but his chief object is entertainmnent , and the combination is found attractive to the common ear . The favorite lecturer is , in many instances , a preacher , who lays by the solemnity of the pulpit manner , and thus helps to undermine his profession while seeming to extend its influence : for the arts by which he attracts and holds his auditors are thoroughly popular ; he addresses the average intelligence , and he assumes as the ultimate criterion of excellence the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a lay preacher ; and.if he is an eloquent man , as he often is , his platform takes precedence of the pulpit , his words are listened to with delight , and his method gradually affects the treatment of religious themes , until the very essence of religious thought is qualified , and the sermon is deprived of its peculiar character . In a word , it ceases to be a sermon , and becomes an address . There is a substantial difference between the two modes of speech . It must not be forgotten that , under one or another form , the preacher assumes the fact of divine revelation either as truth directly imparted , or as a spiritual instinct , or as a philosophy of intuition that pledges the recipient to certain cardinal beliefs of the soul . But criticism throws doubt on the existence of outward communications of knowledge , philosophy discredits intuitive presentiments , and skepticism cavils at the notion of an implanted instinct . The age resents dictation , in an era of magazines and newspapers and journals and reports , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face with each other , and talk things over on rational principles ; requiring knowledge ; demanding that problems shall be considered on their merits , that speech shall be frank and precise , that mystery shall be discarded , and dogmatism condemned , and preaching set at naught , and feeling subordinated to argument , there is impat:ence of pretension , restiveness under authority , a disposition to break away from tradition . The preacher relies on formulated ideas ; he claims to speak the absolute truth , to bring a message from the holy Spirit . The assumption is now somewhat attenuated , but it is very old . The hebrew prophet , who better than any other corresponds to the modern preacher , arrogated to himself the right to speak in the name of Jehovah . lie was the Lord 's representative . He disclaimed all ability of his own , made himself of no reputation , claimed no private wisdom or virtue , called himself a servant , and was accepted accordingly . Jesus gave voice to the best anticipations of his race . rrhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his lips . The proclamation of the kingdom of heaven was the ancient announcement of the Messianic reign . It was not he who founded the heavenly dispensation on any authority of his own . He spoke for his Father . Paul planted his feet on the rock of the old covenant . The Church of Rome regarded the Pope as the Lord 's vicegerent , the source of all spiritual illumination , from whom power descended to the inferior priesthood . In the Protestant churches the preacher was the leading figure , and whenever he felt the presence of a holier spirit behind him than had visited his predecessors , a fresh inspiration from the incarnate Word , his heart was aflame with the Holy Ghost . The modern preacher goes through certain prescribed courses of study in a " school of the prophets . " He takes his diploma from the constituted authorities . He is ordained by the solemn laying on of hands . He is set apart for a peculiar work . He is consecrated a servant or minister of the Highest . Henceforth he speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not argue ; he announces , // declares , affirms . There are certain truths he takes for granted , certain things he knows without experiment . If he chooses to utter his thought on any secular subject , he does not put himself exactly on a level with , common reasoners . One will hardly take up a pamphlet written by a clergyman without encountering this peculiarity . The man is a dogmatist on principle . He can not be anything else . Dogmatism belongs to the profession . It is fortunate for him if it does not eat into his nature . The skepticism of this generation is of a character to bear directly on the existence of the pulpit . It is rather a matter of temperament than of judgment . It affects conduct more than opinion , being not so much a settled form of reasoned unbelief as a practical disinclination to turn the thoughts in an ecclesiastical direction . The element of common sense " is larger in it than the element of knowledge . It touches the more cultivated and the more intellectually occupied classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to church . They prefer to stay at home , and read or write ; naturally finding more pleasure in books that engage them than in sermons that do not . The men of science employ the quiet Sunday hours in making researches in their several departments . The time is especially favorable to the nicer experiments of the new physiology . The philosophical student pursues his studies , uninterrupted by duties or by visitors . When classrooms are closed and offices are shut , then is his hour for close examination . Then he can be alone , can read his favorite authors , can enlarge his mind . It is his day of recreation and of rest . Again , the comic disposition of an age fond of entertainment , amusement , laughter , disliking grave thoughts and averse to meditation , is not attracted to pulpit discussions . The words " duty , * ' " immortality , " " death , " " responsibil ity , " are unwelcome to popular ears . Say what one will , the minister 's themes are necessarily serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . His speech drops down from the higher atmosphere of spiritual thought . He has nothing for sportive hearers . It is not his business to tickle idle ears . He is not a jester , a buffoon , a clown , or a merry-Andrew . He is unwilling to make people laugh ; he rarely induces them to smile . it is his office to open the fountain of tears in their hearts , to stir their consciences , to awaken their souls , to rouse their sympathies . He speaks of brotherhood , charity , accountability ; the wisdom of restraining passion , and curbing desire , and keeping the higher life in view . There are things that look unseemly in the presence of the eternal law , and such things he must condemn . There is a mirthfulness , innocent - nay , positively wholesome - elsewhere , that sinks into silence when the awful , invisible Form comes out of the shadow . That form the preacher never can forget . Lie would be untrue to himself if he lost remembrance of it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . low murmur of the everlasting flood is ever in his ears , and resounds through his language , imparting a deep solemnity to his utterance . He may be tempted to indulge his humor or wit , if he has any , but he yields as to a temptation , regretfully , half remorsefully , fearing lest something may be taken from the edge of his appeal . Even when his theme is neither theological nor technically religious , he is true to his calling as a minister of righteousness . The liberal preacher , so called , is no less austere than his Calvinistic neighbor ; rather more so , if anything , as feeling the importance of correcting a certain latitude of speculation which his " orthodox " friend is not aware of . But if all this be true , - and true in a great measure it may well be , - why // is it , one may ask , that the pulpit has not fallen more completely into disrepute ? Why is the institution supported ? Why are preachers listened to ? Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have to say ? For it is a fact that preaching has not yet stink into utter discredit . The churches are not deserted . On the contrary , I am inclined to think that , all things being taken into account , more people in proportion " go to meeting " - go intelligently , earnestly , sympathetically , expectantly - than ever went before . My impression is that there is more live mind in the churches to-day than there ever was . Buildings are larger , congregations are more numerous , the word is listened to more eager ly . If an able man has anything to say from the pulpit , an audience is ready for him ; and the more authoritatively he speaks , the better they like it . The ancient faithis alive . The old way of presenting it is not obsolete . Skepticism does not appear to have penetrated the heart of the multitude . As the world grows larger , the number increases of those who frequent the sanctuary , as well as of those who stay away . To say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - hours of sorrow , of disappointment , of defeat , - that everybody meets and must surmount ; of the craving to hear a word of solace , encouragement , instruction , to enlarge the horizon of experience , to obtain a wider prospect of life ; to say nothing of death , that awful , mysterious certainty , so universal in its sway , so uncertain in its issues , or of conscience , whose voice is heard in every breast , the themes of the pulpit possess an inexhaustible fascination for the majority of mankind . The preacher 's cardinal topics are irresistibly interesting . There are grave questions which nobody can answer , yet which everybody asks , - questions that the preacher alone pretends to deal with , that none but a thinker attempts to grasp , but that force themselves on the unthinking mind . To know what answers have been given is a good deal ; to be sure that there is no final answer is something . The most light-hearted , even frivolous people , at some moments in their lives , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest minds should confront them , and they , for the most part , are consecrated professionally to the task . The preacher has been educated to consider such problems ; he spends his life in endeavors to solve them ; he has arrived at a certain degree of conviction ; he has won popular confidence by the devotedness of his ministry and the elevation of his life . He is usually noble , simple-hearted , honest , true of intention , single of purpose , disinterested , and sympathetic . He lives in contemplation . He is an idealist . If he is a man of traditions , the traditions he holds by are humane ; they embody the treasured wisdom of the race . Those who resort to him are pretty sure to get all that is known . The purely sensational preacher is rare in any community . There are not many men in the pulpit , if there are any , who study immediate effect more than truth . There may , here and there , be one man of remarkable humor , who is tempted occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incidental to his temperament , not radical in his ministration . His aim is heavenward , though he may frequently provoke a smile . Theodore Parker used to say that if he were to give expression to all the funny thoughts that occurred to him , his hall would resound with laughter . Fanciful images thronged his mind ; yet nobody doubted Parker 's earnestness of purpose , or questioned the absolute sincerity of his nature . Most people imagined that he was somewhat uncompromising , even grim . A prevailing passion for truth is all that can be asked for . Great genius , the gift of insight , of divination , of prophecy , of eloquent // speech , are not to be expected . The saintly disposition is given to few . But the power of personal character is not uncommon , simplicity of intention , purity of mind . Character is very different from genius , accomplishment , or talent in particular directions . It is the force of the unseen world flowing through the soul . There is much in the fact that the minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither aristocrat nor democrat , rich nor poor , old nor young ; that he is simply human ; that he meets all men on the same terms ; that all doors are open to him ; that all domestic secrets are disclosed . The family physician is the only person who has anything like the same universality of influence , anything approaching an equal range of sympathy . No other man in society pretends to it . When to this is added the quality of personality so generally felt in the preacher , who takes into himself the burden of so much experience , the importance of the pulpit is not surprising . The pulpit should be a mount of vision . A living soul utters oracles there . One hears a voice , sees a form , gazes on an expressive countenance . The lecturer has a portion of the same advantage , but he is not charged with so mysterious a theme , nor does he touch people at so many points . In fact , he does not reach the same people year after year , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The audience brings ears , seldom hearts , to the lyceum . It comes in the mood of admiration , not in the mood of worship . Mr. Emerson made the platform an altar , drawing down fire from heaven upon sticks of wood ; but he was alone . The most persuasive lecturer does well if now and then he can ascend from low themes to lofty contemplations . The personality of the lecturer may be called magnetic , in the absence of a better word . The personality of the genuine preacher is born of the spirit , and is largely made up of the elements of hope , fear , love , aspiration , devotion . The truth is that faith in the supernatural is not dead ; faith in the invisible will never die . The ancient religious instincts of men will change their mode of expression , but they will retain their energy . The scientific method does not threaten them with extinction . The democratic principle does not endanger their authority , and the man who can arouse them is sure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , has been heralded by the preacher . The Hebrew ages were ; the Christian age was . The Church of Rome sent out its preaching orders to revive a declining belief ; the Protestant reform depended on the pulpit for its extension . Luther 's force was , in great measure para*netical ; so was Calvin 's . In England , France , Germany , Italy , Switzerland , there was a line of orators with their message from the Lord . The Puritan era came in with preaching . The modern pulpit is broader , more elastic , more practical , less theological , less speculative , less doctrinal , less severely logical , but its old spirit of moral operation is preserved . It still appeals to revelation , still falls back on inspiration , still assumes the immediate presence of Deity , - an immanent God , perhaps , but a living God , - with all the old reality and all the old vividness of conception . The radical pulpit simply transfers the divine influence to other fields ; it never dreams of abolishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantheistical it may be ; theistical , in some form , it commonly is . The conditions of a powerful pulpit to-day are essentially the same as formerly : devotion , sincerity , open-mindedness , translucency of soul . The pulpit must contain consecrated men , who live for the highest thought , the noblest life , the purest sympathies ; who are out of the world , do not seek its prizes , do not court its applause ; who are not secta // rians , not churchmen , not polemics , - men who lay by their individuality , their pride , their self-sufficiency ; who are no hypocrites or pretenders ; who do not strut , vapor , put on airs of superiority , or practice affectations of any kind , but who stand fairly on the border line , where humanity blends with divinity , - men of glowing enthusiasm , of invincible hopefulness , of perfect goodwill , friends and servants of mankind . Such are not rare , and they are becoming less uncommon with every generation . It will he generally allowed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men of this stamp . The culture of the moral nature is still the chief concern . The prevalence of knowledge renders compulsory a finer interpretation of nature , history , experience . We depend on the pulpit to supply this perennial demand . We depend on the pulpit to furnish the conditions of its maintenance . The habit of fault-finding because it does not satisfy them is an evidence of the expectation that exists yet in the world of thinkers . That people are discontented , that they complain , that they stay away from church , may be a good sign . The pulpit should be based on the attribute of intellectual power . The occupant of it should be held to a high standard . It is our duty to insist that the Sunday shall not be wasted , given up to quacks , drivelers , buffoons . My quarrel with the community is that it is too acquiescent ; criticises too little ; is too easily satisfied ; accepts mediocrity of learning , talent , devotion ; abuses too mildly ; ridicules too gently . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who do not begin with aspiration . Religious men are the first to detect imposture . The pulpit can be trusted to purge itself from intruders . A distinguished preacher once said , " When I wish to throw stones at the church windows , I shall go outside . " It was well remarked , for to throw stones is a hostile and rath er a lawless proceeding . It is true , all the same , that the real improvement of the pulpit comes from the inside , from the growth of serious opinion among earnest men , who see what the age and the soul require . The correspondence between John Ruskin and certain clergymen of the Church of England , published two or three years ago , throws much light on the prevailing tendency towards a more spiritual understanding of the pulpit 's office ; the short preface by Dr. Matteson displaying admirably the temper of the leading ecclesiastics . As , in the case of a battle , the hard fighting is done by the ordinary soldiery , whose disciplined valor carries the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor is performed by obscure . men , whose names are never spoken , and whose consecrated lives attest their fidelity to the highest interests of man . The officers bear the brunt of the criticism , but they do not fill the ranks . the best and the worst has been said about the pulpit , yet it is not probable that any agency will ever take its place . Its very imperfections - and in the nature of things it can not be all it aims to become - act as a constant spur to its improvement . Other ministrations , honorable and capable as they may be , do not propose to themselves the same objects , of course can not produce the same results . The newspaper press , for instance , reaches a greater number of people , serves a greater number of wants , touches vastly more points of interest , deals with more immediate concerns , strives after a more comprehensive enlightenment ; but its whole design is different . It has another ideal , which it endeavors to reach , but which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from that of the preacher . The time has gone by when praise of the newspaper press is called for , or is timely . Blame of it is out of place . An attempt to understand the secret of its power is alone wise . That its domain is 1884. 176 // immense , its sway almost boundless , its stride prodigious , must be evident to all who have eyes to see . In 1776 , but little more than a hundred years ago , there were thirty-seven papers of all grades in the United States . Of these , nine were in Pennsylvania , seven in Massachusetts , four in New York . All of them , with a single exception , were weeklies , and this one was a semi-weekly . There was no daily paper in the country . Five years ago there were eight thousand papers of all orders , of which New York had the largest number , Pennsylvania the next in quantity , while Massachusetts ranked seventh or eighth . Now the dailies are all but numberless . A century since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five years since , there was one for five thousand people . In 1876 , there were in this country eight thousand one hundred and twenty-nine periodicals of every rank , with a total circulation of something over a billion . The population of the country was , at the same time , a little over thirty-eight million . There certainly is room enough for the growth of the press . It is not likely soon to overpass the pulpit . We sometimes hear people talk as if there were danger of an inundation from newspapers ; but can any such event be anticipated ? There is more ground for the opinion that we have not newspapers enough for the needs of the people . Less than fifteen years ago , there may have been started , on an average , six new papers a day , yet the actual increase in five years previous to 1876 was only about two thousand . The others had died , or been consolidated , or shrunk from view . The large controlling papers , on which the smaller papers feed , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most papers owe a great deal to the scissors , to the art of making extracts from the great journals ; therefore , unless the towns are to become cities , and small journals great ones , - an event at present beyond conjecture , - the power of the newspaper press must have its numerical limitation . The primary object of the newspaper is to convey enlightenment to the multitude . In the beginning it professed simply to supply intelligence regarding current incidents of importance . When the world was small the paper was small . When intercourse was difficult and infrequent , papers were of necessity local in their scope , limited in their circulation , restricted in their horizon . The Wide , Wide World was a child 's look over a fence . With the expansion of the universe , new scenes were brought to view ; and with increasing facilities of communication , fresh curiosity was awakened . The demand for information extended . Now the great newspaper gets news from every part of the panet . In every chief centre , in every great city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reporting deeds and transactions . If an event of public interest occurs in Egypt , India , Rome , Constantinople , Mexico , or wherever else , special commissioners are sent out , keen observers , trained writers , careful chroniclers of history , to transmit intelligence in regard to everything that passes beneath the eye . The cost of all this is something fabulous . The amount of energy , of enterprise , of disciplined skill , required is fairly beyond computation . The brain-work of the editor in chief - of the subordinates , too , for that matter - must be prodigious , and it is unceasing . Then the external facts must be explained , accounted for , and interpreted . Their meaning is to be disclosed , their tendency indicated , their consequence foreshadowed . Hence the prominence of the editorial column , the necessity of comment by experienced minds who have made the subjects a study . The best statisticians , critics , historians , financiers , scholars , must be employed to reduce to reason the crude material of S // phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago there were no editorial contributions . It is an acute Bostonian , as high-minded as he was sagacious , who has the credit of this innovation . He was himself a singularly able man , of great penetration and enlightened public spirit ; but he secured the service of the most competent men in Massachusetts , for his purpose . His editorials acquired fame all over the country ; they were copied in other papers , and laid the foundation of the system that has become habitual as well as adequate and conscientious . Conscientious , it is repeated . For behind every fact lies a moral no less than an intellectual cause . The antecedents are often exceedingly subtle . Phenomena are subject to law ; they implicate conscience ; they are connected with the inner history of mankind . These relations must be indicated : hence the press preaches . The editor is , in a certain sense , a preacher ; he must tell about the right and wrong of movements . There is an ethics of the press . To meet this requirement , men exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen write for the papers . Pulpits are subsidized . Of course , the moralizing is more or less conventional . It appeals to the general conscience . It rarely soars above its occasion , or leaves the beaten track of conviction . The paper assumes the average moral sentiment of the community , - the highest average sentiment , certainly , - and is compelled to be , in substance , commonplace . It can not diverge far from accepted principle , for by so doing it would be unfaithful to its leading purpose , which is to enlighten the minds of its contemporaries , not directly to elevate their consciences . It takes existing laws of duty for granted , follows the road of tradition , and , however fresh and forcible it may be in expression , abides by conceded examples . Now and then an editor ventures on original theses , indulges in speculative lucubrations , or propounds ethical theories beyond his calling . But this is felt to be out of his province , and is set down to the account of some private eccentricity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other hands , and if entrusted to him alone would hardly be fulfilled . To him belongs the office of the interpreter , not that of the prophet . Unquestionably , his influence may be great in extending the sphere of the pulpit , in holding the preacher to the level of his vocation , in distributing moral forces , but his power to originate them is small . This is the most important limitation of the press , and herein it differs from the pulpit , which holds its occupant to the highest mark of ideal aspiration . The more completely he loses himself in heavenly contemplations , the better men are satisfied . The limitations in question may be explained by the fact that the newspaper press is a great business , and must obey the rules of business . Its expenses are enormous . The salaries , rents , costs of correspondence , of editorial writing , of news agencies , reporters , and the rest are incessant as they are absorbing of money . It requires a large outlay to start a daily paper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made good , and more than made good ; otherwise the result is failure . Here and there , to be sure , a paper is begun and continued for a time , longer or shorter , in some particular interest that commands the support of a special individual or company , but this does not count . The press , as a rule , is a venture , conducted on the principle of every pecuniary investment . It offers to the capitalist a fair return for the money he has put into the shares , and if no such return is forthcoming , the investment is not a good one . There are papers that represent more than a million of dollars . If this sum is de // rived from subscriptions , as it seldom or never is , the public taste must be primarily consulted . If it is derived from advertisements , the business community must be accommodated . The advertisements depend on the circulation ; the circulation results from the popular approval . Thus , at last , the public sentiment is made the test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be escaped . There may be papers that live for a while without advertising , - sectarian organs , Sunday-school journals , instituted for denominational purposes , - but they are small and insignificant . And these seek advertisements , though not often with success , inasmuch as their constituency is not large , and is formed of people who are already attached to the cause advocated . Here is an unavoidable peril , not merely financial , but moral ; for the public mind nowhere is remarkably high-toned . Remunerative advertisements must be invited ; must be , if possible , secured . How far policy may be stretched to meet the exigency will rest on the conscience of the editor or editors . At all events , policy must be invoked . Most papers advertise their circulation , of course with a motive , which appears on the face of the proceeding . Deference to a subscription list is sometimes increased by this means . A falling off of circulation will be injurious . The management mav regret this necessity of pleasing a fickle public , may rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inculcate , enjoin ; but can circumstances be controlled ? Even when the multitude becomes infatuated , possessed , maddened by some strange prejudice , some unwarrantable persuasion , must not the conductors of the paper be careful how they run counter to the tide ? No paper that loves its own existence can afford to defy the world . No paper dares be so independent that it will put itself in opposition to all opinion . It is dependent on its very independence . If its patrons maintain it , all is well . But its patrons must naintain it . If the editor sets at naught their judgment , he as certainly drives his vessel on a rock as does the head of an ordinary enterprise . Here is the distinction between an ideal and a practical profession . The ideal profession stands upon principle ; the practical profession stands upon policy . Every calling , as soon as it leaves principle for policy , incurs the danger of moral depreciation . The pulpit does so even more fatally than the press , because its aims are higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upheld by the church . The community was directed by the priesthood . The power of spiritual authority was universally acknowledged . The minister was therefore independent of social influence . He was strong in the support of his superiors , who silently backed his word . Men might like what he said , or they might dissent from it ; they were compelled to listen , because the speaker was countenanced by celestial inspiration . In the days of Catholic supremacy , just before the Reformation , a class of preachers was sent out to revive the drooping faith of the believers . Their moral audacity was amazing . They went everywhere with their encouragement and rebuke . They stood before monarchs , princes , gentlemen , ladies . The Pope himself came under their censure , for greater than any earthly dominion was the dea*nless spirit he represented . In the early days of Protestant rule , the voice of the Holy Ghost in the soul was louder than any human clamor . The period of Puritan energy was also the period of implicit confidence in the monitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the democratic system , the prevailing faith in a revealed will gives the pulpit courage . The wish of the majority sometimes overbears the speech of the timid man . He must consult the press before he utters his conviction // on any matter of divided sentiment . We have all known instances where conscience clashed against expediency , where the multitude rose up and overturned the authority of the pulpit , and the minister was obliged to depart from his place . The pew rents dwindled , and a new administration was thought more likely to " edify . " This event frequently happened in the years that preceded the civil war ; but a purely spiritual exigency may arise which brings the common sense of the hearers into collision with the soul of the prophet , and then the consequence is equally disastrous . The preacher who regards his calling as a business , as the novelist has often described him , is lost . He preaches what the congregation likes to hear . He prophesies smooth things , because such only are attractive , such only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences ; sensational sermons ; loud declamations ; the facility with which men persuade themselves that they believe what they have discarded ; the habit of thinking one thing in the study , and saying another on Sunday . The office thus becomes a bargaining shop , and it lapses at once into spiritual degeneracy . This danger the press is exposed to continually and inevitably . How far it eludes the danger it is not for me to say . The editorial conscience can alone answer that question . A curious concomitant of this deference to polite opinion is the tone of infallibility the press assumes . It is obliged to speak with authority in order to keep the confidence of its supporters . It must abide by its assertion ; otherwise it weakens its grasp on its adherents . Consistency is its jewel , even if it be consistency in misjudgment and mistake . To retract is perilous ; to correct an error is to confess it ; to give prominence to a recantation is humbling . To forgive is always difficult ; to ask forgiveness requires almost supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who grants looks down on a suppliant ; he who asks looks up to a judge . He who admits no judge more exalted than personal inclination or popular approval will not often take the attitude of humiliation . It is done sometimes , not often , still less habitually ; for it is a hard thing for a paper with a hundred thousand readers who pin their faith to its columns to take back its own asseveration . Fidelity to its main purpose forbids its making concessions which might impair its force . Another source of limitation in the newspaper press is the necessity of paying attention to local politics . This is not a fault , nor even a misfortune . It may , indeed , imply a most excellent quality ; for in a democratic country politics ought to be a leading concern of the people , and the task of informing the general mind about it , of scrutinizing candidates , testing questions , and estimating issues , is of primary importance. * Great discussions are continually agitated . The merits as well as the demerits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained , and in the course of debate absolute principles are brought into view . All this is admirable as bearing on the higher education of the community at large . Every considerable paper is , fortunately , obliged to have political sympathies ; every leading paper must undertake political advocacy . The sympathies grow from year to year more generous ; the advocacy becomes from year to year most just and noble . That the public mind is enlightened by the uninterrupted agitation , the general conscience purified , the standard of equity raised , the level of truth elevated , is heartily conceded ; nay , is gratefully acknowledged . That this is in great measure due to the efforts of journalists can not be doubted . At the same time , it would be miraculous if the habit of confining attention to the details of party // management did not weaken the faculty of ideal contemplation , and render difficult , to say the least , the duty of considering everlasting ideas .

It is a vast popular educator , in science , the useful arts , taste for literature , music , painting , sculpture , in all that belongs to human existence in this world . A critic , a keen observer , a man of singular intelligence , himself a distinguished preacher , once said to me that he never read a paper that he did not come across something he wished to cut out and preserve ; and he was prevented from doing so only by the number of such paragraphs . This too is the experience of other men , as I can bear cheerful testimony . This power of the press is increasing continually , and is becoming more and more beneficent . To every one who can look back half a century , it must be evident that in quality as well as in quantity the improvement is immense .

The real friend of his kind must rejoice in the signs of such advance , for they prove that one of the chief agents of civilization is about its work . The mission of the stage is no less lofty and peculiar than that of the pulpit or the press . Though its office is primarily to entertain , it aims at doing this in a way more refined and elegant as time goes on , thus promoting the a3sthetic education of society . The epoch of Puritan protest against the theatre is gone by . Amusement is no longer associated with vice . The sources of turpitude have been , once and for all , removed from buildings devoted to dramatic art . Clergymen need no longer defend the stage . The best actors move freely in the choicest circles . Even orthodox preachers show , by their attendance at places of theatrical entertainment in foreign cities , that their objections are not founded on principle , but rather on local convenience , and that they would gladly introduce a more generous form of culture at home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially unreal , illusory , artificial , false , hypocritical , perhaps , inasmuch as he must pretend to be somebody else ; must simulate a kindness , a state , a virtue , not his own ; must wear borrowed clothes , and put on a mask , and seem to be noble when he is at heart base , is gradually disappearing under finer influences , at the common demand for higher conception , for more consummate skill , for nicer delineation of character , for a delicate quality of dress and decoration which a generation ago were unknown . Coarseness is scarcely tolerated in our days ; rudeness is severely criticised . The arts of expression are cultivated because they are insisted on . The passion for the drama , it is on all sides confessed , has its seat in human nature . The church admitted this long ago , in the miracle plays , by which received doctrines were commended to the uneducated classes . The church must admit it again in the new shape prescribed by the modern spirit , welcoming its gay coadjutor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors themselves - the foremost of them - are doing what they can to render their profession acceptable to the worthiest men and women . They work hard ; they study incessantly ; they consult the best standards of feeling . If they are ingenious in producing meretricious effects by the use of paint , cosmetic , and costume , it is simply because the public inclination runs in that direction , not because they themselves love ornament or the i*esort to tricks . As fast as they are permitted they will ele // vate the standard of taste . Their business is to make moral sentiment attractive ; not to promulgate absolute ethics , not to diffuse information , but to make such morality as exists apprecia'ted , and to recommend it by all the means at their command . The appetite for high tragedy is less *and less importunate . Bold , melodramatic effects are seldom produced . Violent ethical contrasts are avoided . Strong painting of moral peculiarities is no longer in vogue . The finer shadings of life are indicated , - a sign of healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chastened by a very considerable refinement in the character of comedy itself , . which is taken out of the region of buffoonery and burlesque , and carried up into the domain of wholesome merriment . It is beginning to be suspected , in fact , that the actor , and not society , is the principal victim of the profession . He is the sufferer from insincere conditions , if there is any . He must labor at night , when other people enjoy themselves ; and his labor is especially exhausting to the nervous energy , so that he must sleep through the sunniest hours of the day . He is cut off seriously from social intercourse , even in the period of his fame ; and until his fame is acquired he has no chance to go into the world . The chief interests of mankind - business and politics - have but little part in his life . The movements of social reform pass him by . He dwells habitually in a world of his own , a world apart from his fellow creatures . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by his environment . His ideas of virtue are apt to be characterized by the peculiarities of a remote and fanciful ideal . The moral persuasions of a distinct order are visibly impressed on his mind . Both his virtues and his vices are incident to a calling that shuts him up in a species of isolation from his kind . His temptations are his own ; his victories , too , are his own . Other men have stronger supports , and deserve sterner judgment for errors . In my own experience , both the men and the women merit more honor than is meted out to them . There have been times when the stage was made to minister directly to the political , social , and moral guidance of mankind ; when it was wielded as a force by kings and courts ; when its writers regarded it as the object of their lives to satirize folly in the interest of wisdom . In a word , the playwright was a prophet . But , as a rule , the office of the actor is to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman of Boston used to frequent , when he visited New York , a certain theatre , well known then , where he was sure to be shaken out of his cares by side - splitting laughter , and sent home a new man . The actor , as it befell , was no model of private virtue , but he performed this vast service for his fellow men . Better offices are rendered now , butthey are the same in kind . To diminish in some degree the pressure of toil is a great blessing . Unhappily , they who least need to have the pressure lightened , the leisurely , pleasure-seeking classes , are the chief supporters of the theatre . But the most cultivated people , the most responsible members of the community , will become the patrons of it in proportion as its office is better appreciated . Still , the multitude require , more than the few , this solace of entertainment , for they have not so many resources in their homes and their daily life . They are the people who need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rich or educated classes can do without amusement , on ordinary occasions , or can obtain it through other channels . During the days of terror in Paris that marked the French Revolution , in 1793 , between twenty and thirty theatres gathered crowds every evening , the actors and // actresses exerting themselves to keep quiet the agonized spirits of the metropolis . In the darkest hours of our civil war , when the ministers were sustaining drooping hearts by holding before them the precepts of eternal justice ; when the daily papers published bulletins ot dismay , and tried to put the most cheerful interpretation on disaster , the theatres of New York were thronged as they never had been before by men and women who wished to escape from painful thoughts . To some the mirthfulness appeared unseemly , but they who saw deeper beheld with thankfulness this provision for relieving the tension of an overcharged nervous system . Laughter follows close on tears . This point can not be too strongly stated . It would be a real misfortune were the actor to undertake the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multitude with him , and the presentation of moral ideas would be sentimental , if not extravagant . For the actor to play the reformer would be a serious mistake , because he would inevitably be betrayed into fustian or silly pedantry . He would disgust many , and amuse none . All attempts to " purify the stage " by making it an adjunct of religion disclose a singular ignorance of the true mission of both . A play written for philosophers would not interest merchants , manufacturers , or artisans . Acting that might please saints could not he acceptable to sinners , as the majority of men are . The stage must represent the society it entertains . The player must be popular . Society , indeed , would be the gainer if actors and actresses would study to accommodate themselves better than they appear to do to the most refined moral sense of the community ; if they would accept in good faith their duty as educators of their generation . The customary dependence on the hair-dresser , the milliner , the dealer in cosmetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The adaptation of French plays , with their inevitable meretriciousness , to say nothing of their daintily concealed lubricity , is not a sign of elevated taste . But this may be a passing fashion . The increasing popularity of American plays argues a nobler future , a more complete adaptation to the ideas of a young , aspiring people . The actor is an artist . He belongs to the great brotherhood of the masters of perfect form , and he must not confound electric lights with beauty , or make paint a substitute for principles . The introduction of personal charms as a guarantee of histrionic talent , or a passport to histrionic success , as if it were enough to be beautiful , is fatal to lofty attainment , either in morality or in art , and should be frowned at instead of being indulged , as it is by a too generous profession . That the stage has a very dignified career before it can not be doubted ; that it will rise above its difficulties must not be questioned ; that it holds in its possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened minds . Its function is intellectual , and therefore boundless in possibility . There is simply no end to its capabilities . Though its office is to entertain , it is also its office to cultivate , to refine , to elevate , quite *s distinctly as the work of the press is to impart a complete information , or as the task of the pulpit is to inspire the human soul . These are the three sources of power . All other agencies are but variations on the themes they propose . As time goes on , the peculiar differences in their design will probably be disclosed more and more . They will come to respect one another as fellow workers , and to rejoice each in the other 's success ; all jealousy and envy being laid aside , as between real artists who are en ( leavoring to promote the well being of humankind. 0 .
