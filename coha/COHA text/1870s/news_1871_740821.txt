txt The intense cold which has followed the ate storm recalls to every charitable mind the suffering of the poor . Many causes will combine to make this one of the hardest Winters for many years . The failing of so many savings banks alone , one of the bitterest fruits of Ring rascality , will bear cruelly on a large class of our people . We trust that the more fortunate among us will not now be stinted in their generosity- . We have many deserving and efficient associations for relieving the distresses of poverty , to which we have heretofore called attention . A gift to any of these would , we are sure , be gratefully acknowledged and properly applied . One could certainly bestow no more gracious Christmas gift . But there still seems room for some plan of relief more comprehensive . if not more practical , than any of these societies appear to have adopted . What is wanted more than anything else is a soup-house in some central situation , where simple food could be served out at cost prices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who could not . There was , if we mistake not , perhaps is still , such a place in Berlin , where a good dinner could be had for a few cents . Some years ago a similar enterprise was maintained by a benevolent gentleman of this City at his own expense . Concerted action on the part of the many poor associations in New-York , together with such aid . as would freely come from private charity , once the thing were started . might carry out the design on an efficient scale . Who is to have the honor of beginning it ?
