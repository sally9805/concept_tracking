ART . VII . - MIXED POPULATIONS OF NORTH CAROLINA . IT has been the fashion in this country to deplQre the want of individuality in the characteristics of different parts of our land ; it has been said so often , that belief has readily followed , that we are wearers of a social uniform , and our land the region of interminable monotonies . The good people over the water , who live on the ragged edge of the great Asiatic continent , have been accustomed to reiterate these opinions with a persistence which has led to their adoptioii in this country . There is no doubt a massiveness in the grouping of the feature lines of America , which , to the eye which has had its habit formed on the sharp contrasts of Europe , may give the impression of uniformity . Those who have not the judgment to perceive that each of these majestic individualities we call continents must be judged by separate canons of criticism , who can not see that // they are no more to be measured together than are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may go on regretting that our America , with its noble symmetries , wants the picturesque surprises which characterize Europe , that land of physical accidents . But those who would fit themselves to appreciate and enjoy their own land should learn at once to look at it in the spirit which it itself arouses . The traveller who would journey through the southern part of the United States should be possessed of this independence of judgment , if he means to get all the satisfaction that can be obtained . From the Potomac to the Rio Grande his course may be laid through a region of vast plains , rarely diversified by considerable hills ; but , to replace those agents of diversification , lie will find noble rivers and forests more picturesque than those of any other level country without the bounds of the tropics . Leaving Washington by the Alexandria and Manassas road , we come at once upon the most historical of our American ground . The Long Bridge across the Potomac carries us over the road down which for five long years was poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice to our ideal of national unity . For a little while we find our road within the line of Washington defences , and the marks of war are limited to the lines of decaying earthworks or the shabby relics of old barracks and hospitals , shorn of the neatness and whitewash which once redeemed them , and given over to the squalor of negro cabin life . However much the character of Southern life may change in its new conditions , it will be half a century or more before the outward garb of the old life disappears . The traveller who has the least perception in such matters can not fail to see that in passing from the North to the South he leaves behind him the civilization of one type , and enters upon another having quite a different basis . The house , the chief element in the machinery of civilization , changes its character as soon as one passes the line dividing the two regions . One sees at once that the home is arranged for two different races , a superior and an inferior .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of shelter for the lower , and the rest is distinctively the habitation of the superior race . However much the latter part may rise in character with the taste or // means of the owner , the cabin part remains the same . The uniformity of one part , and that often the larger portion of the home , gives to the dwellings in the South a much greater uniformity of aspect than in the northern part of the United States . Whether scattered as isolated farm-houses along the road , or grouped in the sad , decaying looking town of Alexandria , these homes show always the mark of the society of a double race , and are even more widely different from those of the North than are those of two far separated European peoples . Beyond Alexandria , we enter upon the field of the most complete desolation which the war effected . Generally , the destruction done by modern wars is qnickly repaired . The visible property of a conntry is generally a small part of its wealth , and its destruction , while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fields are the richer for a year of fallow , and the husbandman comes eagerly to his work again . But here the destruction was utter . The fenceless fields have been claimed by the forests again , so long were they left to waste . Those of the people who survived the accidents of five years of war wandered away too far to return at its end . Scarcely the tenth part of the ravaged fields which lie between Alexandria and Gordonsyille have come under the plough again . The natives say that the climate has changed since the war ; that it is drier , and therefore the soil less fruitful . For some reason or other , the tide of Northern emigration which set this way so strongly for the first years of peace seems to have slackened . It is hard to believe that this soil will not repay culture ; it has most of the characteristics of the light sandy fields of New Jersey , which were profitless while treated with contemptuous half-culture , but have proved fertile under a better system . Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Ridge begin to rise on the right . Though none of the mountains are more than fifteen hundred feet above the plain , their effect is very beautiful . Though we may be well enough satisfied with the scene , made up of the broad undulating plain , merging by gentle degrees into the sweeping hills beyond , we may enhance the pleasure by the reflection that here our race has done the most to prove its willingness to // die for abstract principles , - that highest proof of the true manliness of a people . It needs some such reflections to reconcile one to the desolate appearance of this region . It is indeed an American campagna . The ruins one sees at frequent intervals seem as fitting to the whole scene as do the grander works which break the monotony in the desolation about Rome . The air here is far richer in color than in the region farther to the north ; so that the skies have more of an Italian hue than those which deck most American landscapes . It wants nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give this plain , those mountains , and the sky the stamp of Italy . The negroes seem to increase as one goes away from the cities . There is always a superabundance of them in the social congestions called cities ; they having a magical attraction for all those who *#ould get the most life for the least labor . It is only when one is far enough away from the towns to be somewhat beyond the reach of their influence , that we find the laboring population of the country where it belongs . Around Gordonsville , a point where two railroads cross , there is a gathering of this people , who seem to live off of the little they can get from the charge of travel at that point ; some twenty women , picturesquely shabby , peddle luncheon of roast chicken and pancake . This traffic , which , if it is profitable in proportion to the din made by its followers must be good indeed , seems to be limited to this railway crossing . A friend of mine , who was with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the country had been foraged over for years , the negro and chicken were still always to be found at Gordonsville . The traveller looks in vain for any evidence of a growing illfeeling between the white and black races . It was Christmastime , and the negroes were gathered in large crowds about every little hamlet ; always boisterous , sometimes drunken . These assemblages would have provoked trouble , if there had been any latent irritation existing . But in a journey of some weeks I heard not one harsh word used towards the many noisy fellows who were demanding Christmas gifts , or otherwise making themselves nuisances . Nor , on the other hand , // did I see any disposition on the part of the negro to make himself disagreeable , by thrusting himself into positions where his presence would be unwelcome . The conductors on the railroad told me that they rarely took any other than their own cars on the trains , though there was no compulsion about the arrangement . The roads have been wise enough to arrange the matter by allowing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars set apart for them . My road led me to visit the extensive coal mines in the vicinity of iRichmond , Virginia , where I had the satisfaction of learning how the negroes worked in large gangs , in an employment demanding a certain fortitude and constancy of labor . I found the only working mine , of the many which were in operation at Coalfield before the war , under the charge of an intelligent German gentleman , from the mining school of Freiberg , who had lived for about twenty years in the South , and had seen the character of the work done by the negroes during the existence of slavery . Since the war he had spent some time in the North , under circumstances which gave him a opportunity of learning something of the quality of the labor used there . His opinion seemed to be that the negro worked very nearly as well now as lie had ever done , mind that their work would *compare favorably with that done by the average miner in other parts of this country , though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European workmen in the same position . The most difficult matter seemed to be to get them to abandon the long Christmas holiday . A. few years of liberty has reconciled them so far to the loss of their saturnahia , that they had agreed to put up with a single day of " Christmasing , " on condition that their wages should not be reduced , in place of the fortnight of unpaid and unprofitable riot they have generally indulged in . Any deficiency in skill and force on the part of these negroes is probably more than compensated by the absence of strikes and their accompanying disturbances . The relation between the negroes and the whites in this part of Virginia seems quite satisfactory to both races . While I was with Mr. II there came in two members of the school committee of the precinct , seeking to make some arrangement to have coal furnished for their schools . it came // out in their conversation that the school committee was composed of two white men and one black man , and that the school had been divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the members of the board was as fine a specimen of sturdy manhood as I ever had the pleasure of looking upon . About sixty years old , he had preserved in a surprising way the lines of youth . His body showed something of the marks of hard labor , , and his head and beard were gray , but his step was light , and he carried his erect and giant form with all the ease of a gymnast . It was a body to make one feel confident of the future of our race in this region . His mind seemed about as young as his body ; and though there was an evident want of schooling , there was no lack of native wit . Though singularly free from the usual Americanisms , his language was strongly , one might say richly , tinctured with the local color of the region . As soon as one comes in coLitact with the mountains in this part of the country , the man begins to improve . These big men seem to spring naturally from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions found there are , on the whole , the most favorable for the development of a powerful race . A climate of few extremes , though variable enough to produce active habits , and inviting to a life in the open air ; a soil fruitful of good food , bearing beneath it a rich store of those elements of mineral wealth best suited to give the basis of a real prosperity . It wants only a good government and good social conditions to become the garden of the continent . From these coal regions , on the outskirts of the mountains , my route took me over the long , sloping plains which lead from the low table lands of the upper part of the James River down to the swamps of the seaboard region of North Carolina . There is a great change for the worse as one passes from this upland region towards the shore . The land sinks down first to monotonous plains , then to the swamp regions , and the people go down with equal pace with the soil . There is much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye for local color , in the swamp region of Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds . The shores of these great sounds have had a singu // lar physical history . It has been only a little while , geologically , since this part of the continent came out of the waters ; so recently , indeed , that the land still preserves the contour given it while it lay beneath the sea . It is to be presumed , however , that the ocean is not satisfied with its work , for the land is again sinking with a rapidity which leads us to expect that on the geological morrow , say five thousand years hejice , these swamps and savannas will be again beneath the waters . The great sand reefs which form the promontory of Cape Hatteras shut out the tide from the vast lagoon-like bays they enclose . The waters of the streams freshen these enclosed seas and spread far and wide along their bankless borders , giving a monotony of cypress swamps , from which project long , low islands which bear forests of the Southern pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial life which has ever existed here . It has been to the inhabitants of this region what the cocoanut-palm is to the people of the , Pacific islands . While standing in the forest , it is the source of the turpentine and resin , the staple products of this region ; when it has survived its usefulness as source of these products , its noble trunk is used to make the most enduring of pine lumber , or is converted into tar and pitch . The tree is far handsomer than our Northern species ; it stands up among the smaller common pines which surround it a real monarch of the forest . Even in its decay it is handsome ; its branches have a more varied and hardy architecture than is usual in our cone-bearing trees ; an isolated group lined against the sky recalls the stately stone-pines of Italy . It has the rare merit among trees of being more beautiful in its decay than in its vigor , and this capacity for making a grand ruin is of great value in this region , so monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they are called , gradually die under the sapping process of their exploitation , and their grand ruins gather an always heavier and heavier mantle of the lugubrious trailing moss , as if in mourning for their decay . The roadside shows little to mark the approach to Newbern , the seaboard capital of North Carolina . There is none of the evidence of an overflow of wealth , shown in better kept plantations , better roads , and other signs of civilization ; we // come almost at once from the forest , where the clearings are comparatively bare , to the outskirts of the town . There is not much to please the eye in the place , except here and there traces of taste in the older buildings , which have a certain un-American air about them . The number of the buildings which look over a century old shows that this was one of the points of colonization on our shore , and the difference between them and the old buildings in our Northern seaboard towns indicates that the colonists were of another race than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one might suspect from the name , by a colony of Swiss . During the religious persecutions of the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries , England gave harborage to many thousand Swiss and Germans . These homeless men afforded excellent material for the government and the great land companies to use in stocking the plantations in the New World . It is well worth our while to turn to the records of that time to get an idea of the conditions under which this colonization was brought about . There is very little evidence as to the character of the people who constituted the German colonists . They seem to have been under the guidance of Christopher , Baron de Graffenried , and Louis Mechell , and to have blindly obeyed the lead of these men . Their leaders were paid to transport them to America at the rate of five pounds ten shillings for each of the six hundred and fifty persons in the hundred families constituting the colony . The leaders were to give to each family two hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five years without payment , and afterwards at a rental of two pence per acre . They were also bound to provide the people with food for three years , furnish them with " two cows , two calves , two sows with their several last litters or number of pigs , with male of each of the said kind of cattle , " all of which was to have been repaid to the venturers . Soon after the settlement of these people , their chief man , De Graffenried , returned to Europe , leaving them without any title to their property . The colony continued to exist , if it did not flourish , for many years , and to this day some of the families of Eastern North Carolina show by their names that the stock has not quite died out . But it is evident that they could not have found favora // ble conditions here ; they have not increased with anything like the rapidity of the colonists on other points on the coast , nor have they shown any such capacity for founding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was also a large amount of Swiss immigration on this shore . Under the same speculative De Graffenried a colony from the neighborhood of Berne founded the town of Newbern , occupying exclusively the neighboring country . Their numbers are doubtful , hut there is reason to believe that the colony had about fifteen hundred people . Besides these large settlements , this country also received many hundred Huguenot colonists . It is difficult to determine the relative numbers of the different nationalities who first peopled this region , but there can be little doubt that this part of the State had a very great preponderance of Germans and French , and was essentially a colony of these races . Though these people were doubtless of the lower classes , there seems to be warrant enough in their willingness to expatriate themselves for the cause of religion to justify our believing that they were sturdy citizens , fit seed for a State . Those who came from the Palatinate had been harried by the French for many years , and the recipients of alms in England for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life during these years , but they were from the same source as the German colonists of Pennsylvania , and had had the same history . It is not to be doubted that the original material of the colonization here was of a character fairly to test the suitability of the conditions for the development of a State . Under favorable circumstances we should have had a numerous population and a rapid accumulation of wealth ; the facts are that the increase of number has been surprisingly slow , the whites in some of the counties having hardly doubled in a century . The German , Swiss , and French colonists seem to have been to a great extent supplanted by the people of English stock , whom they at first outnumbered . There are still marks of the descent left in some of the names common in Eastern North Carolina . Many of these still show , despite the anghicizing process they have undergone , a descent from wellknown French and German names . The languages have been // completely driven away . Sometimes one hears among the many local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patois like " Pennsylvania Dutch , " but even these traces are not clearly marked . I could see nothing German in the faces , as one can still in Pennsylvania ; the lean , fever-smitten , face of the people had nothing Teutonic in it . Once or twice a face and figure characteristically French came under my observation , reminding one of the aspect of the habitans of Canada ; sometimes a volubility of utterance which contrasted with the prevailing taciturnity of the people seemed to indicate the presence of Gallic blood . There were certainly some influences at work here calculated to lower the morale of the early colonists . Large numbers of criminals were exported to the Carolinas during the first century after their foundation . The shallow waters of the network of inlets of this shore became thronged with pirates and maurauders . To add to this , the land was long held as the property of a company who gave bad law and worse governors to the colonists they had planted , like vegetables , in the rich swamps of Pamlico Sound . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Quaker or the Puritan settlements , in these North Carolina plantations , may account for munch ; but it is impossible to look at the physical condition of this people without the conviction that it ha* not been the sole sustaining influence . Were it not for some other difficulties the inexhaustible fertility of these swamp-farms must have given an immense population , if it did not create an ideal State . While much can be attributed to the miasmatic curses of this country , which though great do not seem wholly insufferable , more can be laid to the charge of bad food and careless habits of living . It may be that these two are chargeable to the assemblage of influences which we term climate . Entering at random the home of any of the farming class of this country , we find onrselve* at once in contact with conditions calculated to insure degeneration ; and in a region where the commonest prudence would dictate the selection of the highest points of land , where there might be a chance of escaping miasmatic poisions , the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lot of swamp by the door ; the bedrooms are but // little elevated above the ground . The food is poor ; sweet potatoes and bacon are the staples ; the latter is consumed in large quantities , - it seems indeed to be preferred to more savory food . Wheaten flour is rarely used among the lower classes ; the food is calculated to produce a habit of body conducive to the febrile diseases which ravage this country , but which might disappear under a more satisfactory system of life . The most unsatisfactory feature in the physical condition of the people is that acclimation does not seem to have been accomplished during the five generations of life here . The people still die in large numbers from the congestive intermittents which rage every year . That much of the bad effect of this region on the bodies of the people depends upon remediable causes is , I think , shown by the immunity from disease exhibited by many of the persons who have come to this country from the North since the war . They seem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people suffer . The observer who finds so little result from the two centuries of existence of man in this region , who sees so much to fear for the results of coming years upon the race if subjected to the same conditions , may well feel thankful that the fate of America did not depend upon colonies planted on this part of our shore . Among the things that might Wave been , let us suppose the Mayflower had been driven to the shores of Carolina , and found a place for its colonists on the ground which received the " poor Palatines " which were so passively planted by Dc Graffenried , nearly a century later . Would the Puritan have fared better here and reared a braver State than the Palatines and Huguenots have done ? Or wonld these insidious influences of climate have reduced them to the intellectual and physical poverty to which they seem to have brought this people ? It may be a reasonable cause for congratulation that the good ship which bore the seed of New England did not find other winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have fallen on worse ground than the stony fields where they have grown so well . No one has attempted to trace with care the history of these settlements in Eastern North Carolina , yet it is one of the richest fields which our country affords for such a work . The // original material was varied and picturesque . Germans from the valley of the Neckar , Swiss from the Alps of Berne , and iluguenots from France , gave a more varied character to the people than could have been found in any of the other colonies of America . Whoever will trace for us the history of these peoples during the century following their immigration , and who will show the reason why this good seed and good soil has given no harvest , will do much to reveal to us the future of our race over a large part of the American continent . It is to be feared that the materials for such a history have been lost . Nothing indicates more clearly the want of culture over the greater part of our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generations which did the work of pioneering . In a part of the West , New England influences have aroused a cer* tam interest in the immediate past , but over the whole South and Southwest little effort has been made to record the history of the settlement of the country . It is interesting to observe the perfect blending of the English , German , German Swiss , and French colonists in this region . Though no considerable advance has been made since this people came together , they have , nevertheless , mingled in the most perfect way . No such absolute obliteration of race lines has taken place in other parts of our country where people with diverse languages and customs came together . This would seem to indicate the action of some powerful conditions of environment tending to replace the original characteristics by suddenly reduced conditions . But if we turn from our own kindred people , the descendants of the German , Swiss , and French immigrants , to the Africans , who came here about the same time or a little earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these modifying influences , we seek in vain . The negro of this region is the same vigorous creature he is throughout the South . One looks in vain for any marks to separate him from his kindred in other regions . The white men about him are apparently smaller than the average men under the same isothermal ; their sallow complexion and lank forms betray the influence of some adverse influences , either in the climate or habits ; but the full-blooded negroes are not perceptibly different from those of Virginia or Kentucky , or other parts of the // South . This inflexibility of the African is , to the eye of any one accustomed to observe such facts , a very striking feature . Although general assertions concerning the condition of a people , based upon anything except precise statistics , are apt to be dangerous , we may venture the opinion that the negroes of the South give many evidences of being a far less elastic race than our own . The variation in size among individuals in any community seems rather less than among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarfs . If we take the negroes in different regions , the geographical variations of size are seen to be small compared with those of the dominant race . Some difference in moral and intellectual character is to be observed between those regions where the supply of imported slaves was kept up until a late stage in our history and those where the race is as many generations from the foreign source as our own ; but in his physical features the negro has varied little from his African ancestors , and varies little when subjected to the diverse influences of climate on this continent . The negro has changed less in his movement from one hemisphere to another , from tropical to local conditions , from the indolence of savage life to the toil of slavery , than has the European in his migration from one side of the Atlantic to the other . How comes it that the negro is so fixed in his physical character , and the white man so variable ? There are several forcible explanations of this , though it is far from certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , among animals the higher members of any group seem to be more variable in character than the lower , and offer less resistance to those agents , whatever they may be , which lead towards change or destruction . It would seem , however , that the two races are scarcely far enough apart to refer this difference to this law , if it may be so called , of the animal kingdom . Again , it may be reasoned that just as the most highly developed breeds are those which are the most difficult to retain in their best shape , so those races of men which are the most civilized are those the most dependent upon the conditions of environment for their maintenance . It may also be claimed , with a good show of reason , that the variability of our own race may be an acquired capacity , caused by the frequent changes of conditions to which it has been subjected // during several thousand years of continued migrations , as well as the constant change of seasons in the western region where it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be due to the uniform conditions of its home in the continent of least variation , where for many thousand years their lives knew little change . The intense race individuality of the negro is the source of certain advantages and detriments in his new home : on the one hand , it makes him better fitted to withstand the strain which climate puts upon him ; on the other , it can hardly be denied that the resistance to change which his body shows is shared by his mind , and that his intellectual advance will necessarily be slow , even under the most favorable conditions . There can be no doubt that the negro is succeeding better in the North than many of those who knew him best dared to suppose . The condition of the race in Eastern North Carolina is , on the whole , encouraging . They are working more and stealing less than ever before , if the testimony of competent witnesses may be believed . They keep their contracts as well as any ignorant race is likely to do , and are truer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be . There can be no doubt that they are learning the severe lessons which make the citizen . It is to be regretted that their wages are so inadequately low ; fifteen dollars per month for the year , and no rations , is said to be the ordinary wage of an able-bodied man . He may eke out a miserable subsistence on this , but civilization can not grow on such wages . Unfortunately , even at this rate , with the imperfect agriculture , the farmer can barely live himself and pay his laborers . The absolute want of variety of pursuits is the great curse of this region , as of most of the South . There are no manufactures ; even the agriculture represents a single crop ; the laborer has steady employment for no more than half the year , and so leads an irregular life . The possibility of any hopeful future here for either race rests upon the question of whether subsistence can have a more varied foundation . The most cheerful feature of this community is the comparative freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been the radical sheriff for two years , an edu // cated New-Englander and a Republican , and so fairly competent as a witness , told me that since the close of the war Crown County , with an average population of about twenty thousand , had had but six homicides . Of these none were clear cases of murder , and none traceable to class feelings or race prejudices . The negroes have not separated themselves from the whites , making negro districts , as at other points . The relations between the races is no difficult question here . There have been no Ku-Klux outrages in this county , though they have occurred in the county to the west . Travelling is as safe here as in Massachusetts , no highway robbery has ever occurred . That a large community like this , wherein live many Northern men , where the irritations leading to disturbances have manifestly been so many , should be so peaceful , shows clearly that there is no wide-spread and deep-rooted trouble in the relations of the two races and the diverse beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the county , - a part of them adventurers in the better sense of the word , some men of small capital . On the whole , they are probably no better , no worse , than those who go to the new fields of the West . Where they were disposed to conform to the usages of Southern life in such unessential points as talking with everybody , and never expecting payments to be made very promptly , they seem to get along very well . If the traveller will examine into the condition of the people here and in the coast region of South Carolina , he will find very striking contrasts . The problems which arise with the change in the condition of the negroes in passing from slavery to liberty are apparently far advanced towards a solution in this northern part of our shore . In the Sea Island region they seem utterly beyond such a result . In South Carolina the negroes have gathered on certain of the shore islands , forming aggregations wherein there is scarce a trace of white influence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina , under very similar conditions , the association of the races is just what must be desired by all who wish to see the negro go forward with the dominant race . There is but one explanation of this . It is found in the fact that in the Pamlico region the negroes and whites were left to // work out the problems in their own way , with no considerable outside influence ; while in South Carolina governmental interference and private experiments by all sorts of reformers came in to complicate the matter . It seems to be a general rule in the South that the position of the negro in all important regards is in reverse proportion to the help which has been forced upon him . Where free rations , schools for which he has paid nothing , and volunteer leaders have abounded , his state is far worse than where he has been left to face his new conditions , with no other guide than his homely and healthy instincts . The schools have done good work , and are doing better , but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in part , directly for the teaching his child receives . There is one danger , however , before the race : their numbers are not increasing . The opinion is very general among physicians and other observant persons , that the death rate is not balanced by the births . The cotton seed is a ready sul ) stitute for ergot , and is used to an alarming extent . It is comparatively rare to see a negress looking as if she were preparing to add anything to the woes of the Maithusians . We have had it said recently that in some of the States , according to the census , the number of the negroes is as great as in 1860 , ergo the negroes are not decreasing , - a very hasty conclusion . For the first five years of the decade the race was under pretty much its old conditions in the greater part of the South . This should have added largely to the total of 1860 . Moreover , the fact that slaves were taxable property caused the returns to be always somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a well-known fact that property returns are always beneath the truth . Before the war the rate of increase of the negroes was far more rapid than among the whites . The superior race did all that could be done to push the reproduction to the highest point , for therein more than half the South found the real profit of slaves . It is useless to strive against such evils , as that above indicated , by moral influences alone . While the wages of the negroes are so small , any considerable increase in population is hardly to be desired . Until the South , through a more varied industry , develops capital more rapidly than at present , the increase // of the negro population in the rapid ratio of the years before the war would make it even more difficult for them to advance than at present . The greatest need the negro now has to meet is not more or better assured rights , but better wages . The ballot and spelling-book are potent instruments under certain circumstances , and in their time may do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to a man who , at his best , can earn only fifteen dollars per month , they mean nothing at all . He who would do the best for this people , must seek to establish in the South real industrial schools , manufactories and savings banks . They are the levers which will lift this race , if it is ever to rise . N. S. SHALER.
