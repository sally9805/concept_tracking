txt The Brooklyn Eagle is a paper which is not on our side in politics , but with which we have always endeavored to retain friendly and courteous relations , for two reasons  --  first , because it is an able antagonist , and . we like to meet able antagonists ; secondly , because it generally argues a question fairly , and does not drag inoffen ' sive women and children into its controversies , or tell lies , or fight with the weapons of an assassin . In all these respects , it affords a favorable contrast to its Democratic contemporary on this side of the river  --  the World . When , therefore , the Eagle asks us a question we are always glad to answer it  --  and if of late we have not replied to certain questions which it has addressed to us about Gen. Dix , it is because we can scarcely believe it to be in earnest in the assertions which it mixes up with those questions . Last night , however , it made the following remarks : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him 8 It says to-day that ' Ile is as strong with the Republicans as he was in ' 72 . ' We do not believe he is . We know ho ought not to be . Some facts have come out since ' 72 . In ' 73 , in February , it came out that Gen. Dm bad , by signing the Hozie con. tract , led to the swindling of the Union Pacific stockholders out of 48,000,000 . It also came out that he was charged on oath with blackmailing the Credit Mobilior ont of $50,000 . Ile was asked to explain these matters by Congress . He never did - so , or tried to do so , or let anybody else try to do so . Months ago the Eagle asked him , and since then scores of papers besides the Eagle have asked him , to explain these matters . He bee never done so ; no. body has tried to do so for him ; notably the Times has not . Now , will the Times explain those matters , try to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so I " What we have to say to-day in reply to this is that the charge of " blackmailing " is a very serious one to bring against the Governor of this State , and that we are very sorry to see tho Brooklyn Eagle make it . We do not believe that Gen. Dix has been a , party to any transaction which " swindled the Union Pacific stockholders out of $8,000,000 , " or that he " blackmailed the Credit Mobilier out of $50,000 . " Before we believe this we shall require very strong and unanswerable evidence . We have not seen that evidence , although the Brooklyn Eagle speaks of it as open and notorious to the world . If it will now tell us where that evidence is to be found , we promise to read it carefully , and to express our honest opinion upon it . Mere unsupported newspaper charges will not weigh with us , for the Eagle may have noticed that we have ourselves been the objects of many newspaper assertions which have not been of a nature calculated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dog ought not to be condemned upon " evidence " of that kind . But if the Eagle has any proof to offer of its statements ? proof of the kind which fair-minded men may conscientiously accept  --  we will give it our most careful attention , and let it know as soon as possible what we think of it .
