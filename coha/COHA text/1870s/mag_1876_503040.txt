BEFORE taking up in order the remaining letters of our alphabet , and the sounds which are suggested by them or connected with them , it may be well to consider some exceptions which have been taken and some suggestions which have been made in regard to what I have already said upon this subject in two previous articics . Those articles have brought me a plentiful crop of letters from all points of the compass , some of them written in an amusing tone of touchiness and irritability , lit is very remarkable , and to me quite inexplicable , this disposition on the part of many persons to resent the utterance of general views in regard to the use of language which may not accord with their own habits or their own observation . It is nothing new . On the contrary , it has marred the discussion of language for centuries . But could anything be more unworthy of a reasonable creature ? No man is free from liability to error ; and if a writer seems to you to err , and you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper , and it may be desirable , that you should try to do so . But if he has dealt with his subject in a general way , and has not attacked you personally , why should you be angry with him , and instead of merely correcting his mistakes and refuting his arguments , also in a general way , make it a personal matter , and atti*ck kim as well as his position ? And yet such is too often the style of controversy in regard to language , even in its highest and most abstract forms-in philology and in textual criticism . There was reason to hope that this very bad fashion had passed away ; but a certain Dr. Hall has shown to the contrary , and more recently we have seen an American philologist , of whose attainments we are all reasonably proud , abused " like a pickpocket " by another philologist of equal and world-wide dig .. tinction . Now I hold with Truthful James upon this question , that - It 's not a proper plan For any scientific gent to whale his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his pecnl1sz* whim you do n't happen to be " a scientific gent , " or to have given the subject in question any special consideration , it is certainly not well for you ho emulate that " quiet Mr. Brown " who was such a " sarcastic man " that On several occasions he had cleanedout the town . And yet it is from those who are not scientific gents , Ilud who have not even been close observers of contemporary usage in language , that there come most commonly resentful denunciations of those who do not agree with their peculiar whims . This , however , only by the way ; for of all the criticisms , by letter or in print , which I have received , much the greater number are written in a candid spirit and serene temper , and by persons whose views and whose testimony are valuable . And upon this subject of pronunciation testimony , the results of the observation of intelligent persons with sensitive , discriminating ears , is peculiarly valuable , because pronunciation is of all the elements of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ephemeral usage . Usage , of the highest authority and greatest weight in all departments of language , is in pronunciation the supreme and absolute arbiter . With regard to others , reason , historical affiliation , and logical coherence have some weight , be it more or less ; but if , for example , it is the habit of the best society to call a certain ornamental vessel a yaws , a yaws it is , and there an end ; that is English . Now , what usage is to decide this question of the sound of the names we give to things , // qwq pists themselves , even to each other . " Webster " and " Worcester , " which are prescribed for me , and crammed down my throat like two big boluses , are oniy valuable in this respect just in so far as they record and are able to express the usage of the best English speakers ; and Smart , perhaps the most unexceptionable of British oftho*pists that have yet attained reputation , has only a like position . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must go to the authority to which " Webster " and " Worcester , " and even Smart himself , must submit ; and any person who has not direct acquaintance with that , and who has not been able to satisfy himself , by his own close selfobservation and by the testimony of others , of the delicacy and discrimination of his ear , has no right to speak upon the subject , except as a quoter of the authority of others ; that is , not at all . Moreover , as to pronunciation , the observation of the average American is very untrustworthy ; for it is in that respect that the speech of the average American , however " polite " and " intelligeat " he may be , is most likely to deviate from the true English standard . As a people we utter our language vilely ; as a people we have a bad tone of voice , and very unpleasant inflections , in great variety of unpleasantness , according to the place of our birth and breeding . It is only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of high social culture , in New England and New York , and in the latter place among those of New England birth , or very direct descent , that the true standard of English speech is found in this country . And even there we too often find proper pronunciation marred by a bad enunciation  --  a tone nasal and drawling , united to a disposition to a slovenly dropping or slurring of syllables . The clear , firm , crisp enunciation of the well-bred Englishman , and particularly of the well-bred Englishwoman , is heard , even among our most cultivated people , with comparative rarity . What is it that has so vitiated the voices of most American men , and still more of most American women ? For there is no doubt that the fairer sex are in this respect the least to be admired . Among a hundred men you will find perhaps ten or a dozen who will open their mouths and speak clearly and freely ; but among a hundred women not more than one . You shall see a lovely , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , a woman who will carry you captive so long as she is silent ; but let her open her pretty lips , and she shall pierce your ear with a mean , thin , nasal , rasping tone which at once diminishes her charm . An English woman , even of the lower classes , will delight you with the rich , sweet , smooth , and yet firm and crisp tones in which she utters what may perhaps be very bad " grammar . " And since I am telling unpleasant truths about ourselves , I may as well say here that there is more of this among both Western men and women than among those in other quarters of the country . I recently went into one of our most frequented theatres to pass an hour . There was a scene in progress ; and I remained for the time standing just within the door . A lady was doing some emotional business , with a high manifestation of toilet and gesticulation . I listened a few minutes , and then , turning to an apparently official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situations and the personages of the play were unknown to me . " That , " he replied , in a tone of some awe ( for she was the " leading lady , " and the houses were very full ) , and looking at me much as if I had asked a like question as to General Grant or the statue of Washington in the square - " that is Miss - , " naming a Western actress of some celebrity . I listened for a few minutes more , and then fled the house . The tone of her voice propelled me from the door like a pellet from a pop-gun . All the emotional and sensational convulsions into which // she could have fallenwould not have allured me to sit under her ministrations of the English language for one quarter of an hour . And her speech bewrayed her as if she had been a female Peter ; for I knew before I was told , that she must have come from the region west of the Alleghanies . For the reasons given above , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common among ' polite " and " educated " people in various parts of the United States can not be accepted as at all decisive upon the question as to the correct pronunciation of a single English word . On the other hand , it must not be assumed that even in England or in London , where the best results of English culture have been brought together for many generations , and where they have a permanent establishment and a traditional continuity of influence , there is a rigid uniformity of pronunciation , a standard by which every person is or may be tried , at the peril of being condemned as illiterate or ill-bred for lack of conformity . Such criticism of each other 's language is not at all the habit of people of the best culture and breeding , who , even as to their own pronunciation as well as their " grammar , " are generally quite thoughtless , if not indifferent . They speak and write unconsciously the language that they hear spoken around them , and therewith they are content . Professor Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that " he who can not take to pieces his own native utterance lacks the true foundation on which everything else should repose . " But it should be remarked that , unless I misapprehend him , this refers not to correct pronunciation , but the comprehension of phonetics . Among those who speak the best English there is not one in a thousand who is more capable of taking his own utterance to pieces than of conjugating a Sanskrit verb of the tenth class ; and this I believe no one would more readily admit than Professor Whitne*y . To consider some objections and queries A lady , whose letter is dated at Watertown , N. Y. , referring to a remark in my last article upon this subject as to the disappearance of the European or ec sound of i , asks me to give her my pronunciatioa of profile . If this implies , as I think it does , that she pronounces the word prof eel . I venture to beg her , if she wishes to speak the best modern English , to change her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may . But even as to this word and oblique the ec sound is in very old persons no sign of lack of culture ; for that was the pronunciation of the best bred people in the days of our grandfathers , and even of our fathers . And here I must acknowledge and correct an error of inadvertence into which I fell when I said that oblique and oblige were the last words that retained this sound . There are several others in which it still retains a longestablished position . Of these I remember now antique , intrigue , fatigue , caprice , machine , mutine , marine , routine , and quarantine , and there may be others . Canine and rapine have that sound generally , but they are in process of change in this respect to the English sound of j . I wonder how my cynicasters public and private could have failed me here ; perhaps because I was really in error . As to the pronunciation of been I have received many protests from many quarters . The pronunciation of it with the ee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " cockneyish " ; to be that of " a cockneyish class of New Yorkers " ; to be " one of those modern purisaic refinements to which a part of good society in England and Boston has given itself " ; and so forth ; and I am told of various excellent and wellbred persons and various high-toned social circles by which no other pronunciation than bin is recognized . The last I am quite ready to admit ; nor ' would I for a moment imply that that pronunciation , or indeed any other of like frequent occurrence , is an evidence of want of culture or of inferior // associations . And let me , reverting to my previously mentioned correspondent 's request for my pronunciation , say that I am not setting up my pronunciation as a standard for others . Far from it . Indeed I do not know that I have any standard myself . I am only considering a subject to which I have given some attention in a general way for some years , and which appears to have now for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only to give some of the results of my studies and of my observation of others . That observation , I repeat , in the case of Englishmen as to whose culture and position there could be no question , is that the best English pronunciation of been makes it a perfect rhyme with seen . But I am not without evidence upon the subject which it would be hard to gainsay ; and it is all the more valuable because it is indirect . The noting of an exception proves a rule ; and what the rule is as to been has been thus shown by more than one recent English writer . For example , in " Hero Carthew , " a novel by Louisa Parr , those personages who are of the class of " gentry " say been , but those of an inferior class say bin . Thus an old sailor says : " Thauk'ee , sir . I ai n't much of a hand at speechifying , through allays having bin in the carpenter 's crew ; so the cap'n can tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind 's bin pretty stiff up there ' " ( Chap . 26 ) . This marking of bin as exceptional is proof sufficient that according to the observation of this English novelist the unnoticed been of her people of higher position and culture had not the sound of short i , and did not rhyme with sin . I have remarked the same distinction in the works of other English writers , although I have not at hand the passages in which it occurs . But this is sufficient for our purpose ; and taken in connection with my own observation , it seems to me to leave no room for doubt upon the question . At the same time it should be said that the pronunciation bin would not neces sarily be regarded as an evidenee of want of culture in the best English society ; but , if noticed at all , it might be looked upon as an evidence of Americanism in speech , although ben is more generally so regarded . The pronunciation bin is of long standing . I remember seeing a remonstrance against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , in a book some two hundred years old , which however I can not cite , as I neglected to take a memorandum of the passage . It is worthy of remark that in the novel which I have cited , " Hero Carthew , " the personages of inferior position not only say bin , but use expressions which are generally regarded as Americanisms of New England origin . For example : " My dear life ! ' exclaimed the woman , dropping a succession of courtesies . Well , meyer did ! ' " ( Chap . 2 ) . " If so be now I 'd a got anybody to give me a boost up , . . . she 'd take me right off the reel . ' " ( Chap . 26 ) . " I hope you find yourself pretty middlin ' , ma'am , and that you left Sir Stephen , " ' etc . ( Chap . 38 ) . It is by no means to be assumed without question that the fact that this pronunciation and these phrases , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book as characteristic of the speech of the unlettered rural people of a certain shire in England , shows a community of origin in them or an inevitable connection between them ; but it certainly does show a probability that such is the case , and the fact is certainly interesting . I can not now or hereafter notice the suggestions or the objections of more than one in a dozen of my correspondents upon this subject ; and I must at present confine my attention to two , one in California , the other in Boston ; both of whom , although the first is rude and the second is polite , seem to be men of more than usual culture and closeness of observation . Both of them protest strongly in favor of bin ; the one in Boston on the ground that it " is almost the only one in common use hereabout , and has the sanction of // men not usually considered slovens in speech " ; the other because " most authorities agree that the best pronunciation of this word at present is bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman Smart . " As to American usage , whether in Boston or in California , and its weight in the decision of a point in orthoilpy , I have already said all that it seems to me there is to be said upon the subject . The dictionaries of Webster and Worcester are both very valuable guides in pronunciation , to those who need a guide ; but I venture to say that they are not infallible ( if indeed infallibility is to be considered as attainable on this subject ) , and also that they can not be accepted as authoritative , except where they record the best English usage . Smart is deservedly held in high esteem in England , and is the most widely known of all English orthoilpists except Alexander Ellis , the President of the British Philological Society ; but according to my observation , a more trustworthy guide than Smart is the Rev. P. H. Phelp , of Cambridge university , England , who is responsible for the pronunciation given in Stormonth 's dictionary , to the great value of which I gave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smart gave bin as the proper pronunciation of been , for I had not consulted him upon the point ; and if he does so , I can only say that his observation of the best English speech differs in this respect from mine ; for I am not giving my " opinion " as to how words ought to be pronounced any more than he is giving his ; although some of my readers seem to think otherwise . On turning , as I write , to Stormonth , I find that Mr. Pheip gives been , with the sound of e as in mete ; which , I repeat , is the pronunciation that I have heard from all the best bred and best educated Englishmen whom I have met-men from Oxford and Cambridge universities , officers of the army , barristers , men of letters , peers and peers ' sonsa sort of Englishmen which the word " cockney " does not very accurately describe . Both of these correspondents also protest against the pronunciation of wound ( an injury ) as woond . One tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Webster says that " wownd was undoubtedly the primitive pronunciation , " which has survived in 8ound , found , etc . He adds that he thinks woond " is affected , and should be discouraged , " and that he considers futile the reason given by Professor Whitney for its encouragement ; i. e. , to distinguish it from the participle of wind . The other of these correspondents , he in Boston , also protests against " that most intolerable pronunciation woond for wound , " and rejects without qualification Professor Whitney 's plea in its favor , that it serves to distinguish the two wound. * . The precedent , he thinks would be disas* trous ; and he goes on to say : We should have to make a similar distinction , not only between the dual signilicatlons of " found , " " ground , " and several others , but we should have three meanings In " bound , " to prodde for , and not less than four in " pound " ; in which case I suppose one would be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , perhaps , " pond , " and the fourth  --  but heaven only knows what that would be . If this remarkable ortholipic principle is to obtain , the language will speedily be In a worse state than any other has ever been since the time of Babel . Foreigners have , it would seem , a sufficiently herd time already in learning our complicated language-not to mention the troubles of our own children ; but if , in addition , every shade of meaning in a word Is to be indicatedby a separate pronunciation , not even the natives will find seventy years long enough to master the Intricate structure . Such a procedure is simply retracing all the steps we have taken toward analogy since the old time of sweet license , when every one spelledwords to suit himself , without k*curring the reproach of Ignorance . And if this absurd rule Is not to be applied all through the list , why single out one word , neither more nor less Anglo-Saxon than Its companions of like termination , on which to fasten It ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phantom . There is no reasonable fear that the distinction between wound the noun and wound the participle , by pronunciation , will become a precedent ; nor is that distinction itself of any particular value . And I present to my // readers the remarks of these two correspondents upon this subject less be . cause of its intrinsic importance than for another purpose . Here we have two intelligent and well educated men not only earnest but vehement in their denunciation of a pronunciation which is so common among men of their own class that it is almost universal . There is no disputing that the correct-that is , the analogicalpronunciation of wound is not woond , but to rhyme with round and found . But by at least ninety-nine persons in a hundred in America it is pronounced woond ; and that the same pronunciation prevails among the best speak . ers in England there is , I believe , no reason to doubt . Both these gentlemen take exceptions to my dogmatism , and express surprise that I should be so decided in my difference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to which it seems they agree with him . But when he differs from them they have no hesitation or reserve in a still stronger expression of their counter judgments ; and one of them summarily brushes aside the distinguished philologist 's suggestion as " futile . " They furnish a very pretty example of the difference between orthodoxy , " my doxy , " and heterodoxy , " another man 's doxy , " which it seems obtains no less in ortho*py than in theology . They can appreciate the weight of an eminent scholar 's opinion when it is on their side ; but when it is destructive of their peculiar whim they have no scruples about setting it aside , by implication or in words , as futile . They are not singular in this . Upon all subjects we are all apt to take such views of the arguments or assertions for and against our own peculiar notions or habits ; and in regard to language , and particularly in regard to pronunciation , it seems that such feeling and prejudice is both stronger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , pronunciation is the very subject upon which such an attitude is most unwise and mistaken ; for , as I have before remarked , it is a mere matter of fleeting fashion , and is not worth all the pother that is made about it . The persons whose usage is most decisive upon the subject are they whose judgments in regard to it are most tolerant and intellectually charitable . When , however , one undertakes to record facts , or the results of observations in regard to speech , the very nature of the case makes positive assertion unavoidable . If a man has heard a word pronounced in a certain way by certain people , he has heard it , and he must say so , and there an end , or he must hold his peace . How different the result of such observation by two or three persons may be has already appeared , and will be further shown by the remarks of both these critics upon one or two other points . Both have something to say as to the pronunciation of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best speakers , particularly those of English birth and breeding , having led me to say that the " proper " sound of the vowel was that of short o , to rhyme with tog and hog . My California censor says : " The words ending in og can not , I think , be appropriately pronounced with short 0 ; for if not exactly the same , the transition is very slight between d% ' and dcthg ; and the latter is that , I think , given by the Oirish , and is not especially desirable . Hence I say dawg . " On the other hand my Boston correspondent writes : " In respect to God and dog my experience is that while the first is pronounced Gawd only by small-beer clergymen and the like , the second and tog are invariatty sounded with the aw , though by no means lengthened or drawled out . I can recall no instance of their being given the * sound . " As to this I can only say that my ears are wounded by the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose beer is not particularly small ; and that although I do hear tc&amp;wg from many such persons , I also hear tt*g from many others whose habits of life and // qwq but that on the contrary it was in his time slowly yielding , and has now yielded , to the pure sound of o . If this be the case , it merely furnishes another example of the fact that we pronounce words , not letters . There is , however , very little difficulty or disagreement as to the pronunciation of words of the o class which have the pure u or oo sound . It is in regard to the English or iotized u that there is uncertainty and disagreement ; a disagreement which is , or was , a shibboleth of cultivated speech . The Turveydrops of language would turn with aversion from a man who pronounced due or dew with the pure u sound , as do or too . And according to my observation , those words , and some others , as duty , new , stew , etc. , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some people a preceding d is softened by the iotized u into j ; so that I heard one of these persons , who had prejudice against the Hebrew race , object to residence at a suburb of New York , where many of that thrifty people lived , and went daily to business in the city , remark , with savage wit , that L ' . found the place would not suit him , because of the depressing dampness  --  the morning and the evening Jews . The introduction of the e ( or i ) before u is , however , difficult after r , 8 , or 1 . 11 , indeed , seems to be quite destructive of the English u , which after that consonant is always pronounced oo . The effect of the English u in rude or rule , for instance , is as ridiculous as its utterance is difficult . And I am surprised at seeing that Professor Whitney , who of course recognizes this difficulty and the consequent law of orthoi*py , includes fruit , brew , and rheum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound " more or less mixed with a preceding i or y sound " ; his other examples being duty , pure , due , feud , few , and 8tew . According to my observation , the best usage requires absolutely the iotized u ( e-oo ) in the last six words ; but as ab solutely the pure u , or oo , sound in fruit , rheum , and brew . Well-bred people do not laugh at each other 's speech ; but I think that if any vagary of pronunciation would provoke among such people an internal smile which might become visible , it would be the pronunciation of fruit and brew as f*re-aot and bree-oo . This I have never heard ; but I have heard from a few persons of some culture , but more affectation , a like pronunciation of column-eol-yume . Profesk*r Whitney seems however to have detected an intermediate sound between the pure u or oo and the iotized u ( eoo or you ) ; for he says : " In my usage , and in that of those who pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever between a pure u , the vowel sound of food and more , and an absolute yu , in which the y element is as distinctly uttered as it would be if it were written . The general rule with us , as with the rest , is that the y sound is prefixed ; and the exceptional cases in which the y is omitted and the u left pure are those in which the u is so preceded that the insertion of the semivowel ' between it and its predecessor is phonetically difficult . " To this rule there seems to me to be neither objection nor exception . Nor have I ever remarkedand I admit that , possibly from a dulness of ear or of speech , I can not conceive-an intermediate sound between the pure and the iotized u . An attempt to introduce it would , in my opinion be an affectation that would result in laughable disaster . This iotized u , which , as I have already remarked , is in my opinion of comparatively late introduction , I believe to have taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of that letter I believe to have been the Yankee u as heard in view , in true , in pure , and in fruit . This sound has been entirely misapprehended and absurdly caricatured . The stage Yankee , even in America , utters instead of it a sound which is quite as unlike it as either the pure u or oo , or // the jotized it , or &amp;iou , is  --  a snarling , nasal yeaou . But the real Yankee it is a simple sound , pure and clean of all admixture , and particularly so with regard to any nasality . It is very difficult of utterance by those who have not flexible organs of speech and who have not caught it among those by whom it is used unconsciously . It would have been heard in perfection from many a well educated Yankee of two generations past in his reading of Johnson 's couplet : Let observation with extensive view Survey mankind from China to Peru . He would have given the same it sound in Peru and in view ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voo in the other . His vowel would have had no trace of e ( or i ) , and yet it would not have been the pure or continental it . To express it by signs of any fixed value at present is quite impossible ; and I am therefore altogether unable to convey to my readers in type any suggestion of its sound , or te describe it , except by saying that it was , or rather is , something between the French it and the pure oo , and that so far from being a sneaking , nasal sound it is remarkably free , open , and firm . But thousands of my readers must have heard it , and there are tens of thousands of people in New England at this day by whom it is uttered without any consciousness that they have any peculiarity of speech . I know a gentleman of unusual intelligence , culture , and refinement in New York , whose it is invariably this Yankee it in perfection . This it sound I believe to have passed into the modern English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to me reason for believing that it had but two sounds , this one and thepure* sound ; the obscure , nondescript sound which is now heard in mud , cur4 ug4 , r , young being unknown ; words of that class having been pronounced at that time with the pure it sound , mood , eoorl oogly , yoong .

XII . of my edition of Shakespeare , 1862 , and also reprinted in Ellis 's " Early English Pronunciation , ' * Vol . H. , London , 1869 . We have now reached the consonants , which will be considered in the next paper upon this subject . RICHA1W GRAIIT WHITE .
