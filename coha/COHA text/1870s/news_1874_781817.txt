txt We have long foreseen the possibility of a missionary to our country from the heathen , and one has at last arrived in the person of WONG CHIN Foo . Alas , yes ! Bitter and humiliating as is the truth , he is a Chinaman ; nay , more  --  a political refugee , and doubtless the forerunner of a long line of distinguished Celestials who will leave their country to transfer their allegiance and their ambition to our soil . This antipodal celebrity , who speaks English perfectly , " and therefore , " according to the logical reporters , " sometimes even elegantly , " has recently arrived in Boston , and , with commendable zeal , has at once begun his labors among the skeptical people of that modern Athens . He does not appear to have felt it his duty to open his mission on the Pacific Coast , where the people of his race are popularly supposed to be destitute of souls , and where , once upon a time , a witness in a murder trial , being asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had never killed a man , but that " he believed he had ehot a few Chinamen . " Consternation , wide-spread and terrible , fell upon that Boston audience when WONG CHIN Foo lifted up his voice in the Parker Memorial Hall . For here was an audacious heathen from the extremest East , who lied not come to sit at the feet of the wise men of America , but essayed to teach them a lesson . In this uncompromising political refugee was none of the bland and deferential submission of the low-class Chinaman . His garments did not rustle with awe as he gazed at the massive shaft on Bunker Hill , nor did . he betray the slightest feeling of reverence for Plymouth Rock . No hint that America is to lead . the world , or that she will startle China from the inactivity in which she has lain so long passed his Oriental lips . No compliments to the society of the young and energetic continent on which be had so newly set his feet came from his oracular mouth . Paralyzed. by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened mutely to this child of the centuries , this apostle of fixedness , who , with delicate irony masked under velvet words , scoffed at the progress made by the sons of the Pilgrims , and laughed . their missionaries to scorn . Who shall say that he did . not , in the proud insolence of his barbaric scorn , foresee in vision the day when Chinese war-junks would anchor in Boston Harbor , and when the Hoodlums of San Francisco would be compelled to prostrate themselves before grotesque idols in Joss-houses ? Many things which were especially daring said WONG CIUN Foo to the affrighted Bostonians . He held up before their startled eyes a panorama of the doctrines of CONFIIaus , and with pride alluded to the fact that a stern observance of the five cardinal principles of that revered . Celestial , viz. : gravity , propriety , sincerity , virtue , and . filial love , had . allowed the Chinese " to maintain themselves as they had . for two thousand years . " Nothing that WONG CH Foo said , write the reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , or any desire to propitiate his hearers by yielding to their beliefs or working upon their prejudices . " Evidently not ; for this patriotic aristocrat defended . to the uttermost the custom of placing idols in temples , and . declared to the Boston audience : " We worship God . ten times nicer and quicker in this way than you can in your way . " He vaunted Chinese society as vastly more sincere , ingenuous and cultured than that of the United States and Europe . With a fine enthusiasm he described the Arcadian simplicity and kindliness of the Chinese country-folk , among whom " the cruelty , the barbarity , and the greediness " of European and American had not penetrated , and with pride declared that in an Empire where four hundred and fifty millions of people were crowded . together , there were not so many murders annually as in our sparsely-settled country containing forty millions . Finally , WONG CHIN Foo extolled the retiring and modest disposition . of the Chinese , and added that he was modest himself until he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm of politics in his native land , this Oriental refugee seems to have retained an unwavering love for and belief in the religion and society of the country of the Celestials , and he has begun an active missionary work here . He mourns over our incompleteness , our lack of repose and gravity , our profuse expenditure , our business greed , and our utter want of filial reverence . Nothing , he thinks , can lift us from our degradation but the religion of CONFUCIUS , which raised China from a low and disturbed condition , and gave her so many centuries of brilliant peace . WONG CHIN Foo earnestly expresses the hope that followers of the Chinese philosopher may at once spring up here ; and his audacity may yet result in a " Confucius class , " . into whose ranks young Boston may flock to listen to the teachings of the exiled . aristocrat . But let him not repeat his aspersions of our national manners and society outside of the Massachusetts metropolis . If he braves Americans elsewhere , he will find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , to reheat the unpatriotic inquiry of " Truthful James " - " Is civilization a failure ? And is the Caucasian played out ? " Let the earnest WONG beware . The fate of unsuccessful iconoclasts is hard .
