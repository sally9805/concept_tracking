Old-fashioned escritoire with chair . Folding doors across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fireplace , with picture of PAUL KAUVAR over it , and fire on andirons . Doors at the right and left of stage . At the Rise of Curtain , NANETTE crosses to fireplace and shovels ashes into a pail . POTIN is heard outside , singing , in loud and discordant tones , " La Marseillaise . " NANETTE . Starting up angrily . There 's that lazy man of mine , singing , while I work . Crosses to folding doors , flings them open and shouts roughly . Dodolphe !  --  Dodolphe Potin ! POTIN . Meekly , outside . Aye , aye ! NANETTE . I want you ! POTIN . Outside . Aye , aye ! NANETTE . Hurry up !  --  Do you hear ? POTIN . Appearing . I could hear your sweet voice if I were deaf as Justice . NANETTE . Fool ! Justice is blind , not deaf . POTIN . True ! That 's why you always get the better of me , dear . Justice listens too much and looks too little . NANETTE . Bah ! Pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POTIN . Crosses , lifts pail , and looks into it . Ashes !  --  Heigho ! Every fire has its ashes . NANETTE . Aye  --  and the fire that warms a man 's home may burn his house down !  --  Mark you that , Citizen . POTIN . Oh , I see ! You mean a wife , who should be a comfort , often proves a curse . NANETTE . I mean , Citizen Potin , that in days of revolution , husbands are easily suppressed . POTIN . Starting . Take care ! A word against the Revolution is treason and sure death . NANETTE . Bah ! Better death , than a life of terror like that in France to-day . POTIN . Terrified . Good heavens , Nanette ! Fewer words than these have guillotined our betters ! Can you never hold your tongue ? NANETTE . Never !  --  while I have a truth to tell . POTIN . Tell the truth ! Good Lord , that 's fatal . NANETTE . Aye , for in these noble days of liberty we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust . Damn it ! I must run or be ruined . Starts to go , but , in passing window , recoils with a cry of dismay . Sacristie !  --  See !  --  See there ! Points out of window . NANETTE . Contemptuously looking out of window . What now ? POTIN . There goes the Phantom ! NANETTE . Starting . The dumb girl of the guillotine ! POTIN . Who glides like a phantom through the streets , without home , friend , or occupation . NANETTE . With horror . Except to stand by the scaffold , and count the heads that fall from the guillotine . POTIN . They say that calamity overtakes everyone she follows : that it 's disaster to stand in her way , and sure death to notice her . NANETTE . Aye , even those who think themselves too great to believe in God , have faith in the fatal power of this pale child . My God ! look there ! POTIN . Good Lord !  --  It 's Mademoiselle Diane ! She 's crossing the street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go .  --  Hurry Mademoiselle here , before she has a chance to heed this messenger of misery . POTIN . Going hurriedly . Goddess of Reason , save us all ! Exit . NANETTE . Goddess of Reason !  --  A fine deity for days as mad as these ! Crossing to mantel and looking at KAUVAR 'S picture . Ah , Citizen Kauvar !  --  Patriot !  --  Revolutionist !  --  Bold son of Liberty , as you are !  --  You 'd love this age of terror less if it brought death to Mademoiselle Diane .  --  Yes , I 've watched ye , sturdy citizen , and in spite of your stern devotion to the Republic , I suspect you carry another idol in your heart . DIANE Outside , laughing . All right , Citizen ,  --  I 'll not forget ; though the poor crazed girl is not half as harmful as her saner neighbours . NANETTE . Ah ! Here she comes  --  Diane Leblanc ,  --  a ray of sunlight in this prison men call Paris . DIANE . Entering with flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See ! NANETTE . What  --  flowers ? Brings vase . DIANE . Yes , they bloom even in this reign of terror . Putting flowers in vase . But you see these fragile beauties are sinless , and therefore know no fear .  --  Is my father in his room ? NANETTE . No . He went away an hour ago . DIANE . Gone an hour , and not returned ? That makes me anxious !  --  Is Citizen Kauvar at home ? NANETTE . Not yet ! He 's been away all night . DIANE . Good heavens !  --  Nanette  --  can anything have happened ? NANETTE . Yes , what happens every day . Innocence is slaughtered ! DIANE . But he  --  Citizen Kauvar  --  ? NANETTE . Has doubtless fought all night to stop the useless flow of noble blood . DIANE . Yes , he is brave , merciful . NANETTE . Ah ! He was one of the fiercest champions of Freedom when the people first arose ; but now I think he 'd give his life to still the tempest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will return sad and worn ; we must do our best to cheer him when he comes . NANETTE . One look  --  one smile of yours will banish every thought of sorrow from his tired brain . DIANE . Hush , Nanette ;  --  you must not talk like that . A VOICE . Outside . Nanette !  --  Diane ! NANETTE . Startled . What 's that ? DIANE . Frightened . My father ! DUKE . Entering wildly . My child ! Diane !  --  Where is she ? DIANE . Rushing to him . Here !  --  Safe in your dear arms ! DUKE . Embracing her . Thank God ! Turning to NANETTE . My good Nanette , leave us alone awhile . NANETTE . Going . All right , Citizen . DUKE . And warn us when anyone is coming . NANETTE . At the door . Do n't fear ! I 'll stand good guard . Exit . DIANE . Father , why are you so moved ? DUKE . But now , the mob seized some poor young girl they found without protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your life , I hurried here in awful agony of mind . Ah ! Diane , this dread of peril to you is worse than the worst of deaths to me . DIANE . Take heart , dear father ! Does not Paul Kauvar , strong and true , stand between us and danger ! DUKE . Yes ; but ' t is hard that I , a peer of France , should owe my daughter 's life to a peasant 's son  --  a workman ! DIANE . A workman with a brush so potent that the noblest born do honour to his art . What would have been our fate but for his devotion ? DUKE . He 's a plebeian  --  a Republican ! The sense of my obligation to him  --  the enemy of my race  --  is almost unendurable . Ah , but for you I should long since have braved the scaffold and buried humiliation in the grave . NANETTE . Hurrying in . Take care !  --  A committee from the Section is on its way upstairs . DIANE . In fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , not strange ! Treachery is at every door . They are coming . Quick !  --  To your work ! The DUKE sits at the desk and pretends to write . DIANE sits at table and takes up sewing . NANETTE dusts . Knock is heard outside . NANETTE answers roughly . Come in ! Enter GOUROC , POTIN , GOUJON and two SANS CULOTTES . GOUROC . Health and fraternity , Citizens ! We come for Paul Kauvar , President of our Section . NANETTE . Gruffly . He 's not at home . GOUROC . Ah , indeed ! Sitting . Then we will await him here . All sit in silence . NANETTE . Aside , in irritation . Oh , the impudence of these men ! How my nails ache to get at their ugly faces ! Crossing . How often have I told you that this apartment is not a public office ? POTIN . But , my precious angel  --  NANETTE . Bah ! Religion is abolished , and angels are suppressed ! I wish friends were too ! POTIN . Laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's tongue ? NANETTE . What know you of a woman 's tongue ? POTIN . Enough to damn me , if knowledge were a crime . NANETTE . To GOUROC . Come , Citizen , there 's no use waiting . President Kauvar do n't do business at home ; you 've no rights here . GOUROC . Rising sternly . The patriot has unlimited rights , woman . He may dare all  --  violate all , in his zeal for the Republic . NANETTE . Well , then , dare my dusting . Strikes brush into her hand and sends dust all over GOUROC . GOUROC . Moving off , sputtering . Who is this , Citizen Potin ? POTIN . Proudly . My wife , Citizen Gouroc . GOUROC . Who taught her manners ? POTIN . The Goddess of Liberty , a rough and ready teacher . GOUROC . Who teaches with sharp tools . NANETTE . Aye  --  tools so sharp they often cut the fools that use them . Mark that . GOUROC . Crossing to DIANE . You are the wife of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The DUKE rises and advances with stern hauteur . At sight of GOUROC , he starts , and surveys him with amazement . Well , old man , are you mad , or do you know me ? DUKE . Significantly . I think we have met before . GOUROC . Yes , and may meet again . Permit me to introduce myself . I am Citizen Gouroc , of the Jacobin Club , and one of the Public Accusers of the Revolutionary Tribunal . DIANE draws close to NANETTE . Now , who are you ? DUKE . I am George Leblanc , private secretary to Paul Kauvar . GOUROC . Ah , indeed !  --  His private secretary ? Then I can do my business with you . It is said that two aristocrats in disguise are lurking about this house . All start . I must communicate with you in secret , Citizen . Turning to DIANE . Are you the daughter of this old man ? DIANE . I am his daughter , Diane Leblanc . GOUROC . You remain . To SANS CULOTTES . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CULOTTES. and you , Citizen Potin , take your wife , leave the room , and wait within call . You understand ? POTIN . I do , Citizen . When the Republic commands , I obey . Exit , with NANETTE . GOUROC . Bowing with great politeness . Monsieur le Duc de Beaumont . DIANE starts . DUKE . Turning with contempt . Monsieur le Marquis de Vaux . DIANE Amazed . This  --  the Marquis de Vaux ? GOUROC . You are surprised to see me in this garb . I am equally surprised to find you the guests of Citizen Kauvar , President of the Republican Section of Fraternity . DUKE . Not quite as strange as discovering the dainty Marquis de Vaux a Public Accuser and the servile slave of the guillotine . GOUROC . Reserve your contempt till you understand the meaning of my presence here . I come to warn you against your host . DIANE . Haughtily . How , sir ! You suspect the loyalty of Monsieur Kauvar ? GOUROC . What if he has trapped you here only to betray you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kauvar is the soul of honour and devotion . DUKE . Besides , his head is surety for ours . The discovery that he had sheltered us would entail his own death . GOUROC . Precisely ! And what if the sense of that danger had prompted a denunciation , while there still was some merit in it ? The DUKE starts . DIANE turns aside with scorn . One thing is certain : an anonymous denunciation of you , describing your disguise and your retreat , has been made to our club . DIANE . Clasping her father . What !  --  Discovered and denounced ? GOUROC . As Public Accuser , the denunciation fell first into my hands . I have risked my life by withholding it from the Tribunal until your safety is assured . DUKE . Giving GOUROC his hand . Pardon , Marquis , that I did not realize before the motives of your course . GOUROC . Grant me , then , the privilege of saving you . DUKE . We will . You belong to our own race ; we may trust you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANE . Starting . Flight ! Where can we be safer than under our present host 's protection ? GOUROC . Under mine , Mademoiselle . Kauvar is a man of the people . To him such words as loyalty , truth and honour are but empty puffs of air . DIANE . Proudly and passionately . On whose lips is there meaning purer , or prouder , than on Paul Kauvar 's ? DUKE . With haughty surprise . Mademoiselle ! When you speak so warmly , you forget the distance that separates you from one of his rank . Cries in the distance of " To the Guillotine ! " with the roll of muffled drums . DIANE . In solemn voice . Nay , father , listen !  --  Do we need more to remind us of the nearness of the protected to the protector ? The DUKE listens with bowed head . GOUROC goes to window . DUKE . To GOUROC , as drums draw near . Is it the patrol ? GOUROC . Solemnly . No . ' T is the guard of the death-cart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiding her face . This constant agitation is torture . GOUROC . You can easily escape it , Mademoiselle . Accept the refuge I offer you . DUKE . We will , Marquis , at once . Come to my room , and we will complete our plans . To DIANE . My child , prepare to leave this house to-night , in haste and in secret . Exit with GOUROC . DIANE . Fly from this house to-night ?  --  No ! I will not go ! And yet I must , or tell my father the secret I have kept from him so long . PAUL . Outside . I am not at home to anyone . I will not brook intrusion here . NANETTE . Outside . I 'll keep out all I can . DIANE . Paul is coming !  --  How can I tell him we must part ? PAUL enters . DIANE turns quickly toward him . PAUL . Absorbed in documents he is carrying . Crossing slowly to desk , he lays the papers down and , turning , sees DIANE . Diane ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning gesture ; crosses quickly to the door , listens a moment , then slowly approaches PAUL , looking back anxiously . Have you no word of welcome for a very weary friend ? DIANE . Throwing herself with nervous impetuosity into his arms . Ah , Paul ! God bless and keep you ! PAUL . God blessed me beyond measure , when he made your heart my own . DIANE . Leading him with nervous intensity to a chair . Sit here  --  sit here ! She sits beside him . Let me look at your face , and listen to your voice , while I can  --  while I can ! PAUL . How strangely you say this ! DIANE . Do you remember the old days  --  before this reign of terror darkened all our lives  --  the sunny room in my father 's chateau , where you taught me to paint the flowers we had gathered  --  oh ! so gaily !  --  from the quaintest corners of the garden ? PAUL . Ah , those were ideal days .  --  You , almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rosebuds in your hair . DIANE . Oh , how happy I was !  --  So happy , earth seemed heaven ! So happy , sorrow seemed almost a myth !  --  I little dreamed that I would ever drink the bitterest dregs of that black cup .  --  The Revolution rushed upon us  --  and then , oh then !  --  Hides her face on PAUL 'S breast . PAUL . Then we parted , I thought forever . DIANE . You came no longer . The sunshine lost its smile  --  the flowers faded . PAUL . And yet , amidst the fearful tumult of these distracted times , we met once more . DIANE . Starting up . Oh , my God ! That meeting ! I see the frightful scene again ! My father there before me  --  old  --  helpless , dragged from his own house by a horde of brutal beasts .  --  I , shrieking , righting vainly at his side  --  amidst their mocking laughs and jeers . Ah ! I can hear them now  --  yes , and high above their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is yours  --  silencing this crowd of curs !  --  With what sublime audacity you claim my father as your cousin , saving him and me , by the coolness of your courage !  --  Paul , from that hour you were more than man to me ; you were a God , a hero , my father 's Saviour ! PAUL . Rising . Better than all that now  --  your lover  --  guardian  --  husband . Embraces her , then staggers . DIANE . Paul  --  what is it ? PAUL . Nothing ,  --  fatigue from last night 's bitter work . DIANE brings wine and offers it . He puts it away . No  --  one kiss from you will give me more strength than all the wine in France . She kisses him . DIANE . Heaven knows you need more than human strength . PAUL . Aye , Titan strength , to stem the tide of madness that overflows the mind of France ! Ah , Diane ! if it were not for your dear love , I fear my mind would falter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why undertake this task ?  --  Why not fly to peace in other lands ? PAUL . Fly !  --  Desert France in the hour of her agony ?  --  In the awful travail which gives birth to a new and nobler era for mankind ?  --  No , no ! I love you more than life , but my Country  --  ah , that is mother , sister , wife , and child ! DIANE . But Paul  --  PAUL . Hush , sweetheart , you must not make the struggle harder ! The infant age is threatened with miscarriage !  --  The torch of Liberty , which should light mankind to progress , if left in madmen 's hands , kindles that blaze of Anarchy whose only end is ashes . DIANE . Suddenly starting . Hush ! Listen ! What is that ? PAUL . After listening . Nothing , foolish child . He is about to embrace her . DIANE . Turning sadly away . Nay , we are too rash ! We forget the dangers that environ us . PAUL . Would we could forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Oh , that something would happen to make us end this living lie ! DIANE . Solemnly . Perhaps that something has happened , Paul . We have been warned that we 're no longer safe beneath this roof . PAUL . Amazed . Warned !  --  By whom ? DIANE . What matter by whom ?  --  Enough that we 've been told the Civil Guard may search the house this very day . PAUL . With sudden resolution . I am glad of it . Thank fate that something forces us to tell your father you are mine . DIANE . Nay , Paul  --  I can not , dare not tell him that ! PAUL . Then leave the task to me . DIANE . ' T would be but to win his curse . You little dream the deathless pride that 's rooted in his heart ! To wrench out that pride would break the heart that holds it . PAUL . Bitterly . Then let it break ! I , too , am proud , Diane , proud as all are proud to be who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of a king !  --  If your father scorns the sacred work of heaven 's hand , then he is only fit for scorn himself . DIANE . Oh , Paul ! Be charitable ! PAUL . Charitable ! To what ?  --  Your father 's pride in the race from which he springs  --  the race whose iron rule for centuries stamped shame on honest labour  --  crowned infamy with honour  --  made gods of profligates and dogs of workingmen  --  ruining their wives  --  insulting their mothers  --  debasing their daughters , and sewing the seeds of madness in their veins ?  --  Ah , Diane ! when I face your father , ' t is not your husband who should blush for his race . DIANE . My father 's race is mine .  --  I forgot its glories , and atoned its wrongs in marrying you !  --  But I love , revere , my father still , and have hoped each day that he would come to love you for your saving care of me  --  and grow content to take you as a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANE . Sadly . Ah , no ! The more you do for me , the more his pride revolts , till now I dare not tell him of our marriage . PAUL . Diane  --  listen . The time has come when you must choose between us . I staked my life in saving yours , and his ! He loves but little if he hesitates to keep the precious life I saved unmarred by sorrow . DIANE . Well , then , so be it ! Have your will ! But oh , seek first his blessing for our love , before you tell him of our secret marriage . PAUL . My love for you will teach me tenderness for him . Go now and send him here . Kissing her . Courage ! All may yet be well . Exit DIANE . PAUL sits at desk wearily . Hateful humiliation !  --  to stoop in pleading for that already mine ! But patience , Paul Kauvar ; he is the father of the woman you adore . DUKE . Entering and advancing to PAUL . One word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this house without farewell , but I can not be so cruel . I have learned that this is no longer a safe retreat . I am forced to seek one safer . PAUL . And where will you find one , Monsieur ? DUKE . I shall best serve you by keeping that a secret . PAUL . And does your daughter go with you ? DUKE . Could you think that I would leave her here ? PAUL . Certainly , Monsieur . If to stay seemed less perilous than to go . Why not let me replace you for awhile ? DUKE . You guard my daughter here alone ? PAUL . In my character of cousin to Diane Leblanc , gossip has already united us by even a closer tie . DUKE . To my infinite annoyance , sir . PAUL . Monsieur le Duc , in times like these , Madame Kauvar would be far safer than Mademoiselle de Beaumont . DUKE . With quiet hauteur . There are some means of safety forbidden to my rank , sir .  --  Pardon me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAUL . What if I dared to love your daughter , to hope that you would grant me the right to guard her as my wife ? DUKE . Seriously ? PAUL . Seriously ! DUKE . Shrugging his shoulders . This is another of the many insanities of the times . PAUL . Haughtily . Suppose I had reason to believe that your daughter would consent ? DUKE . Sternly . One moment , Monsieur ! Your first proposition involves but madness ,  --  your last implies dishonour . PAUL . Indignantly . Dishonour ! Checking himself . Monsieur , honesty is honoured now , even though it be not allied to an empty title . ' T is not a crest , but character , that measures manhood in this modern age . Therefore I do not fear to tell you  --  DUKE turns quickly . PAUL hesitates. that I love your daughter . DUKE . With terrible contempt . And you take this time to declare it ! When you have burdened me with obligations that leave me powerless at your feet ?  --  when I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible bargain for the father 's life . PAUL turns fiercely . The DUKE checks him . No more , sir ! Happily I have two securities against dishonour : my child 's sense of what is due to herself  --  my own scorn of life purchased at such a price . PAUL . Perhaps your daughter may not deem the protection of my name so great a degradation as yourself .  --  Dare you put her to the test ? DUKE . What test can you propose ? PAUL . Seating himself at desk and writing . Here is a pass procured at the risk of my life .  --  I fill it out for George Leblanc .  --  It will convey you , alone , safely beyond our borders . Here is another . I make this out for George Leblanc and Diane his daughter . This will enable both of you to escape .  --  These passes have the signatures of the chief of police ; I countersign them , thus  --  a double surety for you , a double risk for me.  --  Now , Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter may decide , if you will offer her the choice of remaining under my protection , or of leaving France with you . DUKE . Striking a bell . The choice is at her will . Enter NANETTE . Send my daughter here at once . Exit NANETTE . PAUL . One word , Monsieur . These passes are at stake , and my life as well . I promise to be bound by the decision of your daughter .  --  If she decides to remain , you promise to go and leave her here with me ? DUKE . I promise this on one condition . I pledge my honour to put the alternative fairly before her . You must pledge yours to use no word to influence her choice . PAUL . I pledge myself to silence . DIANE . Entering pale and anxious . You sent for me , Father ? DUKE . I did . Listen , child . I am about to leave France . By my side there is peril  --  here is safety . Answer frankly : will you follow me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANE . Aside . What can this mean ? He could not ask this if he knew the truth . Aloud . Father , I do not understand .  --  What shall I say ? DUKE . What your heart prompts , child . Turning away . Nay , do not hesitate ; I will not influence your choice even with a look . DIANE . If I shrink from danger , if I stay here , what becomes of you ? DUKE . I go alone . DIANE . Alone to meet your peril ?  --  Then , by the bond of a daughter 's duty , my place is at my father 's side . PAUL staggers . The DUKE retires quietly to desk . DIANE speaks aside to PAUL . Remember he is old , with none but me to comfort his last days . PAUL . With stern self-control . Monsieur , the double pass for George Leblanc and Diane his daughter has been fairly won . Hands the pass to the DUKE , bows coldly , and leaves the room without a look at DIANE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE . Looking suspiciously at DIANE . Could there be warrant for his strange presumption ? If so , this separation is none too soon . Enter GOUROC . Ah , Marquis , congratulate us . We are now released from all need of burdening even you .  --  See ! Here is a pass which opens the doors of our prison . We fly to-night to Vende , where we hope you may soon rejoin us , and our cousin Rochejacquelein . GOUROC . Aside . The devil !  --  Aloud . You are fortunate , Duke . Alas that I can not go with you ! DUKE . Well , come , Diane ; time flies . We must prepare for our escape . Going with DIANE . Au revoir , Marquis . GOUROC . Au revoir , Monsieur le Duc , and bon voyage , Mademoiselle de Beaumont . Exeunt the DUKE and DIANE . GOUROC changes to a fierce and hurried manner . Ah !  --  Not so fast , dear Duke ! You 're not out of France yet . This sudden flight destroys all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions , will get beyond my reach .  --  No !  --  death , dishonour  --  nothing shall snatch her from me now !  --  Aye , but how to prevent it ? Reflecting . The Duke has not many years to live , and in these ticklish times old men 's days are easily shortened . He dead , his daughter 's at my mercy . With sudden triumph . I have it !  --  I see the way to place her wholly in my grip !  --  A brilliant move and easy to execute !  --  Kauvar knows nothing of my rank ! Rings bell , goes to desk and begins to look at papers . Yes , these are what I need to guarantee my triumph ! Enter POTIN . Have you any blank warrants ? POTIN . I have !  --  I keep them always handy , especially for the petticoat sex . Giving them . I say , Comrade , I hope it 's a she-man this time , for there 's nothing like this  --  Making sign across throat. to stop the wag of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ante-room.  --  I may want you to summon a guard . POTIN . Going . All right , Citizen ! I 'm always ready at the call of the Republic . Exit . GOUROC . Good !  --  Now to secure my victory !  --  But where can I find Kauvar ? Starts for door . KAUVAR enters , absorbed in thought , without seeing GOUROC , who watches him . He 's just in time ! Fate conspires with me for success . PAUL seats himself at desk and buries his face in his arms .  --  GOUROC goes over quietly and touches him on the shoulder . PAUL . Starting up in dismay . You here , Gouroc ! GOUROC . I am , old friend ,  --  though you seem scarce glad to see me . PAUL . Pardon , Comrade ; you find me at a moment when my mind 's absorbed with many cares . GOUROC . I understand ;  --  in times like these perplexity pursues the patriot . I would not now intrude , dear friend , if duty did not force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what duty can bring you here ? GOUROC . I have important warrants for your signature . PAUL . Sitting again , with a sigh of relief . Another time .  --  I can not sign them now . GOUROC . Firmly . Friend , the business of the Republic is sacred ; it can not be postponed . PAUL . Wearily . Well , well !  --  What are these warrants ? Takes up pen carelessly . GOUROC . Calling off papers , as he gives them to PAUL to sign . Warrants for the arrest of Catherine Cler  --  PAUL signs . Maxime Berton  --  PAUL signs . Marie Legrand  --  PAUL signs . And this blank warrant for a suspected party , whose name that fool Potin has registered so badly that I must get him to decipher it before I can fill it in . PAUL signs mechanically . Aside . ' T is done !  --  And she is mine ! Aloud . Shall you be at the club to-night , friend ? PAUL . Shortly . No ! Night comes on . GOUROC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say I am busy  --  busy  --  Striking his breast. breaking the heart of a traitor to France ! GOUROC . Going . A welcome message .  --  I sha' n't forget it . Exit . PAUL . Wife gone !  --  Home desolated !  --  Naught left but the haunting memory of joy forever lost !  --  Ah , I am weary , heart-broken  --  helpless ! He sinks into the chair at desk , and buries his face in his arms . Slowly the light dims to darkness . At back , the stage is transformed into a TABLEAU OF KAUVAR 'S DREAM OF ANARCHY . Mysterious music accompanies the Dream , which consists of a tableau of the guillotine in the Place de la Revolution , in Paris , by moonlight . Here is seen the scaffold , with its ghastly paraphernalia , surrounded by ferocious SANS CULOTTES , and GENS D'ARMES . Amidst them is an old hag . The death-cart , with its load of victims , is seen in the foreground  --  the entrance to the garden with the palace of the Tuilleries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guillotine From the death-cart DIANE glides on and slowly goes up the scaffold steps . As she reaches the top , she is seized roughly by the HEADSMAN . At this moment PAUL starts with a cry of agony from his chair  --  and at his shriek , the whole Tableau of the Dream instantly disappears . PAUL . Starting up wildly . No , no !  --  My life for hers !  --  My life for hers ! Waking , as the Dream disappears , he looks about dazed and bewildered ; then bursts into hysterical laughter . A dream !  --  Thank God , a dream !  --  Only a horrible dream ! Suddenly stops short in horror . How dark and still the house is . My God !  --  Something has happened !  --  What is it ? Shrieks with terror . Diane !  --  Diane ! NANETTE . Entering with lamp . What 's the matter ? PAUL . Diane  --  Mademoiselle Diane , where is she ? DIANE . Appearing , dressed to go away . Here ! PAUL . Makes a spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NANETTE . Leave us ! NANETTE goes silently away . PAUL speaks to DIANE hoarsely . Where are you going ? DIANE . I am going to do my duty  --  follow the father who would die without my care . PAUL . After a pause . Yes , I remember now .  --  You are right .  --  You will be safer out of France .  --  The dream ! The dream ! DIANE . What dream ? PAUL . No matter ! I am resigned now ! Yes , resigned  --  resigned  --  resigned ! Sinks sobbing into chair . DIANE . No , no , Paul !  --  I can not endure this !  --  I will stay ! I will stay ! PAUL . Starting up . No ! You must not ! I dare not keep you here .  --  I fear the worst ! DIANE . What do you mean ? PAUL . Do n't ask me . I do not know myself . But you  --  when you are gone  --  you will not forget me ? DIANE . Not while memory lasts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  shall be free to seek you . DIANE . God grant that day is near ! PAUL . And we  --  when we meet again , will you find courage to acknowledge who I am ? DIANE . Nay  --  if you desire it  --  I 'll prove my deathless love before I go .  --  I 'll tell my father all . PAUL . No , never !  --  Never till I 've won a name that even your proud father is forced to honour . Meantime , I ask but this  --  your love and trust , while I have life to strive . DIANE . You shall have it !  --  Yes , through sunshine and shadow , I will love and trust you to the end . They embrace . DUKE . Outside . Nanette , the coach is ready : be quick , bear our baggage to the door . PAUL and DIANE separate quickly . Entering , the DUKE glances suspiciously at the two , then advances to PAUL . Paul Kauvar , let us not part in bitterness . I owe you much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe me , I never honoured you as I do now . Extends his hand . PAUL turns away . Will you not take my hand ? PAUL . No , Monsieur . Not until you think it worthy to guide and guard your daughter , as my wife . DUKE . Starts haughtily , then turns to DIANE . Come , child ! ' T is time that we were gone . DIANE . Crossing and extending her hand to PAUL . Farewell ! PAUL . Taking her hand , speaks aside to her . Remember , love and trust . DIANE . Forever ! PAUL kisses her hand . She comes slowly to her father , keeping her eyes in anguish on PAUL . The DUKE leads her toward the folding doors which are suddenly thrown open , disclosing a platoon of GUARDS . DIANE shrieks , the DUKE starts back , PAUL turns in horror . TABOOZE advances into the room . TABOOZE . In the name of the Republic , I arrest Honor Albert Maxime , heretofore Duc de Beaumont . DIANE . Clasping the DUKE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  Whose name is on that warrant ? TABOOZE . With surprise . Why , your own , Citizen . PAUL recoils , stunned . DUKE . What ! Betrayed by you ? DIANE . No , no ! It is not true ! Snatching the paper , looking , then with a cry . Great , heaven !  --  It is !  --  His name and hand ! She sinks down in despair . PAUL . Passionately , to the DUKE . I betray you !  --  I , Paul Kauvar.  --  ' T is false ! To DIANE . You at least will not believe this lie . DUKE . Interposing . Silence ! Better death to her than the pollution of another word from you ! PAUL . But my God !  --  You do not know .  --  She is  --  DIANE . Starting up wildly . Stop !  --  I forbid you to say more ! CURTAIN . ACT II . SCENE . Interior of the Prison of the Republic . A room with cells .  --  Entrance to outer corridor . Table with chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mob are heard outside . POTIN . Entering in the midst of the howls , then clapping his hands to his ears . Oh , that I were deaf ! Then I 'd escape the shriek of my wife , and the roar of this cursed tribunal condemning poor devils to death . Renewed howls . Aye , that 's right ! Howl on , hyenas ! I could howl , too , yesterday , as well as the worst of ye . But I ca n't now ; no , not since the arrest of the poor old Duke . There he lies , in yonder cell , and here am I quartered as a witness against him  --  and that villain Gouroc has done all this ! Enter GOUROC quietly in the background . Curse him ! He rules me with a rod of red-hot iron ! I wish I had him here now ! By the gods ! I 'd take courage for once ; I 'd tackle him with my tongue  --  like my wife . I 'd say  --  GOUROC . Advancing coolly . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside , startled . The devil take you ! GOUROC . What would you say ? POTIN . Nothing !  --  anything !  --  everything ! GOUROC . That 's lucky !  --  I have much for you to say before the day is done . The trial of the Duke will soon begin . When asked who gave you the order for the Duke 's arrest , you must swear that it was Paul Kauvar who did so . POTIN . Why , Lord help me ! ' T was you who gave me the order , and forced me to carry it , too . GOUROC . Possibly ; but , in spite of that , my name must not be mentioned in the affair , to any one , do you hear ? POTIN . Alas , I do ! GOUROC . And will swear as I command ? POTIN . With sudden resolution . Never ! GOUROC . Do you care to save your head ? POTIN . Of course ! What could I do without it ? GOUROC . If you refuse to attest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason in trying to conceal the presence of the Duke in Paris . Such a declaration from me is sure perdition to you . How say you now : will you swear ? POTIN . Wilting . I will swear . GOUROC . You are wise . Going . Within an hour , the trial comes on . Be at hand , or  --  Making a sign across his throat . There 's nothing like this to quiet a traitor 's tongue . Exit . POTIN . Looking after him . To lie living , and be a coward  --  or to lie dead , and be a corpse ; that 's the riddle.  --  No ! I 'll be neither a coward nor a corpse . I 'll run away !  --  run like a brave man , enlist in the army of Vende , and so escape damnation , and my wife . Starts off . Liberty , lend thy wings that I may fly  --  NANETTE appears . Ye gods !  --  Fate is false again ! NANETTE . Ha ! It 's you , is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here , I 'm nobody . NANETTE . Where 's the Duke ? POTIN Pointing . In that cell . NANETTE . And I believe ' t was you betrayed him ! POTIN . Indignantly . That 's a lie ! NANETTE . Well said ! Short and sharp , like the truth . She pats POTIN on the back . He turns away . Bravo !  --  But one moment ! Do you know who did betray him ? POTIN shakes his head mournfully . You do know ! I can see by the wag of your head you know , and I mean to make you tell me !  --  But I ca n't stop now ; I 'm here to see Mam'selle Diane ; where is she ? POTIN . Pointing to cell . There  --  with her father . NANETTE . I 'll be back soon , and then I 'll give you a piece of my mind . POTIN . Give me peace if you like , dear , but keep the mind for yourself ; you 've none to spare . NANETTE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . POTIN . Yes , it 's woe to me whene'er we meet !  --  But now to fly ; I 've no time to lose ; between my wife and Gouroc , I shall go cracked . So here 's for liberty , and Vende ! Exit into his room . Enter GOUROC , followed by GUARDS escorting MARDOCHE . GOUROC . To GUARDS . You may leave the prisoner with me . Exit GUARDS . And so , Mardoche , you have been tried and condemned . MARDOCHE . Yes . Accused by beasts , tried by fools , and condemned by assassins . GOUROC . And of what were you accused ? MARDOCHE . I was a quiet cobbler ; I made shoes for Jacobins that pinched their toes , so I was accused of sympathy with aristocrats . GOUROC . Is this all the cry they raised against you ? MARDOCHE . No . I was never heard to swear , so I was watched  --  and was seen upon my knees . As piety is poison to the Republic , I was accused of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found upon me . Showing a crucifix and rosary . This was enough . I was immediately condemned to die . GOUROC . A fine fool you were , to be caught with such baubles in your bosom . Had you forgotten old mother Dupaix ? MARDOCHE . The old woman who never gossiped , wore clean linen , and kept four cats ? GOUROC . The same  --  who was therefore accused of being a Duchess in disguise , and sent to the guillotine . MARDOCHE . Moral :  --  In this age of reason , death to him who prays ! GOUROC . Or keeps four cats ! But cheer up , Citizen ; I have a crumb of comfort for you yet . In your cell someone is waiting impatiently to see you . MARDOCHE . Who ? GOUROC . Your sister . MARDOCHE . Great heavens ! Of what do they accuse her ? GOUROC . Nothing . She is here by my care to bid you farewell .  --  Listen and understand .  --  You are going to die , and leave your sister in poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be willing to do to provide her with an independence ? MARDOCHE . I would do anything . I can do nothing . GOUROC . You are mistaken . If you choose , before you die , you can place in her hands 10,000 francs . MARDOCHE . How ? GOUROC . By helping me to save another man 's life . MARDOCHE . I do not understand . GOUROC . The Duc de Beaumont has been discovered , and is about to be condemned . For reasons of my own , I wish to save his life . There is but one way . You , who are destined to die soon , must be disguised as the Duke , answer to his name , and go to the scaffold in his stead . Consent to do this  --  and you shall place in your sister 's hands 10,000 francs in gold . MARDOCHE . What ! That Jacobin of Jacobins , Gouroc , asks a cobbler to save a Duke  --  ? GOUROC . Why not ? The Republic is poor , the Duke is rich . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret escape will bring us gold , why not crown the Republic with riches as well as fame ? Is not this Patriotism ? MARDOCHE . Yes , Patriotism to-day ! Yesterday and to-morrow  --  Jesuitism . GOUROC . Well , your answer . Will you save the Duke ? MARDOCHE . After a pause . I will . GOUROC . Good ! In your cell you 'll find everything for your disguise . MARDOCHE . As howls are heard outside . Listen .  --  That is the voice of fraternity shrieking for fratricide ! GOUROC . By heaven ! No cobbler talks as you do !  --  Who are you ? What are you ? MARDOCHE . A victim  --  to present madness ! An atonement  --  for past wrongs ! A pledge for future progress !  --  The Abb de St. Simon . GOUROC . Ha ! As I suspected . SOLDIERS are heard approaching . Take care !  --  Hurry to your cell ; they are coming for the Duke . MARDOCHE . And my sister  --  ? GOUROC . You shall have the money at your parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than all the years I might have lived to love her . Exit . OFFICER . Entering , followed by GUARDS , and presenting paper to GOUROC . An order for the person of Duc de Beaumont . GOUROC . Looking at order . Correct .  --  There is his cell . OFFICER . Reading from paper at the door of DUKE 'S cell . Honor Albert Maxime , heretofore Duc de Beaumont , you are called for trial for your life . In the name of the law , stand forth ! The DUKE appears with DIANE clinging to him , followed by NANETTE . DUKE . I am ready . The GUARDS surround him . OFFICER . To DIANE . Young woman , free your father ; he must follow me alone . DIANE . If he is guilty , then I am guilty . I have shared his prison ; I claim the right to share his scaffold . OFFICER . You are not called , and can not go with him . DUKE . Courage , child ! Remember who you are , and scorn to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast . We shall meet again .  --  Turning to OFFICER . Lead on , sir . The GUARDS go of with the DUKE .  --  DIANE falls into a chair near table , overcome . NANETTE approaches her ; GOUROC waves her back . GOUROC . Pointing to cell . Wait there , till you 're wanted . NANETTE goes out sullenly . GOUROC draws near to DIANE . At last I 'm free to crave your pardon for the part I 'm forced to play in these dark days of tragedy .  --  Say you forgive me . DIANE . I have nothing to forgive , sir .  --  You did not betray my father , and if you dare to feel for such as we , then it is for the Republic to pardon your secret treachery . GOUROC . Always cruel , Madamoiselle . If you knew the truth , you could not wound me with your scorn . DIANE . Going . If my face offends you , I will go . GOUROC . Stay , and be just .  --  I am the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin of the Republic . My affected zeal but masks the well-aimed blows I strike at the enemies of our order .  --  Before many weeks have past , Robespierre will go to the scaffold , the Jacobins be ruined , and the Republic crushed .  --  To this great end I am content to suffer anything , even your contempt , if need be . DIANE . Yes , I despise all blows dealt in darkness . GOUROC . Even though those very blows could save your father 's life ? DIANE . Turning and staring at him . Save my father 's life ? GOUROC . Yes ; I hold it in my power to set your father free , and escape with both of you to Vende.  --  Say but the word and it is done . DIANE . Tell me the word that I may speak it quickly . GOUROC . You know the past .  --  My one wild dream was to win you as my wife . Revolution came ; I lost you in the chaos of the times ; and when at last I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DIANE . In anguish . No more , sir ! No more ! GOUROC . But I can save you yet . DIANE . Save my father ! That is all I ask . GOUROC . To save his life I must imperil my own . I am willing to do this , but  --  DIANE . Scornfully . You must have your price ! GOUROC . Yes  --  that price , the right to save and guard you as my wife . One word of hope , and I am your slave forever . DIANE . Such a word would be cruelty to you , and crime in me . She starts to go . GOUROC . Seizing DIANE 'S hand . Hear me , I beg  --  beseech  --  A bell tolls . Nay  --  I command !  --  Listen ! A VOICE . Calls slowly in the distance . Hubert , Marquis de Ferrand ,  --  Comte de Vigny ,  --  Duc de Beaumont  --  DIANE turns in horror . GOUROC . Your father is called for trial ! That means certain death . DIANE . Kneeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everything I have . GOUROC I may hope ? DIANE . Yes ! Take hope from my despair . GOUROC . Then you will be my wife ? DIANE . When he and I are free . GOUROC . Your father shall be saved !  --  I go to perfect all my plans . Kissing her hand . From this moment I am yours  --  body , mind and soul ! Exit hurriedly . DIANE . When he has saved my father  --  death shall deliver me . Exit . POTIN enters cautiously , with various things hidden under his clothes , giving him a grotesque appearance . POTIN . Now , O Fate , is your chance to protect a patriot ! If I can only get away ,  --  I shall escape perjury in Court , and tongue-lashing from my wife !  --  Now to run !  --  To run for Vende ! Better the awful thunder of masculine war than the piercing tenderness of a woman 's tongue ! Starting to run off , he begins to sing  --  to the tune of the Marseillaise chorus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rushing in and stopping him . Hold , Citizen Potin ! POTIN . Willing . Oh , Republic , I am lost ! NANETTE . Dodolphe  --  you 're up to mischief . Speak out  --  what 's up ? POTIN . Patience , gentle lamb ! NANETTE . Do n't lamb me , sir ! Twisting him round . What 's this mean ? Tapping him . Porpoise ! Pulling breeches from under his coat . Culottes ! Pulling cap from his breast . Ye gods , what 's this ? Pulling hose from his pockets . By heaven ! A woman 's hose ! Shaking hose in his face . What does this mean ? POTIN . Nothing , precious love ! This is my uniform ;  --  I have recruited for Vende . NANETTE . You  --  a soldier ? POTIN . Posing . Yes : The safety of France demands it . I go to preserve the Republic ! France beckons  --  while Victory extends her arms , panting to embrace my noble form ! NANETTE . Embrace ye ? Putting his head under her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entering with GUARD . Citizen Potin , you are wanted as a witness . POTIN . Caught !  --  From the frying-pan into the fire ! NANETTE . We shall meet again , my dear . POTIN . Do n't remind me now ; I 'm sick enough already . Enter PAUL KAUVAR . POTIN starts at sight of him , and speaks to the GUARD . I 'm ready ; show the way . PAUL . To POTIN . Stop !  --  Thank heaven I have found you ! Tell me , who ordered the Duke 's arrest ? POTIN . Sullenly . What I know of , that I 'll tell only to the Court . Exit . PAUL . Turning to NANETTE , who is going . Nanette , one word . NANETTE . What word can an honest woman speak that you would care to hear ? PAUL . Justice !  --  I want that word , and all it signifies . Mob howls outside . NANETTE . Listen ! Go to them  --  they 'll give you justice , aye , and glory , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . PAUL . That 's a lie  --  a vile , infamous , monstrous lie ! NANETTE . Is it a lie that you signed the warrant for the Duke 's arrest ? PAUL . My name was forged . NANETTE . I know your hand too well to be deceived . I 've seen the warrant ; it bears your name , and written by yourself . PAUL . Then it was obtained by some strange trick ! I 've tried to learn the truth , but no one will tell me who took the warrant to the office of the Guard . NANETTE . I wish I could believe you . PAUL . Forcing her to face him . And so you shall !  --  Do I look like the vilest of mankind ? NANETTE . No ; in looks you 're lucky ! PAUL . Would any man conspire to kill the wife he adores ? NANETTE . Why ask that ? PAUL . Because Diane de Beaumont is my wife . NANETTE . Your wife ? PAUL . Yes ! For me to betray her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the anguish of the damned to me ! Can you not see that I am  --  I must be innocent ? NANETTE . In these days the fairest faces mask the foulest souls ! Looks and words prove nothing ! Evidence alone will clear you of this crime . PAUL . That  --  I have not been able to obtain . NANETTE . Then get it quickly before it is too late . PAUL . Where is Diane  --  my wife ? NANETTE . Pointing . There !  --  Praying for the father she believes you betrayed . PAUL . No , she can not ! By the light of her own love she sees the innocence of mine . NANETTE . Then love is lunacy ! PAUL . Send her here to me ! NANETTE . She will not come . PAUL . I 'll stake my life she will ! NANETTE . You shall see . Exit . JEAN LITAIS enters , watching PAUL intently . PAUL . Two things at any cost I must accomplish ! First , prove my innocence of treachery , and save her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I came to help you . PAUL . Who are you ? JEAN . Look well and you will see . PAUL . I 've seen your face before , but have forgotten where we met . JEAN . I am Jean Litais . Six months ago , I was accused , and about to be condemned . You saw  --  took pity  --  spoke in my behalf  --  and by your eloquence saved my life ! So now the life you saved , and all its service , is yours to use , or forfeit as you please ! A lion freed a mouse  --  the mouse now comes to serve the lion . PAUL . I do not understand . JEAN . I am turnkey here , though once a servant of the Duke 's . You love his daughter ; I can help her father to escape . PAUL . How ? JEAN . Crossing to the door . This opens on a staircase leading to the river . Here 's the key . I have a boat below . To-night I 'll creep up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door  --  and you 'll find deliverance for those you love . PAUL . Taking the key . How can I repay this deed ? JEAN . Trust me  --  that is all . PAUL . Extending his hand . I will  --  I do ! JEAN . Kissing PAUL 'S hand . I 'm yours in life or death . Goes to door . Till to-night ! Exit . PAUL . Alone . Saved !  --  Thank God !  --  Their freedom in my hand !  --  Pausing . And yet she does not come .  --  Can it be that she believes me guilty  --  esteems me lower than the foulest worm ? Enter DIANE . No , no ,  --  I was right ! Going toward her . I knew you 'd come . DIANE . Checking him . Stop !  --  Let me look at you and say farewell . PAUL . Then you really think me guilty ? DIANE . If an angel had accused you , I would say it was a lie . PAUL . Diane ! Diane !  --  My loyal wife ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no ! I am not worthy of your love ! I must save my father 's life , no matter what it costs me . PAUL . Courage , dear heart ! I hold here salvation for you both . DIANE . You ? PAUL . Yes ! This very night your father shall fly with us to England . DIANE . Ah ! Then I am free ! I need owe him nothing ! PAUL . Owe whom nothing ? The tramp of SOLDIERS is heard outside . DIANE . Hark !  --  The Guard !  --  Take care ! Enter the DUKE , with GUARD and POTIN . DUKE . Contemptuously to PAUL . You here , traitor ? DIANE . Aside to the DUKE . You must not call him that . He did not betray . The proof this  --  that he has come to save you . DUKE . And so make my debt to him a means of reaching you ;  --  but I would not accept my life from hands unclean with treachery . PAUL . There 's not a drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you signed the warrant for my arrest . PAUL . Then another hand than mine  --  unknown to me  --  filled in your name . DUKE . Plausible trickster !  --  We have here double proof that you are guilty . Enter GOUROC in background . The evidence of the man to whom you gave the warrant , commanding him to take it to the Guard . PAUL . There 's no such man alive  --  or dead ! DUKE . Potin , advance . POTIN comes forward sullenly . Repeat what you swore in court .  --  From whom did you receive the warrant for my arrest ? POTIN . After a struggle . I received it from  --  Hesitates . GOUROC . Aside to POTIN . Take care !  --  If I denounce  --  you die ! DUKE . Well , sir , we are waiting . POTIN . Desperately . I received it  --  Pointing at PAUL. from him . PAUL recoils with horror . DIANE , with cry of agony , hides her face upon her father 's breast . PAUL . Crossing to POTIN . Potin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour of your old and steadfast friend ! Look in my eyes , and , in the name of your own salvation , speak nothing but the truth . DUKE . Sternly . ' T is useless to intimidate the witness . He will not prove himself a perjurer , and condemn himself to death , even to please so dear a friend as you . PAUL . My God !  --  There is some wicked plot ! DUKE . Yes  --  and you 're the plotter . PAUL falls prostrate into chair near table . Supporting DIANE to the door of his cell , the DUKE pauses and speaks . Paul Kauvar , we shall never meet again .  --  Remember my last words .  --  Beggars , thieves , assassins may escape perdition ; but neither here , nor hereafter , is there any hope for Judas . Exit , supporting DIANE . NANETTE follows the DUKE off . POTIN goes into the opposite cell , GOUROC crosses to PAUL . GOUROC . How 's this , old Comrade ? I thought you were antique in the mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flint ! PAUL . Agony is fire that melts the mettle of the hardest man . GOUROC . But why should you  --  a Jacobin  --  care for this old Duke ? PAUL . I loved his daughter  --  she became my wife . GOUROC . Starting . What ! Diane de Beaumont is your wife ? PAUL . Yes  --  has been my wife in secret  --  for six months . GOUROC . Aside . So I have a double task ! To save her  --  and kill her husband . Aloud . The same old story , Comrade , and as usual a woman mars the plot ! You were a patriot , till love enmeshed you in his magic web ; then you became the weakest of mankind  --  a husband . I am sorry , very sorry ; but Paul  --  my friend  --  if I can serve you now , I beg of you command me . PAUL . Yes , you can serve me . You have been my friend  --  be more ! GOUROC . Your sorrow seems so deep , I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of conscience ! Speak then , without fear . PAUL . Help me to save the father of my wife !  --  See ! This key opens yonder door ; to-night , at any moment , you may hear three knocks .  --  That signal will be given by a man who will conduct you safely out of France . GOUROC . A man that you can trust ? PAUL . To the death .  --  I saved his life . GOUROC . But suppose the Duke is called before the signal comes !  --  I must go and find some man to take his place . GOUROC starts to go . PAUL 'S face lights with a sudden resolution . PAUL . Stop ! The man is found . GOUROC . Who is he ? PAUL . The man they call a traitor  --  Paul Kauvar . GOUROC . Suppressing a smile of surprise . You ? PAUL . Yes . When safely out of France , tell them of my fate . My death may convince them I loved too deeply to betray . A bell begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marquis de Ferrand ,  --  Mardoche , alias the Abb de St. Simon  --  GOUROC . They 're calling the condemned ; there 's not an instant to be lost . Crossing to cell . In this cell there hangs an old man 's coat and wig , kept here to disguise the spies connected with the prison . Luckily they 'll serve your purpose well . Opening cell door . Quick !  --  Get ready to answer when the Duke is called . PAUL . Tell my wife I died for love of her , and honour . Exit . GOUROC . In exultation . Thank luck !  --  This man 's death clears my path , and saves the money I meant to pay the Abb . Enter DIANE and NANETTE . DIANE . Where is he ? I must see him once again !  --  Paul ! Paul ! Starting at sight of GOUROC . Who 's there ? GOUROC . ' T is I ! Here to save your father . THE VOICE . Outside .

As the GUARDS start with PAUL , DIANE rushes in with a cry of agony . DIANE . Father !  --  Father !  --  We have been deceived ! DIANE rushes into PAUL 'S arms ; he embraces her passionately . GUARDS force them apart and go out with PAUL . Held back by GOUROC and NANETTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering . Diane !  --  What is it ? DIANE . Turning in amazement and joy . What !  --  You are there ? GOUROC . Yes , saved by me . DIANE . And he  --  ? Who was he they dragged away ? GOUROC . A man condemned to die  --  whom I disguised  --  to take your father 's place .

DIANE sits near the fire ; the DUKE and GOUROC at table . Now try to smile a bit . DIANE . I have forgotten how . Calling . Jean ! JEAN . Crossing to DIANE . Yes , Madame ? DIANE . Hush ! Do not let my father hear you call me Madame . Converses aside with JEAN . GOUROC . Taking a newspaper from table . Strange !  --  a Paris journal , dated the day after our escape . DUKE . Taking the paper . There may be some notice of our flight . Reads . JEAN . To DIANE . Will you never confess your marriage to Kauvar ? DIANE . Never !  --  Unless he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will ! We can trust the wit of his deep love for that . DIANE . So you believe him innocent ? JEAN . As innocent as my own sweetheart , dear Denise . DIANE weeps . What  --  tears , Madame ?

Here 's a list of martyrs slaughtered the day that we escaped . GOUROC . Taking the paper . And here 's a name underlined with ink . Starting up with great joy . By heaven , your own !  --  See !  --  In the list of fallen heads  --  the Duc de Beaumont ! The DUKE takes paper . DIANE . Coming toward GOUROC . You speak of the man who took my father 's place , as though you exulted in his death !  --  Was he an enemy of yours ? GOUROC . I rejoice that the man 's disguise was not discovered  --  for the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joyfully to GOUROC . You remember the Abb de St. Simon ? GOUROC . Yes . He was condemned to die with you . DUKE . This journal says that he escaped from the death-cart as it rumbled to the scaffold through the crowd . GOUROC . Starting , and with great emphasis . Impossible ! DUKE . Holding out the paper . See for yourself ! GOUROC takes paper eagerly . LA ROCHE . Entering , with a cry of joy . Duke ! DUKE . Holding out his arms . Henri ! LA ROCHE . Embracing the DUKE . In days of misery , a moment such as this is sweet indeed . But how did you escape ? I saw your name among the guillotined . DUKE . Turning to GOUROC . This gentleman wrought a way for our deliverance !  --  Monsieur le Marquis de Vaux . LA ROCHE . Grasping GOUROC 'S hand . Monsieur  --  the King 's friends are all your debtors . GOUROC . Nay , sir , the debt is mine . ' T is a privilege to save such precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lass you played with , years ago . LA ROCHE . What !  --  My little cousin  --  grown so stately and so sad ! Mademoiselle , I claim a kinsman 's right to kiss away these shadows . DIANE . And I yield the right with pleasure , cousin Henri . LA ROCHE . Kisses her . Good cheer , sweet cousin ! You are now protected by the soldiers of the King , who  --  God willing  --  will punish those who brought this shadow to your face . GOUROC . That may not prove an easy task ! Granville is overrun with rebels , who are urged to most atrocious crimes by Carrac . LA ROCHE . Yes  --  Thomas Carrac  --  a brutal monster , reeking with loyal blood ; a loathsome anarchist , who glories in the vilest deeds . GOUROC . Ravishing without remorse the daughters of our race . LA ROCHE . If we could capture wretches such as he , it might end our civil war . DIANE . Is he so hard to take ? LA ROCHE . Yes . Reptiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and escape by crawling . This Carrac is brave in words , but too craven to face fighting in the field . Our soldiers rarely reach these civil sinners . DUKE . Let us forget them here . For now we will task your hospitality for a time . LA ROCHE . I swear I have not felt the poverty that war entails till now . My old chateau has been dismantled  --  this hall alone is habitable , I feel ashamed to offer you such shabby quarters . DUKE . Nay , cousin , a bed of stones with friends is better than a bed of down with those we do not love . DENISE . Entering , speaks to LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN . A couch and fire are ready in the room that was your mother 's . LA ROCHE . To DIANE . Where doubtless you 'll be glad to take some rest . DIANE . I confess the need , Monsieur . LA ROCHE . Denise , show the way . DENISE crosses to the door . DIANE . At the door . Till to-night , kind friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANE courtesies and goes out with NANETTE . Gentlemen , I pray you , make yourselves at home ; important business claims my time .  --  I 'll rejoin you within an hour . DUKE . We 're here to help , not mar the cause ; command us in all ways . LA ROCHE . Presently !  --  Till then the poor old house is yours . Exit . Exit JEAN . DUKE . Sitting near the fire . At last , praise God ! We 're out of reach of traitors ! GOUROC . Not yet !  --  The rebel hosts have gathered here at Granville in great force . They may rout the royal army , and capture all of us . DUKE . No , not all , for I shall die first , fighting in the ranks . GOUROC . But Diane , your daughter  --  ? DUKE . Must take the chances of a soldier 's child . GOUROC . You forget her peril from this scoundrel , Carrac.  --  Why not put her safely out of the reach of such a brute ? DUKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can escape to England . DUKE . I fly no further . I owe the King and country service here . GOUROC . Then let Diane go with me to friends in London . When I 've found for her safe asylum , I 'll return to do my duty at your side . DUKE . The daughter of a peer of France could hardly go so far without protection worthy of her rank . GOUROC . That she can secure as a Marquise , and my wife . The DUKE turns quickly in surprise . I know , dear Duke , that you are richer , nobler than myself , but then the love I bear your daughter , together with the dangers that surround her life and honour here  --  DUKE . Say no more !  --  There 's nothing that would ease my mind so much as to see Diane your wife . GOUROC . Then plead my cause with her . DUKE . I 'll more than plead .  --  Her perils urge me to command this marriage . GOUROC . Then do not lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army strikes , she and I , as man and wife , should sail for England . NANETTE . Entering . Monsieur , your daughter desires a word with you  --  Glancing at GOUROC. alone . DUKE . Say I 'll see her here at once . Exit NANETTE . I 'll broach this marriage to my child without delay . GOUROC . Going . I 'll be at hand in case you call me . Exit . DUKE . Alone . This alliance secures Diane from peril . The Marquis is young , noble ,  --  has saved her life , and has a claim on it . She must marry while there 's time to get away . Enter DIANE . Now , dear child , what is it ? DIANE . Father , I loathe this useless life of mine ! I long for action  --  danger  --  anything that stirs the blood , and brings oblivion . DUKE . Oblivion !  --  Nay , Diane , I have something happier to suggest than that . Time and circumstance commend to you a marriage . We owe our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to-day . DIANE . The Marquis ?  --  After a pause . I can not marry , for I do not love him . DUKE . Then ' t is time you did . DIANE . No more , I beg of you .  --  It is impossible ! DUKE . Impossible ! When prompted by the wisdom of a father 's love ? When your escape from peril and my peace of mind demand it ? DIANE . I can not argue . DUKE . Then at least explain . DIANE . Alas , I dare not . DUKE . You fear mere frankness with your truest friend ? DIANE sinks into a chair and hides her face . The DUKE looks at her with suspicion . By heaven ! You hide your face as though to speak implied dishonour . DIANE . No , no ! It is not that ! DUKE . Then why torture me with this concealment ? Have I been cruel , or faithless as a father ? DIANE . Never ! DUKE . Then I claim a father 's sacred right to confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to whom we owe our lives ? DIANE . I love another . DUKE . Starting . Another ! After a pause . His name  --  ? DIANE . What matter , since we shall never meet again ? DUKE . I understand at last !  --  ' T is Paul Kauvar ! DIANE bows her head . So ! The saviour of your father 's life is scorned for his betrayer ! No wonder that you blush to own it ! This makes my course more clear . The safest cure for this disgraceful love will be your marriage . DIANE . That can not be ! DUKE . Going . I say it shall ! DIANE . Startled . Where are you going ? DUKE . To seek the priest ! Delay is dangerous ! You wed to-day and sail to-night for England . DIANE . No , no ! Have pity ! I have no right to marry . DUKE . In horror . No right ? DIANE . Falling at his feet . I am a wife already . DUKE . His wife ?  --  You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  Oh God ! What have I done to merit such a blow as this ? DIANE . Father ,  --  forgive ! Hear me ! DUKE . Flinging her off , rushes to the door . Henri , Marquis  --  here ! All of you ! Enter LA HOGUE , LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN , GOUROC , JEAN and DENISE . To LA ROCHE . Call your guards ! Drag this woman away ! Fling her to these rebel dogs  --  for she is one of them ! GOUROC . What has she done ? DUKE . Deceived a father 's love ! Become the mate of my betrayer . Turning on DIANE . Degraded remnant of my race !  --  Go ! Back to your own , wife of a Sans Culotte ! GOUROC . Stepping between them . Stay ! There must be some mistake ! DUKE . No ! She has confessed that she 's the wife of Paul Kauvar . GOUROC . That can not be , for Paul Kauvar is dead . DUKE . Dead ? How do you know that ? GOUROC . Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANE . Rising . My God ! DUKE . What ! I owe my life to him ? GOUROC . He died to atone his treachery to you . DIANE . Traitors do not die to save their victims ! His life was noble ! His death sublime ! To the DUKE . You have foully wronged the man who bravely met a martyr 's death for you !  --  have scorned and spurned me from your side , because I was his wife . You have disowned me  --  I now disown you ! Turning , she goes swiftly up the steps to the terrace . LA ROCHE . Where are you going ? DIANE . Back to the Sans Culottes ! DUKE . Diane !  --  Daughter ! DIANE . No ! Not your daughter  --  but his wife ! No longer Diane de Beaumont  --  but , thank God ,  --  Diane Kauvar ! CURTAIN . ACT IV . SCENE . Same as Act III .  --  DUKE discovered seated in attitude of despair .  --  GOUROC standing near mantel.  --  LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN enters sadly . DUKE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The DUKE sinks back into chair . GOUROC . Then she has positively escaped ? LA ROCHE . While we stood dazed with horror at her words  --  she vanished . Our soldiers have searched , but can find no trace of her . DUKE . Starting up . I will find her ! LA ROCHE . Barring his way . This is madness . DUKE . Let me pass ! LA ROCHE . Hear me ! DUKE . While I listen , she is lost !  --  An army shall not stop me . Breaks from him towards door . DENISE . Entering joyfully . She is found ! ALL . Found ? DENISE . Yes . Jean tracked her ,  --  they are bringing her here . JEAN . Entering . General , I have not failed . LA ROCHE . Grasping his hand . You never do . LA HOGUE enters first , followed by two GUARDS , whom he directs to the entrance at top of steps .  --  DIANE enters , followed by two GUARDS . DIANE . To LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN . By what authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I am your father . DIANE . My marriage has set me free of parental rule . I claim the right to fly from those who have defamed my noble husband . General , command your soldiers to release me ! GOUROC . No !  --  You shall not go . DIANE . What will prevent me ? GOUROC . The force of your own honour . DIANE . Honour commands me to return to my husband 's friends . GOUROC . Honour commands you to keep your word with me . DIANE starts and turns away . You promised , if I saved your father , and you were free , you 'd be my wife .  --  I have done my part , you must do yours . DIANE . Passionately , to GOUROC . Now I understand your joy when you read of the beheadal of the man who took my father 's place !  --  You knew he was my husband . GOUROC . I did . DIANE . You planned his death to free and force me to this marriage . GOUROC . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to the guillotine .  --  Then he told me all , confiding you to my care . I promised him I 'd shield you from all peril .  --  I but keep my word with him , in asking you to keep your word with me . DIANE . So you would wed the widow of a Sans Culotte ? GOUROC . Your husband was my friend ; I knew and honoured him . DIANE . Ah , you believe , then , that Potin lied when he declared he got the warrant for the Duke 's arrest from Paul Kauvar ? GOUROC . I now believe that your husband was the victim of a trick . DIANE . Then swear  --  before those who have heard the dead defamed  --  swear that you believe my husband was innocent of infamy . GOUROC . With deep sincerity . As I hope for mercy from my God , I believe that Paul Kauvar was guiltless of dishonour . DIANE . Impressed with his sincerity . Then his widow swears to keep her word with you . She extends her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to GUARDS , and directs them silently to exit .  --  They about-face , and go out . GOUROC . Aside , triumphantly kissing DIANE 'S hand . At last ! Howls of execration outside . What is that ? LA ROCHE . The mob howling at some captured rebels . Enter ORDERLY , who presents paper . Reading paper , LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN speaks to ORDERLY . Conduct the prisoner here . Exit ORDERLY . Turning to DIANE . Cousin , I must ask you to retire . We have secret business to transact . DUKE . Giving DIANE his arm . We will await you in my daughter 's room . To GOUROC . Marquis , we can complete the plans for your marriage and escape to England . Exeunt DIANE , DUKE , JEAN , DENISE and GOUROC . GOUROC . Aside , as he goes out . Now I know that I shall triumph ! LA ROCHE . To LA HOGUE . When and where were these prisoners secured ? LA HOGUE . At dawn this morning , in the centre of the Faubourg . They fought like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though overcome by numbers , he do n't seem conquered in the least !  --  Hang my hide ! I can not help but like him ! Howls renewed outside . ORDERLY . Entering . The prisoner is here , General . LA ROCHE . Bring him in . ORDERLY beckons.  --  Yells outside . GUARDS enter and form on terrace behind entrance .  --  Enter PRISONER , who strides haughtily in . To ORDERLY . Retire and guard the doors . ORDERLY right-faces.  --  GUARD goes off with ORDERLY . Politely to PRISONER . I see , sir , you 're an officer . PRISONER . Yes .  --  Captain of Volunteers in the ranks of the Republic . LA ROCHE . To what corps do you belong ? PRISONER . Kleber 's  --  who waits upon the banks of the river to cut off your retreat . LA ROCHE . Smiling . We do not propose to retreat , but to advance . PRISONER . Before another day you will be driven , routed , into the heart of Vende . LA ROCHE . If boasting wins , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win  --  your side is sure to fail . You 've not a regiment that 's trained better than a pack of boys ! LA HOGUE . I wish he were a liar , but he is n't . LA ROCHE . Our boys struck hard enough , it seems , to capture you . PRISONER . We were ten , surprised by a battalion , and yet it cost you nearly fifty of your friends to take but ten of us . LA HOGUE . There he goes again riddling us with facts . LA ROCHE . Sir ,  --  you know there is no quarter given to traitors found in arms against the King . PRISONER . France has no sovereign but the people .  --  It is you who are the traitors . LA ROCHE . Answer civilly and I may show you mercy . PRISONER . I neither ask , nor accept mercy . I have done my best to deal a crushing blow to you .  --  So call your guards , and shoot me without more waste of words . LA ROCHE . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not afraid to die ? Laughs bitterly . Bah ! It takes more courage sometimes to consent to live . LA ROCHE . You are young , a Frenchman , and  --  though misled  --  a credit to your country . If you 'll give me some excuse , I swear I 'd rather spare your life . PRISONER . Laughing . Thank you , General ; but frankly , I 'd rather give you some excuse to take it . Tremendous explosion heard in the distance . Then a second explosion . The Faubourg in middle ground is blown up and is seen to burn into a blaze . LA ROCHE . My God !  --  See !  --  The Faubourg ! PRISONER . Triumphantly . Blown up and burning !  --  In an hour the houses that were to shelter your attack on our defenses will be gone , and you will have to fight our forces in the open field .  --  That means defeat for you . LA HOGUE . Sacristi ! Gag this rogue , or we 'll be whipped before we fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter GOUROC , who starts and goes out again with a gesture of menace towards the PRISONER . Enter ORDERLY . LA ROCHE . To ORDERLY . Despatch these orders instantly , and send a guard with loaded muskets here at once . Exit ORDERLY . Turning despondently to LA HOGUE . I fear this is a death-blow to our plans to-night . PRISONER . A death-blow dealt by me !  --  You 'd better kill me quickly before I do more damage . LA ROCHE . You are right , sir ; I should be faithless to my King if I showed you mercy now . PRISONER . Bravo ! Mercy to enemies is as base as cruelty to friends . LA HOGUE . Damn me ! There 's no fun in killing such a fool  --  he seems to like it ! Enter ORDERLY with GUARDS . LA ROCHE . To ORDERLY . Take the prisoner outside and shoot him there at once . GUARD crosses to PRISONER . Have you any last request ? PRISONER . But one .  --  You have shown me the kindness of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the presence of the peace of death , I would like to feel that as Frenchmen we are friends , and ask one parting grasp from you . LA ROCHE . Grasps his hand . With all my heart !  --  May we meet like this above . LA HOGUE . With emotion . Curse these youngsters , they make me snivel like a fool . He blows his nose furiously . The PRISONER bows , takes his place in the platoon of GUARDS , who begin to march off . When they are on the terrace , LA HOGUE suddenly cries out . LA HOGUE . Halt !  --  ORDERLY about-faces and waits for orders . You have not given us your name . PRISONER . I prefer to let it die with me . LA HOGUE . Hang it , sir ! Courage is glorious even in a rebel rascal like yourself . LA ROCHE . Some friend may be glad to know how fearlessly you met your fate . PRISONER . The only ears I 'd care to reach would rather never hear my name again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know your name myself . Ca n't you be civil as well as brave ? PRISONER . Laughing . Well , then , to please your gentle highness , I must give it . I am Captain on the Staff of General Kleber  --  Captain Kauvar . LA ROCHE and LA HOGUE . Starting . Kauvar ? PAUL . Yes  --  Captain Paul Kauvar . LA ROCHE . Turning amazed to LA HOGUE . What do you think of this ? LA HOGUE . That if I had a regiment of Paul Kauvar 's , I 'd conquer Europe . LA ROCHE . My cousin 's husband was guillotined . There 's some mistake . To GUARD . Leave the prisoner , and wait outside for orders . PAUL . Stopping the GUARD . Stay !  --  ORDERLY waits for further orders . To LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN . General , I beg of you to spare me further waiting .  --  Make an end of this . LA ROCHE . When I have questioned you again . PAUL . I shall refuse to answer further questions . LA ROCHE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL . I swear you can not do it . LA ROCHE . Motions GUARDS to go . ORDERLY about-faces , goes on to terrace . GUARDS then march off . We shall see ! You 've given a name that 's not your own . PAUL starts , but remains silent . Paul Kauvar was guillotined the night of the ninth of May . PAUL turns , amazed but silent . He died to save my kinsman , the Duc de Beaumont . PAUL , about to speak , checks himself . He was the husband of my cousin . PAUL . Exploding . Diane  --  your cousin ? LA ROCHE . Ha ! I thought I 'd make you speak . PAUL . Eagerly . You know her ?  --  She has escaped ?  --  Is safe ?  --  alive ?  --  happy ? LA ROCHE . Oh , ho !  --  So you would turn the tables  --  question me ? PAUL . Is she alive and well ?  --  I ask to know but this . LA ROCHE . I 'll tell you more , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that do not force me to betray my cause . LA ROCHE . Explain !  --  You escaped the guillotine ? PAUL . The story is too long . LA ROCHE . Make it brief , but answer . PAUL . In the death-cart I found a priest confessing those about him . He questioned me , soon saw that I was not the Duke . " Mychild , " he , said , " I die to-day , but as a priest shall be the last to mount the scaffold .  --  Let me take your place , assume the same disguise , while you slip from the cart and live . " At first I refused , as I no longer cared for life ! But when he said Diane might not escape unless I lived to aid her , I yielded .  --  The night was cloudy . When the moon was hidden , the priest put on my coat and wig , and as the death-cart neared the scaffold , I slipped through its slatted floor , and in the darkness mingled with the crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you free ? PAUL . The Abb de St. Simon . LA ROCHE . Strange ! We heard the Abb had escaped . PAUL . He answered when the Duke was called and so was guillotined ; but when the Abb 's turn had come , they could not find him , and so gave out that he 'd escaped . LA ROCHE . Yes , I understand it now .  --  Proceed ! PAUL . I found Diane had gone , believing I was guilty of a most ignoble crime . Too sick at heart to follow her , I enlisted and , seeking death , obtained promotion to my present grade . LA ROCHE . What if your willingness to die to save her father had convinced Diane that you were innocent , and had taught her a deeper love for you ? PAUL . Ah ! Then life would be worth living once again !  --  Can you have heard from her  --  seen her ? LA ROCHE . You can see her for yourself  --  save your own life  --  and bring boundless joy to hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PAUL . What !  --  Betray my country ? LA ROCHE . No.  --  Redeem your country !  --  Desert the side of those who bring disgrace upon your native land  --  of fiends , who drown her soil in blood !  --  blood bred from the noblest heroes of her history . PAUL . Heroes who debauched our women , and enslaved our men !  --  Libertines who let harlots reign in France ! Despots whose arrogant descendants are crushed to-day beneath their fathers ' sins ! LA ROCHE . What , sir ! You , a soldier , justify these Jacobins  --  anarchists like Carrac , who slaughter hundreds of defenceless women every day , and even outrage little children ? PAUL . Anarchists are monsters your race bred when it brutalized their mothers . LA ROCHE . Enough , sir ! I see that I must leave you to your fate . PAUL . But Diane , my wife ! Give me one word of her . LA ROCHE . Yes . You shall know that she believes you innocent , is sick with grief and desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her , then ? LA ROCHE . Yes  --  here , within an hour . PAUL . She is here now , within call  --  ? LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN makes sign of assent . PAUL kneels at his feet . My God ! In pity 's name , let me see her once again . LA ROCHE . And so re-open the old wounds ?  --  re-awaken hope , but to deepen her despair ? PAUL . Rising slowly . No , no ! You 're right . I will not purchase joy at the cost of pain to her !  --  Call your guards . I die happy , knowing she 'll remember me with love . LA ROCHE . For her sake renounce rebellion , and I unite you both forever . PAUL . Better I should never see her face again than be unworthy of her love . LA HOGUE . Great Caesar ! Here 's an eagle facing death in loyalty to carrion crows !  --  The noble bird is mad ! We must not kill , but cure him . LA ROCHE . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him give his word that he 'll not fight until he 's exchanged . LA ROCHE . True ! Captain Kauvar , you are a prisoner of war , a man of proven honour .  --  Give me your word that you will not lift your sword against the King , till you 're exchanged , and you 're paroled and free . PAUL . Free with honour , to see my wife once more ? LA ROCHE . Yes ! PAUL . Oh , generous foe ! Next to my country , my life belongs to you . LA ROCHE . I have your word ? PAUL . Raising his hand . You have . LA ROCHE . Captain Kauvar , you are paroled . PAUL . And my wife ? LA ROCHE . Going . Shall come to you at once . Exit . PAUL . Great heavens !  --  I 'm going mad with joy ! Turning to LA HOGUE . Colonel , I must explode or die ! He embraces LA HOGUE . LA HOGUE . Submitting with gusto . Damme ! Embraced by a Sans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard in the distance . PAUL . Looking off . By heavens !  --  The Republicans are sweeping down from Granville ! To LA HOGUE . Colonel , see ! My comrades have attacked you under cover of the town I burned . Crash of artillery again . LA HOGUE . Damnation ! Enter LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN . ORDERLY . Rushing in . General , the enemy are upon us ! LA ROCHE . Excitedly to LA HOGUE . Quick !  --  To arms !  --  We must rouse and lead our men ! PAUL . But Diane  --  my wife ? LA ROCHE . Gone !  --  to England . Handing a paper . Read , and remember , whatever be my fate , you are on parole . He rushes off with LA HOGUE . The crash of firearms increases . PAUL . Reading .

Ah !  --  The enemy weakens !  --  gives way !  --  falls back !  --  The Royalists fly !  --  The Republic wins !  --  Progress triumphs ! The noise of battle grows louder , but the cries of triumph from Republicans decrease , then die away .  --  PAUL checks his joy and speaks in changed tones . And I  --  I have no part in this glorious play  --  because I 'm on parole . Walking up and down excitedly . What torture !  --  to be here ; with heart aflame , and limbs all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to idleness by an oath , as much a prisoner as though in fetters at the bottom of a cell !

You are a prisoner on parole .  --  The General is as good as captured now .  --  Let him release you from your word , then his escape will only be an exchange of prisoners . PAUL . Will you consent to this ? LA ROCHE . No , I can not . The exchange would not be fair to the side you serve . I am a General ; you , but a Captain . LA HOGUE . But we have the other prisoners , the comrades of the Captain ; we can shoot them all at once , or exchange them if we choose for you . PAUL .
