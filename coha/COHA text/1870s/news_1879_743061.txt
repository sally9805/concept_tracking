txt The Legislature ot Texas , to the great relief of the people , adjourned on Thursday last ( the 24th . ) As the most of its work is not yet in print , it is difficult to comment upon it justly , However , near the close of its session it passed an appropriation to DAV the semi-annual interest nn bonds of the State . This appropriation was vetoed by Gov . Roberts on the 23d inst. , thereupon the Senate , by failing to enact the appropriation by a two-thirds vote , ( in fact it voted by a small majority the other way , ) sustained the veto and both houses finally adjourned , as stated , on the 24th . By the concurrent action of the Governor and the Senate Texas has practically repudiated the payment of the interest on her bonded debt . This is the record of a Democratic Governor and a Democratic Senate . The result arrived at might have been averted by the Governor if he had not vetoed the appropriation in order to force the Legislature to omit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the support of public free schools . It might have been averted by the Legislature lad it , instead of adjourning at once , continued in session until it either passed the school tax and the appropriation to pay the interest on the State bonds over the veto , or else have modified its action so as to induce the Governor not to veto the tax and the appropriation . As it is both the Governor and the Legislature are censured , and neither can shift the blame wholly on the other . The Legislature was morally bound not to have adjourned until both the public free schools and the interest on the State bonds were provided for . As it may be contended that notwithstanding there is no appropriation the interest will be paid , attention is called to the following provision of the Constitution of Texas ( that of 1876 ) now in force : " The Legislature shall not have power to borrow , or in any manner to divert from its purpose , any special fund that may or ought to come into the Treasury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow , withhold , or in any manner to divert from its purpose any special fund or any part thereof . " ? ( Section 7 , art . 8 . ) As the immediate preceding section of the Constitution provides that " no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in pursuance of specific appropriations made by law , " it is clear that if the Legislature were required ' to meet in called session it would borrow from the inviolable school fund in order to pay current expenses , and that if it be not reconvened the Governor can not cause the interest on the bonds to bo paid , for lack of an appropriation . Gov . Roberts has been truly unfortunate in his official utterances during the short time lie has filled the Executive chair . His loose talk to some newspaper writer , in which he expressed the conviction that when criminals got outside of Texas it was the policy of the State that they should remain there , and should not be captured and brought back , created a strong feeling against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to public free schools , ( which have been practically abolished in Texas , ) and his veto of the appropriation to pay interest on the State bonds , have injured his standing yet more . Indeed , there is a passage in his veto Message which he can never explain to the satisfaction of the public . After referring to the administration of the Republican Governor in office from 1870 to 1873 , inclusive , he said : " At the end of four years , upon a change of Administration , it was found that ( as since ascertained and reported by the Controller ) the State had incurred a debt of over $4,000,000 , much of which was a floating debt not reduced to interest-bearing bonds . The credit of the State was low and warrants were low . " The Galveston Daily News , of the 18th of March , contains the last report of the Controller in reply to special inquiries in regard to the debt of Texas . It demonstrates quite the contrary to the assertion of the Governor . Indeed , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State ' Government , late in 1873 , it has doubled the public debt and , as its last political move , has gone into repudiation . GALVESTON , April ** years ot uninterrupted Democratic misrule has resulted in a serious financial dilemma , which now threatens not only the peace and prosperity of the State of Texas at home , but its credit abroad . In 1870 the State entered into what was then called " a grand reconstruction . " A government was established on a scale of magnificence little inferior to that of an Eastern Empire . New offices were created where there was an insufficient number for the demand , and high salaries and enormous expenditures were the order of the day . For the first time public schools were properly recognized , and the frontiersmen protected in their rights . With plenty of money in the country , high rates of wages for the laborer , and abundant crops , which brought large returns , the average citizen of the " Lone Star " State imagined that he millenniumeras at hand . Glowing accounts of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered broadcast throughout the country by means of letters and the enterprise of railroad companies and land agents . It is estimated that in the year 1872 the population increased 250,000 . At the end of four years of reckless administration , the State was in debt upward of $4,000,000 , a great deal of which was of a float ' ing character , not reduced to interest-bearing bonds . The State credit was impaired , and warrants were selling far below their value . Consternation seized upon all , and an effort was made to restore matters to a better basis . The frontier was pushed back , and the enormous general expenditures were to some extent reduced . The Democratic convention called to form a new Constitution in 1875 adopted measures of reform which were never acted upon , and which in reality increased many of the expenses . The Democracy claimed the happiest results for their plans , and the state was again jubilant over the wonderful change for the better . As might have been expected , some disappointments resulted , but the terrible experience to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years is of a character not only to be remembered by all , but to disorganize the Democratic Party . During this period , emigration has fallen off , the products of the country have been less remunerative and the expenses of the State more onerous . The legislative and other officers of the State Government , for the past three years have combined to conceal the true financial condition of the State , until now it stands upon the very verge of bankruptcy . This information , coming as a thunderbolt , is now rapidly developing a change throughout the State , and cities such as Austin and Dallas , which have been intensely Democratic , have elected Republican officers by large majorities . The Democratic leaders , with their present principles and policy , are doomed to abandonment , while the demand for financial reform is growing daily in importance . Another cause for this great change is that the recently adjourned Legislature , which was overwhelmingly Democratic , failed in all particulars to meet the demands of their constituents . A change even of leadership would at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Greenback movement , which is now being accepted by thousands , of discontented Democrats , is daily increasing in strength . Since the organization of Democratic rule in Texas , the State officers and Congressional Representatives have , in nearly every instance , been lawyers who were the representatives of corporations antagonistic to the interests of the people at large . Col. Upson , the San Antonio Convention noing nee , and the Hon. John Hancock , late nominee of the Fifth District , being instances  --  the former the attorney of the Pierce Railroad and the latter a well-known corporation counsel . The report of the last State Revenue Collector , as read to the Legislature , showed that out o .. 135 counties forming the State , in 74 the Collectors were defaulters to the large amount of $750,000 , and when a motion was made by a Republican member that their names be published throughout the country , the " large majority " decided that it was " impolitic to do so . " With an annual expenditure far exceeding the State revenues , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature of the past Winter , elected especially to relieve the State , beyond drawing their $6 per day and mileage , passed only three bills of importance  --  the Bell-punch Liquor bill , the Quarantine bill , and the General Appropriation bill , the latter of which was vetoed by Gov . Roberts on the 23d inst. , the sams day that the Legislature adjourned , thus leaving the interest on the State debt unprovided for . This veto , which will probably result in the calling of an extra session , has been a great surprise to many of the Governor 's constituents on account of its boldness . He vetoes the bill in the appropriation of the poll-tax and one-fourth of the general revenue fur the support of the public schools , the appropriation of $400,000 for interest on the bonded debt , and of $100,000 for the sinking fund . He asserts that it is his duty to care for the State in its most vital functions , and see that it does not suffer by financial mistakes ; that in placing the large amount of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds would have to be used to defray the expenses of the Government , and that there is no choice between temporary repudiation or temporary curtailment of the appropriation for schools . By the Constitution adopted in 1876 , no tax can be levied larger than 50 cents on $100 for any purpose other than the payment of interest on the bonded and floating State debt , or any sum over $200,000 borrowed at any one time to cover deficiencies which may occur . Neither can any moneys constituting a special fund be used for other purposes . All . State expenses must , there- , fore , come within the limits of the revenue raised by this one-half of 1 per cent . As the matter now stands , the financial outlook of Texas can be summed up about as follows : , tier revenue the ensuing year , estimated in the most careful manner by the statistics of past years , will amount to $1,600,000 in cash . The appropriation for deficiencies reduces this $600,000 , leaving $1,000,000 . From the first collection of this amount , one-fourth must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public debt , amounting to $400,000 , must be set apart before all other demands . These claims leave only $250,000 from which all current expenses incurred in the administration . of the actual Government must be defrayed . These imperative requirements are : Judiciary , $260,000 ; Governor's. and Secretary of State 's offices , At- , torney-General , Controller , Treasurer , and Land Office , about $255,000 ; State asylums , $100,000 ; pensions , $50,000 ; sinking fund , $100,000 ; Penitentiary , $40,000 ; Quarantine , $22,000 , and frontier defense , $100 , - 000 , making in all a total of over $027,000 , or about $680,000 above the estimate . To complicate matters still further if emigration should decrease and the demand for real estate fail to keep up values , or should the crops fall short of the usual yield , a large decrease in the revenue must occur . With this state of affairs blankly staring them in the face , the people have declared themselves thoroughly disgusted and dissatisfied with Democratic rule , and are ready to throw themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from.the unbearable burden of debt and taxation which seems to be their lot for some time to come under the , . present party .
