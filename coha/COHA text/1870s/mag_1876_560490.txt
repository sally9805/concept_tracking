OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XII . IT was years after these events that Lawrence , meeting my father accidentally in the street one day , stopped him and spoke with great feeling of his sympathy for us all in my approaching trial , and begged permission to come and see my mother and become acquainted with me , which he accordingly did ; and from that time till his death , which occurred but a few months later , he was unwearied in acts of friendly and affectionate kindness to me . He came repeatedly to consult with my mother about the disputed point of my dress , and gave his sanction to her decision upon it . The first dress of Belvidera , I remember , was a point of nice discussion between them . Plain black velvet and a lugubrious long veil were considered my only admissible wear , after my husband 's ruin ; but before the sale of our furniture , it was conceded that I might relieve the sombre Venetian patrician 's black dress with white satin puffs and crimson linings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bankruptcy , I was allowed ( not , however , without serious demur on the part of Lawrence ) to cover my head with a black hat and white feather , with which of course I was enamored , having never worn anything but my hair on my head before , and feeling and unspeakable accession of dignity in this piece of attire . I begged hard to be allowed to wear it through the tragedy , but this , with some laughter at my intense desire for it , was forbidden , and I was reduced after the first scene of the play to my own unadorned locks , which I think greatly strengthened my feeling of the abject misery into which I had fallen . When in town , Lawrence never omitted one of my performances , always occupying the stage box , and invariably sending me the next morning a letter full of the most detailed and delicate criticism , showing a minute attention to every inflection of my voice , every gesture , every attitude , which , combined with expressions of enthusiastic admiration , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminated , was as strong a dose of the finest flattery as could well have been offered to a girl of my age , on the very first step of her artistic career . I used to read over the last of these remarkable criticisms , invariably , before going to the theatre , in order to profit by every suggestion of alteration or hint of improvement they contained ; and I was in the act of reperusing the last I ever received from him , when my father came in and said , " Lawrence is dead . " I had been sitting to him for some time previously for a pencil sketch which he , ave my mother ; it was his last work , and certainly the most beautiful of his drawings . He had appointed a day for beginning a full-length , life-size portrait of me as Juliet , and we had seen him only a week before his death , and , in the interval , received a note from him merely saying he was rather indisposed . His death , which was quite unexpected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something sufficiently mysterious about its circumstances to give rise to a report that he had committed suicide . The shock of this event was terrible to me , although I have sometimes since thought it was fortunate for me rather than otherwise . Sir Thomas Lawrence 's enthusiastically expressed admiration for me , his constant kindness , his sympatby in my success , and the warm interest he took in everything that concerned me , might only have inspired me with a grateful sense of his condescension and goodness . But I was a very romantic girl , with a most excitable imagination , and such was to me the melancholy charm of Lawrence 's countenance , the elegant distinction of his person , and exquisite , July , // refined gentleness of his voice and manner , that a very dangerous fascination was added to my sense of gratitude for all his personal kindness to me , and my admiration for his genius ; and I think it not at all unlikely that , had our intercourse continued , and had I sat to him for the projected portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our ages , and my knowledge of his disastrous relations with my cousins , I should have become in love with him myself , and been the fourth member of our family whose life he would have disturbed and embittered . His sentimentality was of a peculiarly mischievous order , as it not only induced women to fall in love with him , but enabled him to persuade himself that he was in love with them , and apparently with more than one at a time . While I was sitting to him for the beautiful sketch he gave my mother , one or two little incidents occurred that illustrated curiously enough this superficial pseudo-sensibility of his . On one occasion , when he spent the evening with us , my mother had made me sing for him , and the next day , after my sitting , he said in a strange , hesitating , broken manner , as if struggling to control some strong emotion , " I have a very great favor to beg of you ; the next time I have the honor and pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Kemble does not disapprove of it , sing this song for me ? " He put a piece of music into my hand , and immedi*tely left us without another word . On our way home in the carriage , I unrolled the song , the title of which was These few pale Autumn Flowers . " Ha ! ' * said my mother , with , I thought , ratherapeculiar expression , as I read the words ; but she added no further comment . Both words and music were plaintive and pathetic , and had an original stamp in the melancholy they expressed . The next time Lawrence spent the evening with us , I sang the song for him . While I did so , he stood by the piano in a state of profound abstraction , from which he recovered himself as if coming back from very far away , and with an expression of acute pain on his countenance , to thank me repeatedly for what he called the great favor I had done him . At the end of my next sitting , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he said , " No , do n't go yet , - stay a moment , - I want to show von something - if I can ; " and he moved restlessly about , taking up and putting down his chalks and pencils , and standing , and sitting down again , as if unable to make up his mind to do what he wished . At length he went abruptly to an easel , and , removing from it a canvas with a few slight sketches on it , he discovered behind it the profile portrait of a lady in a white dress folded simply across her bosom , and showing her beautiful neck and shoulders . Her head was dressed with a sort of sibylline turban , and she supported it upon a most lovely hand and arm , her elbow resting on a large book , towards which she bent , and on the pages of which her eyes were fixed , the exquisite eyelid and lashes hiding the eyes . " Oh , how beautiful ! oh , who is it ! " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning white and red , " towards whom - for whom - I entertained the profoundest regard . " Thereupon he fled out of the room . " It is the portrait of Mrs. W- , " said my mother ; " she is now dead ; she was an exceedin* , ly beautiful and accomplished woman , the authoress of the words and music of the song Sir Thomas Lawrence asked you to learn for him . " The great painter 's devotion to this lovely person had been matter of notoriety in the London world . Strangely enough , but a very short time ago I discovered that she was the kinswoman of my friend Miss Cobbe 's mother , of whom Miss Cobbe possessed a miniature in which the fashion of dress and style of head - dress were the same as those in the picture I saw , and in which I also traced some resemblance to the beautiful face which made so great an impression on me . Not long after this Mrs. Siddons , dining with us one day , asked my mother how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 1876. 33 // my mother 's reply , my aunt remained silent for some time , and then , laying her hand on my father 's arm , said , " Charles , when I die , I wish to be carried to my grave by you and Lawrence . " Lawrence reached his grave while she was yet totterin* , on the brink of hers . After my next sitting , my mother , thinking he might be gratified by my aunt 's feelin , , towards him , mentioned her having dined with us . He asked eagerly of her health , her looks , her words , and my mother telling him of her speech about him , he threw down his pencil , clasped his hands , and , with his eyes full of tears and his face convulsed , exclaimed , " Good God ! did she say that ? ' * When my likeness was finished , Lawrence showed it to my mother , who , though she had attended all my sittings , had never seen it till it was completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What strikes you ? what do you think ? * " It is very like Maria , " said my mother , almost involuntarily , I am sure , for immediately this strange man fell into one of these paroxysms of emotion , and became again so a itated as scarcely to be able to speak ; and at last , with a violent effort , said , " Oh , she is very like her ; she is very like them all ! * ' In spite of these emotions , which I heard and saw Sir Thomas Lawrence express , I know positively that at his death a lady who had been an intimate acquaintance of our family for many years put on widow 's weeds for him , in the full persuasion that had he lived he would have married her , and that the mutual regard they entertained for each other warranted her assuming the deepest morn in , for him . Not the least curious part of the emotional demonstrations I have described was the contrast which they formed to Sir Thomas Lawrence 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved to a degree of coldness , and as indicative of reticent discretion and imperturbable self-control as became a man who lived in such high social places , and frequented the palaces of royalty and the bondoirs of the great rival beauties of the English aristocracy . July , On my twentieth birthday , which occurred soon after my first appearance , Lawrence sent me a magnificent proofplate of Reynolds 's portrait of my aunt as the Tragic Muse , beautifully framed and with this inscription : " This portrait , by England 's greatest painter , of the noblest subject of his pencil , is presented to her niece and worthy successor , by her most faithful humble friend and servant , Lawrence . " When my mother saw this , she exclaimed at it , and said , " I am surprised he ever brought himself to write those words - her worthy successor . ' " A few days after , Lawrence begged me to let him have the print acrain , as he was not satisfied with the finishing of the frame . It was sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words in which he had admitted any worthy successor to his Tragic Muse ; and Mr. H- , who was at that time his secretary , told me that Lawrence had the print lying with that inscription in his drawing - room for several days before sending it to me , and had said to him , " Cover it up , I can not b**ar to look at it . " One day , at the end of my sitting , Lawrence showed me a lovely portrait of Mrs. Inchbald , of whom my mother , as we drove home , told me a number of amusing anecdotes . She was very beautiful , and gifted with original genius , as her plays and farces and novels ( above all , the Simple Story ) testify ; she was not an actress of any special merit , but of respectable mediocrity . She stuttered habitually , but her delivery was never impeded by this defect on the stage ; a curious circumstance , not uncommon to persons who have that infirmity , and who can read and recite without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Inebbald was a person of a very remarkable character , lovely , poor , with unusual mental powers and of irreproachable conduct . Her life was devoted to the care of some dependent relation , who from sickness was incapable of self - support . Mrs. Inebbald had a singular uprightness and unworldliness , and a childlike directness and simplicity of manner , which , combined Old l'Yomctn 's Gossip . // with her personal loveliness and halting , broken utterance , gave to her conversation , which was both humorous and witty , a most peculiar and comical charm . Once after traveling all day in a pouring rain , on alighting at her inn , the coachman , dripping all over with wet , offered his arm to help her out of the coach , when she exclaimed , to the great amusement of her fellow-travelers , " Oh , no , no ! y-y-y-you will give me in-in-in-my death of c-c-c-cold ; do brine me a-a-a-a dry man . " An aristocratic neighbor of hers , with whom she was sli*htly acquainted , driving with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overtook her walking along the road one very hot day , and , stopping his carriage , asked her to let him have the pleasure of taking her home ; when she instantly declined , with the characteristic excuse that she had just come from the market-gardener 's : " And , my lord , I-I-I have my pocket f-f-f-full of onions , " - an unsophisticated statement of facts which made them laugh extreme ly . At the first reading of one of her pieces , a certain young lady with rather a lean , lanky figure being proposed to her for the part of the heroine , she indignantly exclaimed , " No , no , no ; II-I-I wo n't have that s-s-s-stick of a girl ! D-d-d-do give me a-a  --  a girl with bumps ! " Coming off the stage one evening , she was about to sit down by Mrs. Siddons in the green-room , when suddenly , lookin , at her magnificent neighbor , she said , " No , I wo n't s-s-s-sit by you ; you re t-t-t-too handsome ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , and Jess with my aunt than any one , their style of beauty being so absolutely dissimilar . Somebody speaking of having oysters for supper , much surprise was excited by Mrs. Inchbald 's saying that she had never eaten one . Questions and remonstrances , exclamations of astonishment and earnest advice to enlarge her experience in that respect assailed her from the whole greenroom , when she finally delivered herself thus : " Oh , no indeed ! I-I-I-I never , never could ! What ! e-e-e-eat the eyes and t-t-t  --  the nose , the teeth a-a-a-and the toes , the a-a-a-all of a creature ! " She was an enthusiastic admirer of my uncle John , and the hero of her Simple Story , Doriforth , is supposed to have been intended by her as a portrait of him . On one occasion , when she was sitting by the fire-place in the green-room , waiting to be called upon the stage , she and Miss Mellon ( afterwards Mrs. Coutts and Duchess of St. Albans ) were laughingly discussing their male friends and acquaintances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was standing near , excessively ani*used , at length jestingly said to Mrs. Inchbald , who had been comically energetic in her declarations of who she could or would , or never could or would , have married , " Well , Mrs. Inchbald , would you have had me ? " " Dear heart ! " said the stanimering beauty , turning her sweet , sunny face up to him , " I 'd have j-j-j-jumped at you ! " One day Lawrence took us , from the room where I generally sat to him , into a long gallery where were a number of his pictures , and , leading me by the hand , desired me not to raise my eyes till he told me . On the word of command I looked up , and found myself standing close to and immediately underneath , as it were , a colossal figure of Satan . The sudden shock of finding myself in such proximity to this terrible image made me burst into nervous tears . Lawrence was greatly distressed at the result of his experiment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of the power of his picture . A conversation we had been havin , upon the subject of Milton and the character of Satan had made him think of showing this picture to me . I was too much agitated to form any judgmeat of it , but I thought I perceived through its fierce and tragical expression some trace of my uncle 's face and features , a sort of " more so " of the bitter pride and scornful melancholy of the banished Roman in the Volscian Hall . Lawrence 's imagination was so filled with the poetical and dramatic suggestions which he derived from the Kemble brother and sister , that I thought 1876. 35 // a likeness of them lurked in this portrait of the Prince of Darkness ; and perhaps he could scarcely have found a better model for his arch-fiend than my uncle , to whom his mother occasionally addressed the characteristic reproof , " Sir , you are as proud as Lucifer ! " ( He and that remarkable mother of his must really have been a good deal like Coriolanus and Volumnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me , Lawrence took me into his drawing-room , - that beautiful apartment filled with beautiful things , including his magnificent collection of original drawings by the old masters , and precious gems of old and modern art , - the treasure-house of all the exquisite objects of beauty and curiosity that he had gathered together during his whole life , and that ( with the exception of Raphael 's and Michael Angelo 's drawings , now in the museum at Oxford ) were so soon , at his most unexpected death , to be scattered abroad and become , in separate , disjointed portions , the property of a hundred different purchasers . Here , he said , he hoped often to persuade my father and mother and myself to pass our unengaged evenings with him ; here he should like to make my brother John , of whom I had spoken enthusiastically to him , free of his art collections ; and , adding that he would write to my mother to fix the day for my first sitting for Juliet , he put into my hands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never entered that room or his house , or saw him again ; he died about ten days after that . Lawrence did not talk much while he took his sketch of me , and I remember very little that passed between him and my mother but what was purely personal . I recollect he told me that I had a double row of eyelashes , which was an unusual peculiarity . He expressed the most decided preference for satin over every other material for painting , expatiating rapturously on the soft , rich folds and infinitely varied lights and shadows which that texture afforded above all others . He has dressed a great many of his female portraits in white satin . He also once said that he had been haunted at one time with the desire to paint a blush , that most enchantin* , " incident " in the expression of a woman 's face , but , after being driven nearly wild with the ineffectual endeavor , had had to renounce it , never , of course , he said , achieving anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by a story he told my mother of Lady J- ( George the Fourth 's Lady J ) , who , standing before her drawing-room looking-glass , and unaware that he was in the room , apostrophized her own reflection with this reflection : " I swear , it would be better to go to hell at once , than live to grow old and ugly . " Lawrence once said that we never dreamed of ourselves as younger than we were ; that even if our dreams reproduced scenes and people and circumstances of our youth and childhood , we were always represented , by our sleeping imagination , at our present age . I presume he spoke of his own experience , and I can not say that I recollect any instance in mine that contradicts his theory . It seems curious , if it is true , that in the manifold freaks of our sleeping fancy , self-consciousness should still exist to a sufficient degree to preserve unaltered one 's own conditions of age and physical appearance . I wonder whether this is really the common experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance in curious opposition to this theory of Lawrence 's . A young woman whom he knew , of more than usual mental and moral endowments , married a man very much her inferior in mind and character , and appeared to him to deteriorate gradually but very perceptibly under his influence . " As the husband is , the wife is , " etc . Towards the middle of her life she told him that at one time she had carried on a double existence in her sleeping and waking hours , her dreams invariably taking her back to the home and period of her girlhood , and that she resumed this dream-life precisely where she left it off , night after night , for a considerable period of time , - poor thing ! - perhaps as long as the roots of the young nobler self survived below the soil of a // baser present existence . This story seemed to me always very pathetic . It must have been dismal to lose that dreamlife by degrees , as the real one ate more and more into her nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable estimate was taken during his life , and since his death his reputation has suffered an undue depreciation . Much that he did partook of the false and bad style which , from the deeper source of degraded morality , spread a taint over all matters of art and taste , under the vicious influence of the " first gentleman of Europe , " whose own artistic preferences bore witness , quite as much as the more serious events of his life , how little he deserved the name . Hideous Chinese pagoda pavilions , with grotesque and monstrous decorations , barbarous alike in form and in color ; mean and ugly low-roomed royal palaces , without either magnificence or simplicity ; military costumes in which gold and silver lace were plastered together on the same uniform , testified to the perverted perception of beauty and fitness which presided in the court of George the Fourth . Lawrence 's own portrait of him , with his corpulent body girthed in his stays and creaseless coat , and his heavy falling cheeks supported by his stiff stock , with his dancing-master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a caricature as a flattered likeness of the original ( which was a caricature ) dares to do . To have had to paint that was enough to have vulgarized any pencil . The defect of many of Lawrence 's female portraits was a sort of artificial sentimental elegantism . Pictures of the fine ladies of that day they undoubtedly were , pictures of great ladies , never ; and , in looking at them , one sighed for the exquisite simple grace and unaffected dignity of Reynolds 's and Gainsborough 's noble and gentle women . The lovely head of Lady Nngent , the fine portrait I have mentioned of Mrs. W- , the splendid one of Lady Hatherton , and the noble picture of my grandmother , are among the best productions of Lawrence 's pencil ; and several of his men 's portraits are in a robust and simple style of art worthy of the highest admiration . His likeness of Canning ( which , by the bye , might have passed for his own , so great was his resemblance to the brilliant statesman ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uncle John , are excellent specimens of his best work . He had a remarkable gift of producing likenesses at once striking and favorable , and of always seizing the finest expression of which a face was capable ; and none could ever complain that Lawrence had not done justice to the very best look they ever wore . Lawrence 's want of conscience with regard to the pictures which he undertook and never finished is difficult to account for by any plausible explanation . The fact is notorious that in various instances , after receiving the price of a portrait , and beginning it , he procrastinated and delayed and postponed the completion , until , in more than one case , the blooming beauty sketched upon his canvas had grown faded and wrinkled before the image of her youthful loveliness had been completed . The renewal of intercourse between Lawrence and my parents , so soon to be terminated by his death , was the cause to me of a loss which I shall never cease to regret . My father had had in his library for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large volume of fine engravings of the masterpieces of the great Italian painters , and this precious book of art we were occasionally allowed to look at for an hour of rare delight ; but it belonged to Sir Thomas Lawrence , and had accidentally been kept for this long space of time in my father 's possession . One of my mother 's first acts , on again entering into friendly relations with Lawrence , was to restore this piece of property to him ; a precipitate act of honesty which I could not help deploring , especially when , so soon after this deed of rash restitution , his death brought those beautiful engravings , with all the rest of his property , to the hammer . There is no early impression stronger in my mind than that of some of those 1876. 37 // masterpieces , which , together with Winckelmann 's fine work on classical art ( our familiarity with which I have elsewhere alluded to ) , were among the first influences of the sort which I experienced . Nor can I ever be too grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing in us the highest culture , they were still such as , combined with their own excellent taste and judgment , preserved us from that which is far worse than ignorance , a liking for anything vulgar or trivial . That which was merely pretty , in music , painting , or poetry , was never placed on the same level in our admiration with that which was fine ; and though , from nature as well as training , we enjoyed with great zest everything that could in any sense be called ood , our enthusiasm was always reserved for that which was best , an incalculable advantage in the formation of a fine taste and critical judgment . A noble ideal beauty was what we were taught to consider the proper object and result of all art . In their especial vocation this tendency caused my family to be accused of formalism and artificial pedantry ; and the so-called " classical " school of acting , to which they belonged , has frequently since their time been unfavorably compared with what , by way of contrast , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not care to discuss the question , but am thankful that my education preserved me from accepting mere imitation of nature as art , on the stagv* or in the picture gallery ; and that , without destroying my delight in any kind of beauty , it taught me a decided preference for that which was highest and noblest . All being in due preparation for my comiug out , my rehearsals were the only interruption to my usual habits of occupation , which I pursued very steadily in spite of my impending trial . On the day of my first appearance I had no rehearsal , for fear of overfatigue , and spent my morning as usual , in practicing the piano , walking in the inclosure of St. James 's Park opposite our house , and reading in Blunt 's Scripture Characters ( a book in which I was then deeply interested ) the chapters relating to St. Peter and Jacob . I do not know whether the nervous tension which I must have been enduring strengthened the impression made upon me by what I read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think was curious , because certainly such subjects of meditation were hardly allied to the painful undertaking so immediately pressing upon me . But I believe I felt imperatively the necessity of moderating my own strong nervous emotion and excitement by the fulfillment of my accustomed duties and pursuits , and above all by withdrawing my mind into higher and serener regions of thought as a respite and relief from the pressure of my alternate apprehensions of failure and hopes of success . I do not mean that it was at all a matter of deliberate calculation or reflection , but rather an instinct of self-preservation , which actuated me ; a powerful instinct which has struggled and partially prevailed throughout my whole life against the irregular and passionate vehemence of my temperament , and which , in spite of a constant ten ( iency to violent excitement of mind and feeling , has made me a person of unusually systematic pursuits and monotonous habits , and been a frequent subject of astonishment , not unmixed with ridicule , to my friends , who have not known as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness . And I am persuaded that religion and reason alike justify such a strong instinctive action in natures which derive a constant moral support , like that of the unobserved but all-sustaining pressure of the atmosphere , from the soothing and restraining influence of systematic habits of monotonous regularity . Amid infinite anguish and errors , existence may preserve a species of outward symmetry and harmony from this strong band of minute observance keeping down and assisting the mind to master elements of moral and mental discord and disorder , for the due control of which the daily and hourly subjection to recurring rules is an invaluable auxiliary to higher influences . The external practice does not 38 // supply , but powerfully supplements the internal principle of self-control . My mother , who had left the stage for upwards of twenty years , determined to return to it on the night of my first appearance , that I might have the comfort and support of her being with me in my trial . We drove to the theatre very early , indeed while the late autumn sunlight yet lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and as I screened my eyes from it , my mother said , " Heaven smiles on you , my child . " My poor mother went to her dressingroom to get herself ready , and did not return to me for fear of increasing my agitation by her own . My dear aunt Dall and my maid and the theatre dresser performed my toilet for me , and at length I was placed in a chair , with my satin train carefully laid over the back of it , and there I sat , ready for execution , with the palms of my hands pressed convulsively together , and the tears I in vain endeavored to repress welling up into my eyes and brimming slowly over , down my rouged cheeks , upon which my aunt , with a smile full of pity , renewed the color as often as these heavy drops made unsi*htly streaks in it . Once and again my father came to the door , and I heard his anxious " How is she ? " to which my aunt answered , sending him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Kemble called for the stage , ma'am ! " accompanied with a brisk tap at the door , started me upright on my feet , and I was led round to the side scene opposite to the one from which I saw my mother advance on the stage ; and while the uproar of her reception filled me with terror , dear 01 ( 1 Mrs. Davenport , my nurse , and dear Mr. Kecly , her Peter , and half the drama/is personce of the play ( but not my father , who had retreated , quite unable to endure the scene ) stood round me as I lay , all but insensible , in my aunt 's arms . " Courage , courage , dear child ! poor thing , poor thing ! " reiterated Mrs. Davenport , " Never mind em , Miss Kemble ! " urged Keely , in that irresistibly comical , nervous , lachrymose voice of his , which I have never since 39 heard without a thrill of anything but comical association ; " never mind em ! do n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of cabbages ! ' * " Nurse ! " called my mother , and on waddled Mrs. Davenport , and , turning back , called in her turn , " Juliet ! " My aunt gave me an impulse forward , and I ran straight across the stage , stunned with the tremendous shout that greeted me , my eyes covered with mist , and the green baize flooring of the stage feeling as if it rose up against my feet ; but I got hold of my mother , and stood like a terrified creature at bay , confronting the huge theatre full of gazing human beings . I do not think a word I uttered during this scene could have been audible ; in the next , the ball-room , I began to forget myself ; in the following one , the balcony scene , I had done so , and for aught I knew I was Juliet ; the passion I was uttering sending hot waves of blushes all over my neck and shoulders , while the poetry sounded like music to me as I spoke it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported into the imaginary existence of the play . After this I did not return into myself till all was over , and amid a tumultuous storm of applause , congratulation , tears , embraces , and a general joyous explosion of unutterable relief at the fortunate termination of my attempt , we went home . And so my life was determined , and I devoted myself to an avocation which I never liked or honored , and about the very nature of which I have never been able to come to any decided opinion . It is in vain that the undoubted specific gifts of great actors and actresses suggest that all gifts are given for rightful exercise , and not suppression ; in vain that Shakespeare 's plays urge their imperative claim to the most perfect illustration they can receive from histrionic interpretation : a business which is incessant excitement and factitious emotion seems to me unworthy of a man ; a business which is public exhibition , unworthy of a woman . At four different periods of my life I have been constrained by circumstances Old Woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic faculty ; latterly , it is true , in a less painful and distasteful manner , by reading , instead of actin , . But though I have never , I trust , been ungrateful for the power of thus helping myself and others , or forgetful of the obligation I was under to do my appointed work conscientiously in every respect , or unmindful of the precious good regard of so many kind hearts that it has won for me ; though I. have never lost one iota of my own intense delight in the act of rendering Shakespeare 's creations ; yet neither have I ever presented myself before an audience without a shrinking feeling of reluctance , or withdrawn from their presence without thinking the excitement I had undergone unhealthy , and the personal exhibition odious . Nevertheless I sat mc down to supper that night with my poor , rejoicing parents well content , God knows ! with the issue of my trial ; and still better pleased with a lovely little Geneva watch , the first I had ever possessed , all encrusted with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate and I immediately christened Romeo , and went , a blissful girl , to sleep with it under my pillow . BUCKIEGHAM GATE , JAMES STREET , December 14th. 3 DEAREST H- : I received your letter this morning , before I was out of my room , and very glad I was to get it . You would have heard from me again ere this had it not been that , in your present anxious state of mind respecting your brother , I did not like to demand your attention for my proceedings . My trial is over , and , thank Heaven ! most fortunately . Our most sanguine wishes could hardly have gone beyond the result , and at the same time that I hail my success as a source of great happiness to my dear father and mother , I almost venture to hope that the interest which has been excited in the public may tend to revive once more the decaying dramatic art . You say it is a very fascinating occupation ; perhaps it is , though it does not appear to me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate as an antidote to the vanity and love of admiration which it can hardly fail to foster . The mere embodying of the exquisite ideals of poetry is a great enjoyment , but after that , or rather for that , comes in ours , as in all arts , the mechanical process , the labor , the refining , the controlling the very feeling one has , in order to manifest it in the best way to the perception of others ; and when all that intense feeling and careful work can accomplish is done , an actor must often see those points of his performance which are most worthy of approbation overlooked , and others , perhaps crude in taste or less true in feeling , commended ; which must tend much , I think , to sober the mind as to the value of applause . Above all , the constant consciousness of the inimeasurable distance between a fine conception and the best execution of it must in acting , as in all art , be a powerful check to vanity and self-satisfaction . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre , I am sure you will believe me when I say I do not think I shall ever experience it . But should I reckon too much upon my own steadiness , I have the incessant care and watchfulness of my dear mother to rely on , and I do rely on it as an invaluable safeguard , both to the purity and good taste of all that I may do on the stage , and the quiet and soberness of my mind under all this new excitement . She has borne all her anxieties wonderfully well , and I now hope she will reap some repayment for them ; my dear father is very happy ; indeed , we have all cause for heartfelt thankfulness when we think what a light has dawned upon our prospects , lately so dismal and overcast . My own motto in all this must be , as far as possible , " Beget a temperance in all things . " I trust I shall be enabled to rule myself by it , and in the firm hope that my endeavor to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed myself , nothing doubting , to the stormy sea of life . Dearest II- , the papers will give you a detailed ac 40 July , // count of my de'but ; I only wish to assure you that I have not embraced this course without due dread of its dangers , and a firm determination to watch , as far as in me lies , over its effect upon my mind . It is after all but lately , you know , that I have become convinced that fame and gratified ambition are not the worthiest aims for one 's exertions . With affectionate love , believe me ever your fondly attached , FANNY . I most sincerely hope that your brother 's health is improving , and if we do not meet sooner , I shall now look forward to Dublin as our point de re'union ; that will not be the least of the obligations I shall owe this happy turn of affairs . I do not know whence I derived the deep impression I expressed in this letter of the moral dangers of the life upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom , of course , the idea that actors and actresses could not be respectable people naturally did not occur , and who were not troubled , I am sure , as I then was , with a perception of the more subtle evils of their calling . I had never heard the nature of it discussed , and was absolutely without experience of it , but the vapid vacuity of the last years of my aunt Siddons 's life had made a profound impression upon me , - her apparent deadness and indifference to everything , which I attributed ( unjustly , perhaps ) less to her advanced age and impaired powers than to what I supposed the withering and drying influence of the overstimulating atmosphere of emotion , excitement , and admiration in which she had passed her life ; certain it is that such was my dread of the effect of my profession upon me , that I added an earnest petition to my daily prayers that I might be defended from the evil influence I feared it might exercise upon me . As for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in it , for puffing can send upwards only things that have a buoyant , rising quality in themselves ; but there was also a great feeling of personal sympathy for my father and moth-41 er , of kindly indulgence for my youth , and of respectful recollection of my uncle and aunt ; and a very general desire that the fine theatre where they had exercised their powers should be rescued , if possible , from its difficulties . All this went to make up a result of which I had the credit . Among my experiences of that nauseous ingredient in theatrical life , puffery , some have been amusing enough . The last time that I gave public readings in America , the management of them was undertaken by a worthy , respectable person , who was not , I think , exceptionally addicted to the devices and charlatanism which appear almost inseparable from the business of public exhibition in all its branches . At the end of our first interview for the purpose of arranging my performances , as he was taking his leave he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite in a nice train . I should say things are in a most favorable state of preparation ; we ye a delightful article coming out in the . " Here he mentioned a popular periodical . " Ah , indeed ? " said I , not quite apprehending what my friend was aiming at . " Yes , really , ma'am , I should say first-rate , and I thought perhaps we might induce you to be good enough to help us a little with it . " " Bless me ! " said I , more and more puzzled , " how can I help you ? " " Well , ma'am , with a few personal anecdotes , perhaps , if you would be so kind . " " Anecdotes ? " said I ( with three points of interrogation ) . " What do you mean ? What about ? " " Why , ma'am " ( with a low bow ) , " about Mrs. Kemble , of course . " Now , my worthy agent 's remuneration was to consist of a certain proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , I felt I had no right absolutely to forbid him all puffing advertisements and ( lecently legitimate efforts to attract public attention and interest to performances by which he was to benefit . At the same time , I also felt it imperatively necessary that there should be some limit to these proceedings , if I was to be made a party to them . I therefore told him that , as his interest was involved in the success Old Woman 's Gossi*p. // of the readings , I could not forbid his puffing them to some extent , as , if I did , he might consider himself injured . " But , " said I , while refusing the contribution of any personal anecdotes to his forthcoming article , " take care what you do in that line , for if you overdo it in the least , I will write an article , myself , on my readings , showing up all their faults and turning them into ridicule as I do not believe any one else either would or could . So puff just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my agent left me with the same opinion of my competency in business that Mr. Macready had expressed as to my proficiency in my profession , namely , that " I did not know the rudiments of it . " Mr. Mitchell , who from the first took charge of all my readings in England , and was the very kindest , most considerate , and most courteous of all managers , on one occasion , complaining bitterly to my sister of the unreasonable objection I had to all laudatory advertisements of my readings , said to her , with a voice and countenance of the most rueful melancholy , and with the most appealing pathos , " Why , you know , ma'am , it s really dreadful ; you know , Mrs. Kernble wo n't even allow us to say in the bills , these celebrated readings ; and you know , ma'am , it s really impossible to do with less ; indeed it is ! Why , ma'am , you know even Morrison 's pills are always advertised as these celebrated pills ! " - an illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with infinite delight . When I saw the shop-windows full of Lawrence 's sketch of me , and knew myself the subject of almost daily newspaper notices , when plates and saucers were brought to me with small figures of me as Juliet and Belvidera on them , and finally , when gentlemen showed me lovely buff-colored neck-handkerchiefs which they had bought , and which had , as I thought , pretty lilac-colored flowers all over them , which proved on nearer inspection to be minute copies of Lawrence 5 head of me , I not unnaturally , in the fullness of my inexperience , believed in my own success . I have since known more of the manufacture of public enthusiasm and public triumphs , and , remembering to how many people it was a matter of vital importance that the public interest should be kept alive in me , and Covent Garden filled every night I played , I have become more skeptical upon the subject . Seeing lately a copy of my play of Francis the First , with ( to my infinite astonishment ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " I suppose this was a bit of bookseller 's puffery ; or did each edition consist of three copies ? " He replied , " Oh , no , I tiiink not ; you have forgotten the furor there was about you when this came out . " At twenty I believed it all ; at sixty-six I find it difficult to believe any of it . It is certain , however , that I played Juliet upwards of a hundred and twenty times running , with all the irregularity and unevenness and immature inequality of which I have spoken as characteristics which were never corrected in my performances . My mother , who never missed one of them , would sometimes come down from her box and , folding me in her arms , say only the very satisfactory words , " Beautiful , my dear ! " Quite as often , if not oftener , the verdict was , " My dear , your performance was not fit to be seen ! I do n't know how you ever contrived to do the part decently ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you appear to have entirely lost the secret of ; you had better give the whole thing up at once than go on doing it so disgracefully ill . " This was awful , and made my heart sink down into my shoes , whatever might have been the fervor of applause with which the audience had greeted my p*rformance . My life now became settled in its new shape . I acted regularly three times a week ; I had no rehearsals , since Romeo and Juliet went on during the whole season , and so my mornings were still my own . I always dined in the middle of the day ( and invariably on a muttonchop , so that I might have been a Harrow boy , for diet ) ; I was taken by my aunt early to the theatre , and there in my // dressing-room sat through the entire play , when I was not on the stage , with some piece of tapestry or needle - work , with which , during the intervals of my tragic sorrows , I busied my fingers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene and the various effects it demanded . When I was called for the stage , my aunt came with me , carrying my train , that it might not sweep the dirty floor behind the scenes ; and after spreading it out and adjusting its folds carefully , as I went on , she remained at the side scene till I came off again , then gathered it on her arm and , folding a shawl around me , escorted me back to my dressing - room and tapestry ; and so my theatrical evenings were passed . My parents would not allow me to go into the green-room , where they thought my attention would be distracted from my business and where I might occasionally meet with undesirable associates . My salary was fixed at thirty guineas a week , and the Saturday after I came out , I presented myself for the first and last time at the treasury of the theatre to receive it , and carried it , clinking , with great triumph to my mother , the first money I ever earned . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which three weeks had made in the aspect of my whole life . From an insignificant school - girl , I had suddenly become an object of general public interest . I was a little lion in society , and the town talk of the day . Approbation , admiration , adulation , were showered upon me ; every condition of my life had been altered , as by the wand of a fairy . Instead of the twenty pounds a year which my poor father squeezed out of his hardearned income for my allowance , out of which I bought ( alas , with how much difficulty , seeing how many other things I would buy ! ) my gloves and shoes , I now had an assured income , as long as my health and faculties were unimpaired , of at least a thousand a year ; and the thirty guineas a week at Covent Garden , and much larger remuneration during provincial tours , forever forbade the sense of destitution productive of the ecstasy with which , only a short time before I came out , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my desk a sovereign that I had overlooked , and so had sorrowfully concluded myself penniless till next allowance day . Instead of trudging long distances afoot through the muddy London streets , when the hire of a hackney-coach was matter of serious consideration , I had a comfortable and elegant carriage ; I was allowed , at my own earnest request , to take riding lessons , and before long had a charming horse of my own , and was able to afford the delight of giving my father one , the use of which I hoped would help to invigorate and refresh him . The faded , threadbare , turned , and dyed frocks which were my habitual wear were exchanged for fashionably- made dresses of fresh colors and fine texture , in which I appeared to myself transfigured . Our door was besieged with visitors , our evenings bespoken by innumerable invitations ; social civilities and courtesies poured in upon us from every side in an incessant stream ; I was sought and petted and caressed by persons of conventional and real distinction , and every night that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had thought it prudent to let me do so , have passed in all the gayety of the fashionable world and the great London season . So much cordiality , sympathy , interest , and apparent genuine goodwill seemed to accompany all these flattering demonstrations , that it was impossible for me not to be touched and gratified , - perhaps , too , unduly elated . If I was spoiled and my head turned , I can only say I think it would have needed a strong head not to be so ; but God knows how pitiful a preparation all this tinsel sudden success and popularity formed for the duties and trials of my after-life .
