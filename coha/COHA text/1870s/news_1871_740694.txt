txt Sufficient time has elapsed since my eonviction for the murder or Mr. Pirretim to allow me to make that appeal to the cool judgment of the public which my counsel could not make in a court-room , oppressed by the usual legal formalities . I have not much to say , but in my awful position what little appeal I make 18 Invested with a terrible Importance , to me at least . After a short and impartial trial , before the case was submitted to the jury , judge CAnDozo charged almost directly in my favor ? at least , in modification of the verdict . He directed the jury that a fit of passion did not imply the requisite degree of malice justifying a verdict of murder in the first degree . He almost as much as told them that in my case there was no evidence proving that I intended to kill Mr. Prireast  --  that death was a result I never contemplated , and that however furious the resentment of the public might be , it would not be In accordance with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. PUTNAM . The jury was evidently Inclined to regard this direction of Judge CARDOZO , but they were afraid to abide by it thoroughly . Public opinion was too strong and because . I believe , it did not stop to consider my case coolly . It compelled that jury to bring me in guilty of downright murder in the first degree . But even then they went as far as they dared in recommending ins to mercy . They recommended me to mercy because they felt that there was somethimg wrong with the rest of their verdict , and they wanted to make the best balance they could without taking any responsibility themselves . Now I make this appeal from my condemned cell , because the public are beginning to believe with Judge CARDOZO . Judge CAnnozo said the truth . He said I never meant to kill Mr. PUTNAM . He knew from the very evidence that there was nothing further from my intention ? and it is the intention which makes the crime . What are the facts of the easel 1 bad been drinking heavily  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , mad drank , and I got into a drunken difficulty with estrange man . That was Mr. PuTNAN . He said something which aggravated my drunken madness . Without any thought , without any calculation , on the impulse of blind- fury , I struck him with the first thing that came to hand . That blow was never intended to kill Mr. PUTNAM . It was struck with hardly any intention at all . It was the work of a madman , not of a deliberate murderer . It was struck with no recognized weapon  --  just the first thing that came to hand . If it had fallen on the top of his head it would probably never have kilted him . But it did kill him , and for the blow which I struck , without having any definite intention , resulting in his death , I am condemned to death in revenge . No one will pretend to say that I deliberately set about to effect . Mr. PUTNAM% death . I made no attempt to escape . I identified myself I claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my drunken blow would result in bringing about my conviction of murder . Public resentment and exasperation brought about the verdict . There are men in the Tombs who have killed others soberly , in cold blood , and there has been no hue and cry after them . A man who had a quarrel with another and then went home and procured a knife with which he came back and stabbed him to death , deliberately and in cold blood . was sent to Sing Sing for four years the other day . There are others in this prison convicted of murder with weapons known to be deadly ? so that their intentions in Using them could not be doubted a moment  --  and they are safe . Then again , I was tried in the Court of Oyer and Terminer , that I might have no appeal . There is no appeal from that Court . Everybody else on the same charge is tried before General Sessions . There are three or four men now , convicted and sentenced , who have a stay of proceedings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before General Sessions . I was tried out of my turn . There were others indicted for murder months before me , who have not been tried yet , because there was no hue and cry after them , while the nubile was resolved to have my blood as soon as possible . Out of these I alone am selected to undergo.capital punishment , because mine was a sensational case . No one can doubt the truth of this , and It IS because this Is the truth known to God and sworn to by me in the shadow of death , that I make my appeal to the public . I am doomed to die because a wicked drunken freak resulted in the death of a man , whom I no more intended to harm seriously than I would my own child . The public , perhaps , because it forgets me in the horror of my cell , convicted of an intention which I never had ? as my Creator , into whose presence I am shortly to be hurled , knows better even than I do ? insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean nothing/ Does anybody refuse to see in it the protest of the jury against the pressure which forced them to bring me to the gallows I The public , which was furious , compelled the jury to act as it did , and I make my appeal , therefore , to the public . I implore the public to consider my case , now that I am sentenced , and any evasion of law in my favor is impossible , coolly and dispassionately . I appeal to the publics to be just and fear not . And what I have to say in my behalf I say with the solemnity of my situation . I make my appeal as a condemned murderer , sentenced to a speedy and ignominious death , helpless and powerless , but confident that the same feeling which on an impulse secured my conviction , will , when cool and deliberate , do even me proper justice .
