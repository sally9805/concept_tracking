ARTICLE VL-THE REVISION OF THE AUTHORIZED ENGLISH VERSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT . THE Revision of the Authorized English Version of the Bible , as is now generally known , was originated by the Convocation of Canterbury , in England , at its meeting in February , 1870 . This body resolved , on that occasion , to undertake the work , and appointed a Committee of its own members for the purpose . The resolutions which were adopted , were very simple and brief . They declared the desirableness of a revision , but indicated that it should not be extended so far as to become in any sense a new translation , or to involve any alteration of the language of the old version , except when , in the judgment of competent scholars , such a change should be necessary . They also suggested , that , in the case of such necessary changes , the style of the language employed in the existing version should be closely followed . As members of the Committee eight representatives from each house of the Convocation were named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Deans Alford , of Canterbury , and Stanley , of Westminster , are among the more prominent as known on this side of the ocean . With one further expression of its judgment-namely , " that this Committee should be at liberty to invite the codperation of any persons eminent for scholarship , to whatever nation or religious body they might belong "  --  the Convocation intrusted the work entirely to the charge of the new body which it had created . It imposed upon the members of that body no obligation to submit the results of their labors for its own examination or approval , and no conditions of any kind which should make them dependent upon itself . The Coin . NOTE-This Article is the substance of a Lecture given at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College , on the 4th of March , 1819 . This fact will account for some peculiarities of style and expression . It may be stated , also , that , inasmuch as the rules of the Revision Committees , both in England and in our own country , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Authorized Version which have been adopted , until the work has been brought to its completion , the suggestions offered in this Article with regard to such points are suggestions for which the author alone is responsible . // mittee owed its existence to the act of the Convocation , and carried the authoritative influence of that act into the new undertaking . But , in the work itself , it had no responsibility laid upon it , except that it should proceed in accordance with the general principle of Revision which had been set forth , and should be faithful to the truth . In accordance with the resolutions which gave it being , the Committee met in May of the same year , and divided itself into two companies , one for the Revision of the Old Testament and the other for that of the New Testament . At the same time , it extended an invitation to thirty-seven other gentlemen , both of the Established and Dissenting Churches of the kingdom , to join the two companies , on an equality in all respects with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rules for its own guidance in carrying on its work , which were in the line of the suggestions given to it by the Convocation , and were fitted to secure the best results . The first meeting for the purpose of Revision was held on the 22d of June , 1870 . It was only a few months after this date , that negotiations were entered upon for the creation of an American Committee of Revision , which should act in cooperation with the English companies , and should be governed in its work by similar rules . These negotiations were in harmony with the resolutions adopted by the Convocation , as we have already noticed them , and were prompted by the same large-mindedness which had extended the limits of the original Committee , so as to include representatives of the non-conforming churches in Great Britain . The American Companies , after some delay with reference to their organization , met for the beginning of their work in October , 1872 . For nearly nine years , therefore , on the other side of the ocean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Revision has been in course of preparation . The sessions of the Committees in both countries have been held-one in London and the other in New York-once in every month during the greater part of each year within this period . These sessions have been devoted to consultation and decision respecting passages previously assigned , which have been investigated by all the members in their individual studies . In this way , every chapter and verse , every clause and every word have // been carefully examined and as carefully discussed , until now the entire New Testament has been twice brought undc*r review , and the translation passed upon by nearly forty persons-representing the two countries and all evangelical denominations-men of ability in various lines of scholarship within the general field of biblical learning , who , in the constant interchange of views , have aided one another , and have come , it is hoped , to wise decisions which will commend themselves to the judgment of the church . The work on the Old Testament is of course not so near its completion , because the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of this it is not my office here to speak . The American New Testament Company are now engaged in a third review of some of the more difficult or doubtful points , which they have carried partly through the gospels . This work as connected with the remaining New Testament books will require several months , probably more than a year longer , but before the period of ten years shall have elapsed from the time when the Revision was first entered upon in Englandthat is , previous to June , 1880-it is believed that the New Testament will be completed . A delay , because of the longer time required for the Old Testament , may be necessary before the publication of the new book . But we may now look forward with hope to the end as in the near future . In connection with this brief review of the history of the Revision four questions may naturally suggest themselves . First , Is the work one for the entrance upon which , at the beginning , there were abundant and satisfactory reasons ? Secondly , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been undertaken , and bn what principles should they carry it forward ? Thirdly , Of what character are the good results and changes , both general and particular , which may be anticipated from it ? Fourthly , Is it probable that the Revision now nearly completed will be successful , and will take the place of the old Revision of 1611 ? I. In a large proportion of the things to which our thought is directed , the discussion of reasons why they should or should not be done , is , by common consent , terminated when we find that they have actually been done . This fact seems to render // all such discussion useless , and brings our minds to meet and consider the new condition and this alone . But , in this matter which is now before us , the sufficiency of the reasons for originally undertaking the work is one of the chief points in determining the probability of its success , so far as the attainment of that end is concerned which those who favor it have had in view . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet , at this late period in the history of the undertaking , it will not be necessary to present them with the fullness which was once required . The progress of time , and the results which time has brought with it , will count for something even here . It will be enough for my present purpose to offer two suo-o-estions . The first reason which justifies us in undertaking a new revision of our translation of the Scriptures is the fact that no such work has been attempted by a duly-organized body for more than two centuries . This fact is , to many minds , the ground of opposition to the present movement . The English Bible has been too sacred , they say ; it has been too long held in reverence as the word of God , to be subjected to changes at this remote period . Changes will detract from its sacredness . They will make the Bible a thing of to-day , and tend to depress it to the level of the books which concern our earthly living only , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine . They will separate us from the words in which Christian believers of former generations , and not only they but we ourselves , have given expression to pious feeling and entered into communion with God and his truth . They will take away from the glory of its ancient style , and the solemn music which belongs to its very language ,  --  the things which , as it is read in our hearing , make it seem like the voice of the holy apostles and prophets of the early times . They will shock the religious feeling , and even shake the religious faith of the common reader , to whom the Version of his ancestors has seemed to be the true Scripture , inspired by the Holy Spirit , and written under his direction . What gain can compensate for such loss ? That which guided our fathers , and their fathers also , to heaven for more than two centuries , should be left as it is. // This reasoning is good as against those who would modernize the language throughout , and make a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a Revision which keeps itself in harmony with the book that is revised . If there can be improvements within the limits of the old language and style , the suggestions which have just been referred to do not prove the impropriety or undesirableness of introducing them . Now the passing away of so long a period affords in itself a presumption that such improvements can be made , and suggests that careful investigation should be instituted in order to determine whether this presumption is sustained . The very instituting of the investigation , however , calls for a body which shall be competent to revise , if the necessity for it shall appear . And such a necessity will appear , if the result of the investigation shall prove that the common reader can be led thereby to a truer understanding of the Divine teachings . If difficulties and obscurities can be removed , or if the thought can even be more felicitously expressed , so that a verse or passage can gain a new impressiveness to the mind , this fact in itself ought to overbalance every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings are what , as honest scholars and Christians , we ought to desire beyond all things else . Moreover , there is a danger that the common reader , if no such investigation is ever allowed , may rest in a false idea of the English Version . He may come to think that it is what . it is not , and may make a sort of idol of it . It is better for the interests of the truth , that he should know how to estimate it aright , and should understand that it is a translation of the inspired writings made by uninspired men . Otherwise he is deceived , and is liable to be awakened from his deception by some rude attack of an enemy , who , gaining a sort of victory over him at this point , is thereby enabled to lead him into greater dangers and errors than would , under other circumstances , be possible . Reverence the Bible of our fathers as we will , as it is a version only the progress of time may give us the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which it is derived . When that progress has gone on for two hundred and sixty years , it can not be too early to enter upon inquiries , // and to make those changes which shall give it a greater value than it ever possessed before . The second of the two reasons , which I would suggest , for undertaking the new Revision is the fact , that , in an especial sense and measure , the means which enable us to make an accurate reproduction of the original Greek writings of the New Testament are now in our possession . I do not refer simply to the circumstance that much has been discovered with regard to the Greek text , and that great additions have been made to the knowledge of the Greek language , since 1611 . This point , in itself , is one of great significance . It is well known by all who are familiar with the subject , that the Greek text on which the English Version is based was derived from a comparatively small number of manuscripts , and that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is called , which is essentially the text of our translators , was founded in the main upon that of Erasmus as published in 1527 , and his text as then printed varied but little from that of his first edition of the Greek Testament in 1516 . This first edition , however , was drawn from only five , and to a large extent from three , manuscripts of as late a date as the tenth , twelfth , thirteenth , and fifteenth centuries . Since the days of our translators the oldest and best manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries , and large numbers of others , extending in time from that early period down to the invention of printing , have been discovered or collated . The ancient versions , also , and the works of the Christian writers of the first centuries have been investigated more thoroughly and are better understood . A large amount of new evidence , and evidence also of the highest value , has thus been obtained , by means of which we are able to determine the precise words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the scholars of King James 's age . The progress of two hundred and fifty years has , likewise , carried forward , riot indeed with * great an advance , but to a very marked degree , the scholarship of the modern nations in all departments of Greek learning . In respect to the uses and signification of words , the force of tenses and moods , the laws respecting the article , the distinction between prepositions , in fact all the nicer shades of meaning and the minuter grammat // ical relations , on which so much depends in such an artistic language as the ancient Greek , the more perfect understanding which has been attained is of the highest importance to the translator . But significant as these things are , there is a fact in connection with them which has an especial bearing upon the Revision as now undertaken . The results of the new acquisitions , in both of the lines which have been mentioned , have been in a very remarkable degree gathered together , and placed in the hands of scholars generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned men of Germany , during this period , have been full of good results . These results have been transferred , in great measure , to England and America , and the stimulating influence of German scholarship has made itself felt in both nations . Since the publication , in 1850 , of the first edition of Dean Alford 's Greek Testament , previous to which England had for many years done little for Biblical interpretation , a company of scholars has arisen in this department , some of whom hold a high rank as measured by any standard . Within these twenty - nine years , the preparation for this great work has , thus , been constant and even wonderful . At no time since the beginning of the century , could a body 50 competent have been found in the kingdom to meet the need . In our own country , also , linguistic scholarship in all branches , and strikingly in this particular line , has passed far beyond its earlier stages during the same period , and has attained a development akin to that of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of decision with respect to both meaning and text have been afforded . They have arisen because the means have been afforded . And , as the two necessary conditions are fulfilled ,  --   --  and fulfilled for the first time-through the presence of the men and the means , it would seem that the period had arrived for beginning the work . The Providential indications can scarcely be mistaken . II . But if it is reasonable to undertake a new Revision , by what persons and on what principles should it be carried for-ward ? That such a work should not be intrusted to an individual , however learned or cultivated , it is believed that all who reflect // upon the subject will agree . Not , indeed , that there are no advantages which could be anticipated from such a course . A single scholar , having the sole responsibility in the case , might no doubt exhibit a greater unity of plan in his working , and very probably would have more boldness in making changes and improvements , which the results of investigation should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anything that is old , but also fears opposition on the part of the religious public , increases in strength very rapidly with the increase of numbers . No one cau do all in such an enterprise , when united in a company with forty others , which he would do without hesitation , if left entirely to himself . But , on the other hand , the individual is always liable to prejudices of his own , to errors of judgment , to a slavish obedience to some preconceived plan or method : things which need the influence of associates of equal ability and acquisitions to counteract them . In a book so many sided , also , as the Bible , where no one man grasps all that it contains , the union of many minds is helpful to the setting forth of the truth . If , however , a number of persons are to be employed , it would seem quite as clear that they should be chosen from various bodies of Christians , for the work , when completed , is designed for all alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English IRevision , also , they should be selected from both nations , in order that the Divine Book may continue always to be a bond of union to those who , however separated in other interests , have the common inheritance of the one language . The principle of selection should , also , be such , that in the Revising body there should be men of various kinds of scholarship . According to the differences of mental characteristics , men of learning , though investigating their whole field of study , devote themselves , more or less exclusively , to one or another single line of working . It is so in regard to the study of languages . To one the examination of words , as to their origin , the history of their usage , the possibilities of their meaning , of words , that is , as considered in and for themselves , is the work of life . To another the rules of construction and the principles of grammar , the modes of expression belonging to // the distinctive peculiarities of one language as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of each nation , are the subjects of special interest . One gives himself mote carefully to the train of thought in the book on which he comments , and makes his author 's plan , and the development of his theme in accordance with it , the main end of his investigation . Another rejoices in the grandeur of the antique style and the rhythm and music of old words , and , thus , becomes familiar with his own language as it was written and spoken two centuries ago . Another still unites with his accuracy of knowledge that appreciation of what is adapted to the common reader , which is not always possessed by scholars , but without which no translation for the people can answer to the true idea . If I may take my position apart from the company with which I am connected , and speak of them as if outside of their number , I would say that in the American and English Committees , who are now engaged in this new Revision , this condition is strikingly fulfilled . As members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarly acquisition have met together for nearly ten years . They have brought their individual influence , consciously and unconsciously , to bear upon one another . They have contributed , each from his own peculiar knowledge , to the common result . They have adjusted and modified each other 's views in the most healthful manner . They have grown in ability for the fulfillment of their task , all of them , as they have filled out towards completeness each other 's limitations . And thus they have become more and more , as it were , one complete man , prepared on every side for the duty imposed upon him . That they are doing their work well , or as well as it might be done , it does not belong to me to say . But it will be allowed me , without offense I trust , to state my belief that , so far as they have any qualifications at all for the work , they have the varied qualifications of which I have spoken , and that , in regard to this important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . A Version or a Revision made by such a body of men ,  - -  though it should chance not to be , in every part , in exact accordance with the views of any one of the members ,  --  will // be a better and more perfect work , than it could have been , had the ablest of them labored alone . Of the principles in conformity with which such a company should carry on the work , it will be unnecessary to speak at length . What has been already said in another connection will be sufficient to show that a new translation , as distinguished from a new revision , should not be made . The Christian people of England and America are certainly not ready to abandon altogether the Authorized Version . They will not cut themselves off from the Historic Bible , which , through the several revisions in the 16th century , goes back to the time of Tyndale . Nor ought they to do so . All Christian literature in the two nations is full of the old book . All Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . The labor of ten years would be wasted , which attempted such a result . But if the Version of our fathers is to be revised , and not wholly set aside , the improvements and alterations must be in the language of the former days . We can not here , more than elsewhere , sew a piece of new cloth on an old garment with the purpose of making it better . The style can not pass from 1611 to 1880 , and from 1880 back to 1611 , as we read on from page to page , unless we are to lose the beauty and harmony and impressiveness of the whole . The rule , that changes necessary to be introduced should be made within the limits of the vocabulary of King James 's Version , was but the simple outcome of the decision to revise that Version . That there are cases , however , in which modern words , not inharmonious with the old ones , may be used can not be doubted . If the true meaning is only in this way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise thought conveyed by the original is that which the translation undertakes to set forth . To convey this precise thought is the first of all duties . If it is impossible to accomplish this result without modern language , the reviser should draw upon all his resources to bring the modern into unison with the ancient . He must exercise his wisest judgment and his most cultivated taste , that the meaning may not be obscured by the effort to maintain the oneness of the language , nor the rhythm and flow and oneness of the language be broken by the demands of the meaning . // Of the manner of working which has been adopted , a single word may here be said . The English Committees having not only , as appointed by the Convocation , originated the undertaking , but having commenced their labors two years before the American company , it was natural that their results should be communicated to us as a foundation for our suggestions and criticisms . Accordingly , as the several portions of the New Testament have been carried through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pursued in respect to the Old Testament , ) the work , as thus revised , has been sent to this country . It has then been subjected to the same kind of examination here to which it was previously subjected there ; namely , first , by each individual member of the company in his own studies ; and , secondly , by the company as a whole at its meetings . At these meetings each verse is read , both as it stands in the Authorized Version and as the English body have proposed that it should stand in the Revision . The most full and free discussion is then allowed on every point , whether great or small , and after such discussion the changes suggested are voted upon . When the entire portion thus examined ( as , for example , the Gospels , ) is finished , a second investigation of all matters which have been passed upon , and also of any others which may arise in connection with the words , is instituted , and again a vote is taken upon every alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this second review , aie remitted to England , and the English Company make their second revision with the American views before them . In case of differences remaining between the two bodies , a third consideration limited to these points is entered upon , with a view to the greatest possible harmony . If after this final review , as may to some extent be the case , there are still unadjusted differences , the opinions of the two bodies will , in some way , be submitted , in the book itself , to the reader . The number of such differences , it is believed , as the result of our experience thus far , will be comparatively insignificant . Ill . We are , thus , led to our third question , which has reference to the good results , both in general and in particular , which may be looked for from the new Revision . // Of the general good results , I will only say that it will give to the English-speaking world a most thoroughly prepared Version of the Scriptures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been learned since 1611 has had full consideration . He will understand that the light of grammatical and linguistic knowledge , as the scholars of recent days have discovered it , is brought to bear upon our English Bible . Greater confidence will , thus , be given in its accuracy as a true and complete representation of the original . The renewed examination of the Greek text , with all the help of the various evidences and authorities which have become accessible , will introduce him more perfectly to the words of the Apostles as they wrote them . It will , at the same time , show him-what is now indefinite , and thus sometimes alarming to his mind-just how great is the influence of those changes in the text which affect the thought and meaning , and just how little is the importance of multitudes of others among the one hundred thousand which are said to exist . The accomplishment of the work , in a word , if it shall be successful , will give to the churches a IRevision as perfect , in its measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long ago for theirs . With reference to particular results , I must limit my statement to suggestions of what many modern scholars think might with reason be done , rather than of what the body of IRevisers have actually done . What they have done is still so far from completeness , and is by the law which I have already alluded to so guarded in confidence until the end , that it is impossible to announce as yet what will be included in the Revision . Speaking wholly for myself , then , I may say that such changes as may properly be made both in the text and in the translation will , as I believe , be manifestly helpful to the reader . They will either render the meaning clearer , or will add new force and emphasis . A few examples will illustrate this ; examples which might be greatly multiplied were the space at our command sufficient . The cases which I will first mention will illustrate the changes in the Greek text . In Matt. vi . 12. instead of " Forgive us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best modern critics agree that the reading should be , " as we also have forgiven // our debtors : "  --  the thought being that the petitioner should not ask forgiveness for himself , until he has already forgiven others . Matt. x. 23 , " When they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another , " should read , " flee ye into the next , " - that is , they should not merely go to some other place , but should pass to the very next town ; thus omitting none in their proclamation of the kingdom of God , but going steadily forward from place to place in the natural order of their course . Matt. xii . 6 , " But I say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple , " should be " that which is greater , " or a greater ( thing ) , ' ' or something greater than the temple is here . " The emphasis , in connection with the preceding verse , will be noticed . Matt. xxv. 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a cry made , Behold ! the bridegroom 1 " instead of " Behold , the bridegroom cometh . " Matt. xxvii . 5 . Judas is said , by the best texts , to have " cast " or " flung down the pieces of silver " which he had received from the chief priests " into the sanctuary , " instead of " in the temple . " It was the sacred part of the temple , where he was not permitted himself to enter , into which he cast the silver . Mark ii . 7 . When Jesus bad said to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins be forgiven thee , the scribes , according to our Authorized Version , say , " Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God only ? " But the better text reads , with more force , " Why doth this man thus speak ? He blasphemeth ! Who can forgive sins but God only ? " Mark vi . 20 . In the story of Herod and his beheading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously been unwilling to kill him , " because he feared him , knowing that he was a just man , and observed him , and when he heard him , he did many things and heard him gladly . " But the new text gives a better picture of his divided state of mind : " he was greatly perplexed , and heard him gladly . " Luke xiii . 24 . The verse answers more fitly to the following , if we read , not as ( Auth . Ver . ) , " Strive to enter in at the strait gate , " but " Strive to enter in at the narrow door . " vs. // 25 , " When once the master of the house bath shut to the door , " &amp;c . Luke xvi . 9 . The more satisfactory sense is given by the modern reading , " it fails , " for " they fail . " " Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness , that , when it fails , they may receive you into everlasting habitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilate , after saying that he discovers no fault in Jesus , add , No , nor yet Herod , for I sent you to him , and lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him ; but the approved text reads " No , nor yet ilerod , for he sent him back to us , and behold nothing worthy of death hath been done by him . " * The sending him back with no word of evil respecting him , is cited as a proof that Herod found no more crime in Jesus than Pilate himself bad done . John xiii . 24-26 . The account is more vivid , if , in*tead of the Auth . Ver. , " Simon Peter , therefore , beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom be spake . He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? Jesus answered , He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter , therefore , beckoneth to him , and saith unto him , Tell us , who it is of whom he speaketh ? * * * * Jesus therefore answereth , He it is for whom J shall ( i. e. next ) dip the sop and give it to him . So when he had dipped the sop , he taketh it and giveth it to Judas* " John xiv . 12 . The best reading substitutes for " And whither I go ye know and the way ye know , " the form " And whither I go , ye know the way . " The connection with what follows is more striking , if this text be adopted ; as Thomas says , in substance , " Thou speakest of our knowing the way whither thou goest . We do not know even whither thou goest , and how , then , can we know the way ? " These variations by reason of changes in the Greek text are all taken , and almost at random , from the Gospels . They are of a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purpose here , for they suggest the improvements , in many * The rendering unto him , instead of by him , is an error of translation , not &amp; change of text . // ways , which even these comparatively unimportant alterations make , and show thereby the value of a thorough and minute revision . In several essays or treatises on the subject of IRevision , like those of Professor Lightfoot and Archbishop Trench , which are accessible to all readers , the possibilities of improvement in the matter of translatgon are presented in several divisions . These have reference to positive errors with regard to the sense , e. g . Acts xxv. 5 , where the Authorized Version makes Festus , in reply to the request of the leading Jews that he would send for Paul to come from Ca*sarea , where he was in prison , to Jerusalem ( hoping to kill him on the way , ) say , " Let them which are able " go to C*esarea with me ; but the true meaning is , " Let them who are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of signification , but our translators mistook the sense in this place ; secondly , to mistakes in the meaning of words , e. g. , 1 The*s. v. 22 , where the Apostle does not enjoin upon his readers to " Abstain from all appearance " ( as A. V. ) , but " from every form of evil ; " thirdly , to a misunderstanding as to the use of tenses , e. g. , Acts xix. 2 , the disciples of John the Baptist found by Paul at Ephesus were asked , not the question ( as A.V. ) , " Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed , " but " Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed ; " fourthly , to a failure to notice the force of the definite article ; e. g. , the Apostle says to his younger companion ( 2 Tim . iv . 7 , 8 , ) not " I have fought a good fight , and there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , " but , " I have fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the crown of righteousness ; " fifth ly , to the employment of a number of different English words to represent the same Greek word in the same connection of thought , e. g. , Mark xii . 38 , Luke xx . 46* ( parallel passages , ) where A.V. reads , with the same Greek , Beware of the scribes which ( in Mark ) love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the market-places and the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts  --  but ( in Luke ) , which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts. * A presentation of the subject * This striking case is referred to in an article in the Sunday School World Dec. , 1878. // under these and similar heads has some especial advantages . In particular , it gives to persons who are unfamiliar with such weaknesses as exist in our Authorized Version in these respects , a classification of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate all the facts of the case . As the works of these writers , however , may have been examined by many in this audience , and as the limits of a single lecture will not allow a suitable exhibition of the whole subject in this way , I have chosen another method , and would ask your attention to some improvements , which , as I conceive , may be made in the translation of a single one of the New Testament books , namely , the First Epistle to the Corinthians . A rapid review of some of the changes which may be introduced in this Epistle will suggest the importance of kindred ones in other books , where they may be required in greater numbers . In chapter i. , verse 19 , the Authorized Version reads , " God will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent , " but the two Greek words are the same and do not convey the sense of prudent , but of intelligent , " the intelligence of the intelligent , " or the discernment of the discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased , " &amp;c. , we should probably read " Since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God " ( the article here being substantially like the possessive pronoun ) . In verse 26 , Paul calls the attention of the Corinthian church to the time of their conversion , and says , God , as you know in your experience , " did not choose " the wise and powerful and noble , but the weak and despised ; not , as A.V. , " he hath not chosen . " In verse 30 , Christ is said to be our wisdom , first ; both our righteousness ( justification ) and sanctification , secondly ; and our redemption , thirdly ; thus making him the beginning , the middle , and the end of our salvation  --  the one who reveals the plan , the one who carries forward the process , and the one who brings the work to its completion . By the neglect of the precise force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version loses much of the force of the passage , saying simply // " wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption , " as four coordinate things . In chap . ii . verse 11 , by the omission of the definite article , the A uthorized Version misses the definiteness of the thought . The verse should read , not " What man knoweth the things of a man , but the spirit of man which is in him , " but " who among men knoweth the things of a ( particular ) man except the spirit of the man which is in him . " And so Paul argues that the things of God may reasonably be unknown except to the Spirit of God , and that they must come to men through the revelation from the Spirit . In verse 13 , our version reads , " comparing spiritual things with spiritual , " and perhaps conveys scarcely any meaning to some readers ; but the true sense is , probably , to be determined in connection with the preceding words . The Apostle says he speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human wisdom or philosophy , but in those taught by the Spirit , uniting , as would be natural , the spiritual words with the spiritual subjects . In chap . iii . verses 2 and 4 , he says to the Corinthians , referring to the time when he originally preached the gospel among them , " I fed you with milk not with meat , for ye were not yet able to bear it , and not even now are ye able . " Our version mars the fitness and precision of the language by saying , " I have fed you with milk , not with meat , for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , " etc . " Hitherto " and " have fed " bring the matter down through the past as far as to the present , but the Apostle 's reference is to the definite past time of their first entrance upon the Christian life , and only in the last clause does he pass over from that time to the present . There is no reference at all to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not speak of a man as " saved by fire , " or of a person as " defiling the temple ; " but as " saved through fire , " the figure being that of a workman on a burning building who escapes himself through the fire , but loses his work which he had done ; and of " destroying the temple . " In chap . iv . verse 4 , the words translated , " I know nothing by myself , " should be , " I know nothing against myself , " or am conscious to myself of no fault . " By " is here supposed to be an archaism for " against . " // In chap . v. verse 3 , the true text gives the undoubted meaning . Paul says , with regard to the action in the case of the person who was to be . excommunicated , not " as , i. e. , as if , absent in body but present in spirit ; " but ( as was the fact respecting him at the time , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have determined to do a particular thing " as if I were present , " ( i. e. in body ) . In chap . vi . verse 1 , there is no intimation that the heathen judges , before whom the Corinthian Christians were carrying their disputes , were " unjust , " and the word should not thus be translated , as our version gives it . It should be translated unrighteous , " that is , not Christians . In chap . vii . verse 22 , it is not said ( as A. V. ) , " Ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men . " Paul was pressing upon his readers that they should not have their minds filled with anxieties about earthly condition , and that which was better according to human opinion , and he says " Ye were bought at a price , " i. e. by the sacrifice of Christ , " and thus belong wholly to Christ . Become not slaves of men . " There are three common errors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar force of the definite past tense ( were , for are , bought ) ; the failure to distinguish the verb to become from the verb to be ; and the missing of the full meaning of the Greek word rendered servant , which should here be slave or bondservant . In verse 31 , the connection seems to show that the meaning of the author is not , " and they that use this world as not abusing it , " but " as not using it , or using it up , or to the full . " The parallel phrases are , " they that weep as though they wept not , thei# that buy as though they possessed not , " etc . The thought clearly is , that , inasmuch as the fashion of this world is passing away , they should not be full of cares respecting their peculiar lot or earthly prosperity . In the following verse , 32 , as in other places in the New Testament , no desire is expressed that the reader should be " without carefulness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the word carefulness . In chap . viii . verse 13 , " if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world staudeth , " should read , " If // food , i. e. the matter of food ( eating one kind of food or another ) makes my brother to stumble , I will eat no meat forever . " The word , which our translators render meat is anything eaten , and the words translated while the world standeth are the same as are rendered elsewhere forever . The Apostle meant , that , if his weak Christian brother was injured in his conscience by the matter of his eating , he would cease to eat , not only the meats ( flesh ) from animals which had been offered in sacrifice to idols ( which were specially under discussion , ) but all meat , if needful . In chap . ix . verse 1 , where he is urging the Corinthians to give up their rights and liberty for the sake of their brethren , the approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not free ; am I not an Apostle , " that is , by reason of my high position , possessed in the highest degree of such freedom ; and yet I have given up my prerogatives for the good of others . The order of the Authorized Version , " Am I not an Apostle , am I not free , " breaks the immediateness and naturalness of the connection . In verse 5 , he does not compare himself with other Apostles , but with the rest of the Apostles ; and the leading about of a sister , a wife , as our version reads , probably means , of a Christian sister as a wife , i. e. of a wife who is a Christian . In verse 17 , the Apostle says of himself , " if I preach the gospel voluntarily , " or of my own free choice , i. e. with no necessity laid upon me to do so , I have a reward ; but if involuntarily I am , like a mere servant , intrusted with a stewardship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , when it uses the words willingly and against my will . Paul preached willingly , indeed , but yet by necessity , as opposed to voluntarily . The English version , also , greatly obscures the sense to the ordinary reader , who is unacquainted with the Greek , when it translates the words , which mean , " I have been intrusted with a stewardship , " by " a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me . " In chap . x. verse 11 , " the ends of the world " should be translated , " the ends of the ages " have reached , etc. , the conception being that the ends of all the ages , which made up the great period called the Ante-Messianic age , or the time previ // May , Gus to the establishment of Messiah 's Kingdom , had reached down together , as it were , to the time then present to the writer and his readers . Verse 30 should read , " if I partake with thanks ( to God ) why am I evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace am a partaker . " The thought is , that the man who uses the meats with thanksgiving , and with no conscientious scruples , should not be un favorably j udged by those who refrain from eating because of scruples . In chap . xi . verse 25 , the word testament in the phrase , " This cup is the new testament in my blood , " should unquestionably be rendered covenant* as indeed it should be everywhere , except in Hebrews ix . 16 , 17 . In the same chapter , verse 27. unworthily , which word seems liable to be understood as referring to the general state or character of the participant in the Lord 's Supper , should probably be translated in an unworthy manner . The Corinthians were eating the Lord 's Supper as if it were an ordinary meal , and were displaying unseemly greediness in devouring what they had brought to the accompanying feast , and neglecting to share with the poor ; and it is of such participation , in a manner unworthy of the sacred occasion , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word damnation , in its old usage , has remained in our version to deter from the Communion many loving , but introspective , Christians , who feared that , if they should eat and drink unworthily , they would eat and drink damnation , i. e. eternal condemnation , to their souls . But the word ought to be translated judgment , and the following verses show that the reference is to temporal judgments ( e. g. verse 30 , " For this reason many are weak and sickly among you , " ) and that these temporal judgments are to the end of preventing them from falling into eternal condemnation ( verse 32 , " But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world . " ) A curious instance we have here of the changes in language . Damnation , which is now referred exclusively to the future and greater thing , is applied to the less , and condemnation to the eternal judgment . In chap . xii . verse 31 , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it says , " And yet I show unto you a more excellent way . " As if the Apostle , having spoken of the gifts of tongues , healing , prophecy , miracles , etc. , proceeded to declare , that there is something better than all these , and to declare only this . But what he does announce is , apparently , the following : You may properly desire , with earnestness , the better gifts . And moreover , I show unto you a most excellent way ; that is , I set before you the way above all others , in which living and acting you will be enabled to determine which are the better and greater gifts . This way is the way of love , and those gifts are greater which do the most good to others . And so , when he reaches the xivth chapter and 1st verse , after his words in praise of love , he says , " Pursue love as the goal in the race ( the verb is borrowed from this figure ) , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly prophecy rather than other gifts , because love would dictate this , since prophecy most serves to build up the Christian life in your fellow Christians . In chap . xiii . verse 1ff. , love should be substituted for charity , which has now a different and limited meaning . In verse Ill , " I understood as a child , I thought as a child , " should be , " I thought , I reasoned ; " and the latter part of the verse should read , not as in the Authorized Version , " when I became a man , I put away childish things , " but rather , " since I have become , or now that Tam become a man , I have put away the things of the child . " And the next following verse has this meaning , " for now we see through a mirror , " or in a mirror , " in an obscure revela. tion " - an enigma , the Greek says  --  but then face to face ; now I know in part , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully known ( by God ) while here . The thought of the Apostle seems to be this , that , while here on earth , the revelation which we have of the divine things and truths is after all but as the image reflected in a mirror , and but an enigmatical thing not altogether solved ; but that , hereafter , there will be the attainment of a knowledge and understanding of these things , which will no longer be partial , but , in its measure , as complete as that which God now has of us . The comparative weakness of the Authorized Version in this passage will scarcely fail to be // noticed , " for now we see through a glass darkly , but then face to face ; now Ii know in part but then I shall know even as also I am known . " In chap . xv . verse 24 , the approved text gives us the following : " Then cometh the end , when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God and his Father , when ( i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , under his feet " - that is , the delivering up takes place after and follows upon the subduing of enemies . The Authorized Version and its text lose this point , by translating " when he shall have delivered up , " as if this were parallel with " when he shall have put down , " etc . In the second verse following , it seems better to read , " as the last enemy death is destroyed ; " - as giving a better emphasis , than the order of the sentence in our version , " the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death . " He is referring to the resurrection , which is the victory over death and which comes at or near the end ; and so , when speaking of that destruction of the power of enemies , which is to be the precursor of the passing over the kingdom into God 's authority , he naturally says , " as the last enemy death is destroyed . " In verse 44 , we should read with the best texts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a spiritual body , " but , " if there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body . " In verse 51 ( where , however , the true Greek text is somewhat uncertain ) I believe the best reading to be , not that of our Authorized Version , " We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed in a moment , " etc.  --  the " we " including all Christians of all times , and the declaration of the A postle being , that not all will die , but all will be changed , either by death or translation , to the resurrection-life ; but rather " We all shall not die " ( i. e. no one of us will die , ) " but we all shall be changed . " The " we " refers only to those who shall be alive at the end , and of them the statement is made that none will die , but all will enter the new life by an instantaneous translation . Compare verse 52 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ) will be raised , but we ( the other class ) shall be changed . " If I am not deceived by reason of my long continued study of this subject , the changes which I have thus indicated in the // case of this Epistle , and which are only illustrations selected from a much larger number , will commend themselves to those who hear me as reasonable and advantageous changes for the English reader . They will show that the Authorized Version may be improved , without losing its identity , or the glory of its style , or the music of its old language , or its power to affect Christian feeling or to unite us in the expression of sacred thought with the generations that have gone before us . They will show also , if I am right in my view of them , that the work of revision is not a useless one , or one that should never have been undertaken ; but that , as conducted upon cotrect principles , it will make our English Bible a truer expression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater treasure , than it has ever been , to the church and the world . IXT . The fourth question alone remains for consideration . Is it probable that this new Revision will be successful and will take the place of the Version of 1611 ? To this question it is believed that an affirmative answer may be given for several reasons , which will be very briefly suggested . First . The new Revision will appear before the public as having originated with the only body , which , in these days , could give it anything like authority . ft is doubtful whether , at the present time , a Royal Commission , or any governmental arrangement , could have been institute ( l for the inauguration of the work . And , could such a thing have been accomplished , it may be questioned whether the best influence would thereby have been secured , or the enterprise carried through to its end in the wisest manner . Coming on the other hand , from any branch of the church except the Anglican , it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking as if on the part of individuals , for the ecclesiastical power within all these other branches is comparatively insigniticant , or at least , comparatively unimpressive to those who constitute their membership . But , having its beginning where it did , it speaks with something of the force of the Convocation of Canterbury to the members of the Established Church in England , and through them to the Episcopal Church in this country . It , thus , // approaches the class , who , by their habits of thought , are most conservative and most reverential for the forms and words which have descended to us from the ages , with the best commendation which it could bear . If it can disarm prejudice , by reason of its origin and its authoritative influence , in that communion , we may reasonably hope that it can make its way within the different churches outside of the Anglican body , both because of the approval which it may have there met and because of a less unwillingness , which it may find among these other churches , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In every aspect of the case , as I can not but feel , it is a fortunate circumstance that the Convocation of Canterbury gave the Revising Committee its existence and added to it its own authority , and an equally fortunate one , that it left the Committee in its work wholly to itself , and in respect to its results wholly to the public . Secondly . The Revision not only had its beginning in a conservative body , but its character is conservative . This has been abundantly , though incidentally , shown in our remarks concerning the rules by which the Committee has been governed , accordThg to its original constitution , and the method in which its operations have been conducted . The conservative portion of the community is the one from which most opposition is to be apprehended . That all of this party will be entirely satisfied , it is too much to affirm , but that reasonable provision has been made to meet their demands can not be doubted . It is hoped , that , if not at once , yet after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its manifest merits , arid will pardon , for the sake of these , what may not be altogether pleasing to their minds . Thirdly . Though the conservative party may not be willing to see so many changes , and the progressive party may not be willing to see so few , the real value of the Revision and the improvements which it contains will , we trust , give it success with both sections . For it will be found to follow the middle path , which , in this case surely , wisdom dictates as the right one . The book will seem like the old book to the common reader . He will often wonder where the changes are . It will appear // like a new book , growing out of , and bound in every part to , the old one , to the view of the reader who studiously examines them both . He will find improvements on every page , almost in every verse , and yet , as he reads aloud , the same sound and music will come to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , a waste of time that so much has been expended while so litte has been accomplished . But to another the results will present themselves as being more than worth the outlay , and he will think that even a arger number of years and a greater amount of labor might have been profitably bestowed upon so important a work . Fourthly . The membership of the Committee in England , as I can not help feeling , is a ground for confidence in respect to the favorable reception of the IRevision of which they are so largely the authors . Such men as Bishop Ellicott , Dean Stanley , Archbishop Trench , Professor Lightfoot , Dr. Scott , one of the authors of the Greek Lexicon so well known to all students of that language , Drs . Westcott , Hort , and Scrivener , the leading authorities in Great Britain in regard to Textual Criticism , to say nothing of other members of the English Committee , are the persons who would have been selected for the work by a unanimous vote of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question been submitted to the whole body of English Christians . The decisions at which they shall have arrived , after ten years of study and conference , will come to the public with the weight which naturally attends the names and the presence of those whom that public would have chosen . Of the American Companies it does not become me , as being one of their members , thus to speak . But these companies include a large proportion of the persons in this country who have made the scholarly interpretation of the Scriptures their life 's employment , and it may not be improper to express the hope , that they will be seen , in the result , to have proved themselves not unworthy of the fellowship into which they have been introduced . Fffihly . We may look for the success of the Revision because the public mind is mainly ready for it . When Archbishop Trench wrote , some twenty years ago , his essay on the subject of Revision , which has been published in this country , // he expressed the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet arrived , and he evidently placed its coming at a somewhat remote day . Great progress in sentiment had been made within the eleven years that followed , as was manifestly indicated by the unanimous vote of the Convocation in 1870 , and also by the readiness with which Dissenting Scholars in the kingdom united in the work with the representatives of the Established Church . The discussions of the subject , since that date , and the knowledge that the Revision has been going forward on conservative principles , have not only familiarized the minds of Christian people with the fact , but have developed much of sympathy with those who have the matter immediately under their charge . And , so far as a judgment can now be formed , the great majority of American and English Christians are willing to have a Revision made , are waiting anxiously for the one which is in course of preparation , and are ready to give it a fair examination when it appears . For all these reasons we , who have been united together in the work , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Revision will be exposed to searching criticism . It ought to be . This fact , however , is one element in our hopefulness , for even those who are most apprehensive of any change from the old Version , will have no ground to fear that it will be pressed upon them by force . It must succeed by its own merits , or not at all . It must succeed by gaining the approval of the great majority of English-speaking Christians , or it must fail altogether . It must even win over its enemies , or lose the object for which it strives . No one , therefore , need be disturbed for a moment , as it shall appear . On the other hand , by reason of the very consciousness of this fact , every one will have the strongest motive and the strongest impulse to answer in a kindly spirit the request , which it will bear with itself , to be kindly studied , and , if found worthy , to be kindly received as the English Bible of the coming century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Version , which we now so much admire and love , was not thus accepted . It waited for years for its final triumph . The Revision may and must have , in like manner , its own time of waiting . It may move on parallel with the version which has // been revised for a generation . It may gain its success after all of us , who have labored together in preparing it , shall have passed away from our earthly life . lit may , on the other hand , disappear , and be forgotten except as a failure . But our work and our hopes will go with it . And , whatever may be its fate , we shall remember , I am sure , our meetings during these long and pleasant years ; the studies also and the friendships that have accompanied them ; and we shall rejoice that we have given freely , and with no desire for remuneration , the best gift that we could offer to the churches of Christ of our English tongue on both sides of the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
