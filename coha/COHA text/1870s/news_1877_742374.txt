txt In the case of LAFAYETTE F. GROVER , United States Senator from Oregon , the verdict , a2cording to a local authority , is " Not proven . " Those who have followed the course of this investigation will not be surprised . It could not be proved beyond a possibility of doubt that Mr. GROVER , or Mr. GROVER ' S . friends , paid money to any member of the Oregon Legislature for voting for the successful candidate for Governor . Such a crime would necessarily be secret . No man who received a bribe , unless lie was ready to " damn himself to everlasting fame , " would be willing to admit that . ho had sold his vote , or even his intluenoe , for money . The briber is bound by the instincts of self-preservation to keep silence , and to turn aside the investigation by every possible artifice . Nobody saw GROVER , or his agents , bribe a legislator . No legislator admits that he was bribed , or that he knew of any man who was bribed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the case of one who testified at second-hand . This person said that a member of the Legislature , who was a friend of GROVER , lied said that on a certain occasion , while the contest was pending , he , the legislator , was given a considerable amount of money for a member who was to be bribed to change from NESMITH to GROVER ; that the money was left on the member 's bed-spread , lightly covered , and that the bribed came softly in , took the cash , and went away without speaking a word to the aforesaid member , who discreetly turned his face to the wall and refrained from looking at the man who came , turned over the bed-clothes , took the money , and departed , speechless . Yet , when this ingenious go-between was put upon the witness-stand , he swore that the whole story was an invention , and that he had told it " in fun . " The evidence in the whole ease was much like this . Oregon is essentially provincial . The people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the citizens of the nearest towns and villages . It is evident that suspicions of the veracity of GROCER 'S supporters first arose from neighborhood gossip . Men who voted for Gnovin , after lowing promised to support another candidate , were shown to have been unusually flush of money . Those who had been in debt suddenly bloomed out into cash purchases and twenty-dollar gold pieces . The testimony adduced by the prosecution did not , as a rule , amount to much more than this . To be sure , a convert to Gnovlin 's party came out of a secret conference counting gold pieces as ho walked . And one or two impecunious legislators who had said that if there was any money to be made they wanted to make it , were known to have had their anxiety mysteriously subdued . And they voted for GROVER . But all such evidence is only circumstantial . It really proves nothing , if we consider the case from a purely legal point of view . We have no intention , however , to anticipate the verdict of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all incomplete form , the fullest reports being those which have been telegraphed to the San Francisco papers from Oregon , and these printed reports are yet several clays behind those which have been transmitted to Now-York by telegraph . What we notice in this investigation is the lamentable indifference , not to say flippancy , wits which the witnesses regarded tho whole proceeding . It is evident that ' the men who were most interested in the inquiry considered the act of bribery , if there was a bribery , as only a smart operation which was to be concealed . There was , no hesitation in making the charge that money was used . There was no show of indignation in the denial . The reply to the allegation was . " Prove it , if you can . " There was an undercurrent of mirthfulness perceptible through all the inquiry . There was a suggestion of " smartness " in the attitude of the witnesses for the defense , who turned , twisted , and doubled upon their tracks . And , as soon as the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cronin fraud of GROVER , makes haste to say " Not proven . " It is natural to imagine the bribers and the bribed ( if there were any ) drawing a long breath of relief and saying to each other , " they did n't catch us that time . " Possibly the whole business has been the result of a scandalous misrepresentation . It is not beyond the bounds of reason that GROVER and his friends may be wholly innocent of any wrong , and absolutely free of even a wrong intention . But this is extremely unlikely . And if it were not , their conduct ill the case shows a familiarity with chicane , as well as an indifference to the gravity of the charge preferred , which is , to say the least , repulsive . Has it come to this , then , that the election of a man to the high and honorable office of United States Senator can be clouded by shameful suspicion and excite scarcely a pang of popular regret ? Is it true that the public morals have become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senatorial canvass may be conducted so recklessly that when it is concluded only the " smartness " of the successful workers prevents the exposure of a great scandal ? There ought to be a remedy for . such a shameful state of things . In the present case , we can only say that GROVER 'S title to his seat in the Senate will always be under a cloud .
