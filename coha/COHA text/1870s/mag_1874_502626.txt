How cool and refreshing this little nook seems , after the crush and heat of the ballroom ! Rest and quiet are worth all the glare and tumult of society , if one could believe it .

" The pleasure of a few words exchanged with you alone outweighs all the attractions of an evening 's dancing .

" SOUNDS FROM SECRET CHAMBERS . " By Laura C. Redden ( Howard Glyndon ) . Boston : James R. Osgood &amp; Co .

" Sweet Bella Jangled , " the longest , is a love story of seventy pieces of versification , in measures suited to the various emotions which mark the changes of feelir*g observable in the course of this capricious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement and depth of feeling . Considering the difficulty of expressing the delicacy and purity of tender emotions , and the risk of incurring the charge of affectation , they are unusually successful performances . Our limited space prevents us from making quotations . Indeed , it is not necessary to do so , as our readers are already familiar with Miss Redden 's poetic power through her frequent contributions to this magazine . Those who are not , will recognize true inspiration in " Found , " a confession of love and trust , and in " An Idyl of the Early Spring , " in which nature is made to reflect the freshness and joyousness of the heart under the first impulse of youthful affection . Among the minor pieces which strike our fancy , we would instance " The Loosing of Lilith , " showing fine imaginative power , and " Somebody Knows , " a piece of a lighter sentiment .

They are not apt to regard her as a luminous literary star of the days of Goldsmith and Dr. Johnson . But such she was nevertheless . It seems that she could arouse the jealousy of the author of " The Deserted Village " and the ire of the great lexicographer , and likewise bring down on herself at a later period the critical thunder of Southey . Mrs. Barbauld 's merits , however , are not dependent on such relationships ; she does not need to shine by reflected light . Mrs. Barbauld had the honor of being a pioneer and reformer in the education of the young . Like Froebel and her contemporary Pestalozzi , she must have felt the inspiration of Rousseau 's genius . She probably would not admit this ; but the ideas and sentiments which Rousseau disseminated filled the intellectual atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere applied them advantageously . At all events she discarded old-fashioned notions about the intellectual entertainment of children , avoiding in all her writings for them everything of a purely sensational character ; she substituted for the old ghost story , and the terrors and superstitions of folk-lore , and exaggerations of nature as in " Jack the Giant-Killer , " all of which flow from oriental sentiment , stories and conceptions illustrative of the affections , and in perfect accord with the fancies and reasoning powers of children , exerted and stimulated , like their elders , by the beautiful in nature and humanity . Terror and even wonder oonstituted none of her emotional capital in helping parents to keep children good and quiet . This end could as well be accomplished on her part by catering for the curiosity of children in a normal rather than in a morbid state of mind . If the reader will take the trouble // to compare Mrs. Barbauld 's tales , fables , and allegories with the tales popular in her time that kept alive countless superstitions , he will appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not regard Mrs. Barbauld 's poetry as her most original work , she nevertheless excelled in this line . In sentiment and idea it conforms in a greater or less degree to the conventional standards of her time ; in versification it reminds us of Pope and other masters of verse whom she undoubtedly carefully studied ; but it also shows true feeling , correct taste , and felicity of expression , and particularly in the passages which do not go beyond womanly experience and observation . It is marked , moreover , with much humor . Her " Washing Day " is an admirable illustration of this , the burlesque of Milton 's style being inimitable . Similar traits pervade her essays ; they are more or less suggestive of Addison and Johnson . The latter gives her credit on one occasion for having successfully imitated his " sentiment as well as diction . " Nevertheless they have great merits of their own . The essay on " Monastic Institutions , " showing their importance in civilization , is the work of a liberal and tolerant mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pleasing to Fox , is the fruit of close observation and nice discrimination of character . Mrs. Barbauld was a good letter-writer . Here the genius of a woman always finds a proper field for its display . In correspondence we get at opinions uttered carelessly , which are of more consequence psychologically than thoughts hammered out on the anvil of reflection . Mrs. Barbauld admits to her brother , in one of her letters , that " we idolize Shakespeare rather too much for a Christian country , " in apparent deference to one of his opinions ; . but she insists that he does not do Shakespeare justice if he regards him as " only a poet . " Manners , customs , and sentiments are reflected in her letters . The progress made in the use of tobacco since Raleigh 's time is marked by the following query of one of her correspondents : " Did you ever see seyuars-leaf tobacco rolled up of the length of one 's finger , which they light and smoke without a pipe ?

" We regret that we could not have had on hand , in our notice lately of Miss Brackett 's book on woman 's education , the admirable letter " On Female Studies " by Mrs. Barbauld . It shows the superior views of education of a woman wishing to develop her sex according to the normal limitations peculiar to it . The compilation of this memoir is not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better if the compiler had abstained from giving abstracts of Mrs. Barbauld 's letters , the effect of which is to abate our interest in the letters which immediately follow . The best way in writing a memoir is to let the subject of it speak for himself as much as possible . " ENGLAND , POLITICAL AND SOCIAL . " By Auguste Laugel . Translated by Professor James Morgan Hart . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . The first chapter of this book , entitled " Characteristics of the English Race , " contains nothing new , the author applying the theory of race to the English in pretty much the same vein as Tame . Although not an Anglomaniac , like some of the able French students of political progress , he nevertheless entertains the notion that the English have a peculiar aptitude for liberty  --  a liberty which " knows nothing of the servile violence of revolt , or the quibbles of jurists or philosophic theories . " English liberty to M. Laugel is " a living thing , innate , unconscious-like instinct , akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to find a Frenchman taking such a view of English liberty . Contrasting the stormy manifestations of the French pursuit of liberty wiih the more placid manifestations // of English radicals , we can readily detect the source of it . But is it true that the English have a keener sense of liberty than other people ? M. Laugel , who is an acute observer , brings forward many things which clearly show that English liberty is after all conditional . The phenomenon of liberty which England presents for the world 's study is to be found as much in material as in moral causes . Englishmen have occupied an island , shut out in a measure from the rest of the world , and have accordingly been favorably situated for maintaining individual and national independence . Formed out of diverse races many centuries ago , and be coming civilized through experiences common to mankind at large , they have always dreaded but never experienced invasion , and consequently have escaped the influences which have compelled other populations to concentrate and centralize their power . The English have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigration , those remaining on the soil being therefore the better subordinated . Living on an island surrounded by water , with no contiguous territory to invade or people to become entangled with , its surplus inhabitants have been compelled to leave their country or die , to become industrial pariahs or to live as paupers . These material conditions seem to be at the root of English civilization , quite as much as original racial instincts . Colonization , which is regarded as a special aptitude of the English , is explicable in the same way . English colonization began with cupidity , and developed itself through suffering . The " servile violence of revolt " has had a good deal to do with it . It was favored by birth in a rugged climate , and perfected by a hard " struggle for existence . " Common human instincts , shaped by circumstances , produced English colonization , and not any superior racial capacity . The Scandinavian Swede , the Celtic Irishman , and the German , all belonging to the same zone as the English , prove equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is owing wholly to climatic causes . English liberty , viewed nationally , is really no more remarkable than Dutch or Swiss liberty . Both Holland and Switzerland exemplify the value of physical causes in relation to liberty . Each is " a little universe by itself . " One a creation out of the sea and the other a mountain fastness , each is fashioned and protected by natural advantages . Both the Dutch and the Swiss , like the English , would have been less free had they occupied territory equally as accessible and equally as tempting as that of the French . In meditating over the problems of liberty , we must not overlook the favorable condition furnished by nature . The theory of race in this relation ought to be cautiously handled . It may be useful for descriptive purposes , but it is not to be accepted as the resting-place for thought . The world may profit by a study of the conditions out of which English conceptions of liberty and of government have emerged , but it will not answer to regard English progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Laugel points out the real source of English liberty . To understand a nation 's liberty rightly , we must understand where its sovereignty lies . Our author states that sovereignty in every country lies in capital and land ; that is to say , it is vested in the wealthy . This is eminently true of England . The English government is nothing but an autocracy of wealthy nobles , merchants , and manufacturers . The Crown , the Lords , and the Commons , who rule the country and form the aristocracy , owe their power and place to their material possessions . " Parliaments have been the servants of this power that is based upon land , and the only one visible to the peo. ple . " Through this power the mass of the people have been restrained and kept content . Since the revolution of 1688 , which established the supremacy of the aristocracy , there has been no such thing in England as popular dissatisfaction with the government , and for this reason , that the aristocracy have kept the people busy and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , the people have become as aristocratic in feeling as their masters . Their loyalty is due to material interests , and not to any special love of law and order . Every man in England is sycophantic to some one above him , and overbearing to some one below him . There is no place for a demagogue in a community of this stamp . If the foul seed of Communism is planted in the English organism , it will germinate // from the stomach rather than from the brain . Could French statesmen study the importance of wealth in the government of a people , and attach less importance to ideas , they would be as successful for a time in governing their own country as English statesmen in governing England . The doctrinaire is the poorest of all politicians . in " The People and Social Questions " M. Laugel touches on some matters in which we think his own country has greatly the advantage of England . We never hear of a state of poverty in France comparable to that which is common in England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorged and surfeited with wealth , is like a huge caterpillar feeding upon the foliage and leaving nothing but a skeleton leaf . " He dwelis on the measures taken to alleviate misery there , but not on the causes which produce it . Is it an instinct of race , or isit superior intelligence , which leads the French to avoid extreme poverty by a wise economy of the reproductive system ? Can this great ulcer of civilization be cured through the instrumentality of a form of government ? We can not leave this instructive book without commending the translation , which admirably renders the author 's sense and style . A good translation is as rare as a good copy of an old master " THE FORMS OF WATER TN CLOUDS AND RIVERS , ICE AND GLACIERS . " By John Tyndall , LL . D. , F. R. S. " TEE NEW CHEMISTRY .

These four volumes belong to a series of works on scientific subjects which the world owes to the energy and discrimination of Prof. E. L. Youmans . In whatever light the development of scientific discovery during the last quarter of a century is considered , it will be found to have made such depart*res from the old basis on which scientific facts were arranged and explained at the period when most readers of the present day were students , as to require an entirely new series of technical and scientific works of instruction . Such a series is as much wanted by students as by ordinary readers , for text-books are often wofully behindhand in their methods and ideas . To meet this want Professor Youmans has engaged leading men in each branch of science to treat of some general subject , and by choosing carefully the men and the subjects he will probably succeed in laying before the thinking ( and not experimenting ) world the true state of science at the present day . His conception is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as nine volumes go , with great success . The first volume of the series was the " Forms of Water " of Professor Tyndall . In it the well-known system of aqueous distribution , including the sea as reservoir , the sun as dissipating force , and the winds as distributor , is used as a basis for discussing the physics of light and heat . Much the greater part of the book is given to the subject of water in its solid form . Beginning with the formation of crystals and the structure of lake ice , which are treated in familiar lecture style , the Professor at last shuts up the lecture-room and takes his audience bodily to Chamouni . Then comes the study of glaciers , not as distant objects described by others , but as things which are before the eye and under the feet . A very careful account of glacier phenomena , including their history as well as explanation , is given under the guise of Alpine excursions . It is needless to say that the important phenomena are all presented , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . The style of the book is that direct personal expression which is now so common in works intended to instruct ; and in carrying it out Professor Tyndall reveals so much of the mountaineer 's exhilaration , that the book is entirely relieved from the usual air of dry statement and plethoric wisdom of similar works . In this respect the " Forms of Water** carries out better than any other volume of the series the idea of the popular treatment of a scientific subject . It is pure science tempered with human feeling . The " New Chemistry " of Professor Cooke forms the substance of thirteen lectures delivered in the Lowell course at Boston . The author says in his preface that his object was to present the modern theories of chemistry , " and to give to the // philosophy of the science a logical consistency by resting it on the law of Avogadro . " The subject of molecules and the laws which govern them in the gaseous state is first developed , and next solidification or crystallization is illustrated by a combination of optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecule upon his readers byshowing that it has an indivisible existence ( as molecule ) , a definite weight and often a definite form for each substance , the subject of atoms is considered , and from this standpoint chemical combinations and the laws which govern them are explained . The author does not attempt to form a grammar of the science before proeceding to take any step toward the discussion of phenomena . On the contrary , he seems to prefer the method of taking some subject of general interest like combustion , and explaining the principles involved in it as fast as they come up . The phenomena of combustion , and especially explosive combustion , afford an excellent basis for exhibiting the energy of molecular force , and they are well handled in these lectures . The electro-chemical theory is carefully developed in this as in the author 's previous works . The last lecture is given to the explanation of isomeres and the synthesis of organic compounds , winding up with the last triumph of technical chemistry , the manufacture of alizarine . Professor Cooke 's style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very happy in the selection of illustrative experiments , and his work forms an admirable presentation of the theories which have had so marked an effect upon the growth of chemical science . He carefully guards against the confusion of theory and fact , which is perhaps the most striking defect of the popular mind in applying itself to the study of science , and in his very first paragraph points out that one is absolute knowledge , and the other , however valuable , only arrangement of such knowledge . His book is the best that has appeared on the subject . The leading theme of Professor Cooke 's work is matter and the laws which govern its movements , while the subject of force in its various manifestations is bro. *mt in only as an inseparable but subordinate part of the discussion . This part is treated by itself in Dr. Balfour Stewart 's " Conservation of Energy . " He first demonstrates the existence of energy in general , and of each particular form of its manifestation , by illustrating the conditions under which it is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always produced when another is terminated , and in an exactly corresponding proportion . He uses Professor Tait 's classification of the forms under which energy is manifested , prefacing it with the warning that instead of being complete it is probably only a rude arrangement , the best , however , that science offers at present . A chapter is given to the transmutations of energy , and another to an historical sketch of the subject , ending with some paragraphs on the dissipation of energy , and its relation to the probable fate of the earth . The last chapter is given to some observations on the position of life in relation to energy . Dr. Stewart 's subject is in many respects a fine one for presentation to a popular audience , and it is a little unfortunate that the author 's method is not entirely happy . He p* esents his subject with an earnestness and ability that were to be expected of so profound a man , but in his style we miss the easy development of the subject from the beginning , which is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of both the preceding works . In the last chapter the relation of life to other forces and to material existence is somewhat hastily treated ; and Professor Youmans has happily added to Dr. Stewart 's treatise two others , which form a valuable continuation of the subject . The first of these is a short treatise by Professor Joseph Le Conte , now of the University of California , on the " Correlation of Vital with Chemical and Physical Forces . " Though a reprint ( with additions ) of a paper printed some fifteen years ago , it will no doubt be new to most readers out of the scientific classes . He places all material existences upon four planes , as follows : 4 , animal kingdom ; 3 , vegetable kingdom ; 2 , mineral kingdom ; 1 , elements ; and points out that " there is a special force whose function it is to raise matter from each plane to the plane above . " These forces are : 4 , will ; * , vitality ; 2 , cheniical force ; and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate on the next lower plane of the corresponding se / // ries without lifting the matter in that plane to its own level . Thus chemical force acting on elements immediately lifts them out of plane 1 to plane 2 . The author with justice defends the term vital force against its opponents . He says of it : " Vital is transformed physical and chemical force ; true , but the necessary and very peculiar condition of this transformation is the previous existence then and there of living matter . " With the defence of this principle the author is obliged to end his paper , for science has hitherto failed to suggest any mode of accommodating the theory of vital force with the theory of the conservation of force . The dead body does not differ from the living one , so far as we know , except in the cessation of this force . According to theories now everywhere accepted , this force has not been destroyed . It may have been dissipated and entered into other organisms , or into some general receptacle of unengaged energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolutely no evidence to show that force in another form comes into existence when the vital force ceases in the body , and until that difficult fact can be established the theory of an immortal soul must remain the faith of the world . Indeed , the negative evidence which physical science thus contributes to that theory is a not unimportant support to it . A question somewhat related to this is discussed in a third paper published in this book . It is written by Professor Alexander Bain , of the University of Aberdeen , and is entitled " Correlation of Nervous and Mental Forces . " Professor Bain has , however , supplied to the " International Series " a more extended discussion of the questions involved in the relation of the mind to the body , in a volume which we have placed fourth in our list . In " Mind and Body " he has undertaken to study out the character of the relation which subsists between these two parts of the human organism . That the brain substance is involved in the processes of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that the nerves are the means of communication between the muscles and the brain is one of the older discoveries in pathology . But the study of the exact functions of these parts of the system , the cause of motion , the source of will , and the existence and character of the soul , to which last question such investigations must necessarily lead , are points which remain among the obscurer questions of science . Professor Bain 's book shows how profound has been the study of these problems , and how ingenious are the theories evolved by patient and faithful work . Dr. Lionel Beale 's study of the brain and its embodiment of the intellectual functions is the keynote of the chapter given to this part of the subject ; and this , taken with the labors of other great physiologists , gives the reader a good idea of the wonderful success which has attended these investigations . The speculative part of the subject is in a less satisfactory condition . Professor Bain 's book shows how . difficult it is to formulate conceptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp them . The author most nearly approaches success in the last paragraph of his book , at the close of a history of the theories of the soul , in which his great learning and profound thought are clearly marked . Having explained the conflicting theories of a single substance , materialism and double materialism , he says : " The rapid sketch thus given seems to tell its own tale as to the future . The arguments for the two substances have , we believe , now entirely lost their validity ; they are no longer compatible with ascertained science and clear thinking . The one substance with two sets of properties , two sides , the physical and the mental  --  a double-faced unity-would appear to comply with all the exigencies of the case . " The four books we have spoken of are sufficient evidence of the faithfulness with which Professor Youmans has gone about the task he set himself . The " International Series , " so far as completed , includes many works which are the best resource of students , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would like to see these books more often indexed than they are , for they serve as works of reference as well as a vehicle for instructing the multitude as to the actual condition of science . " DE LA MUsIQuE , DR SES EFEETS ET DE SON INFLUENCE SUE LA SANTE ET sg* LA MALADIE " ( The Effects and Influence of Music on Health and Disease ) . By Dr. H Chomet . Paris , 1874. // Music , as a branch of art , ought to be considered not so much in itself as in its relationship to cognate arts , and its civilizing effects upon persons constituted to feel and appreciate it . Music being as manifold in its nature as the genius of those who create it , we should not wonder at the different opinions concerning it , and at the violent conflict of ideas relative to the greater eminence of one composer over another , of this school over that . It is no breach of logic to suppose from the past history of music that its future course will be characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization itself whereof it forms an testhetical part , and with which it is as vitally interwoven as the germ with its evolved product . Hitherto music has generally been regarded as merely an object of pleasure or entertainment , and almost every definition of it has been correspondingly superficial ; words have been tortured to death to take it out of the world of reality and give it a hazy , transcendental meaning which has sorely baffled the healthy understandings of men . The real import of music , however , is to be caught up solely from a careful and intelligent observation of its refining and elevating effects upon the select few naturally susceptible to its inspiration ; and any attempt to realize these effects through mere abstract verbal definitions would prove as fruitless as an effort to catch the inspiring perfume of a rose from a botanical description . The history of the work before us , as given by its author , is a sad repetition of the old story of the trials and disappointments of young authors . At one of the sittings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to read it under the title , De la Musique , de ses djels et de son influence sur la sante ' et sur Ia maladie . M. Pelouze , a savant , promised to support his application , and to get him an early hearing . Our author says , somewhat sarcastically , that he did not then know that the promises of an academician are , like those of a prince , very soon forgotten . Pelouze forgot both the author and his labor . Two years passed in patient expectation of an opportunity of giving it publicity . In 1848 , however , the revolution broke out , blasting all hope of doing so , and the peaceful arts had to yield to the wild revels of politicians . After a lapse of three years the memorable coup d'état had its advent , and another disappointment followed , coupled with the death of Pelouze , whose aid to our author consisted of broken promises . He tried , however , to take the sting out of this long succession of disappointments , by revising , expanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of some years this cherished nursling of our author 's brain has swelled into a goodly volume of two hundred and forty-nine pages . The historical sketch of music which M. Chomet gives in this volume is very interesting , instructive , and graphic . Originating in the Orient , music casts its nascent shadows through many nations , until it gathers body , and becomes an art among the inspired race of Greece . What divinity stirred within that race which enabled it to adorn all it touched , to ele. vate and perfect everything it worshipped ! The genius and virtue of paganism culminated in the rich civilization of Greece , and planted the fruitful germs of all future culture . About the year 384 St. Ambrose attempted to weave many important changes into the music of his time , by a certain chemical manipulation of the old pagan ideas , thus adapting it to the Christian worship and the words of the liturgy . We must add , however , that in this laudable attempt of the good Bishop to put new wine into old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced it into a certain mechanical routine and immobility . Two hundred years later St. Gregory attempted another musical reform in the chants and melodies of the church , but the result was far from being an artistic success . It was , however , reserved for Guy of Arezzo to take up the broken and tangled threads of music , draw them deftly together , and give them an entirely new and better texture . It is strange that this renewed stream of regenerated art should have been checked and overshadowed in its gentle course . But the wars of the Crusades led to a general decline in the physical , intellectual , and moral conditions of man . His evil passions swelled into a torrent of corruption , and it required all the anathemas of churches and councils , and the wise course of Pope Pius IV. , to ar // rest this fearful brood of evils . The musical genius of Palestrina responded to the earnest demand of the Pope , and wrought out of his own noble and ethereal nature an order of music suited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the musical depths of every successive century a body of artists who have worthily added to , adorned , and ennobled the splendid structure raised up by Palestrina . Our author considers Rossini the greatest composer of this century , and his influence more widely spread than any other master . He regards Wagner as great only in harmony . This opinion , however , is open to some modification . In the tender , pulsating love of Lohengrin , and the swelling passions of the pilgrim Tannh.duser , the deep mellow twilight of melody is often and beautifully apparent . There is a good deal of fantasy in Wagner 's parade of his music of the future ( Zukunftsmusik ) , which some of his weak admirers will turn to his prejudice ; but Ntill it must be admitted that he is a daring , vigorous musical genius , destined to amplify and adorn the musical edifice , and to bequeath to posterity a new and memorable school . With the earnest desire of M. Chomet to constitute music a therapeutic and hygienic agent we have the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function to which we believe it is justly entitled . If health is the perfect accord of the human instrument within itself , and with the varying medium in which it is placed , music must act on it as a vital tonic , and add fresh life to its ever-moving elements . It ; on the other hand , this instrument loses its elasticity and force , and fails to respond to the necessitated demand upon it , if its springs are weak and deranged , and it loses its happy and essential equilibrium , will not music act like an electric battery in restoring its organs and functions to a normal state of health ? As yet the science of sounds , of their transmission and of their relations to each other , is but imperfectly understood . The neh.ulm that surround it must break away , crystallize , and take definite and intelligible outlines before sound , as the pure fountain of all music , can be resolved into a language of its own . Has not all the burning , captivating eloquence of the world sprung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alphabet ? and may we not likewise look forward to the time when out of the notes of the gamut , intelligently and magnetically manipulated , an instrument will be evolve4 having the most startling effects upon man individually and as a social unit ? So long as the human frame is a silver thread which sensitively vibrates to the touch of every outward agent , so long music must have a revolutionizing effect upon all our inward machinery through the most mysterious part of it , the nervous system . Does it not at times sweep plaintively over the chords of the heart like a tropical midnight breeze over sleeping flowers ? does it not at times magically blend together , as if in a constellation , the sweet memories of the past , the tender throbbings of the present , and the glowing , intoxicating hopes of an imagined fut4re ? " IN THE DAYS OF MY YOUTH . " A Novel . By Amelia B. Edwards , author of " Barbara 's History , " " The Ladder of Life , " " My Brother 's Wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A novel by a woman , purporting to give a description of the vie de gar*on in Paris many years ago , is a curiosity in its way , and as a curiosity will be read with some interest . " In the Days of my *outh " is the story of a young Englishman who goes to Paris to pract ! se medicine , has a great number of unusual adventures , makes a great number of strange acquaintances , and ends by making a romantic marriage . The reader will find among other amusing and objectionable things in the novel the Quartier Latin , the well-known grisette , the fascinating married French woman , the artists and medical students , who never have enough money to pay their debts , and are such merry , happy , and entertaining fellows - as different from the artists and medical students known in other countries as are the literary people of literature from the literary people of real life or the Parnassus of tradition from the publishers ' dinner in " Pendennis.
