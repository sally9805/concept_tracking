txt The sharp practice which goes on in connection with the stock market is a periodical cause of disturbance in trade which " experts " ought to be able to foresee with as much certainty as astronomers calculate eclipses . There are certain seasons of the year at which the trains of gunpowder laid . by stock-jobbers of various kinds are sure to end in explosion . This year the blow-up has been a little delayed . It generally occurs toward the latter end of October or the beginning of November . Sometimes one stock is the cause of the " break , " and sometimes another . Erie has been a frequent source of disaster , and it is at this moment as likely as ever to keep up its old reputation as a Mother Carey 's chicken , the harbinger of storms . The road is rotten to the core , and there seems to be no sort of hope for it until Messrs . BARLOW &; Co. are taken off its overloaded back . But the great scandal of the season has arisen over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , might have been prosperous , but which to-day is pronounced by its Ex-President to be in a most dismal and disgraceful plight . The Directors , or some of them , have been playing all sorts of tricks with the stock . They have , according to Mr. SAGE , systematically doctored the accounts , or , as the Ex-President puts it , they have " overestimated the assets and correspondingly depreciated the liabilities . " And a more outrageous offense than that could scarcely be committed by the managers of any company in the world . Large sums of money have been paid out for lobbying at Washington  --  and we hope before long to get hold of the names of the precious legislators who received the bribes . It is reported that the company owes $160,000 for taxes . Add this to the $170,000 overdrawn on the Bank of California , as charged by the Ex-President , and we nave $330,000 to put to the floating liabilities of the company thus making the grand total of these liabilities $2,185,625 , exclusive of the amount due to JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of such facts as these , the public is bidden to believe that the ? affairs of the company were never more prosperous than at the present moment . And who gives this assurance ? If JOHN JACOB ASTOR and MOSES TAYLOR and . MARSHALL 0 . ROBERTS , and other " leading citizens , " signed a certificate to that effect after a thorough investigation of the books of the company-=such as they made into Controller CONNOLLY 'S books when they reported them " all right " ? it would scarcely suffice to allay the suspicions now excited . But , in this case , the personal guarantee comes from ? RuFus HATCH  --  a man of no very great reputation in the commercial world , and whose word is worth just nothing at all on this particular question . For he is interested in keeping his position , and . in putting the best face possible upon the company 's affairs . Under what circumstances he was elected Director -- with what secret bargains and . agreements -- it would be curious to discover , and we should like very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about ' all that , nothing could be more impudent than his present position According to Mr. SAGE .  --  and who is to choose between the word . of Mr. SAGE and RUFUS HATCH l ? he , HATCH , has admitted the existence of gross irregularities in the affairs of the company . At that celebrated Sunday meeting , he " made a clean breast of it . " In consequence of his disclosures , the President of the company thought it prudent to " step down and out , " on account , as he delicately explained , of " pressing engagements elsewhere . " And now the very same Mr. HATCH who made a " clean breast of it " comes forward and . pledges his word that the company was never in so good a condition . Hie word ! ? as if it could have the least weight in such a controversy as this . Indeed , what would . any man 's unsupported word be worth , placed in RUFUS HATCH 'S position , and . having the reasons which he has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal guarantees " upon the public , in the place of true and honest statements of accounts has been worked to death . TWEED and CONNOLLY tried it , and for a year at least it answered very well . But ever since then people have regarded it with great suspicion . The Directors of the Pacific Mail Company have not presented a proper report to the stockholders for a year and . a half . They have in the meantime been operating largely in the stock . They are in debt beyond . all reason , and their working stock is in bad order . A formidable rival threatens now to seize their business . One of the Directors calls another a " liar , " and a second calls a third a " thief . " The Ex-President says that the Directors have juggled the accounts , and RUFUS HATCH , " Managing Director , " retorts that the ExPresident " is on his way to the Penitentiary ! " Is not this a nice little concern for anybody to put his money in ? Under all the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in California have set up a rival line , that they are in treaty for three large and fast ocean steamers , and that Pacific Mail is likely to have its epitaph written sooner than anybody would have deemed possible a year ago . And that epitaph will be , " Rifled by its friends , " among whom must certainly be included RUFUS HArcH . Decidedly , everybody but speculators will give the company a wide berth at the present moment .
