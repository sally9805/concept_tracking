THE CONTRIBUTORS ' CLUB . FEW readers of the Club papers , I imagine , are aware that Mr. H. James , Jr. , has been enthusiastically translated into German , and that his Passionate Pilgrim may now be read in that language under the attractive title of Der Leidenschaftliche Erdenpilger . The Transatlantic Sketches and Roderick Hudson , though not so susceptible to polysyllabic treatment , have still been liberally endowed with German text , and the Fatherlandish critics bestow much praise upon the author . Julian Schmidt , whose name is a powerful prop to book advertisements , says , " He does not , indeed , introduce us to the more characteristic life , but shows one side of it which deserves attention , namely , the impulse of young America toward culture , and its longing for the Old World ; ** and he accords to him a remarkable artistic faculty . But the latest act of am preciation is a little peculiar . The publishing house of Anerbach has issued The American in translation , accompanied by a prospectus full of laudatory phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , go hand in hand as the exponents of contemporary American life in fiction , that Mr. James takes // a place quite above the level of ordinary Uebersetzungs literatur ( a word suggestive , to the uninitiated , of Massachusee ) , and that he has become the Mode-Liebling or " fashionable darlino- " of the Teuton public . All this is very well , but the prospectus neglects to explain that the fastidious translator , despite his high opinion of Mr. James , has written an entirely new ending to the story . He declares that The American is a magnificent exhibition of democracy , and this belief it may be that inspired him to expunge the ignominious catastrophe which closes the original work , and substitute a scene in which Mr. James comes on to the stage in his own person , saying , substantially , " Some time after these events , I met Newman in San Francisco , with a graceful , foreign-looking lady at his side . A goldenhaired child was playing near them , " etc . Newman is glad to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar and a glass of wine , " etc . He then turns to the lady , formerly Madame de Cintr* , and asks her to step out into the garden with their daughter ; whereupon he proceeds to narrate to Mr. James how he came to marry Madame de Cintr* , after all . This narrative it would hardly be just for me to report . What I most wish to call attention to is the development of a new sort of literature here involved . The German editor , as I have noticed , alludes to a special order of " translation - literature , " to which he reckons The American much superior . Does the superiority consist in the fact that it need n't he translated at all , and is fair prey for all sorts of tampering , without acknowled0ment ? Has the doctrine of Elongated Classics found a following in Germany ? Or is this innovation a new move in the direction of international copyright ? - Certain of us are getting up , with great care and small expense , a decoration for the gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is considered that a decoration of some sort is also due to the Congress which passed the law , provided it can be shown that that Congress meant the like ( i/o ntrzbutor8 ' Club . September , law to be understood as the postmasters now understand it : to wit , as covering MSS. for books alone . There is nothing in the dictionary , or in the law , which decides that there is but one kind of authors ' MSS. , namely , that which is written for a book . Yet a luminous postmaster-general has at some time or other decided that the law meant books , and books alone , when it said " authors ' MSS . " Where do you suppose that postmaster-general was educated ? Here is a law which pretends on its face to be a charity to poor scribblers ; it tells them that authors ' MSS. shall be carried through the mails for mere newspaper postage . Now , where is the value of this law , thus construed ? No man has ever yet sent the manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed ; no man ever will intrust so precious a thing as the manuscript of a book to the United States mail while expresses continue to exist . The mail would convey such a package for ten or twenty cents , and probably lose it on the way ; the express will convey it for double the money , and take it through safely . Do you imagine that that " author " lives who is poor enough to be willing to accept ten cents ' worth of this charity of the United States government , with its burden of insecurity , when for a few cents added he can have the trusty services of the express companies ? No , indeed . The fact is as I have stated it before : no one ever sends a book manuscript by mail . That law is a dead letter . One can not send an article to a magazine under it ; no , the crystal intellects of the postal service have decreed that nothing but books are written by authors . Mr. Longfellow is often and innocently referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not send that poem through the mails on reduced postage , because the department knows that a little thing like that has no author , authorship being determined by bulk and not otherwise . He would have to pay letter postage on it , because post-office law - which is as noble in its way , and as clear as crowner 's quest law - has // decided that every manuscript that is not a book is a letter . The department knows perfectly well that there are only two kinds of manuscripts , - books and letters . Poe is spoken of as the author of that long and curious tale called The Murders in the Rue Morgue . Author is a false title in this case , likewise . The department has so decided , for that tale lacks the essential qualities of authorship , - bulk and weight . If you were going to print but a single copy of a book , the gifted department would let you mail the MS. for it at the reduced rate . But if you mentioned the fact that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into hundreds of bulky volumes of the magazine at the end of the year , and that it was therefore author 's MS. , since it was going to be part of a book , what do you suppose the department would say ? I solemnly believe that so intricate a question as this would unseat the reason of the most powerful-minded postal department we ever have had . We authors write about twenty-five magazine articles each , a year . Postage , letter rates , averages forty cents on each article : ten dollars a year for each of us . There are eight hundred and forty-eight authors in the country who write for magazines . Most of our articles are not accepted , but are returned to us . We pay postage just the same , though , - both ways . Considering , for the sake of argument , that we use the mail and not the express , our postage on matter sent aggregates eight thousand four hundred and eighty dollars in a year ; return postage on upwards of two thirds of our work hurled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year , fourteen thousand four hundred and eighty dollars . Aggregate for three years , say , in round numbers , forty-three thousand five hundred dollars . Among us , in this country , there are four hundred and forty - one who write books as well as magazine articles . But we do not write a book every year ; we are not quite so prolific as that . We average a book each , every three years . That is an aggregate of four hundred and forty - one books in three years . Postage on each book ( as authors ' MS. ) , an average of twenty cents . Now observe : aggregate postage ( letter rates ) on three years ' magazine manuscripts , forty-three thousand five hundred dollars ; aggregate postage on three years ' book manuscripts ( authors ' MS. rates ) , eighty - eight dollars and twenty cents ! And , after all , we do not trust more than about three dollars and fifteen cents ' worth of those book manuscripts to the mails in the course of eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken away from books , and conferred upon magazine articles , or , better still , that the whole law be routed and scouted from the statutes , to the end that the United States government may be estopped from glorifying itself any longer over its charity to authors , - a charity , indeed , which is , like all its generosities toward literature , a sham . - I once heard an old novel - reader say , impatiently , " Whenever I open a book and see Hoot , mon ! ' 1 always close it immediately . " Something of the same feeling comes over one on reading That Lass o ' Lowrie 's ; there is a weariness in continually changing " reet " into " right , " yo " into " you , " and , at last , an impatience even as to the treasure-trove itself , " graidely . " The localisms of rural England are hard reading for us Americans ; we understand something of Scotch pronunciations , thanks to long familiarity with Walter Scott and Burns , but we labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as impatient over them as we are over the slow Lancashire man himself when he comes to dig in our gardens or to carry our messages to a neighbor . When , however , we have at length translated this story of Mrs. Burnett 's into our own tongue , what do we find ? Simply the old , long-mooted question , Can an educated man marry an inferior , lift to the position of wife a woman destitute of cultivation and without knowledge of the smaller refinements of life , - can he do this with any chance of hap1877. 865 // piness ? All the educated and refined women will instantly arise and answer , " No ; " for a woman knows so well that , leaving mere education apart , no aftertraining can ever eradicate entirely the habits of the common working-girl , or supply the exquisite little personal refinements which can not be bought , or taught , or even made tangible enough to be fixed in words , but which are yet the most powerful adjuncts of the lady . But , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answer , " Yes ; " and prove their belief by their marriages . Dickens attacked this question in Our Mutual Friend , where Eugene marries Lizzie , the boat-girl ; but he gave her every aid he could think of , - striking beauty , intense devotion , and the chance to save her lover 's life . Reade took up the point in Christie Johustone , giving Christie the same wonderful loveliness , devotion , and the saved life of the little painter ; but Reade , great master of fiction , withdrew before the end the hardest part of the dose by placing Gatty nearer Christie after all , his mother turning out to have been only a cook . Mrs. Burnett 's heroine has the same beauty , devotion , and life - saving opportunities of her predecessors ; in fact , it needs all these to make the thing go down . And , in this case , has it gone down ? Extraordinary loveliness , like Joan 's , can do a great deal ; still , in the long course of married life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Derrick sometimes feel like fleeing away from his wife into the old atmosphere where ease and refinement are known already without the learning ? And then , will he not call himself a brute , and return to her with a determined effort which she will see , and feel , like a knife in her loving heart ? In the case of Eugene and Lizzie , in this of Joan and Derrick , and in the few instances we see in real life , the marriage at the last is a dramatic tableau which we accept because it is striking , and also because it touches in our hearts something which is deeper than conventionality . But , when the chimes have ceased ringing and all the people have gone home , when the personages in the tableau have stepped down to common life , how then ? Can any one look forward five years , ten , and not feel sure that the husband has gone through - whether with good grace or ill - scenes of mortification and deep annoyance almost beyond numbering ? Women of refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love - seriously , I mean - with pretty chambermaids , lovely laundresses , or astonishing collier-girls . They ask themselves how it would be if they should set about discovering ideal qualities in handsome coachmen , cooks , and restaurantwaiters . May they not have " good hearts " and all sorts of capacities ? Might they not be " grand creatures , " too , if brought out and educated and given a chance ? Certainly they might , being human . But here is the difference : in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand , a lady could not endure the personal manners of the son of the soil for one moment , no matter if he was as handsome as an Apollo , and had saved her life a hundred times . Mrs. Burnett 's book as a whole seems to me very well done ; we do not come from it empty - handed , but bear away with us a clear image of Joan , grandlyshaped , majestic creature , with her deep , inarticulate love for the engineer . Derrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is big and strong , self - possessed and good - looking , and that is sufficient . How few modern novels add distinct personages to the galleries of our memory ! They add paintings of society and manners , of events , or odd corners of unfamiliar scenery ; but personages - how few ! Grandcourt is the latest in my collection . I tried hard to get in Gabriel Conroy , but he kept dissolving . I am almost inclined to think that this Joan is going to win a place , however ; she keeps standing at the door in a haunting kind of way , and looking in . But ah ! if she had only died down there in the mine , how much more impressive and convenient it would have been for herself and Derrick , and the reader , also ! // - Mr . Stedman in his Victorian Poets has clearly presented and illustrated with much care the relation between the poet laureate of England and the idyllic Alexandrian school . But , so far as I know , neither he nor any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennyson by some of the older En0lish poets . Compare , for example , the Talking Oak ( that cross , to speak profanely , between the pastoral and the vers de socieW ) with Drayton 's Quest of Cynthia , the finest poem of its kind , as I think , in the language . Not only is the metre the same , but there is a marked similarity in the topics , the style of treatment , the selection of epithets , and even in the music of the two pieces . Each turns upon the subject of a fair one , fancifully worshiped and somewhat extravagantly described . In each , the tree with the names carved upon it is pressed early into service . In each , inanimate objects are compelled to render their tribute of eulogy . But it is hardly necessary to pursue the parallel further . Tennyson opens with a modernization : - " The city 's bulk behind me lies Beneath its drift of smoke . But ah ! with what delighted eyes I turn to yonder oak " Now , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drayton 's first lines : - " What time the trees were clad in green , The fields dressed all in flowers , And that the sleek-haired nymphs were seen To seek them summer bowers , " Forth went I by the eliding rills To find where cynthia sat , Whose name so often from the hills The echoes wondered at . " There is a peculiar attractiveness ( with perhaps a spice of surprise in it ) in these abrupt terminations in short syllables . Of course , it would disappear on much repetition , and such sounds as " at " certainly have no great melody in themselves ; but the general effect when they follow rhymes of long syllables is often quite exquisite and piquant . We have the device over and over again in both poems ; and Drayton especially presents a stanza or two of this sort , whose delicate sweetness has very seldom been rivaled . For instance : - " The winds were hushed ; no leaf so small At all was seen to stir . While , tuning to the was er 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennyson 's fastidious choice of epithets has often been remarked upon ; but you will find the same in Drayton : - " And laugh to see the lusty deer Come hounding oer the brake . " " The gentle spring yet never bore That sweet nor tender flower That damasleed not the checkered floor Of Cynthia 's summer bower . " " The drops that in the footprints stood Of that delicious girl The nymphs upon their dainty food Drank for dissolvdd pearl . " Also the " sliding rills " and " sleekhaired nymphs " already mentioned , and a number of other instances which might be given . Tennyson 's good taste , however , has kept him quite free from any of the grotesque conceits into which a superlative love for the fanciful and the mode of an earlier day combined to hurry his model . For instance , you would never find him declaring that the bank upon which his sweetheart had rested on leaving her bath became straightway so fragrant and precious that the " mold " was removed " For pomander and sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good partner for a druggist . Even more preposterous things are told of the effect of the water ( after her person had left it ) upon subsequent bathers of less exalted purity . But if the earlier poem has the greater number of blemishes , it also excels in beauties . The Talkin* , Oak does not anywhere reach the highest point of the Quest either as regards originality of illustration and adornment , or richness and delicacy of verbal music . There is more equality of merit about Tennyson 's work , but as a whole it must nevertheless take a lower place . - It is an old subject of complaint that our country is all spotted over and discolored by wretched local names . But the worst of it is that in altering them we seldom make any improvement . 367 // Some of the names , given on a casual impulse , are very suggestive . I have been looking over the list of places set down in the Postal Guide , and have come to the conclusion that if Niagara had been a torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all the States , we could not have got more bizarre results than are now to be found . North Hero , in Vermont , and Green Tree , in Pennsylvania , assume a classic and every-day air by the side of the Western inventions in town names ; for example , Orodelfan and Ni Wot , in Colorado . California retains its Bret Harte-ish atmosphere in Slide and Big Pine . Iowa and Wyoming come still nearer the mark , each having a Last Chance . Even Illinois retains some novelties , as East Paw Paw , Teutopolis , and Samsville . One place shows traces of a wandering Latin grammar , the verb Amo having been fixed upon to designate the locality where the whitening bones of the volume were probably found by a train of emigrants . Nevada , of course , has its Bullion , Diamond , Treasure City , and Mineral City , about which there is a slight monotony . But there is something inspiring about these fabrics from Nebraska , namely : Wild Cat , Rescue , Gazelle , Centennial . And alliteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Verdigris Valley . Slaughter ( Dakota ) can not be a place altogether pleasant to refer one 's youthful memories to ; but I find something really interesting in names like Big Bone Lick and Wagon Wheel Gap . Often the choice of early *ettlers in these matters is determined by circumstances that are too trivial and irremediably sordid ; but for all that , they often have a genuineness that is wanting to our more ambitious Eastern nomenclature . We are forever pulling up the most fortunate of our names , and trying new ones , as if these were something like city pavements , - the only real use of which is to be made the source of lucrative experiments in tearing up and restoring . Killingworth , for example , in Connecticut , which appears in Longfellow 's delightful poem , The Birds of Killingworth , has since been changed to Clinton ; and a village known as Nine Partners , where Fitz- Greene Halleck 's father lived , is now stupidly called Washington Hollow . Think of Washington being hollow , - all the pith taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which formerly meant something , though it did not sound pretty , has become Port Chester , which means nothing . I might cite a good many instances , but there are two which have especially annoyed me of late . In Newport there was a street which ended in broad , green fields , and had thus won the delicious appellation of the Green End Road . But because some rich people , without taste , built villas there , the fresh informality of the name had to be discarded for that of Lafayette Avenue . In the other case , a spot near Boston , on the road along which the British retreated from Concord , was called Percy 's Ring , which certainly reminded one of the young Percy who was in that memorable retreat , whether it actually referred to him or not . In any case , there was a pleasant little romantic hint in the words , Percy 's Ring . But a land company went to work putting up houses there , and having some idea that the name of a place is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacant house , they rechristened it Arlington Heights . The people who do this sort of thing seem to me to answer exactly to that adjective which country-folk have charged with so much contempt- " cityfied . " Being an absurdly hybrid word , it is admirably suited to the crude and hybrid notions that lie at the bottom of our foolish names , sometimes so prosaic , and at other times so sentimental . I therefore offer for public use , through your Club , this word " cityfier , " to point out the people who represent that kind of civilization which removes simplicity and wholesome naturalness , to make way for artificiality , " stuck-up-ativeness , " and so on . You will find that it describes elements in our art , literature , society , and religion , also ; and I believe it will be as useful as the German term of Philistine . - What right have literary scaven // gers to arrogate to themselves the exclusive name of " realists " ? I deny that the dark and foul side of life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose is just as real as a poison vine ; a perfume-bottle is as real as a dunghill ; a spring of clear water is as real as a cess-pool . It seems to be taken for granted that " reality " means nastiness , and the more of the hideous rottenness of the lowest deeps of life a writer can rake up , the more real and natural his ( lescriptions must be . I deny this utterly . M. Zola and his far-off comrades only describe one half of life , just like the " romantic " writers they decry ; the only difference is that the former give the worst and the latter the best half . Reality ought at least to demand an equal division of labor between the good and the bad , between misery and happiness , vice and virtue ; it might be granted that no preference should be shown the latter ; but when the former is given sole possession and the latter wholly excluded , the writer forfeits his claim to impartial description of real life as much as if he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing that the choice o* subjects is not to weigh at all , this bears as much for my argument as its opposite ; for a less revolting subject could be chosen , and its faithful depiction would be as well entitled to the name of " realism " as the other . This is not at all a question of art versus morality ; it is a question as to whether art working in comparatively clean material is not as truly art as that which seeks out specially the foulest material . Granting that the chemist must analyze alike spices and ordure , why should the selection for study exclusively of the latter entitle him to call himself a more thorough chemist than one who devoted himself to the former ? - I sometimes wonder whether the present generation , especially the younger portion of it , sufficiently reads and appreciates the works of the man who has just gone from us , an irreparable loss to the world in general , but to ourselves in particular , - regretted I feel sure by hundreds , I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sands . I mean John Lothrop Motley and his great histories . I wonder also whether those who are possibly frightened by the several large volumes know how much they lose , what a mine of treasures , what an immortal panorama of all that is noblest and highest and most divine in human nature , they pass coldly by . For myself , I can mention nothing that is more inspiring , elevating , and truly " heart-strengthening " than these books . To me The Rise of the Dutch Republic was the source of perhaps the deepest and purest enthusiasm of my life ; and , though it is but too true that the years are in nothing so mercilessly cruel tons as in the dampening chill- it seems inevitable and inexorable as fate , and none " of woman born " can wholly escape it - which they cast upon the fervency and intensity of our more youthful sentiments , a warm after-glow of that first enthusiasm lingers with me still . Mr. Motley 's recent death has vividly brought back to me the happy days when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great people whose story he has told with such consummate ability . I can not , of course , go into detail here , but , to mention only a single period , who that has " a living soul within him to be stirred " can read , for instance , his Siege of Leyden without trembling and tears and heart-throbs of sorrow and joy ? To be sure , his subject here , and indeed throughout , is a very fine one , but perhaps he alone was thus capable of doing it full justice , bringing out its whole beauty and grandeur , and I can not but rejoice that it was reserved for an American to depict the successful struggles of another great people for freedom . Mr. Motley has a most happy dramatic faculty of grouping scenes and minor personages round one great central figure , which , combined with his extraordinary powers of description , makes us fancy that , in spite of the two unsuccessful novels of his youth , he might s6metime have taken high rank as a writer of fiction , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientific fact marked out his career in another direction . Hi* style , always particularly racy 1877. 369 // and strong , - indeed , there breathes from his pages an atmosphere as fresh and pure *nd grateful as that of " saltsea air " or the odor of pine woods , - often rises into impassioned eloquence and pathos , and carries us easily and without fatigue even through the barren sands of diplomatic negotiations , which he is sometimes obliged to traverse . Occasionally ; too , the severity of the narrative is lit up by a gleam of most delightful humor or quiet satire , which has all the charm of a smile on a grave , noble countenance ; or it is colored by a striking bit of delicate and poetical description , - the picture of some landscape , city , or church . His account of Antwerp Cathedral , for instance , is as fine a piece of writing in prose -I am almost tempted to call it a poem- as I have read . I find in him so rare a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , he came to his task so fully and peculiarly fitted , so richly and completely equipped for the great undertaking , that , take him for all in all , I am sure we shall indeed not soon " look upon his like again ! ** He was cut off before the labor of his life was coinpleted , but let us be profoundly grateful for the precious legacy he has left us. - It was at the theatre the other evening . The curtain had fallen on the second act . The play was stupid . The chevalier is not stupid , so he did n't talk about the play . He said , - " I have been reading a criticism of Lowell , to-day . Is it true , as this critic says , that Lowell is didactic ? " " In the sense that Pope is didactic , and Young , and-Mr . Tupper ? No ! ' * " Ah ! Well ?

" " Should the theme control him ? Does it measure the sky-lark 's song ? " " Yes , or it would , save that he is immeasurably glad . " " He has never been before the footlights when a crew of tepid wretches were behind them . But after all , is there not too much Yankee self-assertion in Lowell 's best , a positiveness equally in his doubts and beliefs that belongs to the professor and not to the poet ? " " There is Yankee self-assertion in The Biglow Papers , but Lowell found it in Hosea . He did not put it there . There are also such lines as those of A New England Spring : - Af ore you think Young oak-leaves mist the hill-side woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , The orchards turn to heaps of rosy cloud ; Red cedars blossom , too , tho ' few folks know it , And look all dipt in sunshine like a poet .

Not a breath of the time that has been hovers In the air now soft with a summer to be Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons here-after Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep , While as they that are free now of weeping and laughter We shall sleep . ' " Very fair poetry , - that last . " " Very noble poetry , - that first . " " How , then , is it that we care mostfor we do in all art - for that which is simply beautiful , and resent the moral element as an intrusion ? Is Hogarth a great comfort to you ?

They are living people always , for us , in a living world . The quality of endurance in their work has nothing to do with this matter . Nor is it the most energetic , forcible souls which thus keep their vitality among men , in spite of nature . Nobody now thinks of Dickens as alive , with all his geniality and full-blooded ardor .

The shadowy , gray-haired figure will appear just as when he walked the hill-path in Concord , with the covert smile in the eyes , half weird and half shrewd , and remain thereafter , actual in his life , a man that one knows as one does one 's neighbor .

The glimpses he gives us of truth and human life may be deeper and broader than those of the man who colors his drawing with his own blood , but there is all the difference between their work that there is between the studies of trees in a landscape of Claude 's and the single tree rustling above us , with the thrush in the branches and the beetles in the bark ; or between the presentment of a tragedy by Salvini or Janauschek and our neighbor beside his dead , when we can go into the darkened house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and women crowding into authorship , nowadays , belong to the latter class . They may have skill , talent , even that actual force called genius , but it is a motor which has not yet compelled them to write . They do not wait for that . The first necessity which clever young people in this country usually feel is the necessity for bread and butter . So they look about for material , backgrounds , studies , and go to work . There is every degree of success attainable by their cult , - froimDickens 's place to that of the reporter for an illustrated paper . By the time they have wrested the secret of life from their own particular sphinx , in their own particular chasm , they are quite too shrewd or self-conscious to utter it . No more curious study , on the other hand , is to be found in literature than the course of many living authors who have reached middle age , in passing from the one kind of utterance to the other . Their first book or poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; they were startled , almost shocked , when the world stood still to listen . Then came the pleasant conviction that this utterance of theirs was a marketable commodity ; and then the attempt to express other men 's lives by it , and the surprise when the world began to treat them , not as oracles , as at first , but as its other hired singers or preachers . As far as I can see , there are but two chances by which this world may command the best work of either kind from men who handle the pen : either let publishers pay nothing at all for their copy , or let authors all be placed on a pension list . In either case the element of bread and butter would be eliminated from the problem , and humanity and its teachers would meet on level ground . 872 September ,
