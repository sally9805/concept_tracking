VOL . XXLJL-FEBRUARY , 1877. - No. 2 . ADMINISTRATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN . THE second session of the Thirtyseventh Congress , from its commencement to its close , tested the strength of the Government and the capability of those who administered it . Disappointment , in consequence of no decisive military success during the first few months of the war , had caused a generally depressed feeling which begot discontent and distrust that in ' various ways found expression in *Congress . Democrats complained more of the incapacity of the Executive than of the inefficiency of the generals , and the entire Administration was censured and denounced by them for acts which , if not strictly legal and constitutional in peace , were necessary and unavoidable in war . Republicans , on the other hand , were dissatisfied because so little was accomplished , and the factious imputed military delay to mismanagement and want of energy in the Administration . Indeed , but for some redeeming naval successes at Hatteras and Port Royal preceding the meeting of Congress in December , the whole belligerent operations would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slavery question in all its aspects prevailed ; the Democrats insisting that fugitives should be returned to their masters under the provisions of law , as in time of peace . The Republicans were divided on this question , one portion 10 agreeing with the Democrats that all should be returned , another claiming that only escaped slaves who belonged to loyal owners , wherever they resided , should be returned ; another portion insisted that there should be no rendition of servants of rebel masters , even in loyal or border States , who , by resisting the laws and setting the authorities at defiance , had forfeited their rights and all Governmental protection . Questions in regard to the treatment of captured rebels , and the confiscationof all property of rebels , were agitated . What was the actual condition of the seceeding States , and what would be their status when the rebellion should be suppressed , were also beginning to be controverted points , especially among members of Congress . On these and other questions which the insurrection raised , novel , perplexing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration had developed no well defined policy when Congress convened in December , 1861 , but it was compelled to act , and that in such a manner as not to alienate friends or give unnecessary offence , while maintaining the Government in all its Federal authority and rights for the preservation of the Union and the suppression of the rebellion . The character and duration of the war , which many had supposed would be brief , was still undetermined . While affairs were in this uncertain and Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1877 , by SHELDON- &amp; CO. , in the office of the Librarian of Congress , at WashingtOn . // inchoate condition , and the Administration had no declared policy on some of the most important questions , Congress came together fired with indignation and revenge for a war so causeless and unprovoked . A large portion of the members , exasperated toward the rebels by reason of the war , and dissatisfied with delays and procrastination , which they imputed chiefly to the Administration , were determined there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , institutions , and the States which had confederated to break up tile Union . There was , however , little unity among the complaining members as to the mode and method of prosecuting the war . It was not difficult to find fault with the Administration , but it was not easy for the discontented to settle on any satisfactory idan of continuing it . The Democrats complained that the President transcended his rightful authority ; the radical portion of the Republicans that he was not sufficiently aggressive ; that he was deficient in energy and too tender of the rebels . It was at this period , after Congress had been in session two months , and opinions were earnest but diverse and factious , with a progeny of crude and mischievous schemes as to the conduct of affairs and the treatment of the rebels , that Senator Sumner , in the absence of a clearly defined policy on the part of the Administration , and while things were not sufficiently matured to adopt one , submitted his project for overthrowing the State governments and reducing them to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of slavery . It was the enunciation of a policy that was in conflict with the Constitution , and would change the character of the Government , but which he intended to force upon the Administration . Though a scheme devised by himself , it had in its main features the countenance of many and some able supporters . President Lincoln had high respect for Mr. Sumner , but was excessively annoyed with this presentation of the extreme , and , as he considered them , unconstitutional and visionary theories of the Massachusetts Senator , which were intended to commit the Government and shape its course . It was precipitating upon the Administration issues on delicate and deeply important subjects at a critical period-issues involving the structure of the Government and the stability of our Federal system . These questions might have to be ultimately met and disposed of , but it was requisite that they should be met with caution and deliberate consideration . The times and condition of the country were inauspicious for considerate statesmanship . The matters in dispute , the consequences and results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no union of sentiment on Senator Sumner 's plan , nor any other at that period , in the free States , in Congress , or even in the Republican party . There were half a dozen factions to be reconciled or persuaded to act together . This plan was felt to be an clement of discord , which , if it could not be finally averted , might in that gloomy period , when the country was threatened and divided , have been temporarily , at least , avoided . But Senator Sumner , though scholarly and cultured , was not always judicious or wisely discreet . The President , as he expressed himself , could not , in the then condition of affairs , afford to have a controversy with Sumner , but he so managed as to check violent and aggressive demands by quietly interposing delay and non-action . In the mean time , while the subjects of slavery , reconstruction , and confiscation were being vehemently discussed , he felt the necessity of adopting , or at least proposing , some measure to satisfy public sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans themselves , in Congress , which called out earnest debate . The Radicals , such as Thaddeus Stevens , // who were in fact revolutionists and intended that more should be accomplished by the Government than the suppression of the rebellion and the preservation of the Union , were for the immediate and unsparing confiscation of the property of the rebels by act of Congress without awaiting judicial proceedings . In their view and by their plan rebels , if not outlaws , were to be considered and treated as foreigners , not as American citizens ; the States in insurrection were to be reduced to the condition of provinces ; the people were to be subjugated and their property taken to defray the expenses of the war . Mr. Sumner , less crafty and calculating than Stevens , but ardent and impulsive , was for proceeding to extreme lengths ; and , having the power , he urged that they should embrace " the opportunity which God in his beneficence had offered " to extinguish by arbitrary enactment slavery , and *ll claim to reserved sovereignty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other milder men were opposed to any illegal and unjustifiable enactment . As is too often the case in high party and revolutionary times , the violent and intriguing were likely to be successful , until it came to be understood that the President would feel it obligatory to place upon the extreme and unconstitutional measures his veto . A knowledge of this and the attending fact , that his veto would be suetained , induced Congress to pass a joint resolution , modifying the act , expounding and declaring its meaning , instead of enacting a new and explicit law , which the judiciary , whose province it is , would expound and construe . The President , in order not to be misunderstood when informing the House of Representatives that he had affixed his signature to the bill and joint resolution , also transmitted a copy of the message he had prepared to veto the act in its original shape , with his objections , in which he said that by a fair construction of the act he considered persons " are not punished without regular trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial provisions of the law and the Constitution applicable to their several cases . " It was ap . prehended at that time , and subsequent acts proved the apprehension well founded , that Congress or its radical leaders were disposed to assume and exercise not only legislative , but judicial and executive powers . Rebels were by Congress to be condemned and their property confiscated and taken without trial and conviction . Such was not the policy of the President , as was soon well understood ; and to reconcile him and those who agreed with him , a provision was inserted that persons who should commit treason and be " adjudged guilty thereof " should be punished . But to prevent misconception from equivocal phraseology in a somewhat questionable act , he explicitly made known that " regular trials in duly constituted courts " were to be observed , and the rights of the executive and judicial departments of the Government maintained . This precaution , and the determination which he uniformly expressed to regard individual rights , and not to impose penalty or inflict punishment for alleged crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conviction , was not satisfactory to the extremists , who were ready to treat rebels as outlaws , and condemn them without judge or jury . The Centralists in Congress , who were arrogating executive and judicial as well as legislative power , authorized the President , by special provision in this law , to extend pardon and amnesty on such occasions as he might deem expedient . This was represented as special grace and a great conce*ssion ; but as the pardoning power is explicitly conferred on the President by the Constitution , the permission or authorization given by the act was entirely supererogatory . Congress could neither enlarge nor diminish the authority of the Executive in that re // qwq dissimilar propositions , antagonistic to slavery , found expression , increasing in intensity as the war was prolonged . While it was evident to most persons that one of the results of the insurrection would be , in some way or form , the emancipation of the slaves , there was no person who seemed capable of devising a constitutional , practical plan for its accomplishment , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to resort ; yet the necessity of doing something that did not transcend the law , was morally right , and would tend to the ultimate freedom of the slaves was felt to be an essential and indispensable duty . Unavailing but seductive appeals continued in the mean time to be made by the secessionists to the people of the border slave States to unite with the further South for the security and protection of slavery , in which they had a common interest , and against which there was increasing hostility through the North . It was under these circum *tances , with a large and growing portion of the North in favor of abolition  --  the slave States , including the border States , opposed to the measure and for the preservation of the institution-that the President was to prescribe a policy on which the government in the disordered state of the country was to be administered . To surmount the difficulties , without setting aside the law , or giving just offence to any , the President , with his accustomed prudence and regard for existing legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those most in interest , would , he believed , in a legal way open the road to ultimate , if not immediate , emancipation . Inst*ad of assenting to the demands of the radical extremists that he should , by arbitrary proceedings , and in disregard of law and Constitution , decree freedom to all slaves , he preferred milder and more conciliatory measures . The authority or right of the national Oovernment to abolish or interfere with *n institution that was reserved and belonged exclusively to the States , he was not prepared to act upon or admit , though entreated and urged thereto by sincere party friends , and also by party supporters , whose sincerity was doubtful . There could be no excuse or pretext for such interference but the insurrection ; and , even as a war measure , there were obstacles in the condition of the border slave States , to say nothing of loyal , patriotic citizens in the insurrectionary region , that could not be overlooked . On the 6th of March , within less than three weeks after Senator Sumner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration that it is the duty of Congress " to see that everywhere in this extensive ( secession ) territory slavery shall cease to exist practically , as it has already ceased to exist constitutionally or morally , " that President Lincoln , not assenting to the assumption , sent a message to Congress proposing a plan of voluntary and compensated emancipation . In this message he suggested that " the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery , giving to each State pecuniary aid , " etc. , and he invited an interview upon the 10th of March , with the representatives of the border States , to consider the subject . They did not conclude at this interview to adopt his suggestions , and some of them were much incensed that the proposition had been made , believing it would alienate and drive many , hitherto rightly disposed , into secession . Nevertheless , the fact that slavery was doomed , and had received a death blow from the war of secession , was so obvious , that the moderate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the President 's plan favorable consideration . While the policy of voluntary em*ncipation , in which the States should be aided by the national Government , was not immediately successful , it // made such advance as , by the aid of the Federal Government , led to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia . The advoc tes of immediate , general , and forcible emancipation , if not satisfied with the conciliatory policy of the President , could not well oppose it . Warm discussions in Congress , and altercations out of it , on most of the important questions growing out of the war , and particularly on those of confiscation , emancipation , and reconstruction , or the restoration of the States to their rightful position , and the reestablishment of the Union , were had during the whole of the second session of the Thirty-seventh Congress . All of these were exciting and important questions , the last involving grave principles affecting our federal system , and was most momentous in its consequences . As time and events passed on , the convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the line of policy which it was his duty and that of the Administration to pursue . Dissenting , wholly and absolutely , from the revolutionary views and schemes of Senator Sumner and those who agreed with him , the President became convinced , as the subject had been prematurely introduced and agitated , with an evident intent to forestall and shape the action of the Government , that the actual status of the rebel States and their true relation to the Federal Government should be distinctly understood . The resolution of Mr. Dixon , a gentleman of culture and intelligence , who , as well as Mr. Sumner , was a New England Senator , and also of the same party , was , it will be observed , diametrically opposed to the principles and the project of the Massachusetts Senator on the great , impending , and forthcoming subject of reconstruction . It was directly known that the President coincided with the Connecticut Senator in the opinion that all the acts and ordinances of secession were mere nullities , and should be so treated ; that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not in any degree affect the States as commonwealths , and their relations to the Federal Government ; that such acts were rebellious , insurrectionary , and hostile on the part of the persons engaged in them , but that the States , notwithstanding the acts and conspiracies of individuals , were still members of the Federal Union , and that the loyal citizens of these States had forfeited none of their rights , but wern entitled to all the protection and privileges guaranteed by the Constitution . The theory and principles set forth in Senator Dixon 's resolutions were the opinions and convictions of the President , deliberately formed and consistently maintained while he lived , on the subject of reconstruction and the condition of the States . and people in the insurrectionary region . In his view there was no actual secession , no dismembering of the Union , no change in the Constitution and Government the relative position of the States and the Federal Government were unchanged ; the organic , fundamental laws sf neither were altered by the sectional conspiracy ; the whole people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible for his own acts and amenable to law ; and he was also entitled to the protection of the law , and the rights and privileges secured by the Constitution . The confiscation and emaucipation schemes concerning which there was so much excitement in Congress were of secondary consideration to the all-absorbing one of preserving the Union . The second session of the Thirtyseventh Congress closed on the 17th of July . Its proceedings had been confused and uneasy , with a good deal of discontented and revolutionary feeling , which increased toward the close . The decisive stand which the President had taken , and Which he calmly , firmly , and persistently maintained against the extreme measures of some of the most prominent Republicans in Congress , was unsatisfactory . // It was insinuated that his sympathies on important measures had more of a Democratic than Republican tendency ; yet the Democratic party maintained an organized and often unreasonable , if not unpatriotic , opposition . Military operations , aside from naval success at New Orleans and on the upper Mississippi , had been a succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General-in-Chief , which the President could not reconcile , caused the latter to be superseded after the disastrous result before Richmond . Dissensions in the army and among the Republicans in Congress , the persistent opposition of Democrats to the Administration , and the general depression that prevailed were discouraging .. " In my position , " said the President , " I am environed with difficulties . " Friends on whom he felt he ought to be able to rely were dissatisfied with his conscientious scruples and lenity , and party opponents were unrelenting against the Administration . A few days before Congress adjourned , the President made another but unsuccessful effort to dispose of the slavery question , by trying to induce the border States to take the initiative in his plan of compensated emancipation . The interview between him and the representatives of the border States , which took place on the 12th of July , convinced him that the project of voluntary emancipation by the States would not succeed . Were it commenced by one or more of the States , he had little doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emancipation by the States themselves . Failing in the voluntary plan , he was compelled , as a war necessity , to proclaim freedom to all slaves in the rebel section , if the war continued to be prosecuted after a certain date . This bold and almost revolutionary measure , which would change the industrial character of many States , could be justified on no other ground than as a war measure , the result of military necessity . It was an unexpected and startling demonstratioa when announced , that was welcomed by a vast majority of the people in the free States . In Congress , however , neither this nor his project of compensated emancipation was entirely acceptable to either the extreme anti-slavery or pro-slavery men . The radicals disliked the way in which emancipation was effected by the President . But , carried forward by the force of public opinion , they could not do otherwise than acquiesce in the decree , complaining , however , that it was an unauthorized assumption by the Executive of power which belonged to Congress . The opponents of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alarm , and the result of the policy of emancipation in the election which followed in the autumn of 1862 was adverse to the Administration . Confident , however , that the step was justifiable and necessary , the President persevered and consummated it by a final proclamation on the 1st of January , 1863 . The fact that the Administration lost ground in the elections in consequence of the emancipation policy served for a time to promote unity of feeling among the members when Congress convened in December . The shock occasioned by the measure when first announced had done its work . The timid , who had doubted the necessity and legality of the act , and feared its consequences , recovered their equipoise , and a reaction followed which strengthened the President in public confidence . But the radical extremists , especially the advocates of Congressional supremacy , began in the course of the winter to reassert their own peculiar ideas and their intention of having a more extreme policy pursued by the Government . Thaddeus Stevens embraced an early opportunity to declare his extreme views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presi // dent . But Stevens , whose ability and acquirements as a politician , and whose skill and experience as a party tactician were unsurpassed if not unequalled in either branch of Congress , made no open , hostile demonstration toward the President . He restricted himself to contemptuous expressions in private conversation against the Executive policy and general management of affairs . Without an attack on the President , whom he personally liked , the Administration was sneered at as weak and inefficient , of which little could be expected until a more aggressive and scathing policy was adopted . His personal intercourse with members and his talents and eloquence on the floor of the House gave him influence with the representatives on ordinary occasions , but his ultra radical and revolutionary ideas caused the calm and considerate to distrust and disclaim his opinions and his leadership . It was not until a later period , and under another Executive , less affable but not less honest and sincere than Mr. Lincoln , that the suggestions of Stevens were much regarded . When his disciples and adherents became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him power and consequence and reconcile their constituents , denominated him the " Great Commoner . " If his political hopes and party schemes had been sometimes successful , his reverses *and disappointments had been much greater . Many and severe trials during an active , embittered , and often unscrupulous partisan experience , had tempered his enthusiasm if they had not brought him wisdom . Defeats can hardly be said to have made him misanthropic ; but having little philosophy in his composition , he vented his spleen when there was occasion on his opponents in ironical remarks that made him dreaded , and which were often more effective than arguments ; but his sagacity and knowledge of men taught him that a hostile and open conflict with a chief magistrate whose honesty even he respected , and whose patriotism the people so generally regarded , would be not only unavailing , but to himself positively injurious . He therefore conformed to circumstances ; and while opposed to the tolerant policy of the Administration toward the rebels and the rebel States , he had the tact and address , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendly personal relations with the President , who well understood his traits and purpose , but avoided any conflict with him . For the first five or six weeks of the third session of the Thirty-seventh Congress , Stevens improved his time in free and sarcastic remarks on the reconstruction policy of the Government , which he characterized as puerile and feeble , and at length , on the 8th of January , he gave utterance to his feelings , maintaining that " with regard to all the Southern States in rebellion , the Constitution has no binding influence or application . " He averred that " in his opinion they were not members of the Union " ; that " the ordinances of secession took them out of the Union " ; that he " would levy a tax wherever he could upon these conquered provinces said he " would not only collect the tax , but he would , as a necessary war measure , take every particle of property , real and personal , life estate and reversion , of every disloyal man , and sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Several members of Congress hastened to deny that these sentiments and purposes were those of the Republican party ; this Mr. Stevens admitted . He said " a very mild denial from the pleasant gentleman from New York *Mr . Olini , and the somewhat softened and modified repudiation of the gentleman from Indiana " ( Mr. Colfax ) , would , he hoped , satisfy the sensitive gentle*men in regard to him , and he " desired to say he did not speak the sentiments of this side of the House as a party " ; that " for // 1877 . ) ADMINISTRATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN . the last fifteen years he liStevens had always been ahead of the party in these matters , but he had never been so far ahead but that the members of the party had overtaken and gone ahead ; and they would again overtake him and go with him before the infamous and bloody rebellion was ended . " " They will find that they must treat those States , now outside of the Union , as conquered provinces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present rebels as exiles from this country . " " Nothing but extermination , or exile , or starvation , will ever induce them to surrender to the Government . " Not very consistent or logical in his policy and views , this subsequently Radical leader proposed to treat the Southern people sometimes as foreigners and at other times as rebel citizens ; in either case he would tax , starve , and exile them-make provinces of their States , and overturn their old established governments . Few , comparatively , of the Republicans were at that time prepared to follow Stevens or adopt his vindctive and arbitrary measures . Shocked at his propositions , the " Great Commoner " had at that day few acknowledged adherents . When in vindication of his scheme it was asked upon what ground the collection of taxes could be enforced in the Southern States , Judge Thomas , one of the ablest and clearest minds of the Massachusetts delegation , said , " Upon this ground , that the authority of this Government at this time is as valid over those States as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground that every act of secession passed oy those States is utterly null and void ; upon the ground that every act legally null and void can not acquire force because armed rebellion is behind it , seeking to uphold it ; upon the ground that the Constitution makes us not a mere confederacy , but a nation ; upon the ground that the provisions of that Constitution strike through the State government and reach directly , not intermediately , the subjects . Subjects of whom ? Of the nation-of the United States . " " Who ever heard , as a matter of public law , that the authority of a government over its rebellious subjects was lost until that revolution was successfulwas a fact accomplished ? " Shortly after the capture of New Orleans and the establishment of Federal authority over Louisiana , two of the Congressional districts of that State elected representatives to Congress . The admission or non-admission of these representatives involved the question of the political condition of the Southern States and people in the Federal Union , and the whole principle , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deliberately considered and fully discussed in Congress . The committee on elections reported in favor of their admission , and Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts , the chairman , stated that " more than ordinary importance is attached to the consideration of this subject . It is not simply whether two gentlemen shall be permitted to occupy seats in this House . The question whether they shall be admitted involves the principles touching the present state of the country to which the attention of the House has more than once been called . " He said , " The question now comes up , whether any reason exists that requires any departure from the rules and principles which have been adopted . " " An adherence to these principles is vitally important in settling the question , how there is to be a restoration of this Union when this war shall be drawn to a close . " The subject of admitting these representatives and the principles of a restoration of the Union which their admission involved , was debated with earnestness for several days , and finally decided , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a vote of ninety-two in the affirmative to forty-four in the negative . An analysis of this vote , in view *f the proceedings , acts , and votes of // many of the same members a few years subsequently , after Mr. Lincoln 's death , presents some curious and interesting facts . It was not a strictly party vote . Among those who then favored the Administration policy of restoration were Colfax , Dawes , Delano , Fenton , Fisher of Delaware , Win . Kellogg , J. S. Morrill of Vermont , Governor A. H. Rice of Massachusetts , Shellabarger , and others who opposed the restoration policy of President Lincoln after his death and the accession of President Johnson . In the negative with Thaddeus Stevens were Ashley , Bingham , the two Conklings , Kelley , McPherson , and a few others . But when reconstruction or exclusion actually took place after the termination of the war , great changes occurred among the members of Congress , and Stevens , the " Great Commoner , " who in 1863 had a following of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , more than two-thirds to his standard against restoration and for subjugation and exclusion . Mr. Stevens was no ordinary man . At the bar he was astute and eloquent rather than profound , but in the Legislature of Pennsylvania and in the management of the affairs of that State , where for a period he actively participated and was a ruling mind , he was often rash and turbulent , and had , not without cause , the reputation of being a not over scrupulous politician . Personally my relations with him , though not intimate , were pleasant and friendly . I was first introduced to him at Harrisburg in 1836 , when he was a member of the convention that revised the Constitution of Pennsylvania . We occasionally met in after years . He expressed himself pleased with my appointment in Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet , and , notwithstanding we disagreed on fundamental principles , he complimented my administration of the Navy Department , and openly and always sustained my positions , and particularly so on the subject of the blockade , on which there were differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was probably the most eloquent speaker , but his ideas were often visionary and radical . He ultimately refused to sign the Constitution because the colored people were denied the elective franchise . Severe as he exhibited himself toward the rebels during and subsequent to the civil war , Mr. Stevens was not by nature , as might be supposed , inhuman in his feelings and sympathies toward his fellow men . To the colored race he seemed always more attached and tender than to the whites , perhaps because they were enslaved and oppressed . He was opposed to slavery , to imprisonment for debt , and to capital punishment . There were strange contradictions in his character . In his political career he had ardent supporters , though many who voted with him had not a high regard for his principles . His course and conduct in the Legislature and government of Pennsylvania did much to debauch the political morals of that State , and in the celebrated " buck-shot war " he displayed the bold and reckless disregard of justice and popular rights that distinguished the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged leader of the radical reconstruction party in Congress . In his political career and management , though strongly sustained by a local constituency , he had experienced a series of disappointments . The defeat of John Quincy Adams , whom he greatly admired , in 1828 , and the election of General Jackson , against whom his prejudices were inveterate , were to him early and grievous vexatious . The attempt of Mr. Adams on his retirement to establish a national antiMasonic party was warmly seconded by Stevens , and with greater success in Pennsylvania than attended his distinguished leader in Massachusetts . The failure of the attempt was more severely felt by the disciple than by the master . After the annihilation of the anti-Masonic organization and the // discomfiture of the buck-shot war , Stevens was less conspicuous , though prominent for a few months in 1840 , when he came forward as an earnest advocate of the nomination of General Harrison in that singular campaign which resulted in the General 's election . His efficiency and zeal in behalf of both the n*omination and election of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends anticipated they would be recognized and he rewarded by a seat in the Cabinet . But he had given offence to the great NWhig leader of that day by his preference of Harrison for President , and had moreover an unsavory reputation , which , with the declared opposition of Clay and Webster , caused his exclusion . It was a sore disappointment , from which he never fully recovered . Eight years later , with the advent of General Taylor and the defeated aspirations of the Whig leaders , who had caused his exclusion from Harrison 's Cabinet , he sought and obtained an election to the thirty-first Congress from the Lancaster district . In 1856 he strove with all his power to secure the Presidential nomination for John MeLane of the Supreme Court , who had or professed to have had anti-Masonic tendencies . His ill success was another disappointment ; but in 1859 he was again elected to Congress , and thereafter until his death he represented the Lancaster district . Disappointments had made him splenetic , bat he was not , as represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a miscreant , though possibly not wholly exempt from charges against him in either respect . In many of his ultra radical and it may be truly said revolutionary views-revolutionary because they changed the structure of the Government-he coincided with Senator Sumner , who was perhaps the leading spirit in the Senate on the subject of reconstruction , but he did not , like the Massachusetts Senator , make any pretence that his project to subjugate the Southern people and reduce their States to the condition of provinces was constitutional , or by authority of the Declaration of Independence . President Lincoln well understood the characteristics of both these men , and , though differing from each on the subject of restoration and reconstruction , he managed to preserve friendly personal relations with both-retained their confidence , and while he lived secured their general support of his Administration .
