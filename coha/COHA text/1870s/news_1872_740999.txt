In that speech he quoted the following as from Viee President Colfax 's speech at the serenade given him in South Bend . Ind. , on his return home : ? 4 Let me now join you in congratulations on the final triumph of the principles I have so often vindicated and maintained before you . I believe that today there stands no party , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from the lakes of the North to the gulf of the sunny South , there is no voice lifted against the principles which I have always enunciated and always defended . It seems to me that perhaps there could be no more convenient time that I could be transferred from an active to a retired life , where , relieved from all responsibilities . I should share with you the triumph which Republican institutions have eonferred upon the country , and which now seeing so secure . This is all history now , and history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the subject of it has passed away . And the Republican Party may be retained for other objects ; but of this the people must judge . But for all the great principles of its organization , it hus ceased to be necessary . Tfe ooforward now in the great work of the future , either with or without this party , as the needs of the country may require . " After quoting this passage , the South Bend ( Ind . ) Tribune says : The part of this extract which we have italicised above is an utter fabrication , manufactured by some unscrupulous falsifier . Mr. Mahan has been imposed on by this shameless forgery , and goes on in his speech to comment on these pretended admissions that the Republican Party " has ceased to be necessary , " &c.,; which every one here knows , and which the files of both Republican papers here prove , never came from Jilr . Colfax 's lips . "
