THIS centennial year seems to have unearthed in Europe as well as here many events and documents connected with our Revolution never before generally known , or wholly forgetten . Macmillan has brought out an illustrated work containing " political and military episodes derived from the life and correspondence of the Right Honorable John Burgoyne , general , statesman , and dramatist . " The writer goes very minutely into the events which preceded the famous expedition from Canada to Saratoga , gives large space to correspondence connected with it , describes the campaign itself , and evidently comprehends fully how decisive and fatal to our cause its successful issue would have been . Still he is wrong in some of his figures . The work has brought to mind the original order book of this general , directing all the movements of his splendid army-from the bright promising commencement of the march to its sad ending at Saratoga-which many years ago was sent me by a descendant of General George Clinton . It was obtained at Saratoga at the time of the surrender , l*ut in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This order book , written up a hundred years ago , and containing the orders that for three months from day to day directed all the movements of that army , on which two continents looked with such intense regard and expectation , possesses more than common interest . The book embraces about one hundred and seventy pages , is a small quarto bound in brown paper board , fastened together at the back with short leather straps pasted in for hinges . The writing paper is brown and coarse , of the old style , with rough-cut edges . Although in some portions the ink is very much * It is nowkept in a glass case at Washington 's headquarters , Newburgh . faded , yet the whole is perfectly legible . The first two leaves and some half a dozen in the middle have been torn out . In the latter part is given in parallel columns all the correspondence between Burgoyne and Gates relative to the surrender , together with the proposed , rejected , and accepted articles of the convention on which the army capitulated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging the movement of the boats , because the first line on the fourth page is a continuation of what followed before , and ends thus , " following disposition , and then lie upon their oars . " The following order gives us some insight into the feelings of the British commander as he starts on a campaign which he believes is to insure his renown and cause him to be rewarded with the highest honors by his king : SAFDY BLUFF , June 20th , 1777 . Parole , St. Peters ; C. 5 , Florence . Lieut. - General Burgoyne takes the occasion of the army assembling to express publicly the high opinion he entertains of the troops which his Majesty has been graciously pleased to entrust to his command ; they could not have been selected more to his satisfaction . And the Lient. - General trusts it will be received as one mark of his attention to their Glory and Welfare , that with the promise of every encouragement the service will allow , he declares a determinatloa and he calls upon every officer to assist him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following regulations are laid down to prevent the necessity of lengthening the daily orders , and are to be Invariably observed : Officers of all Ranks commanding outposts and Detachments are constantly to Fortify in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the Implements at hand will permit . Felling trees with their Points outward , barricading churches and Houses , Breastworks of earth and timber , are generally to be effected In a short time , and the science of engineering is not necessary to find and apply such resources . The practice of Fortifying , which is useful in all services , Is particularly so Ia this , where the Enemy , infinitely inferior to the King 's troops in open space and hardy combat , is well fitted by disposition and practice for the Stratagems and practise of little War . And neither the distance of Camps nor the Interference of Forests and Rivers are to be looked upon as s // curity against his attempts . Upon the same jirinciple it must be a constant rule in or near woods to place advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent theirbeingtaken off by single marksmen . Together with these precautions , Officers will ever bear in mind how much the publick honor andtheir own is concerned in maintaining a Post , and that to justify a retreat In the present Warthe number of the enemy must be much superior to that which would make their Justification when acting against brave and disciplined forces . The officers will take all proper opportunities , and especially at the beginning of the campaign , to inculcate in the men 's minds a Reliance upon the Bayonet . Men of half their bodily strength , and even Cowards , may be their match In firing , but the onset of the Bayonet in the hands of the Valiant Is irresistible . The enemy , convinced of this truth , place their whole dependence In lntrenchments and rifle pieces . It will be our glory and preservation to storm when possible . Then follow particular directions respecting the formation of camps on the route , etc . Among other things , he says , " When the Lieut. - General visits an Out Post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay him any compliment . " There is to be no useless form or ceremony-nothing of the martinet on this expedition , on which such momentous issues hang . It will be seen by this standing order that Burgoyne had studied the possibilities of this campaign with great care . If Grant had given the order to the commanding officers three miles out from Pittsburgh Landing , that Burgoyne gave one hundred years ago , " Officers of all ranks commanding outposts and detachments , are constantly to fortify in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the implements at hand will permit , " the disasters of that bloody day would never have happened . It was also a wise order to insist on the use of the bayonet , and not depend on firing in attacking lnilitia . But , like all commanders who rely justly on discipline and steady determined bearing , he could not comprehend the fact that a certain amount of enthusiasm will make the onset of untrained men more resistless than any amount of drill . The old Puritans proved this ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England and New York at Saratoga . Burgoyne shows by these daily orders , never . intermitted till the fore part of October , nearly three months , that he thoroughly appreciated the decisive bearing which the successfu.1 issue of this bold movement of his would have on the war . He had a picked army to begin with7,000 regular troops , nearly 2,000 Canadians , besides a cloud of Indian warriors to reconnoitre in front and hang on his wings  --  and took every precaution and watched all the details of the movement with sleepless vigilance . He knew if he reached Albany , and the British force in New York could break through the barriers of the Highlands and join him there , a cordon of posts would be established from the St. Lawrence to New York , dividing the eastern from the middle and southern colonies ; and then the struggle would be virtually ended . He had served here in the beginning of the rebellion , and had returned home dissatisfied with the manner in which the war was carried on . He saw that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be transported from one to the other without obstruction , the English government would break down financially before we were half ready to give up the struggle . The first three orders are dated " River Bouquet , " but on the 20th of June Burgoyne set sail for Crown Point , and never did Lake Champlain witness such an imposing pageant . The number of boats requisite to carry eleven or twelve thousand men , besides horses , and cattle , and provisions , and cannon , and munitions of war , covered the water almost from shore to shore . Led by vessels of war and followed by a crowd of camp followers , men and women , the thousands of oars flashing together in the sunlight , he swept on under the summer sky , with banners streaming , and amid peals of triumphant music . From the scattered clearings that peeped out from the forest-clad shores , the farmers watched his progress with sinking hearts . Victory appeared to perch upon // his banners , and nothing seemed able to arrest his progress . Reaching Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a post and depot of supplies . For five consecutive days the orders are dated " Crown Point , " and consist entirely of directions in regard to preparations for the next movement , which is to bring him face to face with the enemy . Ticonderoga , strongly fortified and garrisoned with 3,000 men under General St. Clair , was now only one day 's sail distant , and there Washington expected the haughty expedition to be detained indefinitely , if not driven back . Burgoyne shows in the last order dated here that he had reached a critical point in his great movement . This fortress captured without severe loss or long detention , his greatest anxiety would be dispelled . Onown PoniT , June 30th , 1777 . Parole , St. DavId ; C. S. , Water . Brigadiers and brigade major as yesterday . Field officer for Piquet British , Lt.-Col. Sutherland . Field officer for Piquet German , Major Morgan . The army embarks to-morrow to approach the enemy . We are to contend for the King and Constitution of Great Britain , to vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his Majesty 's Troops , and those of the Princes His allies , will feel equal excitement . The services required of this particular expedition are Critical and Conspicuous . During our progress occasions may occur in which nor difficulty nor labor nor life are to be regarded . This army must not retreat . The general to beat at dawn of day Instead of the reveille-the assembly an hour afterwards . Then follows a long list of directions respecting the order of movement , and the precise duties of different regiments and detachments . Ticonderoga had been strengthened In every possible way , and was defended by three thousand men and more than a hundred pieces of artillery . Washington had no doubt it could be held against any force Burgoyne could bring against it , at least long enough to allow a formidable army to be collected in his front and threaten his rear so seriously that , crippled as he would be by losses and burdened with the wounded , he would not dare to cut himself off from water communication and-venture into the interior . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty armament , had no idea of making any resistance . The soldiers were burning for the fight , and as the enemy swarmed around the fort , Mr. Allen , a young patriot clergyman , mounted the platform of a gun and harangued the garrison , closing his thrilling appeal with , " God 's grace assisting me , I am determined to fight and die by your side rather than flee before our enemies ; rather than quit thie ground with infamy and disgrace , I8hoUld prefer leaving this body of mine a corpse on the ground . " Noble words from the noble young chaplain , and which , if they had been uttered and acted upon by St. Clair , would have piled that old fortress with the dead before it was yielded to the enemy . But even then the order to evacuate it had been issued , and five hours afterward the entire garrison , leaving all their stores , baggage , and artillery in the hands of the enemy , streamed southward . The news fell like a thunder clap on the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edward soon followed , and nothing but a strip of forest separated Burgoyne from the open country and unfortified highway leading to Albany . Washington was astounded , and wrote to Schuyler , " The evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence is an event of chagrin and surprise , not apprehended , nor within the compass of my reasoning . " No , nor , at least in the manner and time of it , within the scope of any man 's reasoning , except that of an imbecile martinet . St. Clair , although he thought that a strong fortress , garrisoned by three thousand men , and defended by a hundred pieces of artillery , could not be held a single day , fondly believed that the enemy 's vessels could be stopped by obstructions and a boom placed at the mouth of Wood 's Creek ; but they were not even detained , and St. Clair continued his flight south , while Bui .. goyne concentrated his army at Skeensborough , now Whitehall , and pre // pared for the long march , which he now believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success had upset his calculations , and he was compelled to halt at Skeensborough over a fortnight , in order to bring up his provisions and ammunition , and get his army well in hand for the long march before it . For the first two days his orders refer solely to these matters , and he has no time to speak of his victory ; but on the third day he issued the following order , which reveals his great exultation and confi-dence : CAIn ' AT SKUENSEOROUGH HOUSE , 10 July , 1777 . ORDERS : Parole , St. Eustace ; C. S. , Falmouth . On the 6th of July the enemy were diSlodged from Ticonderoga by the mere countenance and activity of the army , and driven on the same day beyond Skeensborough on the right , and to Huberton on the left , with the loss of all their artillery . Five of their armed vessels taken and blown up by the spirited conduct of Capt . Carter of the artillery , with a part of his brigade of gunboats , a very great quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greatest part of their baggage captured . On the 7th , Brigadier General Fraser , at the head of a little more than half the advanced corps , and without artillery , which with the utmost endeavor It was Impossible to get up , came up with near two thousand of the enemy strongly posted , attacked and defeated them with the loss on the enemy 's part of many of their principal officers , two hundred men killed on the spot , a much larger number wounded , and about two hundred made prisoners . Major General Hiedesel , with his advanced guard , consisting of the Chasseur company and grenadiers and Light Infantry , arrived In time to sustaln General Fraser , and by his judicious orders and a splendid execution of them obtained a share for himself and his troops in the glory of the action . On the 8th , Lleut. - Col . Hill , at the head of the 9th regiment , was attacked near Fort Anne by more than six times his number , and repulsed the enemy with great loss , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , Fort Anne was burnt aud abandoned , and a party of this army is In possession of the country on the other side . These rapid successes , after exciting a proper sense of gratitude to God , entitle the troops in general to the warmest praise ; and In particular distinctionis due to Brigadier General Fraser , who , by his conduct andbravery , supported by the same qualities in the officers and soldiers under his command , effected an exploit of material service to the King , and signal honor to the profession of arms . This Corps have the farther honor of having supported fatigue and bad weather , without bread and without murmur . Divine servica will be performed Sunday mornlag next , at the head of the line , and at the head of the advanced Corps , and at sunset the same day a feu de joye will be fired with cannoa and small arms , at Ticonderoga , Crown Point , the camp at Skeensborough and the camp at Castleton , and the Post of Breeman 's corps , etc . The retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the triumphant advance of the latter , emboldened the disaffected and the tories as much as they terrified and disheartened the patriots , and the British army began immediately to receive large accessions of strength . Not to discourage or impede this movement , Burgoyne issued an order on the 7th of July , in which he says : It is of the utmost prejudice to the King 's affairs to molest or terrify persons coining in to surrender . The attempt to take anything from such people , as well as every other kind of plunder , will be punished with the greatest severity . This order book shows that he delayed at Skeensborough a fortnight , and that he was hard at work to move on as rapidly as possible before the effect of his sudden victory could be dissipated . But he was forced to take to the woods now , and his army had to be stripped of all encumbrance . The sick and wounded were sent back to Ticonderoga , ammunition and provisions hurried up from the same point , the bateaux got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had obstructed by felling trees and every other means in his power , cleared up so that his army could march . This occupied the fortnight . He tells the officers , in an order issued July 12 , that they have got too much baggage , and all that is not absolutely necessary must be sent back by those bateaux that " will soon return to Ticonderoga , " and winds up with this rather strong hint : " Such gentlemen as served in America the last War may remember that the officers took up with soldiers ' tents , and often confined their baggage to a knapsack for months together . " At length , on the 21st , he issued a long order , in which he says : " The general to beat to-morrow morning instead of the re // veille , at three o'clock in the morning  --  the assembly an hour after , and the troops to march . " We have seen that Fort Anne had been abandoned and burned . It would seem from this order book that it took him four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remained three , and then started for Fort Edward , which Schuyler had abandoned , leaving artillery and baggage behind him . Burgoyne 's march to Albany threatened to be , like Sherman'smarch*thesea , a mere military promenade . He now was tempted to throw off that caution which he had hitherto exhibited . Forts Ticonderoga , Anne , and Edward were the only works he had to encounter on his route to Albany . Hereafter it must be open field fighting , and he had not the least doubt what the result of that would be with his veteran troops and splendid artillery against farmers and mechanics poorly armed and scarcely drilled at all . While encamped at Fort Edward Burgoyne took stringent measures to prevent desertion , which was now becoming frequent . In an order dated here August 6 , after directing a portion of the " piquet line " to go on the road to Fort George , where they are to work on the road laid out by the engineer , he added the following significant paragraph : " There is reason to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To give greater effect to this infornitation , he adds : " The general and faithful attachment of the soldiers of this army to the cause of the King gives no apprehension of the crime of desertion spreading ; nevertheless , to prevent the straggling from camp for the purpose of marauding and drunkenness , or other disorders leading to desertion , it is positively ordered that a report of absent men be sent to headquarters within one hour after each roll calling , in order that parties of savages may be immediately sent in pursuit , who have orders to scalp all deserters . " A few days later he issued a similar order , adding a reward for scalps . He says : " In regard to deserters themselves , all outposts and scouts , and marching parties of provincials and Indians , are promised a reward of twenty dollars for every deserter they bring in* and in case any deserters should be killed in the pursuit , their scalps are to be brought off . " Such terrific measures show that the compliment he pays to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated generally by our historians that it was while at Fort Edward Burgoyne sent off the detachment to Bennington , but this order book shows this to be erroneous . In an order dated " Fort Edward , August 13th , " he says : The army marches to-morrow morning . The general will beat at daybreak , the assembly an hour after , and the troops to march immediately , after leaving a proper number of men to load and work the bateaux and rafts . - The next order is dated " Camp Duer 's house , August 14th , 1777 , " showing that he had made a day 's march . At the latter place he designed to remain but a short time , for on the very day the battle of Benning. ton was fought he issued the following order : CAXP AT DuER 's buss , August 16th , 1777 . The army will march to-morrow from their right , and in the same manner as their last march . The last regiment that passes the bridge on the march to-morrow will leave an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of march from pressing In such numbers at a time as may endanger the bridge . . . . The general will beat at daybreak , and the quarter master and camp color men to march at the same hour . The assembly to beat an hour after . The line to be alert , and to march immediatdy . Having found the regularly organized army , under St. Clair and Schuyler , ready to run without fighting , he had no fears that the hastily gathered farmers of Vermont and Massachusetts could make any stand at Bennington against Baum and his veterans . But alas , this order was not carried out , for before daybreak a courier dashed into camp with the astounding tidings that Baum was dead , and nearly an eighth of his entire army had disappeared with him ; and so instead wa* issued the following order : // CAXP AT Duzn 's HousE , August 17th , 1777 . It was endeavored among other objects by the expedition which marched to the left , to provide such a supply of cattle as might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themagazines . That attempt having failed of success thro ' the chances of war , the troops must necessarily halt for some days for bringing forward the transports , and the several corps will employ that time to collect their sick and convalescent , and such other scattered parties as are merely on regimental duty . Yes , it did halt for several days , and he continues to date his orders from Duer 's house till September 10 , three weeks . " Collect scattered parties " - he will need to husband every resource , for the victory will rouse New England like a bugle call , and do what all the proclamations of Schuyler failed to effect-bring in the volunteers by thousands . Here three leaves of the book have been torn out , and it is impossible to conjecture what was the character of the orders they contained . They must have been important , or at least very interesting to the one who committed the depredation , orit would not have been done . They were long , for the two covered six pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repeated at Saratoga-that the farmers and untrained colonists were very different soldiers under a daring leader than when under a martinet . As the motley crowd , with their old flint-locks , and with only here and there a bayonet , gathered on the morning of August 16 around Stark , he said , pointing to the enemy in full view , " Men , there are the red-coats . Before night they are ours , or Molly Stark is a widow . " They answered with a loud cheer , and without artillery to support their assault , they charged up to the very muzzles of the guns and over them , and over the breastworks . The clergyman that was so disgusted with St. Clair at Ticonderoga that he left his army and wanted him shot was one of the first over the ramparts , his clerical gown streaming behind him . This , the first blow that Burgoyne had received , was a staggering one , and from which he never fully rallied . In the first place , it weakened him terribly ; in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , and sending in recruits from every section . It will be seen by the order above quoted , that the object of this expedition was only in part to obtain cattle , that he might not be delayed in his march . Our historians in general accept it as the chief motive , while Bancroft gives us another-that he wished to make a diversion in favor of St. Leger . How a movement east could make a diyersion in favor of St. Leger around Fort Schuyler , two hundred miles west , where Rome now stands , will puzzle a military man to discover . Provisions , of course , were very necessary , but the real object was to strike a blow that would paralyze New England , leave her whole western border open to the enemy , and keep back recruits from the American army . Baum 's objective point was Albany , where Burgoyne proposed to meet him . Had Baum succeeded , Gates , who about this time superseded Schuyler in command , would never have advanced to Saratoga , but fallen back on Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an event Burgoyne would not have needed the provisions , for , as it is seen , he had already given the order to march without waiting for them to come up . After this terrible blow he was compelled to halt , and then of course the bringing up of more provisions became necessary . Burgoyne 's best generals endeavored to dissuade him from this enterprise ; but if successful , it promised such glorious results that he determined to risk it . It is well known that Baum , the leader of the expedition , was killed , and Breyman , who had been sent to his relief at the request of the former , arrived too late to render the required assistance . After a delay of ten days we find Burgoyne issuing the following order : CAMP AT Dvxn 's Housa , August 26th , 177 ' ? . The Lieutenant General having the report from Lleut. - C*ol . Breyman relative to the affairs or // Saintwich Mills , and also having obtained every collateral information possible , thinks it justice to declare publicly that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers or troops in the action ; that on the contrary the officers who commanded the different corps acted with intrepidity . The failure of the enterprise seems in the first place to have been owing to the credulity of those who managed the department of intelligence , and suffered numbers of the rebel soldiers to pass and repass , and perhaps count the numbers of the detachment , and upon ill confidences induced Colonel Baum to advance too far to have a secure retreat . The next cause was the slow movement of Lient-Col . Breyman 's corps , which from bad weather , bad roads , tired horses , and other impediments stated by Lient. - Col . Breyman , could not reach twenty-four miles from eight in the morning of the 15th till four in the afternoon of the 16th  --  the succour , therefore , arrived too late . The failure of ammunition , in the management of which there appears to have been imprudence , was another misfortune . The rest seems common accident of War . Upon the whole , the enemy have severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect the army with further regret or melancholy than that which arises from the loss of some gallant men ; but let the affair at the mill of Salutwich remain hereafter as a lesson against the imposition o ! a treacherous Enemy , many of whom in the very hour of swearing allegiance to the King fought against his trflops , and agsinst expending ammunition too fast , by which conquering troops were obliged to retire , and with loss . The reflection upon this affair will , moreover , excite alertness and exertion in every corps marching for the support of another , showing in whatever degree these qualities may be possessed by the commanding officer ( and they are not doubted in the present instance ) , yet , unless they are general , common accidents may become fatal , and the loss of two hours may decide the turn of an enterprise , and it might happen in some cases , the fate of a campaign . Perhaps , as it was necessary , in order to keep this defeat from having a de. - moralizing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have crowded more misstatement and misrepresentation into a shorter order . Still , it required a good deal of effrontery and an elastic conscience to say that " the enemy 8everely felt their little 8UCC*58 "  - -  a success so small that it stripped him of one eighth of his army , and set New England in a blaze of enthusiasm . But this first disastrous blow was to be followed up by another , till the final fatal one came in the last battle at Saratoga . Four days after this defeat , an Indian runner bounded into camp with the startling news that St. Leger had abandoned the siege of Fort Schuyler , and had returned with his forcu to Canada . B4rgoyne 's campaign embraced two movements besides his own-that of Clinton up the Hudson and that of St. Leger down the Mohawk . While Burgoyne moved up Lake Champlain , St. Leger was to go up the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario to Oswego , and then down to Fort Schuyler , where Rome now stands , and , having forced it to surrender , move down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , in the first place , would let loose all the Indians in central New York , keep back all recruiting in the valley , and finally add materially to the strength of the invading army . Gansevoort , who commanded here , like Stark , was a different man from St. Clair or Gates . When the messenger from St. Leger came to demand the surrender of the fort , he quietly said to him , " When you get out of it turn round and look at it , but never expect to enter it again except as a prisoner . " When the news reached Burgoyne the Indians began to desert him . In the mean time Ticonderoga was attacked and well nigh taken , and the patriots threatened to close the path of retreat behind him . He began to be troubled . Halting one day 's march from the fort which was to be his last base of operations , he now looked anxiously forward over the more than fifty miles of open country that lay between him and Albany . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move rapidly forward . He had to stop , with his right and left arm both cut off , and see the whole country rising around him . As he waited and watched he saw the sky gathering black as midnight above him , while it thundered all round the heavens . Provisions were getting scarce , and on the last of August he issued the following order : The strict economy in the delivery and receipt of provisions , at all times are essential duties , now become an object of the most important consequence . The fate of the campaign may depend upon it , and the preservation of the live cattle requires the most particular attention . They are // only to be *Aaughtered for the sick , and in such cases as absolutely require it . The commanding officers of regiments will therefore send in an account upon honor of the fresh provisions requisite for the sick , to the Commissary of the day , before the general Issue of provisions to the army , and be responsible that a proper reduction of rations be made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the 10th of September show that he is slowly gathering together his resources preparatory to his final start for Albany . The scarcity of provisions evidently causes him great anxiety . At last nothing more can be done , and on the 10th of September the roll of drums is heard along the line , and the steady columns move off followed by more than forty brass guns , then the most perfect ordnance of the kind in the world . The next day 's order is dated " Batten Hill . " Here he encamped for one day , and the long order he issued is occupied entirely with the subject of provisions . The next day he reached Saratoga , in front of Gates . After the victories of Bennington and Fort Schuyler , the country had so promptly responded to the call for men , that Gates found himself with an army fully equal in numbers to that of Burgoyne , and had moved up from near Albany to this point , where the valley between the hills ana river was narrow and the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following order , issued the day before the first battle , would show a very extraordinary state of things in the British army . One would think that it was in a starving condition if such loss as is stated was sustained through men foraging for themselves : CAMP AT SWORD 'S Housa , 18th September , 1777 . To the great reproach of discipline , and of the common sense of the soldiers who have been made priaoners , the service has sustained a loss within ten days that might in action have cost the lives of some hundreds of the enemy . The Lieut General will no longer bear to lose men for the pitiful consideration of potatoes and forage . The life of the soldier is the property of the King , and since neither friendly admonition nor corporal punishments have effect , after what has happened , the army is now to be informed , and it is not doubted the commanding officer will do it solemnly , that the first soldier caught beyond the advanced centries of the army will be instantly hanged . This order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , and evinces a desperate sort of spirit , that the loss of a few men captured in the act of foraging would hardly seem to justify . The fact is , these men taken prisoners while foraging designed to be captured . It was a safer form of desertion , and Burgoyne knew it , and by making strolling away for any purpose beyond the sentries a crime to be punished like desertion , he hoped to put a stop to it . The frequency of desertions alarmed him . Even the Indians were leaving him-a hundred and fifty having taken their departure in one day . The next day after this order was issued the battle was fought , and with Arnold 's division alone  --  the right division , under Gates , resting on the river , not being engaged at all . Arnold fought his division with that skill and desperation that always characterized him . Three times did the British grenadiers advance with their bayonets to clear a wood in which the Americans stood , and each time they were not only driven back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shouting pursuers to the mouths of their cannon , and hurled beyond them . But there not being over three bayonets to every ten muskets , the Americans could not hold the guns against the bayonet charges that were made upon them . Darkness put an end to the combat . The British slept on the field of battle and the Americans retired behind their works , Burgoyne was astonished at the steadiness and daring of these raw troops . It is known that Gates never reported this battle to Washington at all , nor in the report to Congress mentioned the name of Arnold . An angry correspondence followed , which ended in Arnold 's division being given to Lincoln , and he left without command . Bancroft , in describing this battle , makes this astonishing assertion : " There were three British major generals on the field and not one American // major general , " and adds , " Arnold was not on the field . " That Gates was not on the field in either battle is well known , and it was the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most overwhelming testimony would justify any historian , especially an American , in fixing such a disgrace on the patriot army as to declare that in a battle on which such tremendous issues hungboth its major generals were sitting quietly in camp while the enemy had three in the field . Yet the only evidence Mr. Bancroft offers is a quotation in a foot note from Wilkinson 's memoirs , and the statement that Gordon was told the same thing by somebody . Probably this somebody was Wilkinson himself . Therefore this grave charge of misconduct on the part of Arnold rests solely on Wilkinson 's assertion . Now in the first place Wilkinson was not on the field at all , but in the camp of Gates , and must have based his allegation on a mere rumor . But Wilkinson was known to be a bitter enemy of Arnold , a great favorite and toady of Gates . That he should endeavor to shield his patron from public censure for not being on the field in either engagement by endeavoring to include Arnold in the same condemnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard historian to attempt to make that single assertion true history is wholly unjustifiable . Arnold 's after treason and Mr. Bancroft 's feelings have nothing to do with the facts connected with this battle . Now to prove that this language is not too emphatic , we will show a portion of the evidence Mr. Bancroft had in his possession , against which he assumes to place the assertion of one man , and he an enemy , and not on the battlefield at all . First , there is the universal belief of the army and the people , which has become traditionary . If Arnold had been guilty of such indifference , the country would have rung with it after his treason . But this charge was never made aguinst him . *econd , Arnold 's well-known fighting character proves it to be false . He could not be kept out of a fight , whether he was asked to take a part in it or not . Like a war horse , he snuffed the battle from afar , while a more fearless man and a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle in which he was engaged that he was not found in the very vortex of it , and no one will believe , without stronger evidence than the assertion of an enemy , that here , in one of the most important battles of the Revolution , borne entirely by his own division , and in which his military reputation was at stake , he sat safely at a distance and let his subordinates manage it as they liked . The supposition is absurd . But the direst testimony is over . whelming . Botta says : " Arnold exhibited on this occasion all the impetuosity of his courage ; he encouraged his men by his voice and example . " Stedman , in his " History of the American War , " says : " The enemy were led to the battle by General Arnold , who distinguished himself in an extraordinary manner . " McFarland , in his " Pictorial History of England , " says the troops , " led on by Arnold , fell upon Burgoyne and the right wing . " Colonel Varick , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , says : " He ( Gates ) seems to be piqued that Arnold 's divisionhad the honor of beating the enemy on the 19th , " and that " he never intended to fight Burgoyne till Arnold urged , begged , and entreated him to do it " ; and yet after all he never went on the field , according to Mr. Bancroft . Lastly , this same officer wrote a month later from Albany : " During Burgoyne 's stay here he gave Arnold great credit for his bravery and military abilities , eepecicdty in the action of the 19th , and once in the presence of Gates . " We might go on and quote ad infinitum ; and yet in the face of all this strong direct evidence Mr. Bancroft , on the single statement of one man , and he an enemy of Arnold , and an unknown informant , de // dares Arnold was not on the battlefield at all . We protest against such a falsification of history , just because he detests Arnold 's character . The only order of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S hOUSE , L QN THE FIELD OP BATTLE . ) Parole , St. Eustatia ; C. S. , Holland . The next day Burgoyne compliments the troops on their good conduct , mentioning the officers who most distinguished themselves by name . At its close he makes the following announcement : " One hundred and twenty men of tried bravery and fidelityfrom the provincial Corps of Jessops , Peters , McAlpine , and McKay are to be incorporated , for the services of the campaign only , in the six British regb ments , in the proportion of twenty to each regiment , " etc . These men were noted marksmen , selected for the sole purpose of picking off officers in battle . Of course it would not do for a commanding general to order this publicly , and yet one can hardly blame him for having it done , for he saw the terrible effect of the practice on our side in the recent battle . The vast body of Gates 's army were undisciplined soldiers-knew nothing of mamnuvres , and had no bayonets . In the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " their own hook , " as they said , and being expert marksmen who could pick off a squirrel at sixty yards , climbed into the trees , and singling out the officers , fired with fatal accuracy . Burgoyne ascertained this fact , and well nigh at the cost of his life . Not only were several officers picked off thus in detail , but a number of bullets were evidently aimed at himone nearly accomplishing its mission . Just as an aid of General Phillips was handing him a paper , he fell from his horse , struck by a bullet designed for Burgoyne . It is true that this is not considered a legitimate mode of warfare , but it must be remembered that our men were not soldiers , but farmers and frontiersmen , who had been 39 taught not to waste ammunition , nor fire till they got good aim . These fought in the only way they knew how . It was so in the war of 1812 , both on land and sea . The fatality among the officers from the accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length they would not wear their uniforms in action . In the next battle the gallant Fraser fell a victim to this doubtful practice . Arnold saw that he was the rock of that tumultuous battlefield , and , dashing up to Morgan , bade him not let him see that officer long in the saddle . The latter , selecting a few of his keenest riflemen , pointed to him and said , " That gallant officer is General Fraser . I admire him , but it is necessary he should die . Do your duty . " The first bullet cut the crupper of his horse , the second pierced the mane , the third the gallant rider himself , and he fell from the saddle mortally wounded . We stated in the commencement of this article that the work referred to embraced some errors in statistics . For instance , the writer says , in giving the number of the different classes of troops composing the army , that there were five hundred Indians and one hundred and 8arty provincials . Whatever znay have been the source from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of it that it could not be correct . It is well known that Burgoyne could not be spared the number of regular troops he asked for , and strove to swell his army by every means in his power , and it is incredible that he could gather together five hundred Indians and only one hundred and sixty provincials-the disparity is absurd . This order , which we have quoted , however , settles the matter . Burgoyne directs that out of the " five provincial corps " " a hundred and twenty men of tried bravery and fidelity " be selected and incorporated into regular regiments . That is , if our author be correct , he ordered a hundred and twenty brave and true men to be winnowed out of a hundred and siaCy , or twenty.four men carefully // selected out of each corps , containing the astonishing number of thirty-two . Besides there is pasted at the end of this order book , evidently in Clinton 's hand-writing , the number of prisoners of every kind taken , and it is stated that 1,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final battle the orders contain nothing of interest . Burgoyne was now in a painful ' dilemma . He could hear neither from Carle* ton in Canada nor Clinton , who was to force the passage of the Hudson and join him at Albany . It was plainly from a certain point of view his wisest course to stop where he was and fortify till he did hear ; for if Clinton reached Albany , and began with his force to operate in the rear of Gates , the latter would fall back and leave his enemy an open road . Whereas if Clinton did not succeed , and Burgoyne should reach Albany , he would . be worse off than bef6re . He could not remain there , and he could not go on . His only course would be to retreat . But if that was to be the result of the campaign , he had better retreat now . But he could get no orders to retreat from Canada , and nothing from New York to justify him in such a course , while every day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for age becoming more difficult , and his communications behind steadily and surely closing . One can not but feel pity for him as he thus stands at bay , and looks gloomily around him . At last he determined to advance , and force his way through the American army and reach Albany , and then if failure came it would not rest on his shoulders . In his last order the day before the final battle , after directing the issue of provisions , he Bays , " His Excellency the Lieut . General is pleased to make a present of twelve barrels of rum to the troops to be distributed as follows . " The proportion to each division to the officers is then given . We shall not attempt to describe the battle of the next day . Arnold was its controlling spirit . While Gates , suffering , it is said , from a previous night 's debauch , was engaged in angry discussion with a wounded British officer , lying on his bed , and on which he soon after died , Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed lip , listening to the deepening uproar of battle in the fields and roads in advance of him . As the explosions grew louder and fiercer he could no longer control himself , and calling for his horse , he leaped into the saddle , and , driving the rowels home , dashed like a thunderbolt into the thickest of the fight . Having always been second in con*-mand , and Gates not being on the field , he was now recognized as first , and took supreme control . Gates , being told of his departure , sent Major Armstrong after him . Arnold saw him coming , and evaded him . Placing himself at the head of the gallant Lamed 's brigade , belonging to his own division , and which received him with a shout that rang over the roar of battle , he led them full on the British centre-himself riding all steadily at their head-waving his sword aloft and delivering his orders in person , with words that frenzied the men . The sturdy Hessians withstood the ' first charge , but when Arnold came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrified and panic-stricken at the fury of the onset , they fled in dismay . Arnold now infused his spirit into the whole line , and they closed in sternly with the foe . Morgan felt that the army had now a leader , and nobly seconded all his efforts . Armstrong followed Arnold for half an hour , striving in vain to deliver the order of Gates . But whenever the former saw him approach , he spurred where the volleys were the heaviest , and once , it is said , to avoid him , he wheeled in front and galloped the whole length of the line , taking the cross fire as he sped on , escaping being hit almost by a miracle . The first British line now began to shake , and Burgoyne , hurrying on to the field , moved up his right wing to // Bupp2rt it , when Arnold hurled three regiments on it with such terrible impetuosity that they also recoiled , and soon the whole line gave way and fled behind the intrenchments . Nothing could now stop the excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front like the very god of war , waving his sword aloft and shouting his orders on every side , advanced straight up to the intrenebments , and without a single piece of artillery met unflinchingly a storm of grape shot poured into their very faces , and tried to force their way through the abatis . Galloping to the head of a part of the brigades of Patterson and Glover , he moved on the works where the Earl of Balcarras was posted with the light infantry . Driving the enemy from their defences , he struggled desperately to make an opening through which he could force his way inside the works . Foiled in this , he turned swiftly to the right flank of the enemy , and met Lamed 's brigade moving steadily against another portion of the works defended by Colonel Breyman . The latter was flanked by two redoubts . Putting himself at the head of the brigade , he ordered Colonel Brooks to assault one of the redoubts , while he led the attack straight on the front . The onset was furious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general assault along the line , while he , gathering a few gallant men around him and shouting to them to follow him , dashed on the German works , and broke with a clatter and a crash into the very sallyport , where horse and rider sunk to the earth , the former killed , the latter crushed beneath him with his leg shattered . His brave followers pulled him from beneath his steed , and bore him back . Here Armstrong at last overtook him with the order to return to camp lest he might " do some rash thing . " He had done a rash thing . He had led on American militiamen as they had never been led on before , and won what the British author Cressy declared to be one of the " fifteen dtxisive battle. , of the world . " Arnold was storming through the fight , and by his very bearing carrying dismay into the enemy 's ranks , while he who issued this order for his return was quietly sitting in his camp . He had made thorough provison for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams attached , stretched for miles back in the country . Night closed the battle , and as the shouts of victory from the troops returning to camp rung out on the night air , they were taken up by the teamsters and carried on till lost in the distance . This battle was fought so skilfully and desperately by Arnold as to extort praise from Burgoyne and the English officers . The country rang with laudations of him . His great services were never forgotten or underrated even after his treason . The reply of an American officer to an English one , a prisoner of war , who asked what the Americans would do with Arnold if they caught him , expressed the general feeling . " Do ? " said he . " Why , they would cut off the leg wounded at Saratoga and bury it with military honors , and hang the rest of him on a gibbet . " But Bancroft , who seems to think that facts must be made to correspond to his own feelings , insists , right in the teeth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does not mention his name till the British are in full retreat , and then introduces him in the following extraordinary language : " The army pursued with fury , and , unwisely led on by Arnold , who ' had ridden on the field as an unattended volunteer , without orders , without any command , without a staff , and beside himself , yet carrying some authority as the highest officer present in the action , they made an onset on the British line , and despite an abatis and other obstructions , despite musketry fire and grapeshot , continued it for more than an hour , though in vain . " And again , " Arnold , who had joined a group in the last assault , lost his horse , and was himself wounded within the works " One would search in vain among the annals of his country to find a sadder mutila // tion or more complete falsification of history than this . In saying that Arnold was not on the field in the first battle Bancroft goes against the accredited historians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon ; but here he has nothing whatever to back him . His language at the commencement of the quotation we have made is ambiguous , so that he could say that he did not assert that Arnold was not on the field till the enemy was In retreat , but that is the impression he intends to convey , and does convey . The statement put in a few words amounts to this : Arnold rode on the field without orders , and out of his head , and putting himself in command of the pursuing army , led them unwisely on , and held them to a desolating fire for more than an hour , without any benefit , and at a great sacrifice of life . In short , Arnold , instead of winning the battle by his skilful and daring leadership , not only broke all orders , but was guilty of a great military blunder , and did nothing but sacrifice the lives of the soldiers " in vain . " This he states , with the following language of Sparks before him , than whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a curious fact that an officer who really had not command in the army was the leader in one of the most important battles of the Revolution . " A man 's subsequent conduct may justify one in denouncing his former professions of patriotism , but it can not change facts ; nor can our feelings toward an infamous character allow us to distort history . It is incomprehensible how after thus showing up Arnold 's madness and blunders he should on the next page write , " In his report of the action Gates named Arnold with Morgan and Dearborn , and Congress paid a tribute to Arnold 's courage by giving him the rank which he had claimed . " That is , we are to believe that Gates placed his bitter enemy , who had assumed a command of which he had been deprived , dodged the aid sent to recall him , and used that command " unwisely " and sacri ficed the troops " in vain , " onapar with Morgan and Dearborn . If Mr. Bancroft 's account is true , Gates should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ask the question , Why did Gates thus heap honor on him whom he really wished to disgrace ? But the reason given for Congress conferring on him the long withheld rank , is perhaps the most remarkable part of this remarkable historic page . It was a " tribute to Arnold 's courage . " It was not a " tribute " to his great leadership  --  a reward for the victory he had done so much to achieve  --  but to his " courage , " and that not a courage well directed , and that brought about great results , but one born of frenzy , " unwisely " exhibited and expended " in vain . " Congress did some foolish things , but nothing so absurd as this . Bancroft 's account and this fact can not be reconciled . Arnold was rewarded for the great service he rendered , not for his courage that only blundered . It is strange that Mr. Bancroft could not see that Arnold 's conduct was the highest breach of military rules that could be committed , and nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle saved him from the most condign punishment . Instead of that he was crowned with honor . All this violation of orders and of military rules was not only overlooked , but rewarded , simply because he showed " pluck , " if we are to believe Mr. Bancroft , as if " courage " was such a rare thing in him or the army ! For more than a week now the order book is without interest , until Burgoyne at last asked for a cessation of hostilities . He could see but one way of escape , and that was to retreat to Fort Edward , his last base , some twenty or thirty miles distant . But he was like a scorpion girt with fire ; his camp was uncovered and cannon balls rained into it on every side , crashing through the rooms in which he held his councils or took his meals . If he had only known of Clinton 's success // on the Hudson , and th atinafew days he could be at Albany , he probably would have made an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endeavored to keep at bay the patriot army till the news of Clinton 's arrival at Albany should compel Gates to face about . The afternoon that Burgoyne was distributing rum to his troops to prepare them for the next day 's fight , Clinton was chasing the garrisons of Forts Montgomery and Clinton with great slaughter down the steep banks of the river ; and on the morning that the former was preparing for the decisive battle , the latter was removing the last obstructions in the channel that had cost the Government a quarter of a million of dollars , and was turning the prows of his vessels northward . Having heard of the unsuccessful termination of the first day 's battle in September , he felt it to be of the utmost importance that Burgoyne should know as speedily as possible of his success and readiness to cooperate with him , and immediately despatched a courier with the news . But fate , that seemed to be against Burgoyne from the first , even in the successes that led him to acts of rashness , was against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , suspecting that he might be a spy , brought him into camp . When they began to search him he took something from his pocket and swallowed it quickly . A surgeon was called , who immediately administered a powerful emetic . He threw up a silver bullet which was discovered to consist of two sections . Unscrewing it , the following was found inside : staid behind his works until Gates received the astounding news that Clinton was in his rear . Burgoyne did not hcar of it until after the terms of capitulation were substantially agreed on , and even then he endeavored to postpone signing them . But Gates had also heard the news , and declared that if they were not signed at once he would open his batteries on the uncovered camp . All the correspondence in full is given in this order book . In reply to Burgoyne 's requast to know what terms Gates would grant , the latter said capitulation of the army , for " their camp was invested and their retreat cut off . " To this Burgoyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army will never admit their retreat is cut off while they have arms in their hands . " He had very little objection to make to the other seven articles submitted to him except the sixth , which was as follows : " These terms being agreed to and signed , the troops under his Excellency General Burgoyne 's command may be drawn up in their encampments , where they will be ordered to ground their arms , " etc . At this the latterfired up , and wrote , " This article is inadmissible in any extremity ; sooner than this army will consent to ground their arms in their encampment , they will rush on the enemy determined to take no quarter . " At sunset that day Major Kingston met the Adjutant-General of Gates with the corrections to the preliminary articles as drawn up by the latter , and said , " If General Gates does not mean to recede from the sixth article , the treaty ends at once . The army will to a man ' proceed to any act of desperation rather than submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after various changes the articles H. CLINTON . of agreement were agreed upon by both parties . It was a terrible humiliation to Burgoyne , and he tried in every way to lessen its force . Some of these attempts seem childish , as the following letter found in this order FOnT Momrreoxnmr , October 8th , 1777. lVous voici . Nothing between us now but Gates . I hope this little affair will facilitate yoar operations , etc . The man was hung at Kingston .
