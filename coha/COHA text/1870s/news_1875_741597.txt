txt This has been what is usually called a dull day , so far as legislative matters are concerned , the day being entirely devoted to the consideration of bills in committee of the whole . ' It is true the measures under discussion were of no little public interest , the bills considered in the House being the amendments to the military code , as recommended by the State Military Association and the Adjutant General , and the Supply bill for the present year . In the Senate the greater portion of the time was devoted to a consideration of the act in relation to County Treasurers . In the Assembly . Gen. Misted , of Westchester , had charge of the National Guard bill , which was completed and recommended for passage . The leading features of amendment are the reduction of the term of service from seven to five years ; also grantaug to enlisted men and officers accused of offenses triable by courts martial the right to appear with and be defended by counsel , and requiring that in the City of New-York the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such armories and . drill-rooms as may be necessary for the uses of the First Division . Section 253 of the code contains amendments which may , unless the powers thereby conferred on division commanders are exercised with great caution , exert a ruinous tendency on the organization and morale of the National Guard . It provides that a division commandant may " for sufficient reason , in his discretion . grant discharges to enlisted men in his division at any time on the recommendation of the commandant of the troop , battery , or company , with the approval of the commandant of the regiment or battalion , and of the brigade , " to which the applicant for discharge may belong . At the close of the consideration of the military code amendments , the Supply bill was taken up , but no important action was had on it up to the hour when recess was taken . THE ceeTem , itteu WAR . There are no material developments in relation to the canal question , beyond an evident desire on the part of the a Ring " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor and the anti-ring party in general . They are already on the qui rive , demanding investigations , and it is becoming a very serious question whether they will not , ere many days take the lead in the great reform movement and try to overslaugh the Governor and to out-Herod Herod . in unveiling the mismanagement of the canal contract system . They will use all their influence , indeed , to the end of anticipating by such action the developments which might otherwise be brought out by their opponents . The ? neat effort on their part will be to show that there has been nothing perpetrated in the nature of fraud . though there may have been extrayasnant expenditures in some cases . They assert in the most explicit terms that there is law to justify every condition embodied in and all the action taken under the contracts which have been made public , and that in addition thereto the law authorizing the alterations in quantities , and requiring contractors to perform the increased work and to supply the increased material demanded , has received the sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain these assertions remains to be seen , but they speak in very confident tones on the subject . POLITICAL VENGEANCE LS " WAIT . It is also understood that the " Ring " party means , before the present difficulty is adjusted , to make it disagreeable for at least one and perhaps more of the parties who have made themselves prominent in this matter , and that among others they mean , as they themselves express it , to " Nail Davis ' hide on the fence to dry . " In this connection they will endeavor , if possible , to resuscitate the details of his position on and connection with the Dorn impeachment fizzle of 1S68 , when all of Davis ' charges were proved to be unfounded , and he came out with many doubts expressed under oath as to his own credibility . There is a still later case also in which Mr. Davis figures which is entertaining , as showing that it makes a , difference whose ex is being gored . The records of the Canal Department show that a contract was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of work contracted for was $6,000 . The figures show that on this same contract , by alteration of quantities , $36 , - 000 was paid to SherrelL A few weeks ago , when the Canal Board was making appointments , this George Sherrell was urged for the position of Superintendent of a division of the canals , his prominent and ardent backer being Mr. Basis , the crusading member from Washington County . The then incumbent of the superintendency was one Conrey , and upon the request of Davis the Canal Board delayed action on this appointment so as to permit Mr. Davis to put in proofs adverse to Mr. Courey 's fitness or faithfulness for the place . The board gave Mr. Davis a bearing , and at its close by a unanimous vote held that the charges were groundless , or at least not : sustained , and then re-appointed Mr. Conrey . So Mr. Davis ' $36,000 contractor was not made Superintendent , and , as in the Dorn case , the gentleman from Washington tailed to make his charges good . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times larger than the estimate , while the other contracts which have attracted so much attention were in no case more than quintupled , and , in most instances , only quadrupled . The only point of such an illustration as this is to show that canal influences appear to have a demoralizing effect on what might el herwise be shown tx be very healthy moral natures , and that it is difficult sometimes to tell who is not bedaubed when mud is flying about . 31ISCELLANCOES ASSEMBLY eusnenss . Members of the House to-day displayed an extraordinary interest in other matters than Assembly business , and at one time there were no less than ten Assemblymen in the hail of the Court of Appeals listening to the argument in the Tweed case , and seven in the Senate Chamber giving their attention to Senator Lord 's canal investigating resolution . The miscellaneous transactions of the House were very meagre . The Speaker presented a communication from aireed , Parsons dtCo. , public printers , setting forth that they had not received , and were unable to obtain , a larnOPortioll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly of 1874 in relation to . the abases in the Streetcleaning Bureau of New-York City . It will be remembered that last Winter , after the committee had given in their report , the New-York Board of Aldermen applied for the copy of the testimony taken in order to proceed against Commissioner Oliver Charlick and others who were then distasteful to Tammany Hall , and against whom some damaging evidence was adduoed by the committee . Pending the application , a large part of the written testimony disappeared and has not been since recovered . On motion of Mr. Alvord , of Onondaga , the Cleric of the Assembly was instructed to inquire into the subject and report to the House . SHALL MRS . TILTON TESTIFY I Mr. Petty , of Suffolk , will introduce a bit to-morrow which has been drawn avowedly with a view to enable Mrs. Tilton to testify in the suit of Theodore Tilton vs . Henry Ward Beecher . The bill in question amends the act of 1867 by providing that in any trial or inquiry in any suit , action , or proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law or consent of parties authority to examine witnesses or hear evidence , the husband or wife of any party thereto , or of any person in whose behalf any such suit , action , or proceeding is brought , prosecuted , opposed , or defended . is made competent and . compellable to give evidence the same as any other witness , on behalf of any party to such suit , action , or proceeding , except that the husband or wife shall not be compellable , but , competent , to disclose any confidential communication made by one to the other during their marriage . JARVIS LORD AS A CANAL INVESTIGATOR . The President of the Senate had hardly announced that " motions and resolutions were in order , " this morning , before Senator Jarvis Lord  --  alled up his resolution providing for the appointment of a special committee to investigate the Charges of fraud in canal management which were made by the Governor in his special Message . The discussion which followed was neither very long nor very interesting . Senator Lowery took again the position assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hoped the consideration of this resolution would be postponed until after the consideration of the Message , for he was unable to see what the Senate could consider tomorrow morning after the passage of this resolution . He favored the passage of the resolutions at an appropriate time , but that time would not be until after the discussion which had been fixed for to-morrow , and consequently , in his opinion , the appointment of such a committee at this time was premature . Senator Woodin dissented from this view . He thought it very important to pass these resolutions , because aertain officers had been accused of crimes which might result in impeachment , and he thought this committee ought to be appointed with the sole view of finding out what persons were guilty of these frauds , and then taking action wisely and well . Ho saw no difficulty in appointing this committee before the discussion of to-morrow , because what was then to be discussed was the system under which it was possible to perpetuate such outrages , without any reference to the truth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more information was needed . than - wee contained in the Message itself . Hp considered the motion a proper one , because what n as needed was not a hasty and inconsiderate investigation , but a real one , and a thorough one , and one that should disclose all the facts , and as it was exceedingly unlilrely that any Senator would personally make this investigation . it must be done by a committee . Senator Jacobs took the ground held by Senator Lowery. but for a different reason . He thought the - people of this State desired a discussion of the matter as it bad been presented by the Governor ; but the effect of the passage of this resolution would be to stifle discussion . He instanced . the investigatiena now being made into the affairs of the Capitol Commissioners , and . into the altering of last year 's Supply bill , upon which subjects he said decency required that the mouth should be kept closed , however great may be the desire to speak . A similar result , he thought , would follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently if the Senate desired to escape the imputation of desiring silence on the subject , the proper time for the passage of these resolutions was after and . not before the discussion which hadbeen set down for to-morrow mornmg . Senator Woodin thereupon remarked that Senator Jacobs had pledged himself to bring on that discussion to-morrow morning , and if the passage of these resolutions would deter him from doing so he would change his position with regard to them . Senator Jacobs then moved to lay the resolutions on the table , and the subject was quietly dropped . A few moments later Senator Lord . offered the following resolutions : Whereas , The Governor , in his special Message of March IS , states that ho is satisfied from information he has received that lock walls upon the canals have been built in an unfaithful way , and not in compliance with the contracts ; and , Whereas , Snch charges demand an immediate investigation ; therefore , Resolved , That the State Engineer and Surveyor be and he hereby is required forthwith to examine personally the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which such stone were taken , for the construction of the locks now being bulb , and that have been built within the last three years , the description of the dressing of steel stone , and the manner and quantity or such work , and whether it is done according to the contracts , and if not , in what respects , and whether done at prices for the interest of the State . The adoption of the above resolution without debate was the last shape in which the canal question carne before the Senate to-day . The precise portion of the Governor 's Message to which reference is made in the above-printed resolution is as follows : " I have deemed it my duty to look beyond the practice in the letting of contraets , end to see if the materials have beau delivered and the work has been done far which so many millions ' has been spent by the State , and also to learn if the lock walls mot other structures have been built in a faithful way and in compliance with the contracts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation of these subjects . "
