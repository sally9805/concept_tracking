txt The important reports which we published a few days since from the Joint Committee of Citizens , Supervisors and Aldermen , met with but a poor reception from that portion of the City Press which has blown hot and cold in this struggle . The Herald gave them the cold shoulder , as " logarithmic tables " and useless columns of figures ; the Tribune printed them in an exceedingly condensed. not to say unsatisfactory form ; and the smaller and larger journals in Tammany 's pay , simply described the reports as so many bids for office and notoriety . The real facts , however , in regard to the labors of this Committee , are well known to the businesss community , and hardly need further explanation ; yetl , efore the smoke of this great conflict clears away , it is desirable that they should be stated as matter for history . The reproach against the City of New York has always been , that her " best citizens " could not be induced to throw themselves into municipal public life . There came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which it seemed as if the whole structure of the City Government would fall to pleas , and this great Metropolis would be bankrupt both in character and funds . The wildest suspicions were afloat as to the losses of the City Treasury , the robberies which it had suffered , and the obligations it was still under . No one knew the depth of our disaster in a pecuniary view . The accounts of the Treasury were so 6:implicated with " City and County " expenditures , with " adjusted claims , " with taxes spent before they were collected , and innumerable classes of " bonds , " that no ordinary mortal could make anything of the confused statements of the Controller and Mayor . What had really been stolen , what was bona fide debt , what were merely temporary notes , what the City had of money , and what it was likely to have , no one could make out . The publication of the vouchers and payments . made in these columns , showed , indeed , astonishing frauds and a vast system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one could say . The Aldermen and Supervisors , under the tremendous pressure of public opinion , thought it safer to have the administration which had so long been pouring its stolen wealth into their pockets examined by a Committee composed of that class who , experience had taught them , could usually be depended upon for neglecting public and disagreeable work . They accordingly selected a committee of fifteen gentlemen , ; bankers , merchants and railroad Presidents , financiers and millionaires , who , they probably hoped , would speedily whitewash the Treasury and retire to the care of their large private interests ? as did the celebrated MOSES TAYLOR and MARSHAL 0 . ROBERTS Committee of last year . It happened , however , that chance or Providence led them to put on the Committee a gentleman , subsequently elected Chairman , of rare devotion to public interests , of admirable organizing faculty , and of that kind of conscientiousness which leads a man to probe a disagreeable matter to the bottom , when once he does put his hand to it . Under Mr. WILLIAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thoroughly organized , and made as complete and exhaustive as the circumstances would allow . Among the other members were such gentlemen as Mr. ROYAL PHELPS , Mr. OSBORNE , Mr. 3 . J. DONALDSON , Mr. R. L. Currnso and Mr. T. T. PEARSALL . These all threw into the investigation the energy and organizing power which they have shown so long in private affairs . Their labors were enormous . Each Subcommittee took a different branch of the City expenditures . One , the new Court-house and the expenditures lavished upon it ; one , the payrolls and salaries ; one the Finance Depart- ment ; one the payments f6radvertising and printing , and another , the City debts and accounts . Witnesses in great number were examined . and the testimony of experts taken as to the real value of the work paid for . Over one hundred ' accounts were examined , aggregating a value of two hundred million dollars . Six weeks were spent by these gentlemen in these thorough and disagreeable investigations . The Aldermen and Supervisors soon proved to be mere figure-heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by refusing to send for witnesses and papers . The results , however , which were obtained , formed a remarkable proof of what can be done by this class of citizens when they fairly take hold of a public matter . No citizen now , of whatever political creed , has any kind of ground for doubting the immensity of the frauds to which this City has been exposed , or for uncertainty as to the guilty authors of the frauds . The Citizens ' Committee state fully and clearly the result of their investigation . and it should be remembered that the evidence comes from persons utterly separated from politics , and with no personal aims in view . Their testimony is. that " all confidence is destroyed in the present City officials , " and that " any attempt to borrow large sums of money while the City is controlled by its present management is futile , " and that " if the expenditures and frauds of the last two and a half years continue , " the credit and prosperity of the City will be utterly ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
