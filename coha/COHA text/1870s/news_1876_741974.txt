txt The financial position of the Government has certainly much improved since the beginning of the present fiscal year . In the first eleven months of the year ended June 30 , 1875 , the net decrease of the public debt was only $12,988,265 . For the first eleven months of the current year it has been V5 , - 367,984 . The whole addition to the surplus has been obtained from a decrease in the expenditures . The Customs revenue will fall nearly ten millions below the figures of last year , and sixty millions below those of 1872  --  a striking illustration of the impolicy of admitting such commodities as tea and coffee free of tax , and placing heavy duties on articles of which the consumption is liable to violent fluctuations . Our imports of tea and coffee have not been diminished since the panic , the entire falling off ' in our foreign trade having taken ? place in ' the duty-paying articles .

Last year the outlays for the Army and Navy , Indians , pensions , and . miscellaneous were above the +average for the five preceding years . This year they will fall considerably below that average . There is room for further retrenchment , and the country undoubtealy expects it of Congress and the Administration . The result of the disbursements of silver has been to strengthen considerably the currency balance of the Treasury , which is now $9,285,708 , against $5,161,186 a month ago . According to the latest figures received from Washington , the total amount of silver paid out up to May 29 bad been $7,389,288 , of which only $4,414,557 was in exchange for fractional currency . Making the most liberal estimate for fractional currency which has been lost or destroyed , there must still be about twentytwo million dollars of the stuff in actual use , or three times the amount of silver thus far paid out .

According to all reports which have been received from Washington , Congress is determined to do something handsome for the languishing industries of Nevada , and there is no reason to doubt that the country will soon be provided with more than a sufficiency of token coins , even if it should have the good fortune to escape the swindling , silver dollar . The coin balance is smaller than we like to see it . After deducting the outstanding gold certificates and $7,313,159 for silver bullion and subsidiary silver coin , which is current only at the value of greenbacks , the Government is left with only about thirty-three and a half millions of gold which it ? can call its own property . Of this , a considerable part will be needed for the payment of interest at the end of this month . The Treasury , however , is much stronger in gold coin than it was three months ago .

The amount of silver remaining in the Treasury ( if the telegraph transmits the figures correctly ) seems small , but the probability is that this is not the whole sum in the possession of the Government , and is exclusive of various balances to the credit of disbursing officers , amounting in all , perhaps , to five million dollars .
