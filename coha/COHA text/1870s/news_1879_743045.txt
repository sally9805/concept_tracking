txt Immediately on meeting yesterday , the House finished the vote which had been ordered pending adjournment the day before , and made what is known as the Warner Silver bill a special order for to-morrow . This bill has four general purposes  --  to remove restrictions on the coinage of the standard silver dollar ; to promote the use of silver as currency by means of bullion certificates ; to abolish the trade and.to secure the interchangeableness of fractional silver coins with silver , gold , . and notes . The first two of these objects are attained in a very thorough manner . It is proposed to amend section 3,520 of the Revised Statutes so that it shall read as follows : " Any owner of silver bullion may deposit the same at any Mint to be formed into bars or into standard silver dollars of the weight of 41212 grains , troy , for his benefit . " Section 3,5S5 is amended so as to include " the silver dollar " in the legal-tender coins of the United States ? an amendment which only incorporates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Section 3 ; 586 is so changed as to make the fractional silver coins a legal tender at their nominal value for $20 at one payment ? the present limit being $5 . Section 254 is amended so as to place silver on the same footing as gold with reference to its deposit as coin or bullion in the Treasury and the issue of certificates . Two important changes are made , however , as to the certificates of both kinds , obviously intended for the benefit of the owners of silver . The certificates are to be issued in denominations of ten dollars instead of twenty dollars , and they are made receivable at par , not only for duties on imports , as the gold certificates now are , but for all dues to the United States . It will be seen that the provisions of this bill regarding the coinage and use of silyer are extremely adroit . It will be argued in its favor that it relieves the Treasury of the obligation of coining from two to four millions amonth of silver dollars , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative interests of the country for the evils which the other provisions of the bill must entail if it becomes a law . While the Treasury will cease . to receive the present accumulation of coin from the Mints , it will receive a far larger amount of silver bullion , covered by certificates , in payment of its revenues . There is no limit to the amount of dues to the Government Which may be paid in these certificates , . and at the present price of bullion there is a premium of over 14 per cent . offered by this law on such payments . The ultimate effect of such an arrangement would be to fill the Treasury with bullion to such an extent that it would be necessary to coin it into silver dollars and pay it out in redemption of United States notes and in payment of interest and other dues . But curiously enough , while the Government revenues are made payable in certificates , which when paid in make the bullion represented by them the property of the Government , the Treasury is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for private account . The only thing which could be done with the bullion thus forced on the Government would be to sell it for what could be got for it . A more ingenious arrangement for the benefit of the silver ring it would be difficult to imagine . They are not only provided with a steady demand for their bullion equal to the annual payments to the Government from all sources , but they are given the privilege of having as much bullion coined as . the Mints can manage in coins which are legal tender ? for their nominal value  --  froth . 14 per cent . to 16 per cent. , as the price has run lately , beyond the actual value . We . are not aware what benefit it is even supposed would result to the country from this generous gift to the silver-mine owners , nor do we know wherein these gentlemen have earned such munificent liberality . The other objects of the bill are either harmless or desirable . The prohibition of the further coinage of trade dollars is already within the discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps as well that it should be embodied in the statutes . The exchange of fractional coins for legal-tender money , and of such money for the coins , at the choice of the holder , is a perfectly just measure , which we have long urged . Making the subsidiary coins a legal tender to the amount of $20 is , how- ever , an entirely unnecessary step , and might in practice prove a very annoying one .
