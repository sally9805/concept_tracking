txt It will be remembered that Tammany Tian turned to excellent account last Fall the cry that the Republican Party intended to " disfranchise " the majority of the voting population of this City by means of certain constitutional amendments , which placed the control of Municipal finances in the hands of a board elected by tax and rent payers . These amendments were regarded with so much trepidation by the working politicians of both parties that they failed to get indorsement from either the Republican or Democratic State Convention , and the " disfranchisement " cry proved so troublesome an element in the campaign that no Republican in either house of the Legislature has found courage enough to introduce the amendments this session . And yet the financial affairs of the City are now regulated by ? a board only two of whose members are elected by the people , and the master spirit of which Is not elected at all . On this board  --  or rather on JOHN KELLY , who controls it  --  a majority of the lower house of the Legislature has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the supreme authority in taxation and expenditure , but will give it the right to regulate the minutest details of the management of every department of the City Government , The act which is erroneously called the Municipal Salaries bill confers on the Board of Appprtionment the power to " regulate " all salaries , fees , &c.,; paid directly or indirectly from the City Treasury . It nowhere alludes to the necessity of reducing salaries and fees , and the saving of two millions of dollars on the tax levy of the present year , for which it provides , can be effected without touching the salary list at a.11 . The reduction of the State tax , and a saving on ' the amount of bonds redeemed , will readily supply . the required amount , leaving JOHN KELLY free to serve his personal or political ends by .. reducing the salaries of his political opponents in order to increase those of his political friends . As the board , that is to say Mr. KELLY , is further authorized to reduce the number of officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea may be formed of the power which this bill gives him to intrench himself as permanent dictator of the City of New-York . From the heads of departments downward , every member of the official corps of the City would , under the operation of this act , be reduced to a position of abject vassalage to Mr. KELLY . Of coupe , no man.having any self-respect would hold or accept office under such condition53 . That would enable KELLY to place his own tools in charge of the departments , and we should have a " one-man power " in the City more perfect than TWEED ever dared to set up . Thine would be no responsibility anywhere , save in the ignorant and unscrupulous person who is himself the Board of Apportionment ; and there would be no power at all adequate to hold him to account . There need be no conjecture as to how KELLY ? would exercise the unchecked authority with which a majority of the Republicans in the Assembly have agreed to invest him . On , assuming his present office he exercised very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . The provisional estimates for last year were drawn up and agreed to befoie Controller GREEN- went out of office ; they wore revised and finally determined after Controller KELLY went in . The re-election of Recortler HACKETT was bitterly opposed by KELLY , and though the Tammany candidate wa ) ' - : ignominiously beaten at the polls , KELLY wasted his time to satisfy an old personal grudge against the Recorder . In revising the estimates for 1877 he cut down the clerks of the Recorder's- Court , as well as those of Judge SUTHERLAND , leaving oth:n . Judges who had given him control of their patronage in full possession of their Wry liberal pay-rolls . Commissioner CAMPBELL had persisted in conducting the ' Department of Public Works ' independently of KELLY 'S dictation , and Mr. CAMPBELL 'S appropriations were ruthlessly cut down , albeit they represented such indispensable work as the repaving and repairing of downtown streets . Salaries of clerks in the Police and District Courts not in.political cord with KELLY were reduced , while those who contributed to the Tammany campaign fund were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised estimates for 1877 contained additions for the benefit of the Mayor 's useless and pernicious Bureau of Permits ; the salary of Corporation Attorney Bovp  --  a mere Tammany hack  --  was increased by $2,000 ; there was added $1,000 for the clerks in BOYD 'S office ; the salaries of the Public Administrator  --  another of KELLY 'S henchmen  --  and his clerks were raised in like manner ; so were those of the notorious " ED " GALE and his clerical staff . The clerks of the Court of Common Pleas received an additional allowance of $2,000 ; those of the Surrogate 's Court , $4,000 , and THOMAS DUNLAP , the Commissioner of Jurors , had his annual allowance for doing nothing increased from $4,000 . to $15,000 . All these salaries had been fixed at perfectly ample rates . under Controller . GREEN ; they were raised the moment Controller KELLY came into power , and they were raised , not only in defiance of all considerations of public necessity , but in order to reward politicians who could be depended on to do the bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of public money which he already possesses to spend that money on personal and political favorites , is a very unfit person to intrust with the absolute disposal of the whole power and patronage of the City Government . Republicans who consent to such an outrage on the people of New-York as is contemplated in the so-called Municipal Salaries bill are either very ignorant or are acting from very corrupt motives . Probably most of them are misled by " leaders " in the party who think they can trade off the control of the affairs of NowYork for the supposed certainty of electing a Republican Assembly and consequently a United States Senator this Fall . All of which goes to show that the Republican Party organization has been allowed to fall into very bad hands , and that the man who has the double , good , fortune of being a Cardinal 's nephew and " boss " of Tammany Hall can dispose of the Democratic Party pretty much as he thinks fit .                @ @ @ @ @
