txt It can be confidently stated that the President will veto the bill " to prevent military interference at elections , " which was laid before him yesterday . The two principal grounds of objection to the bill are : First , That it entirely suspends , upon days of general and special elections , the authority given the President to employ the Army and Navy in certain cases , by the acts of 1792 , 1807 , 1833 , 1861 , and other acts passed since 1861 , all of which make it the duty of the President to protect the States from Invasion by any foreign nation or Indian tribe , and to suppress insurrection against the United States ; secondly , because the bill is an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of individual States as against the sovereignty of the United States . In his Message the President will direct attention to the fact that the bill repeals , upon days of general and special elections , all laws which make it the duty of the President to employ the Army and Navy , if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , enforce quarantine regulations , &c.; After discussing these points , the President will show in his Message that the Federal authorities would be deprived by this bill of all power to enforce the election laws and preserve the peace , should the use of the land and naval forces be required for this purpose . In that portion of the Message devoted to maintaining the supremacy of the National Government , tho President will argue that upon days of general and special elections the Army and Navy could not bo used to resist secession or rebellion on the part of any of the States , and that tho suspension of the national authority , even for one day , might result in seriously crippling the Government . The Message will be finished in time to send to the House to-morrow . It is not expected , however , that it will be sent in before Tuesday . Accepting the general belief as a fact , that the President will veto the bill , the Democratic leaders are already discussing their programme for the future . One of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ber of the Democratic caucus committee , said to the Tram correspondent to-day that if the President should veto this bill it would simplify matters very much . It would make a square issue between the two parties , and the Democracy could afford to rest their case with the people without further argument . " A veto of the bill , " said he , " would materially shorten the session . We would then let the Army Appropriation bill fail , because the masses of the people care very little about the Army . This bill has failed several times without material damage to the country . Wo will , of course , pass the Legislative Appropriation bill , and it will be ultimately passed without the political sections , to which we expect the President to object if the bill should be sent to him containing those sections . We intend , also , to pass a separate bill repealing the jurors ' test oath , to which , of course , there will be no objection . When this is accomplished we will adjourn . So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of troops or no troops at the polls , but it materially shortens the present session . " Another prominent Democratic member of the House expressed to the TIMES correspondant much the same opinion as the one quoted , except that ho did not agree as to the policy of permitting the Army bill to fall . He thought that both appropriation bills would be passed as soon as possible . or that a joint resolution would be passed extending the appropriations of last year . A Democratic Senator of prominence said the Issue was now fully made up between the two parties , and the country understood it . If the President vetoed the bill to prevent military interference at the polls , that would end the struggle in Congress . Money would be at once appropriated to run the Government , and Congress would then adjourn . " A veto , " said he , " puts the Republican Party squarely on record in favor of the doctrine of troops at the polls , and we can safely and confidently go before the people on that issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
