HAVE ANIMALS SOULS ? To answer this question , we must first say what we mean by a soul . If we mean a human soul , it is certain that animals do not possess it - at least not in a fully developed condition . If we mean , " Do they possess an immortal soul ? " that is perhaps a question difficult to answer either in the affirmative or the negative . But if we mean by a soul an immaterial principle of life , which cobrdinates the bodily organization to a unity ; which is the ground of growth , activity , perception , volition ; which is intelligent , affectionate , and to a certain extent free ; then we must admit that animals have souls . The same arguments which induce us to believe that there is a soul in man , apply to animals . The world has generally believed that in man , beside the body , there is also soul . Why have people believed it ? The reason probably is , that , beside all that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles , there remains a very important element unaccounted for . Mechanical and physical agency may explain much , but the most essential characteristic of vital phenom ena they do not explain . They do not account for the unity in variety , permanence in change , growth from within by continuous processes , coming from the vital functions in an organized body . Every such body has a unity peculiar to itself , which can not be considered the result of the collocation of material molecules . It is a unity which controls these molecules , arranges and re - arranges them , maintains a steady activity , carries the body through the phenomena of growth , and causes the various organs to cooperate for the purposes of the whole . The vital power is not merely a result of material phenomena , but it reacts on these as a cause . Add to this that strange phenomenon of human consciousness , the sense of personality , - which is the clear perception of selfhood as a distinct unchanging unit , residing in a body all of whose parts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of a soul has arisen . It has been assumed by the common-sense of mankind that in every living body the cause of the mode of existence of each part is contained in the whole . As soon as death intervenes each part is // left free to pass through changes peculiar to itself alone . Life is a power which acts from the whole upon the parts , causing them to resist chemical laws , which begin to act as soon as life departs . The unity of a living body does not result from an ingenious juxtaposition of parts , like that of a watch , for example . For the unity of a living body implies that which is called " the vital vortex , " or perpetual exchange of particles . A watch or clock is the nearest approach which has been made by man to the creation of a living , being . A watch , for instance , contains the principle of its action in itself , and is not moved from without ; in that it resembles a living creature . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go seventy years , without being wound up . It might need to be oiled occasionally , but not as often as an animal needs to be fed . A watch is also like a living creature in having a unity as a whole not belonging to the separate parts , and to which all parts conspire - namely , that of marking the progress of time . Why then say that a man has a soul , and that a watch has not ? The difference is this . The higher principle of unity in the watch , that is , its power of marking time , is wholly an effect , and never a cause . It is purely and only the result of the arrangement of wheels and springs ; in other words , of material conditions . But in man , the principle of unity is also a cause . Life reacts upon body . Thu laws of matter are modified by the power of life , chemical action is suspended , living muscles are able to endure without laceration the application of forces which would destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the will of a living creature react on the physical frame . A sight , a sound , a few spoken words , a message seen in a letter , cause an immense revulsion in the physical condition . Something is suddenly told us , and we faint away , or even die , from the effect of the message . Here mind acts upon matter , showing that in man mind is not merely a result , but also a cause . Hence men have gen 413 erally believed in the existence of a soul in man . They have not been taught it by metaphysicians , it is one of the spontaneous inductions of common-sense from universal experience . But this argument applies equally to prove a soul in animals . The same reaction of soul on body is constantly apparent . Every time that you whistle to your dog , and he comes bounding toward you , his mind has acted on his body . His will has obeyed his thou , ht , his muscles have obeyed his will . The cause of his motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require any further illustration . Therefore , regarding the soul as a principle of life , connected with the body but not its result , or , in other words , as an immaterial principle of activity , there is the same reason for believing in the soul of animals that there is for believing in the soul of man . But when we ask as to_the the nature of the animal soul , and how far it is analogous to that of man , we meet with certain difficulties . Let us see then how many of the human qualities of the soul are to be found in animals , and so discover if there is any remainder not possessed by them , peculiar to ourselves . That the vital soul , or principle of life , belongs equally to plants , animals , and men , is evident . This is so apparent as to be granted even by Descartes , who regards animals as mere machines , or automata , destitute of a thinking soul , but not of life or feeling . They are automata , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he defines the soul as the thinking and knowing power . But Locke ( with whom Leibnitz fully agreed on this point ) ascribes to animals thought as well as feeling , and makes their difference from man to consist in their not possessing abstract ideas . We shall presently see the truth of this most sagacious remark . Plants , animals , and men are alike in possessing the vital principle , which produces growth , which causes them to pass through regular phases of development , which enables them to digest and Have Animals Souls ? // assimilate food taken from without , and which carries on a steady circulation within . To this are added , in the animal , the function of voluntary locomotion , perception through the senses of an outward world , the power of feeling pleasure and pain , some wonderful instincts , and some degree of reflective thought . Animals also possess memory , imagination , playfulness , industry , the sense of shame , and many other very human qualities . Take , for example , Buffon 's fine description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By nature fiery , irritable , ferocious , and sanguinary , the dog in his savage state is a terror to other animals . But domesticated he becomes gentle , attached , and desirous to please . He hastens to lay at the feet of his master his courage , his strength , and all his abilities . He listens for his master 's orders , inquires his will , consults his opinion , begs his permission , understands the indications of his wishes . Without possessing the power of human thought , he has all the warmth of human sentiment . He has more than human fidelity , he is constant in his attachments . He is made up of zeal , ardor , and obedience . He remembers kindness longer than wrong . He endures bad treatment and forgets it - disarming it by patience and submission . " No one who has ever had a dog for a friend will think this description exaggerated . If any should so consider it , we will cite for their benefit what Mr. Jesse , one of the latest students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Researches into the History of the British Dog ( London . 1866 ) . He says that remarkable instances of the following virtues , feelings , and powers of mind are well authenticated : - " The dog risks his life to give help ; goes for assistance ; saves life from drowning , fire , other animals , and men ; assists distress ; guards property ; knows boundaries ; resents injuries ; repays benefits ; communicates ideas ; combines with other dogs for several purposes ; understands language ; knows when he is about to die ; knows death in a human being ; devotes his whole life to the object of his love ; dies of grief and of joy ; dies in his master 's defense ; commits suicide ; remains by the dead ; solicits , and gives alarm ; knows the characters of men ; recognizes aportrait , and men after long absence ; is fond of praise and sensible to ridicule ; feels shame , and is sensible of a fault ; is playful ; is incorruptible ; finds his way back from distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; has dreams ; and takes a last farewell when dying . " Much of this , it may be said , is instinctive . We must therefore distinguish between Instinct and Intelligence ; or , rather , between instinctive intelligence , and reflective intelligence . Many writers on the subject of animals have not carefully distinguished these very different activities of the soul . Even M. Leroy , one of the first in modern times who brought careful observation to the study of the nature of animals , has not always kept in view this distinction - as has been noticed by a subsequent French writer of very considerable ability , M. Flourens.i The following marks , according to M. Flonrens , distinguish instinct from intelligence . INSTINCT Is spontaneous , necessary , invariable , innate INTELLIGENCE Is deliberative , conditional , modifiable , comes from observation and experience , is free , general . fatal , " particular . Thus the building faculty of the beaver is an instinct , for it acts spontaneously , and always in the same way . It is not a general faculty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of building houses of sticks , mud , and other materials , with the entrance under water and a dry place within . When beavers build on a running stream , they begin by making a dam The Intelligence and Perfectibility of Animals . De l'Inetinct et l'Intelligence des Animaux . Par By C. G. Leroy . Translated into English in 1870 . P. Flourens . Paris , 1864. // across it , which preserves them from losing the water in a drought ; but this also is a spontaneous and invariable act . The old stories of their driving piles , using their tails for trowels , and having well-planned houses with many chambers , have been found to be fictitious . That the beaver builds by instinct , though intelligence comes in to modify the instinct , appears from his wishing to build his house or his dam when it is not needed . Mr. Broderip , the English naturalist , had a pet beaver that manifested his building instinct by dragging together warming-pans , sweepingbrushes , boots , and sticks , which he would lay crosswise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of coal , turf , laying it very even . Finally , he made a nest for himself behind his wall with clothes , hay , and cotton . As this creature had been brought from America very young , all this procedure must have been instinctive . But his intelligence showed itself in his adapting his mode of building to his new circumstances . His instinct led him to build his wall , and to lay his sticks crosswise , and to fill in with what he could find , according to the universal and spontaneous procedure of all beavers . But his making use of a chest of drawers for one side of his wall , and taking brushes and boots instead of cutting down trees , were no doubt acts of intelligence . A large part of the wonderful procedure of bees is purely instinctive . Bees , from the beginning of the world , and in all countries of the earth , have lived in similar communities ; have had their queen , to lay their eggs ; if their queen is lost , have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions of existence in one of their larvm ; have constructed their hexagonal cells by the same mathematical law , so as to secure the most strength with the least outlay of material . All this is instinct - for it is spontaneous and not deliberate ; it is universal and constant . But when the bee deflects his comb in order to avoid a stick thrust across the inside of the hive , and begins the varia tion before he reaches the stick ; this can only be regarded as an act of intelligence . Animals , then , have both instincts and intelligence ; and so has man . A large part of human life proceeds from tendencies as purely , if not as vigorously , instinctive as those of animals . Man has social instincts , which create human society . Children play from an instinct . The maternal instinct in a human mother is , till modified by reflection , as spontaneous , universal , and necessary as the same instinct in animals . But in man the instincts are reduced to a minimum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In animals they are at their maximum , and are modified in * much les ' * degree . It is sometimes said that animals uo not reason , but man does . But animals are quite capable of at least two modes of reasoning : that of comparison , and that of inference . They compare two modes of action , or two substances , and judge the one to be preferable to the other , and accordingly select it . Sir Emerson Tennent tells us that elephants , employed to build stone walls in Ceylon , will lay each stone in its place , then stand off and look to see if it is plumb , and , if not , will move it with their trunk , till it lies perfectly straight . This is a pure act of reflect . ive judgment . He narrates an adventure which befell himself in Ceylon while riding on a narrow road through the forest . He heard a rumbling sound approaching , and directly there came to meet him an elephant , bearing on his tusks a large bc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry to the place where it was needed . Sir Emerson Tennent 's horse , unused to these monsters , was alarmed , and refused to go forward . The sagacious elephant , perceiving this , evidently decided that he must himself go out of the way . But to do this , he was obliged first to take the log from his tusks with his trunk , and lay it on the ground , which he did , and then backed out of the road between the trees till only his head was 1874. 415 // visible . But the horse was still too timid to go by , whereupon the judicious pachyderm pushed himself farther back , till all of his body , except the end of his trunk , had disappeared . Then Sir Emerson succeeded in getting his horse by , but stopped to witness the result . The elephant came out , took the log up again , laid it across his tusks , and went on his way . This story , told by an unimpeachable witness , shows several successive acts of reasoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would not pass ; he again inferred that in that case he must himself get out of the way ; that , to do this , he must lay down his log ; that he must go farther back ; and accompanying this was his sense of duty , making him faithful to his task ; and , most of all , his consideration of what was due to this human traveler , which kept him from driving the horse and man before him as he went on . There is another well-authenticated anecdote of an elephant ; he was following an ammunition wagon , and saw the man who was seated on it fall off just before the wheel . The man would have been crushed had not the animal instantly run forward , and , without an order , lifted the wheel with his trunk , and held it suspended in the air , till the wagon had passed over the man without hurting him . Here were combined presence of mind , good - will , knowledge of the danger to the man , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who has recently died in Paris , belon , , ing to a well-known Boston family , was in his early life a sea-captain . He had a dog , which he sometimes took to sea with him , and sometimes left behind , at his father 's house in Somerset Street . He once sailed for India , taking his dog . Some three or four months after , the family in Somerset Street were astonished by the arrival of a dog , very lean and dirty , but who claimed acquaintance with them by many unmistakable signs , and whom they recognized at last as the captain 's dog . But how had he got home ? The vessel on which he sailed could hardly have arrived in India , much less returned . Inquiring on the wharves , they at last learned that he had come to the port of Boston on a vessel just from Marseilles . The captain could only say that this dog had come on board in Marseilles and had insisted on remaining till they arrived in Boston , when he had instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to know how he got to Marseilles . This mystery was solved on the return of his owner some months after , who said that at sea he had received such kindness from a French captain who took a great fancy to his dog , that he could not refuse to give him to the Frenchman . The dog , therefore , had been carried to France , and then had found his way to a vessel bound for Boston , and had come home . Whether he smelt a certain Boston aroma hanging round the ship , or merely observed that the crew spoke the language with which he was familiar , we can not say . But it is not every man who could succeed in getting home so readily from a foreign land . Perhaps I may properly introduce here an account of the manifestations of mind in the animals I have had the most opportunity of observing . I have a horse , who was named Rubezahl , after the Mountain Spirit of the Harz made famous in the stories of Musaeus . We have contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that Ruby can distinguish Sunday from other days . On Sunday I have been in the habit of driving to Boston to church ; but on other days , I drive to the neighboring village , where are the post-office , shops of mechanics , and other stores . To go to Boston , I usually turn to the right when I leave my driveway ; to , , o to the village , I turn to the left . Now , on Sunday , if I leave the reins loose , so that the horse may do as he pleases , he invariably turns to the right , and goes to Boston . On other days , he as invariably turns to the left , and goes to the village . He does this so constantly and regularly , // that none of the family have any doubt of the fact that he knows that it is Sunday ; how he knows it we are unable to discover . I have left my house at the same hour , on Sunday and on Monday ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : and yet on Sunday he always tui*ns to the right , and on Monday to the left . He is fed at the same time on Sunday as on other days , but the man comes back to harness him a little later on Sunday than at other times , and that is possibly his method of knowing that it is the day for going to Boston . But see how much of observation , memory , and thought is implied in all this . Again , Ruby has shown a very distinct feeling of the supernatural . Driving one day up a hill near my house , we met a horse-car coming down toward us , running without horses , simply by the force of gravity . My horse became so frightened that he ran into the gutter , and nearly overturned me ; and I got him past with the greatest difficulty . iNow he had met the cars coming down that hill drawn by horses , a hundred times , and had never been alarmed . Moreover , only a day or two after , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving uphill , before us , where the horses were entirely invisible , being concealed by the car itself , which was between us and the horses . But this did not frighten Ruby at all . He evidently said to himself , " The horses are there , though I do not see them . " But in the other case it seemed to him an effect without a cause - something plainly supernatural . There was nothing in the aspect of the car itself to alarm him ; he had seen that often enough . He was simply terrified by seeing it move without any adequate cause - just as we should be , if we saw our chairs begin to walk about the room . Our Newfoundland dog 's name is Donatello ; which , again , is shortened to Don in common parlance . He has all the affectionate and excellent qualities of his race . He is the most goodnatured creature I ever saw . Nothing provokes him . Little dogs may yelp VOL . XXXIV. - xo. 204. 27 at him , the cat or kittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to them . A little dog climbs on his back , and lies down there ; one of the cats will lie between his legs . But at night , when he is on guard , no one can approach the house unchallen0ed . But his affection for the family is very great . To be allowed to come into the house and lie down near us is his chief happiness . He was very fond of my son E- , who played with him a good deal , and when the young man went away during the war , with a three months ' regiment , Don was much depressed by his absence . He walked down regularly to the station , and stood there till a train of cars came in , and when his friend did not arrive in it , he went back , with a melancholy air , to the house . But at last the young man returned . It was in the evening , and Don was lying on the piazza . As soon as he saw his friend , his exultation knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round him , barking and showing the wildest signs of delight . All at once he turned , and ran up into the garden , and came back bringing an apple , which he laid down at the feet of his young master . It was the only thing he could think of to do for him - and this sign of his affection was quite pathetic . The reason why Don thought of the apple was probably this : we had taught him to go and get an apple for the horse , when so directed . We would say , " Go , Don , get an apple for poor Ruby ; * ' then he would run up into the garden , and bring an apple , and hold it up to the horse ; and perhaps when the horse tried to take it he would pull it away . After doing this a few times , he would finally lie down on his back under the horse 's nose , and allow the latter to take the apple from his mouth . He would also kiss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said , " Don , kiss poor Ruby , " he leaped up and kissed the horse 's nose . But he afterwards hit upon a more convenient method of doing it . He got his paw over the rein and pulled down the horse 's head , so 18T4. 417 // that he could continue the osculatory process more at his ease , sitting comfortably on the ground . Animals know when they have done wrong ; so far , at least , as that means disobeying our will or command . The only great fault which Don ever committed was stealing a piece of meat from our neighbor 's kitchen . I do not think he was punished or even scolded for it ; for we did not find it out till later , when it would have done no good to punish him . But a week or two after that , the gentleman whose kitchen had been robbed was standing on my lawn , talking with me , and he referred , laughingly , to what Don had done . He did not even look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebuke . But the moment Don heard his name mentioned , he turned and walked away , and hid himself under the low branches of a Norway spruce near by . He was evidently profoundly ashamed of himself . Was this the result of conscience , or of the love of approbation ? In either case , it was very human . That the love of approbation is common to many animals we all know . Dogs and horses certainly can be influenced by praise and blame , as easily as men . Many years ago we had occasion to draw a load of grave , and we put Ruby into a tip-cart to do the work . He was profoundly depressed , and evidently felt it as a degradation . He hung his head , and showed such marks of humiliation that we have never done it since . But on the other hand , when he goes out , under the saddle , by the side of a young horse , this veteran animal tries as hard to appear young , as any old bachelor of sixty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and goes sideways , and has all the airs and graces of a young colt . All this , too , is excessively human . At one time my dog was fond of going to the railway station to see the people , and I always ordered him to go home , fearing he should be hurt by the cars . He easily understood that if he went there , it was contrary to my wishes . Nevertheless , he often went ; and I do not know but this fondness for forbidden fruit was rather human too . So , whenever he was near the station , if he saw me coming , he would look the other way , and pretend not to know me . If he met me anywhere else , he always bounded to meet me with great delight . But at the station it was quite different . He would pay no attention to my whistle , or my call . He even pretended to be another dog , and would look me right in the face , without apparently recognizing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impertinent manner ; the reason evidently being , that he knew he was doing what was wrong , and did not like to be found out . Possibly he may have relied a little on my near-sightedness , in this maneuvre . That animals have acute observation , memory , imagination , the sense of approbation , strong affections , and the power of reasoning , is therefore very evident . Lord Bacon also speaks of a dog 's reverence for his master as partaking of a religious element . " Mark , " says he , " what a generosity and courage a dog will put on , when he finds himself maintained by a man , who to him is instead of a God - which courage he could not attain , without that confidence in a better nature than his own . " Who that has seen the mute admiration and trust in a do , , ' s eye , as he looks up at his master , but can see in it something of a religious reverence - the germ and first principle of relig-ion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul and that of the animal in its highest development ? That there is a very marked difference between man and the highest animal is evident . The human being , weaker in proportion than all other animals , has subjected them all to himself . He has subdued the earth by his inventions . Physically too feeble to dig a hole in the ground like a rabbit , or to fell a tree like a beaver ; unable to live in the water like a fish , or to move through the air like a bird ; he yet , by his inventive power , and his machinery , can compel the forces of nature to // work for him . They are the true genii , slaves of his lamp . Air , fire , water , electricity , and magnetism build his cities and his stately ships , run his errands , carry him from land to land , and accept him as their master . Whence does man obtain this power ? Some say it is the human hand which has made man supreme . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tools in itself . The size and strength of the thumb , and the power of opposing it to the extremities of the fingers , distinguishes , according to most anatomists , the human hand from that of the quadrumanous animals . In those monkeys which are nearest to man , the thumb is so short and weak , and the fingers so long and slender , that their tips can scarcely be brought in opposition . Excellent for climbing , they are not good for taking up small objects or supportin* large ones . But the hand of man could accomplish little , without the mind behind it . It was therefore a good remark of Galen , that " man is not the wisest of animals because he has a hand ; but God has given him a hand because he is the wisest of animals . " The size of the human brain , relatively greater than that of almost any other animal ; man 's structure , adapting him to stand erect ; his ability to exist in all climates ; his power of sub*sisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are associated with his superior mental power , but do not produce it . The question recurs , What enables him to stand at the head of the animal creation ? Perhaps the chief apparent distinctions between man and other animals are these : - 1 . The lowest races of men use tools ; other animals do not . 2 . The lowest human beings possess a verbal language ; other animals have none . 3 . Man has the capacity of self-culture , as an individual ; other animals have not . 4 . Human beings , associated in society , are capable of progress in civilization , by means of science , art , literature , and religion ; other animals are not . 5 . Men have a capacity for religion ; no animal , except man , has this . The lowest races of men use tools , but no other animal does this . This is so universally admitted by science , that the presence of the rudest tools of stone is considered a sufficient trace of the presence of man . If stone hatchets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though no human bones are detected , anthropolo*ists regard this as a sufficient proof of the existence of human beings in the period indicated by such a geologic formation . The only tools used by animals in procuring food , in war , or in building their homes , are their natural organs ; their beaks , teeth , claws , etc . It may be added that man alone wears clothes ; other animals being sufficiently clothed by nature . No animals make a fire , though they often suffer from cold ; but there is no race of men unacquainted with the use of fire.1 No animals possess a verbal language . Animals can remember some of the words used by men , and associate with them their meaning . But this is not the use of language . It is merely the memory of two associated facts - as when the animal recollects where he found food , and goes to the same place to look for it again . Animals have different cries , indicating different wants . They use one cry to call their mate , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of verbal language . Human language implies not merely an acquaintance with the meaning of particular words , but the power of putting them to , , ether in a sentence . Animals have no such language as this ; for , if they had , it would have been learned by men . Man has the power of learning any verbal language . Adelung and Yater reckon over three thousand languages spoken by men , and any man can learn any of them . The negroes speak their own languages in their own countries , they speak Arabic in North Africa , they learn to speak English , 1 Jt te a miBtake to eay that the Taemaniane do not uee fire . 1874. 419 // French , and Spanish in America , and Oriental languages when they go to the East . li any animals had a verbal Ian* , uage , with its vocabulary and grammar , men would long ago have learned it , and would have been able to converse with them . Again , no animal except man is capable of self-culture , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not teach themselves . An old wolf is much more cunning than a young one , but he has been made so by the force of circumstances . You can teach your dog tricks , but no dog has ever taught himself any . Yet the lowest savages teach themselves to make tools , to ornament their paddles and clubs , and acquire certain arts by diligent effort . Birds will sometimes practice the tunes which they hear played , till they have learned them . They will also sometimes imitate each other 's songs . That is , they possess the power of vocal imitation . But to imitate the sounds we hear is not self-culture . It is not developing a new power , but it is exercising in a new way a natural gift . Yet we must admit that in this habit of birds there is the rudiment , at least , of selfeducation . All races of men are capable of progress in civilization . Many , indeed , remain in a savage state for thousands of years , and we can not positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of civilization . But we are led to believe it from having known of so many tribes of men who have emerged from apathy , ignorance , and barbarism into the light of science and art . So it was with all the Teutonic races - the Goths , Germans , Kelts , Lomb*rds , Scandinavians . So it ' was with the Arabs , who roamed for thousands of years over the deserts , a race of ignorant robbers , and then , filled with the great inspiration of Islam , flamed up into a brilliant coruscation of science , literature , art , military success , and profound learning . What great civilizations have grown up in China , India , Persia , Assyria , Babylon , Phornicia , Egypt , Greece , Rome , Carthage , Etruria ! But no such progress has ever appeared among the animals . As their parents were , five thousand years ago , so , essentially , are they now . Nor are animals religious , in the sense of worshiping unseen powers , higher than themselves . My horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worship . These are some of the most marked points of difference between man and all other animals . Now these can all be accounted for by the hypothesis in which Locke and Leibnitz both a*reed ; namely , that while animals are capable of reasoning about facts , they are incapable of abstract ideas . Or , we may say with Coleridge , that while animals , in common with man , possess the faculty of understanding , they do not possess that of reason . Coleridge seems to have intended by this exactly what Locke and Leibnitz meant by their statement . When my dog Don heard the word " apple , " he thought of the particular concrete apple under the tree ; and not of apples in general , and their relation to pears , peaches , etc . Don understood me when I told him to go and get an apple , and obeyed ; but he would not have understood me if I had remarked to him that apples were better ' than pears , more healthy than peaches , not so handsome as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstract and general ideas . Now it is precisely the possession of this power of abstract thought which will explain the superiority of man to all other animals . It explains the use of tools ; for a tool is an instrument prepared not for one special purpose , but to be used generally , in certain ways . A baboon , like a man , might pick up a particular stone with which to crack a particular nut ; but the ape does not make and keep a stone hammer , to be used on many similar occasions . A box of tools contains a collection of saws , planes , draw-knives , etc. , not made to use on one occasion merely , but made for sawing , cuttin0 , and planing purposes generally . Still more evident is it that the power // of abstraction is necessary for verbal language . We do not here use the common term " articulate speech , " for we can conceive of animals articulating their vocal sounds . But " a word " is an abstraction . The notion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abstract general term . All words , except proper names , are abstract ; and to possess and use a verbal language is impossible , without the possession of this mental faculty . In regard to self-culture , it is clear that for any steady progress one must keep before his mind an abstract idea of what he wishes to do . This enables him to rise above impulse , passion , instinct , habit , circumstance . By the steady contemplation of the proposed aim , one can arrange circumstances , restrain impulse , direct one 's activity , and become really free . In like manner races become developed in civilization by the impact of abstract ideas . Sometimes it is by coming in contact with other civilized nations , which gives them an ideal superior to anything before known . Sometimes the motive power of their progress is the reception of truths of science , art , literature , or religion . It is not necessary to show that without abstract , universal , and necessary ideas no religion is possible ; for religion being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , as spiritual , necessarily implies these ideas in the mind of the worshiper . We find , then , in the soul of animals all active , affectionate , and intelligent capacities , as in that of man . The only difference is that man is capable of abstract ideas , which give him a larger liberty of action , which enable him to adopt an aim and pursue it , and which change his affections from an instinctive attachment into a principle of generous love . Add , then , to the animal soul the capacity for abstract ideas , and it would rise at once to the level of man . Meantime , in a large part of their nature , they have the same faculties with ourselves . They share our emotions , and we theirs . They are 421 made " a little lower " than man , and , if we are souls , so surely are they . Are they immortal ? To discuss this question would require more space than we can here give to it . For our own part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time assuming their continued advance . The law of life is progress ; and one of the best features in the somewhat unspiritual theory of Darwin is its profound faith in perpetual improvement . This theory is the most startling optimism that has ever been taught , for it makes the law of the whole universe to be perpetual progress . Many of the arguments for the immortality of man can not indeed be used for our dumb relations , the animals . We can not argue from their universal faith in a future life ; nor contend that they need an immortality on moral grounds , to recompense their good conduct and punish their wickedness . We might indeed adduce a reason implied in our Saviour 's parable , and believe that the poor creatures who have received their evil things in this life will be comforted in another . Moreover we might find in many animals qualities fitting them for a higher state . There are animals , as we have seen , who show a fidelity , courage , generosity , often superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved their master , more than food , and starved to death on his grave , are surely well fitted for a higher existence . Jesse tells a story of a cat which was being stoned by cruel boys . Men went by , and did not interfere ; but a dog , that saw it , did . He drove away the boys , and then took the cat to his kennel , licked her all over with his tongue , and his conduct interested people , who brought her milk . The canine nurse took care of her till she was well , and the cat and dog remained fast friends ever after . Such an action in a man would have been called heroic ; and we think such a do , , would not be out of place in heaven . Yet it is not so much on particular cases of animal superiority that we rely , but on the difficulty of conceiving , in flave Animals Souls ? // any sense , of the destruction of life . The principle of life , whether we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all observation of the senses . All that we know of it by observation is , that beside the particles of matter which compose an organized body , there is something else , not c ognizable by the senses , which attracts and dismisses them , modifies and c&amp;irdinates them . The unity of the body is not to be found in its sensible phenomena , but in something which escapes the senses . Into the vortex of that life material molecules are being continually absorbed , and from it they are perpetually discharged . If death means the dissolution of the body , we die many times in the course of our earthly career , for every body is said by human anatomists to be changed in all its par*ticles once in seven years . What then remains , if all the particles go ? The principle of organization remains , and this invisible , persistent principle constitutes the identity of every organized body . If I say that I have the same body when I am One Behind Time . October , fifty which I had at twenty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which continues unaltered amid the fast-flying particles of matter . This life-principle makes and remakes the material frame ; that body does not make it . When what we call death intervenes , all that we can assert is that the life principle has done , wholly and at once , what it has always been doing gradually and in part . What happens to the material particles , we see : they become detached from the organizing principle , and relapse into simply mechanical and chemical conditions . What has happened to that organizing principle we neither see nor know ; and we have absolutely no reason at all for saying that it has ceased to exist . This is as true of plants and of animals as of men ; and there is no reason for supposing that when these die , their principle of life is ended . It probably has reached a crisis , which consists in the putting on of new forms and ascendin* into a higher order of organized existence . James Freeman Clarke . @         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
