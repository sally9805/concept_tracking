*pFfE consideration of the interestling subject which I now take up is not new to me . Long ago I found myself thinking about it when occasion to do so presented itself ; and in this I was helped by the views of English society presented in the literature of the day , some of the most interesting studies of which are furnished in the novels written by Englishwomen . Indeed , the whole subject of English life and character has long been of the profoundest interest to me ; and a recent visit to England is rather the occasion than the cause of much of what I shall write upon it . To say this is due to myself if not to my readers. * One day a lady whom I had had the pleasure of taking in to dinner in a country house near London , and whom I had soon found to be one of those simple-minded , good-natured , truthtelling women who are notably common in England , spoke to me about some ladies who on a previous day had attracted her atte*ntion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How ? " I asked . " Oh , we always know American women I " " But how , pray ? " She thought a moment , and answered : " By their beauty-they are almost always pretty , if not more-by their fine complexions , and by their exquisite dress . " I did not tell her that I thought that she was right ; but that she was so I had by that time become convinced . And yet I should say that the most beautiful women I had ever seen were Englishwomen , were it not for the memory of a Frenchwoman , a German , and a Czech . But * My article in the April number of " The Galaxy " happened to be sent in without a title ; and in hastily adding that with which it appeared both the editor and myself forgot for the moment that it was the title of Mr. Emerson 's wellknown book . My silent adoption of it was an unintentional violation of courtesy which I regret . the latter three were rare exceptions . Beauty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among those of any other with which I am acquainted ; and among that race it is commoner in " America " than in England . I saw more beauty of face and figure at the first two receptions which I attended after my return than I had found among the hundreds of thousands of women whom I had seen in England . The types are the same in both countries ; but they seem to come near to perfection much oftener here than there . Beauty of feature is , however , sometimes more clearly defined in England than here . The mouth in particular when it is beautiful is more statuesque . The curves are more decided , and at the junction of the red of tho lips with the white there is a delicately raised outline which marks the form of the feature in a very noble way . This may also be said of the nostril . It gives a chiselled effect to those features which is not so often found in " America " ; but the nose itself , the brow , and the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . " In both countries , however , the head is apt to be too large for perfect proportion . This is a characteristic defect of the English type of beauty . Its effect is seen in Stothard 's figures , in Etty 's , and in those of other English painters . Another defect is in the heaviness of the articulations . Really fine arms are rare ; but fine wrists are still rarer . Such wrists as the Viennoise women have-of which I saw a wonderful example in the Viennoise wife of a Sussex gentleman-are almost unknown among women of English race in either country . It is often said , even in England , that " American " women have more beautiful feet than Englishwomen have . This I am inclined to doubt . The feet // may be smaller here ; and they generally look smaller because Englishwomen wear larger and heavier shoes . They are obliged to do so because they Walk more , and because of their moister climate . But more smallness is not a beauty in a foot more than in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape , proportion , and color ; and feet are often cramped out of shape and out of proportion in other countries than China . A foot to be beautiful should seem fit for the body which it supports to stand upon and walk with . It is said by some persons , who by saying it profess to know , that nature , prodigal of charms to Englishwomen in bust , shoulders , and arms , is chary of them elsewhere , and that their beauty of figure is apt to stop at the waist . Upon this point I do not venture to give an opinion ; but I am inclined to doubt the judgment in question upon general physiological principles . The human figure is the development of a germ ; and it is not natural that , whatever may be the case with individuals , the type of a whole race in one country should present this inconsistency . Possibly those who started this notion were unfortunate in their occasions of observation and comparison . There is more beauty in the south of England than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southward , although in addition to my observation northward I had there the opportunity of seeing the great throngs chiefly of women called together by the triennial musical festival , my eyes had begun to long for the sight of beauty . The women were hardfeatured , coarse in complexion , without any remarkable bloom , but rather the contrary , and ungainly in figure . I found a great improvement in this respect in the lower counties ; and in London of course more than elsewhere . For it is remarkable that according to some law , which has never yet been formulated , or from some cause quite undiscovered , perhaps undiscoverable , beautiful women are always found in the greatest numbers where there are the most men and the most money . Much has been said about the complexion of the women of England , which has been greatly praised . I have not found it exceptionally beautiful . It is often fresh , oftener ruddy , but still oftener coarse . A delicate , finelygraduated bloom is not common . The rosy cheeks when looked at closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots of red ; and the white is still oftener not like that of a lily , or , better , of a white rose , but of some much coarser object in nature . It is true that in making these odious comparisons I can not forget certain women , too common in " America , " who seem to be composed in equal parts of mind and leather , the elements of body and soul being left out so far as is consistent with existence in human form . But such women are also to be found in England , although perhaps in fewer numbers than here . As to dress , that , as a man , I must regard as a purely adventitious and an essentially unimportant matter . If a woman be beautiful , or charming without actual beauty , a man cares very little in what she is dressed , so long as she seems at ease in her clothes , and their color is becoming to her and harmonious . There is no greater mistake than the assumption that being dressed in good taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social advantage of any kind . Nor is it even a sign of good taste in any other particular . You shall see a woman who has come out of the slums , and whose life is worthy of her origin and hcr breeding , although it may have become gilded and garish , and she shall dress herself daily , morning , noon , and night , with such an exquisite sense of fitness in all things , with such an instinctive appreciation of harmony of outline and color , that your eye will be soothed with the sight of her apparel ; and she shall nevertheless be vulgar in mind and manners , sordid in soul , in her life equally // gross and frivolous . And the converse is no less true . Women most happy in the circumstances of their birth and breeding , intelligent , cultivated , charming , of whose sympathy in regard to anything good or beautiful you may be sure , will dress themselves in such an incongruous , heterogeneous fashion that the beauty which they often possess triumphs with difficulty over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I am saying very little against Englishwomen when I say that in general they are the worst dressed human creatures that I ever saw , except perhaps the female half of a certain class of Germans . The reputation that they have in this respect among Frenchwomeu and " Americans " is richly deserved . Good taste is simply absent . The notion of fitness , congruity , and " concatenation accordingly " does not exist . In form the Englishwoman 's dress is dowdy , in color frightful . If not color-blind , she seems generally to be blind to the effect of color , either singly or in combination . At the Birmingham festival I saw a lady in a rich red-purple ( plum color ) silk-high around the neck of course , as it was morning  --  and over this swept a necklace of enormous coral beads . It made one 's eyes ache to look at her . This was not an uncommon , but a characteristic instance . Such combinations may be justly regarded as the rule in Englishwomen 's dress . For purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gowns , but they use it for trimming , in bands and flounces , in ribbons , in feathers . They combine it with all other colors . An Englishwoman seems to think herself " made " if she can deck herself in some way with purple silk or velvet , or ribbons or feathers . Of course I am excepting from these remarks a few who have intuitive good taste , and other few who employ French modi8te8 , and who submit implicitly to their authority . The latter condition is essential ; for even when the main body of an Englishwoman 's dress is in good taste she 43 is very apt to destroy its effect by some incongruous addition from her stores of heterogeneous jewels , or by some other ornament  --  a collar , a cape , aftchu , or a ribbon . They have a sad way of putting forlorn things about their necks and on their heads which is very depressing , unless it is astonishing , which happens sometimes . An Englishwoman will be tolerably well dressed , and then will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a huge piece of lace ; or she will wear specimens of two or three sets of jewels ; or she will put a colored feather in her hair , or a bonnet on her head , that would tempt a tyrant to bring it to the block . I remember seeing a marchioness whose family was noble in the middle ages riding with an " American " lady who had not as much to spend in a year as the other had in a week ; but the marchioness was so obtrusively ill dressed and the American with such good taste and simplicity that both being unusually intelligent , both perfectly well bred and self-possessed , and both fine healthy women , a person ignorant of their rank would have been likely to mistake the latter for the noblewoman . It has been said that Englishwomen dress better in full evening dress than in what is known as demi-toitette . I can not think so . It is not the English dress that then looks better , but the Englishwoman ; that is , if she has fine shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is revealed , the woman pure and simple , that pleases the eye , just as is the case elsewhere . For the things that an Englishwoman will put on , or put half-off herself , in the evening , are amazing to behold . An Englishwoman in full dress who has not a fine figure is even more dowdy than she is in the morning . For then she is likely to be at least neat and tidy , and she may wear a gown that is comparatively unobtrusive in form and color . Indeed , the best dress that the average Englishwoman wears is her simple // IIMAY , street dress , which is apt to be of some sober color-black , gray , light or dark , or a dark soft blue , and to be entirely without ornament-not a flounce or a bow , or even a button except for use , with a bonnet , or oftener a hat , equally sober in tint and in form . And this is best for her ; in this she is safe . If she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by no means wander forth into the wilderness of mingled colors : " that way madness lies . " This outward show is in no way the consequence of carelessness . No one in England seems to be careless about anything , least of all a woman about her dress . It is helpless , hopeless , elaborated dowdyism . And yet as I write there rise up against me , with sweet , reproachful faces , figures draped worthily of their beauty ; and more could not be said even for the work of Worth himself . One of many I particularly remember with whom I took five o'clock tea at the house of one of the Queen 's chaplains , and who bore a name that may be found in the " Peveril of the Peak . " Her bright intelligence and her rich beauty ( her oval cheek was olive ) would have made me indifferent to her dress had it been a homespun bedgown . But shall I ever forget the beautiful curves and tint of that soft-gray broad-leafed felt hat and feather , the elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or the perfect glove upon the hand that was held out so frankly to bid me good-by ? No , fair British friends , it is not you that I mean ; it is those other women whom I saw , but did not know . It is because of the average Englishwoman 's sad failure in dressing herself that the notion has got abroad that Englishmen are finer looking than Englishwomen . For the dress of the men is notably in good taste . It is simple , manly , neat ; and although sober in tint and snug in cut , it is likely to have its general sobriety light*ned up with a little touch of bright , warm color . On the other hand , the dress of " American " men is generally far , very , very far , inferior to that of the women in the corresponding conditions of life . This helps to produce the corresponding mistaken notion that the women in " America 's are handsomer than the men ; upon the incorrectness and essential absurd . ity of which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yankee woman I must express my surprised dissent . I have not only read , but heard their intelligence and social qualities rated much higher than that of their sisters in England . Fair countrywomen , heed not this flattery . It is not true . The typical Englishwoman of the upper and upper middle class has in strength of mind and in information no type counterpart in " America . " She may not know Latin , and she may , and get little good by it ; she may not be brilliant , or quick , or self-adaptive , and she generally is not ; but she is well informed both as to the past and the present ; she shows the effect rather of true education than of school cramming , of culture inherited and slowly acquired , and of intercourse with able , highly educated , and cultivated men . She generally has some accomplishment which she has acquired in no mere showy boarding-school fashion , but with a respectable thoroughness . England is full of ladies who paint well in water colors , or who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are botanists , or who write well , and who add one or more of such acquirements to a solid general education , a considerable knowledge of affairs , and the ability to manage a large household . The conversation of the society in which such women are found is far more interesting , far worthier of respect than that which is heard in fashionable society ( and these women are fashionable ) in " America . " And this without any reproach to the latter . For how could it be otherwise than // that women who are the daughters , sisters , and wives of men who are themselves highly educated , and who have the affairs of a great empire , if not in their hands , at least upon their minds , should in all that can be acquired by intercourse with such men be superior to others most of whom bear the same relations to men who are necessarily inferior in all these respects , who are absorbed in business , and know little beyond their business except what can be learned from the hurried reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , but accumulated culture ; and of this the result appears not only in the men , but in the women . It could not be otherwise . Englishwomen are companions , and friends , and helps to their fathers , their husbands , to all the men of their household . They are not absorbed in the mere external affairs of society ; and society is not entirely in their hands . Men , men of mature years , form the substance of English society ; they give it its tone ; women its grace and its ornamentation . Even in the Englishwoman 's drawing-room the Englishman is looked up to and treated with deference . The talk and the tone must be such as pleases him . She finds her pleasure as well as her duty in making it such as pleases him . She is even there his companion , his friend , his help . No matter how clever or brilliant she may be , she does not seek ten , ir sakrn like the French female bet e#prit . No matter how beautiful or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her society arrangements ; unless , indeed , in either case , she chooses to set propriety at naught and brave an accusation of " bad form . " And indeed , should she attempt this she would probably soon be checked by a very decided interposition of marital authority . The result of all this is a soberer tone in mixed society than we are accustomed to , and the discussion of graver topics in general conversation . And yet in the household the Englishwoman is quite supreme-much more so , I think , than she is in " America . " She really manages all household affairs , troubling her husband with no details ; but being careful to manage in such a way as to please him . For , as I have said before , the wish of the master of an English household is the law of that household . Notwithstanding all this , I have been led to the firm belief that hen-pecking is far more common in England than it is with us , and that curtain lectures are much oftener delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would hardly have suggested themselves to an American humorist , although the thing itself-if not in its perfection , in its germ-is sufficiently known here to make the humor and the satire of that series perfectly appreciated . And , strange to say , the average English husband seems to be a less independent creature than the " American . " English wives more generally insist upon their prerogative of sitting solemnly up for their husbands at night ; and latch-keys are regarded as a personal grievance . What American wife would think of making a fuss about a man 's having a latchkey ? Not a Thw of them , indeed , have one themselves . And yet I have seen an Englishwoman of the lower middle class flush and choke and whimper when the subject of the inalienable right of a man to a latch-key to his own house was broached , and begin to talk about the worm turning when it is trampled upon . The devotion of Englishwomen to their families , and particularly to their children , can not be surpassed . I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives , and mothers in the world , except the good daughters and wives and mothers in " America " ; and even them I believe they generally surpass in submissiveness and thoughtful consideration . But this is the result of the general subordination which in all things pervades English society . It is generally believed in England , I can not tell why , that women in " America " take part in public affairs // and are much more in the eye of the world than Englishwomen are . Of this belief I met with an amusing instance . One day at dinner in a " great house " I had on one side of me a gentleman who had come in alone for lack of ladies enough to " go round " ; it was a small family party . He was the brother of my hostess , a fine , intelligent fellow about twenty-five years old , who had just taken his bachelor 's degree at Oxford . As I turned from his sister to him , in a pause of conversation , he asked me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answered instantly , and with perfect gravity , " Yes ; all of them who are not on duty as sergeants of dragoons . " For one appreciable delightful moment doubt and bewilderment flashed through his bright , handsome eyes , and then he , as well as others within earshot , appreciated the situation , and there was a hearty laugh and an ingenuous blush mantled his cheeksfor young men can blush in England . When I explained that in no part of that strange country " America " with which I was acquainted did women sit on juries , or take any part in public affairs , or even vote or go to public meetings , and that nine in ten of the women that I knew would be puzzled to tell who represented in Congress the districts in which they lived , who were the Senators from their States , and possibly who were their Governors , I was listened to with profound attention ; and the surprise of my hearers was very manifest , and was strongly expressed . It could hardly have been otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into clearer light the fact that women in America are very much less informed upon public affairs and take very much less interest in them than is the case with almost all Englishwomen of the cultivated classes . In England almost all intelligent women of the upper and upper middle classes take a very lively interest in politics , are tolerably well informed upon the public questions of the day , and in many cases they have no inconsiderable influence upon them . The reason of this is that political life and the social life of the upper classes there are so thoroughly intermingled . Politics form the chief concern of the members of those classes ; apart , of course , from their own private affairs . Hardly a woman of that class is without a husband , brother , kinsman , or friend who is , or who has been , or hopes to be a member of Parliament , or who is in diplomacy , or connected in some way with colonial affairs . Politics there are intimately connected with the great object of woman 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , and even for men , to understand the entire severance of politics and society which obtains in " America , " and to believe that a man may be a member of Congress or even a Senator , and yet be entirely without social position . Politics there are the most interesting topic of conversation among intelligent and cultivated people in general society , and such an acquaintance with political questions and party mancenvres as is here confined to a very few women indeed , whose relations to public men are peculiar , and who " go to Washington , " is there very common among all women of superior position . Of this I met with a striking illus. tration on my way from Warwick to Coventry . As I was about entering the railway carriage , a friend , an Englishman , who was kindly travelling with me for a day or two , and " coaching " me , told the porter who had my portmantean to put it into the carriage . This , by the way , is permitted there . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a huge trunk into a first-class railway carriage . In. deed , **26;819;TOOLONG second-class carriage for lack of room ; and a third-class carriage is hardly larger than that marvellous institution knoWn to American women  --  but to no others-as a Saratoga trunk . I objected to my friend 's proposal because there was a lady in the carriage . She was standing with her back to me as // I spoke , but she immediately turned and said , in a clear , sweet voice , " Oh , yes ; bring it in ; never mind me ; there 's quite room enough . " I never saw a more elegant woman . She was about forty years old , still very handsome , tall , with a fine lithe figure , and a gentle loftiness of manner which I might have called aristocratic , had she not reminded me strongly in every way of an " American " woman whom I had known from my boyhood . Nothing could have been more simple , frank , and good-natured than the way in which she made me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her , and who was herself a very lady-like person , soon left us to take her place in a second-class carriage , and we three were left in possession . The train started with that gentle , unobtrusive motion which is usual on English railways , and we fell into the chat of fellow travellers . I was charmed with her . Her voice and her manner of speech would have made the recitation of the multiplication table agreeable . She had a son at Oxford , which I had left a few days before , and it proved that we had common acquaintances there . She showed , with all her superiority of manner , social and personal-for she was what would have bten called in the last generation a superior woman-that deference to manhood which I have mentioned before as a trait of Englishwomen . Ere long my companion mentioned that we had been at Kenilworth that day . She replied , " Oh , I must go there . I have never been . Why I It is just like Americans to go to Kenilworth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle , and to Stratford . " My companion replied that we hal been at a11 those places . She laughed merrily , and said , " You ought to have been Americans to do that . " My friend then told her that I was an " American . " She turned upon me almost with a stare , and after a moment of silence spoke to me again , but with a perceptible and very remarkable change of manner . It was very slight-of a delicate fineness . Her courtesy was not in the least diminished , nor her frankness ; but the perfectly unconscious and careless expression of her face was impaired , and her attention to me was a little more pronounced than it had been before . the inquired if I had been pleased with my visit to Kenilworth , and told me that a novel had been written about it by Sir Walter Scott . " But perhaps you have read it , " she added . " Have you met with it I " I answered , " I have heard of it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had done so with a face so unmoved that she replied with a gracious instructiveness of manner , " Oh , yon should have read it before you went to Kenilworth ; it would so have increased your pleasure . But the next best thing for you is to read it now . " Ithanked her , and said that Ishould like to do so . I think that she would have gone on to recommend a perusal of the works of William Shakespeare to me in connection with my visit to Stratford on Avon , although she looked at me in a puzzled way once or twice . But my companion , although I saw he was amused at something in hertalk , marredwhateverhopes Ihad of further instruction by breaking in with some remark upon the politics of Warwickshire . She rose to his fly like a trout on a hazy day , and in a minute or two she had forgotten my existence in her discussion with him of a topic which plainly was to her of far more interest than all the Scotts that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stood in Stratford . He was a Birmingham magnate , and knew everything that was going on in the country ; but she was his equal in information , and it seemed to me his superior in political craft . To every suggestion of his she made some reply that showed that the question was not new to her . She knew all the ins and outs of the politics of the county : who could be expected to support this men . // sure , who was sure to oppose that . She knew all about the manufacturing interests of Birmingham : who had retired from active management ; who was coming in ; what money had been taken out of this establishment , what changes had taken place in the other , and had an opinion as to what effect this was going to have upon Parliament . I never heard the beginning of such political talk from a woman in America , even from one whose hus*. band was in politics . The train stopped ; her maid appeared , and she bade us courteously good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fellow passenger to whom she had recommended the perusal of " Kenilworth " ; and then my companion told me , what indeed I had been sure of all along , that she was a member of the governing class . A few days before , I had observed in Oxford , where a local election was impending , small posters addressed to " The Burgesses , " and these invariably began " Ladiea and Gentlemen , " a form of " campaign document " as foreign to us as it would be to peoples subject to the S*dique law-than which worse laws have long prevailed in many countries . Not only in politics but in business women appear much more prominently than they do in " America . " If they do not keep hotels , which they sometimes do , they manage them , whether they are great or small . The place which in " America " is filled by that exquisite , awful , and imperturbable being , the hotel clerk , is filled invariably in England by a womanso at least I always found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . To be met by the cheery , pleasant faces of these bright , well-mannered women , to be spoken to as if you were a human being whom , in consideration of what you are to pay , it was a pleasure to make as comfortable as possible , instead of being treated with lofty condescension , or at best with serene indifference , was a pleasant sensation . And these women did their work so quietly and cheerfully , and yet in such a businesslike way , that it was a constant pleasure to come into contact with them . Dressed in black serge or alpaca , they affected no flirting airs , and directed or obeyed promptly and quietly . And yet their womanhood constantly appeared in their manner and in their thoughtfulness for the comfort of those who were in their care . They always had a pleasant word or a smile in answer to a passing remark , were always ready to answer any question or give any information , and were pleased at any acknowledgment of satisfaction . Naturally it was so ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me , for their pleasant ways as well as for their efficiency . From not one of them , from one end of England to the other , in great cities or in quiet country towns and villages , did I receive one surly word or look , or anything but the kindest and promptest attention . I can say the same of the shop women , who waited upon customers not as if they were consciously condescending in the performing of such duties , but cheerfully and pleasantly* and with a show of interest that a ptirchaser should be satisfied . Their dress was almost invariably the same black unornamented serge or alpaca , which , by the way , is the commonest street dress of all women of their condition . In the telegraph offices the clerks are generally women ; and indeed , women seem to do everything except plough , drive omnibuses and railway engines , and be soldiers and policemen . They keep turnpikes , where turnpikes still exist ; and in Sussex I saw a woman 's name with her husband 's upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in all public affairs , from politjcs down to turnpike keeping , women were very much more engaged and before the world in England than in America , although I saw no jury-women or she sergeants . As to the manners of Englishwomen , they are , like the manners of other women , good , bad , and indifferent . // And chiefly they are indifferent ; being in this particular also like others , especially of the Teutonic races ; which races , my readers may like to be reminded , are the Deutsch ( which we call German ) , the Hollanders , the Anglo-Saxon ( or better , the English ) , and the Scandinavians ( Swedes , Korsemen , Danes , and Icelanders ) . The average manners of these peoples , even of the women among them , are on the whole truly indifferent . They are not coarse , but as surely they are not polished . Manner , however , is a very different thing from manners ; and in manner Englishwomen , from the highest class to the lowest , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course excepted . This charm , like all traits and effects of manner , is not easy to describe ; but it left upon me at this time , as it had left before , an impression of its being the outeoming of an intense consciousness of womanhood , and with this a feeling of modest but very firm self-respect . The most intelligent Englishwoman , even in her most exalted moments , never seems to resolve herself into a bare intelligence . Her mind is always clad in woman 's flesh ; and her body thinks . Thus conscious of her own womanhood , she keeps you conscious of it , not merely by the facts that her hair is long , her face beardless , and that her body ( in the evening the lower part of it at least ) is covered with voluminous and marvellous apparel-in a word , not merely by outer show . All this is but the outward sign ; and it might exist-as itso often does , I shall not say where-in women , without the least of that grace , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of moral condition , which is to me the chiefest charm in woman . How often have I sat by one of such women talking-no , talked at ( for it reduces me to silence ) - in such a splendid and overwhelming manner , and with such a superior consciousness of intellectuality , that I could not but think that except for the sik and the lace , and the lack of moustaches , and the evident expectation of a compliment , I might as well have been talking with a man ( only a man would have said more with less fuss ) , and that I longed for the companionship of some pretty , well-bred ignoramus , whose head was full only of common sense , and whose soul as well as whose body was of the female sex . England is not without women of the other kind , I suppose , but they are so rare that I met with none ; while all the women that I did meet had the soft , sweet charm given by the contented consciousness of their womanhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks in every inflection of her voice . No matter how clever she may be , how well informed , she never utters mind pure and simple ; she never lays a bare statement of thought or of fact before you . She is too modest . A piece of her mind she does , in deed , sometimes give you . But then , be sure , she is , of all times , the most thoroughly womanlike and absolved from intellectuality ; being , however , thus in her excitement not peculiar among her sex . At all other times she leaves an impression of gentleness , and a lack of intellectual robustness ; and , if you are a man at least , she , with out any seeming intention of so doing , keeps you constantly in mind that she is trusting to you  --  to your strength , your ability , your position  --  to ensure that she shall be treated with respect and tenderness , and taken care of ; and that therefore she owes you deference , and that it becomes her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the hardest women there is a remnant at least of this . An Englishwoman shall be a sort of she-bagman , a traveller for manufacturers , and in the habit of riding second or even third class alone , from one end of England to the other ( and I talked with such women ) , and she shall yet show you this gentle , womanly consciousness . A woman 's eye there never looks straight and steady into yours , // saying , " I am quite able to take care of my own person , and interests , and reputation . Do n't trouble yourself about me in those respects . Meantime , sir , I am taking your measure . " There is always a mute appeal from her womanhood to your manhood . This charm belongs to the Englishwoman of all ranks , and beautifies everything that she does , even if she does it awkwardly , which is not always . She shows it if she is a great lady and welcomes you , or if she is a housemaid and serves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there are hard , and proud , and cruel , and debased women there , as there are elsewhere . But , apart from these exceptions , this is the manner of Englishwomen ; and , in so far as a man may judge , this manner , or the counterpart of it , does not forsake them when they are among themselves . This soft charm of the Englishwoman 's manner is greatly helped and heightened by her voice and her man ner of speaking . In these she is not only without an equal , but beyond comparison with the women of any other people , except the few of her own blood and tongue in this country , who have like voices and the same utterance . The voices and the speech of Englishwomen of all classes are , with few exceptions , pleasant to the ear-soft and clear ; their words are well articulated , but not precisely pronounced . They speak without much emphasis , yet not monotonously , but with gentle modulation . Their speech is therefore very easily understoodmuch more so than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You rarely or never are obliged to ask an Englishwoman to repeat what she has said because you have failed to catch her words . This soft , yet crisp and clear and easily flowing speech , is , as I have said , common to the whole sex there . I remember that in one of my prowlings about London I found myself in a little , dingy court that opened off Thames street  --  a low , water-side street that runs under London Bridge . It was Sunday morning , and I had come down from Charing Cross in one of the little Thames steamers , to attend service at St. Paul 's , and had half an hour to spare . The street was almost deserted , and so quiet that my footsteps echoed from the walls of the dull and smoke-browned houses . In this court I found two women talking . One was Sairey Gamp . I am sure it was Sairey . The leer upon her heavy face could not be mistaken , and she had grown even a little stouter than when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other was probably Betsey Prig ; she was a mere wisp of a woman ; or , indeed , she may have been Mrs. Harris herself-her shadow-like figure being the next thing in woman form to nonentity . As I passed these two humble people , I was struck by the tone and manner of their speech as they talked earnestly together . Their words and their pronunciation were vulgar enough ; but , as a whole , the speech of both was rich and musical . The whole of that otherwise silent court was filled with the soft murmur of their voices . I had no business there , but I pretended to have , and went from dingy door to dingy door , lingering and loitering all round the court , that I might listen . They did not stare at me any more than I did at them-plainly , they would not have thought of such rudeness  --  but they went on with their talk , speaking their language and mine with tones and inflections that I never heard from two women of like position in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning , at a great house , a country seat , I lingered with my hostess at the breakfast table after all the rest of the family had risen . She touched a bell , and a maid , an upper servant , answered the summons . No servants , by the way , wait at breakfast there , even in great houses . After you are once started , and the tea is made , you are left alone , to wait upon yourselves-a fashion full of comfort , making breakfast the most sociable // meal of the day . When the maid appeared the lady spoke at once , and the servant stopped at the door and replied , and there was a little dialogue about some household matter . The young woman 's answers were little more than , " Yes , my Lady , " and , " No , my Lady , " but I was charmed by them - more so than I have ever been by a lecture or a recitation from the lips of one of the sex . She spoke in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was at the further end of a . Jarge dining-room . Her mistress 's voice was no less clear and sweet and charming , and as they talked , in their low , even tones , with perfect ease and understanding at this distance , the whole of the great room resounded sweetly with this spoken music . When English is spoken in this way by a woman of superior breeding and intelligence there is , of course , an added charm , and it is then the most delightful speech that I ever heard , or can imagine . Compared with it , German becomes hideous and ridiculous , French mean and snappish , Spanish too weak and open-mouthed , and even Italian , noble and sweet as it is , seems to lack a certain firmness and crispness , and to be without a homely charm that it may not lack to those whose mother tbngue is bastard Latin . One reason of this beauty of the speech of Englishwomen is doubtless in the voice itself . An Englishwoman s voice is soft , but it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrating . It is neither guttural nor nasal . While it soothes the ear , it compels attention . Like the tone of a fine old Cremona violin , its softest vibrations make themselves heard and understood when mere noise makes only confusion . Such voices are not entirely lacking among women in **America** but , alas ! how few of the fortunate possessors of such voices here use them worthily ! For the other element of the beauty of the Englishwoman 's speech is in her utterance . " Her voice is ever soft , gentle , and low , an excellent thing in woman . ' ' Shakespeare knew the truth in this , as in so many other things . One of the very few points on which we may be sure of his personal preferences is that he disliked high voices and sharp speech in women . Singular man ! I fear that his ears would suffer here . The Englishwoman 's voice is strong as well as sweet , but her speech is low . She rarely raises her voice . I do not remember having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; but I have heard French and Spanish and Italian women , ladies of unquestionable position and breeding , almost scream , and that , too , in society . Nor does the Englishwoman use much emphasis . Her manner of speech is calm , although without any suggestion of dignity , and her inflections , which rise often , although they are full of meaning , are gentle . I remarked this difference in her speech of itself , but much more when I heard again the speech of my own countrywomen . I had not been in their company five minutes-not one-when I was pierced through from ear to ear . They seemed to me to be talking in italics , to be emphasizing every word , as if they would thrust it into my ears , whether I would or not . They seemed to scream at me . They did scream . I am sure that to their emphatic and almost fierce utterance is due , in a very great measure , the inferior charm of their speech , when compared with that of their sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they would be a little more gentle , a little less self-asserting , a little less determined , and a little more persuasive in their utterance as well as in their manner , lam sure that , with all their other advantages , they need fear no rivalry in womanly charm , even with the truly feminine , sensible , softmannered , sweet-voiced women of England .
