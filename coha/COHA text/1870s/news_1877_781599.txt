txt Mr. KEYSER is not disposed to admit that his bills against the City during the reign of TWEED were too large . This ought not ' to surprise any one who remembers that Mr , KEYSER is a plumber . Years of habitual plumbing have had their legitimate effect in hardening Mr. KEYSER 'S heart , until he is unable to perceive that a plumber may overcharge his victims . If the history of his case survives the present generation , pea , twit ) , will wonder why such a mere matter of detail as the excessive size of his bills was made the foundation of suits against hini , while at the same time ho escaped indictment as a notecious professional plumb or . The system upon which plumbing is practiced is different from that of every other criminal or lawful industry . If a plumber is asked to put in a now faucet of a specified size in any particular house , he makes hiq appearance at 10 o'clock in the morning , and devotes half an hour to an inspection of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou returns to his shop for his tools , and on again reaching the residence of his victim , cuts off the water from the promises and goes to dinner . At 2 o'clock he reappears , and in half an lour finishes the job . When tho unhappy householder receives the plumber 's bill , he finds that it contains four distinct items . There is first a charge of $1 50 for a new faucet ; next.a charge of $1 for putting it in place ; then a charge of $3 for three-quarters of a day 's time , and finally a charge of $2 " for the job . " This ingenious system of charging both for putting in the faucet and for the time consumed in putting it in would alone mark the difference between plumbing'and honest industry ; but the additional charge of $2 " for the job " shows a degree of subtle and malevolent wickedness which is paralleled in no other department of crime . Unfortunately , the public is at the mercy of the plumber . No man can repair his own water-pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be called in . As Dr. WATTS poetically observes , " You ' may break , you may shatter , the third commandment if you will , but the bill of the wicked plumber must be paid still . " . Philadelphians have not hitherto been noted as inventors , unless wo except Mr. KEELY . Nevertheless , it is a Philadelphian who has just invented a stlbstituto for the plumber , so far as one branch of plumbing is concerned . This Philadelphian , in the intervals of washing his front stops and reading the obituary column of the . Ledger , cultivates a small garden , which is provided with a waste-pipe to carry off the drainage of his watering-pot . Of course , this waste-pipe was constantly becoming choked up , as is the habit of waste-pipes ; . and , of course , the services . of the plumber were constantly . in request , The Philadelphian was , therefore , on the high road to bankruptcy , and even had ho possessed the wealth of a Centennial hack-driver , it would have been surely absorbodby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more than once occurred to him that wore he to run aT stont string through the waste-pipe , and fasten a small bunch of rage thereto , he could clean the pipe without any other aid than that of his stnal/ boy . How to.pass the string through the pipe was , however , a problem , and it was the accidental sight of an eel in the Philadelphia market that stiggested to 114 the solution . The ingenious Philadelphian straightway bought a large and lively eel , which ho carried home in a basket . For two days , not having the fear of Mr. BEIM before his eyes , lie starved that eel and read to him extracts from ' . Mr. STANLEY MATTHEWS ' speochesenrith a view of increasing the eel 's desire to escape . On the third day he punched a small hole in the eel 's tail , and passing the end of a String through it , tied it fast . Tho eel was thou introduced into one end of the waste-pipe , and immediately fled downward , dragging the string , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , he would pause for rest , but a slight jerk of the string instantly aroused him to activity . In half an hour ho emerged at the other and of the pipe , when he was caught by the Philadolphian 's small boy and handed over to the cook . Thus the string was successfully passed through the waste-pipe , and the plumber was outwitted . It will be noticed that the passage of the gel 's body through the pipe would have opened a way for the water without the Subsequent aid of the bunch of rags . This shows t is how wo can open our clogged pipes , no matter where they ' are situated . All that we have to do is to buy ton or twelve inches of active eel and insert . it into the choked Up pipe . The desire to escape from confinement , and to sock fresh sewers and rivers green , will lead the eel to force his way through the , pipe in spite of all obstacles , The careful householder would do well to keep an aquarium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bo able to clear his pipes on all occasions , and it is quite possible that small eels might bo prescribed , with excellent results , to children choking with croup . This invention is the first blow that has been struck at the plumber . Onehalf of his opportunities for crime will disappear if the eel comes into general use . Lot us never again revile that slippery animal , or speculate upon the possible uses of Philadelphians . It is the eel which is henceforth to partially relieve us from the yoke of the plumber , and it is a Philadelphian who has shown us how to utilize the eel . In view of the latter fact we need no longer wonder at the existence of Philadelphia , and can almost find it in our heart to forgive and forget the " Centennial. "
