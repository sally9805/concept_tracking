txt There is not much joy in the Democratic household over their new State ticket , if we may judge of the prevailing sentiment from the tone of the party Press . The nom'inees are favorably mentioned , of course , but no one has ventured to predict that they are certain to be elected . On the contrary , confidence has reached no further than to claim that , if elected , they will make very good officers . When Democracy doubts , it ' in despair . When it speaks in this way at its candidates it is certain they will be defeated . The events at Utica were not calculated to inspire Democrats with much confidence in the prospects or character of their ticket . Its head was so unsparingly denounced to the Convention as an abject suppliant for office , that after he was nominated Mr. SEYMOUR felt it necessary to give him a certificate of good character , but he also hinted it was of little consequence what Mr. Wir , LExts might be , since , in the judgment of Mr. SEYMOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of the office of Secretary of State . But this depressing incident was nothing , compared with the despair which has grown out of the surrender to Tammany . The Democrats know that their ticket was made by a convention from which such men as SAMUEL G. COURTNEY and ROSWELL D. HATCH were rudely ejected , while JOHN MORRISSEY , JOHN ' KELLY , and Judge SHANDLEY , who wanted to erect a statue of TWEED , remained in as masters . It would be singular if any Democrat of sound mind believed that a ticket , feeble in itself , nominated under such auspices , had any chance of election . There is no occasion to be surprised , therefore , that the ticket has been coldly received . The only danger we can see , at present , in political prospects in Now-York , is that Democratic indifference may beget Republican apathy . We have always warned our friends against the perils of over-confidence , and the warning was never more needed than in the pending contest . Everybody , Republicans and . Democrats , assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any great number of Republicans think their votes are not needed , and stay at home on election day . From force of habit , the Democrats are certain to vote at least once . Under the most adverse circumstances , they march up to the polls , and vote the straight ticket with a constancy and pluck that we are forced to admire . We must count upon this fidelity of the Democrats to a bad and hopeless cause . What is left of the party will be represented in the ballot-boxes , and enough is left to require all the Republican votes to insure a decisive victory . If this were not the case , the excellence of our State ticket should insure for it a full vote . Every Republican should consider it a privilege to vote for the candidates given him by his State Convention . It is not every year that we can vote for such men as THAYER , HOPmugs , &ELLIMAN,; and their associates , and we should not neglect the opportunity now afforded us to place the State in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the candidates and spirit of the two parties is so striking that all the floating vote which is brought to the polls will incline to the Republicans . From every point of view it is evident that we can , by proper industry , achieve a victory this year as decisive as any of our past triumphs in the Empire State . It should be our aim to surpass the achievements of former years . We can not do it by assuming that no work is needed , and that there is nothing at stake worthy of effort . Work ? hard , earnest work ? is needed . The issues of the contest are as important to the State as were those of last year . They involve not only the proper discharge of the duties of the Executive Departments of the State Government for the next two years , but the wise and economical administration of our canal affairs . The officers to be chosen next month constitute a majority of the Canal Board , and it is vitally important to the interests of the State that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of knaves or fools . The Legislature always nays much deference to the views of the Canal Board in its canal legislation , and this legislation will be sensible in proportion as the Board is enlightened and honest There can be no pretense that the Republican candidates would not deal with the canals in a way to serve the best interests of the State , and for this reason alone they should be chosen by large majorities . Thus far the Republicans , as a whole , have not gone to - work with the zeal and energy the occasion demands . The State Committee has , however , been admirably organized by the choice of Hon. A. B. CORNELL for Chairman , and we may expect the campaign to open with vigor at once . There are only four weeks left before election day , and therefore no time can be wasted . The State Committee can do much , and we are . sure the members will do all in their power , but the burden of the work this year must fall upon the Republican press of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State by public speakers for obvious reasons , and our journals must not fail to keep the importance of pending issues before the people , and urge upon them a full performance of their political duties . We observe that the chief Republican journals of the State are aware of this necessity , and the fact increases our confidence that a brilliant triumph awaits us.
