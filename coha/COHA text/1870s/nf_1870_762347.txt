txt //stinguished in all details appertaining to the employment of the needle , ladies are indebted for an arrangement by which the same thread used in the making of the pattern is used for fastening the work . The old plan only provided for the working of the different portions which constituted the pattern , and then these portions had to be sewn together with a needle and thread . The ingenious workers on the Continent have also given much attention of late to the art of tatting , and our instructions now printed comprise what we consider the best mode of learning and doing this exceedingly interesting and fashionable work . Illustration : Tatting Pin . Tatting differs entirely from crochet , and is composed of stitches forming knots . It is intended as an imitation of point lace , and is especially used for trimming under-linen , on account of its strength . To make the stitches or knots a small instrument is used , called a shuttle . This shuttle consists of two oval pieces , flat on one side and convex on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two oval pieces are joined together by a strong cross-piece . The illustration shows the construction of the shuttle . These shuttles are made in ivory , pearl , tortoiseshell inlaid with pearl , and silver ; they are also manufactured in coloured bone , black , red , and white . The best to work with are the pearl for a white shuttle , and the inlaid tortoiseshell for a black shuttle ; the prices vary from sixpence to one shilling and two-and-sixpence each . In selecting a shuttle be careful to see that the ends close , as if dropped it soon becomes unthreaded , which is very inconvenient . The cotton intended for the work is wound round this shuttle , and the thickness of the cotton varies according to the style of work . It is better to use the proper tatting cotton , because it is stronger than the ordinary kinds ; this is manufactured by Messrs . Walter Evans and Co. for the purpose . Their Boar 's Head Cotton is also frequently used , and answers very well . Shuttles . These are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 , useful medium size ; No. 3 , the largest . The Way to Hold the Hands . Take the shuttle in the right hand , between the thumb and second finger , and allow the forefinger to remain at liberty , and rest the under part of the shuttle between the second and third and on the middle finger . Place the thread round the three middle fingers of the left hand , so as to form a loop , keeping the second and third fingers a little apart , and bring the cotton again between the thumb and forefinger , letting the end fall within the palm of the hand , while the end of cotton which holds on to the shuttle passes over the thumb-nail . To Make a Stitch . Keep the hands in the position above described ; pass the shuttle at the back , through the loop  --  that is , between the second and third fingers . Take the end of the shuttle which comes out from the loop between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand , and strain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn through the loop , this cotton must not be impeded by the fourth finger ; it should , on the contrary , slide over it , and be drawn tight . It should divide the loop into two parts . After this withdraw the second left-hand finger , which is above the cotton , and pass it again under that cotton , so as to draw up the loop . A half-stitch is thus formed , and must be tightened by being drawn closely to the forefinger and thumb of the left hand . For the remaining half of the stitch keep the hands in the same position , but , instead of letting the cotton fall over the thumb , pass this cotton over the back of the hand ; then let the shuttle fall between the second and third fingers of the left hand , in front , and take it out again at the back , strain the cotton very tightly , withdraw the second finger from the loop , letting the cotton which is behind the hand sweep over the fingers . When this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand this second half-stitch up to the other , thus completing one stitch . The Way to Make a Loop in Tatting . When a certain number of stitches are made , very tightly draw in the loop by straining the cotton until the first stitch touches the last , and thus a loop is formed . During this process the stitches should be held tightly between the forefinger and thumb . The Way to Make a Purl . A purl is a small loop of cotton often used as an edging in tatting , as , for instance , round the outer edge of the ovals in tatted insertion No. 2 . The following is the easiest method of making a purl :  --  The stitches are not made quite closely together at the place where a purl is to be made ; about one-sixth of an inch is left between each . This space is left free until the loop is made by uniting the stitches ; then the small piece of cotton in the space bulges out between the stitches , and forms the purl . If several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three stitches , according to the desired number . Care must be taken in that case that the small pieces of cotton left be all of the same length , so that the purl may be perfectly even . The purl can also be made thus : At the same time with the end of thread take the tatting-pin or a very large darning needle or knitting needle in the left hand , so that the point may come out farther than the row of stitches ; if then you wish to make a purl , throw the cotton on the pin before making the stitch ; then fasten this stitch , and push it at once close to the preceding ; the pin with the cotton should come above the stitches . Do not take out the pin before all the purl and all the stitches are completed and joined together . Joining the Work . Place the tatting-pin in the loop that is to be joined , and with the hook draw the thread of the loop  --  that is , round the hand through it  --  pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly close to the stitches . A " straight " or double thread is used to join various parts of the work , and forms very beautiful patterns . Without the straight thread we should be unable to imitate point lace patterns , or , indeed , to execute any designs but those composed of circles , ovals , &c.; To use this straight thread 2 shuttles are required ; they should be of different colours . Sometimes one end of thread is left attached to the reel instead of using the second shuttle . In commencing a loop the straight thread is held between the second and third fingers of the left hand , about 2 or 3 inches from the work ; the other shuttle is held as usual in the right hand , and the stitches and purls worked with it upon the foundation of the straight thread of the second shuttle . * * * * * TATTING. 1 .  --  Pine Pattern Collar in Tatting .

This pattern is suitable for trimming cravats , collars , pocket-handkerchiefs , petticoats , &c.,; according to the size of the cotton with which it is worked . Work first the round of circles which incloses the leaves , overlapping each other in the centre ; begin with the smallest circle , which is at the top of the pattern ; it consists of 3 double , 1 purl , 7 double , 1 purl , 7 double , 1 purl , 3 double .

Work 11 circles more like the 2nd to 12th of those just described ( the 13th circle forms the middle ) , only the order of sizes must be reversed , so that the round closes with the smallest circle . Then fasten both ends of the cotton together , so that the circles are joined into a circle . Then work round this row of circles another round , the circles of which must be of graduated sizes like those of the first round . Fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of the first small circle of the first round , and work one circle as follows :  --  3 double , 1 purl , 6 times alternately 2 double , 1 purl , then 3 double ; fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of the next circle , &c.; The remaining circles are worked in the same manner , only they must be increased and decreased in size gradually like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing or decreasing the number of purl , instead of working the first purl of every following circle , fasten it on to the last purl of the preceding circle . When the round is completed , fasten both ends of the cotton together . In the centre of the oval pattern , fasten 6 five-branched patterns of graduated size , which are worked in one piece . For the smallest of these patterns work first three circles , consisting of 5 double , 1 purl , 5 times alternately 2 double , 1 purl , then again 5 double ( these circles must be close to each other ; the second and third circles must , moreover , be fastened on to the last purl of the preceding circle ) . The cotton is then fastened on the first circle between the beginning and the end of the same , then work close to them two small circles , consisting of 6 double , 1 purl , 6 double , fasten the cotton between the beginning and the end of the third circle . The other five-branched patterns are worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch ; but the separate circles of each pattern must become gradually larger . In the largest pattern the three large circles consist of 5 double , 1 purl , 8 times alternately 2 double , 1 purl , 5 double ; the two smaller circles consist each of 15 double , 1 purl , 15 double ; the size of the other patterns can easily be worked from this ; the cotton which joins these last together is covered by over-casting with a needle and thread , so as to imitate double stitches . The five-branched patterns are then fastened in the oval pattern ; they must overlap each other to half way , as seen in the illustration . * * * * * 59.  --  Tatted Diamond . Materials : Messrs .

Turn the work again , work a scallop like the preceding one , and repeat 15 times more from * , only the scallops at the lower edge of the medallion must have a few double stitches more , as can be seen in illustration . After working the last scallop fasten the two ends of the cotton on to the 1st circle ; then cut them off . The second inner half is worked like the first ; only the circles are worked without any purl stitch , and fastened on to the circles of the first half from illustration ; the scallops of this half are somewhat smaller ; each consists of 5 double , 1 purl , 5 double . The completed border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pieces must be first fastened on cardboard . The cotton must be wound several times round the long threads , as seen in illustration . The medallion is then sewn into the muslin at the top only ; the remaining border is edged , before joining it to the muslin , with a straight row of knots to be worked over cotton , and fastened on to each outer scallop of the border at regular intervals . The number of double stitches between two purl is different , as distinctly seen in illustration . For the lace knot both ends of cotton together , * work with one shuttle only 1 circle consisting of 8 double , 1 purl , 8 double ; turn the work and make another circle consisting of 2 double , 9 times alternately 1 purl , 2 double ; then fasten this circle on to the preceding one , where it has been joined into a circle , so that both circles meet as seen in illustration .

The art of embroidering with cotton on linen , muslin , cambric , pique , &c.,; is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The size of the thread and needle must correspond to that of the material on which you embroider ; the needle must not be too long , and the cotton must be soft . Messrs . Walter Evans and Co. ' s embroidery cotton is the best . Skilful embroiderers never work over anything , because when you tack the material on paper or cloth each stitch shows , and if the material is very fine , leaves small holes ; but for those that are learning we should advise them to tack the material to be embroidered upon a piece of toile ciree . If you work without this , place the material straight over the forefinger of the left hand ; the material must never be held slantways . The three other fingers of the left hand hold the work ; the thumb remains free to give the right position to each stitch . The work must always , if possible , lie so that the outline of the pattern is turned towards the person who works . For the sake of greater clearness one part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preparing the patterns is one of the most important things in embroidery , for the shape of the patterns is often spoiled merely because they have not been prepared with sufficient care . Illustration : 66.  --  Scallop . ILLUSTRATION 66 shows how to prepare a scallop . Take thicker cotton than that with which you work ; never commence with a knot , and do not take a thread longer than sixteen or eighteen inches . The outlines of the scallops are first traced with short straight stitches . In the corners particularly the stitches must be short . The space between the outlines is filled with chain stitches , as can be seen from illustration ; they must not be too long , otherwise the embroidery will look coarse . It is in this way that every pattern to be worked in button-hole or satin stitch is to be prepared . Illustration : 67.  --  Double Overcast Stitch . ILLUSTRATION 67 shows the double overcast stitch or button-hole stitch in a straight line . After having traced the outline begin to work from left to right ; fasten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb of the left hand under the outline , insert the needle downwards above the outline , draw it out under the same above the cotton which you hold in the left hand , and draw it up . Repeat for all the stitches in the same manner ; they must be regular and lie close to one another . Great care should be taken that the material on which you embroider is not puckered . Illustration : 68.  --  Overcast Stitch . ILLUSTRATION 68 ( Overcast Stitch ) .  --  The double overcast and the button-hole stitches are worked from left to right , whilst back stitches , knotted and satin stitches are worked from right to left . The stitch is worked in the same way as the double overcast , only the needle must never be drawn out above , but below , the cotton with which you work , and which you keep down with the thumb of the left hand . Illustration : 69.  --  Slanting Overcast Stitch . ILLUSTRATION 69.  --  The slanting overcast stitch is worked without tracing the outline , always inserting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The needle must be inserted in the manner shown in illustration  --  that is , not straight , but slanting ; insert it a little farther than the last stitch , and draw it out close to it . The wrong side of the work must show back stitches . This sort of stitch is used for the fine outlines in patterns or letter . Illustration : 70.  --  Back Stitch . ILLUSTRATION 70.  --  This shows the back stitch , the working of which is well known ; it is worked in several rows close to each other . Illustration : 71.  --  Point Croise . Illustration : 72.  --  Point Croise . ILLUSTRATIONS 71 &; 72 show another kind of back stitch , called point croise , which is only used on very thin and transparent materials . This stitch forms on the wrong side a sort of darned pattern , which is seen by transparence on the right side , and gives the embroidered pattern a thicker appearance , contrasting with the rest of the work ( see the lower leaves of the flower on illustration 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material as for the common back stitch , draw it out underneath the needle on the opposite outline of the pattern , so as to form on the wrong side a slanting line . Insert the needle again as for common back stitch ; draw it out slanting at the place marked for the next stitch on the opposite outline , as shown in illustration 71 . Illustration : 73  --  - Knotted Stitch . ILLUSTRATION 73 shows the knotted stitch ; the simplest way of working it is to work two back stitches at a short distance from each other over the same thread . The knotted stitch seen in ILLUSTRATION 74 is worked thus :  --  Take about four threads of the material on the needle , draw the needle half out , wind the cotton twice round the point of the needle , hold it tight with the thumb , draw the needle out carefully and insert it at the place where the stitch was begun , and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to be worked . Illustration : 74.  --  Knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch seen on ILLUSTRATION 75 is worked in nearly the same manner as the preceding one . Before drawing the cotton out of the material hold it tight with the left-hand thumb ; leave the needle in the same position , wind the cotton twice round it , turn the needle from left to right , so ( follow the direction of the arrow ) that its point arrives where the cotton was drawn out ( marked by a cross in illustration ) , insert the needle there , and draw it out at the place of the next stitch . ILLUSTRATIONS 76 &; 77.  --  Raised satin stitch is principally used for blossoms , flowers , leaves , letters , &c.; After having traced the outlines of the pattern , fill the space left between them with chain stitches in a direction different from that in which the pattern is to be embroidered ; begin at the point of the leaf , working from right to left , make short straight stitches , always Illustration : 76.  --  Raised Satin Stitch. inserting the needle close above the outline and drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as on the branches , must be begun from the point , because they thus acquire a better shape . If you wish to work a leaf divided in the middle , as seen in illustration 77 , you must trace the veining before you fill it with chain stitches , then begin at one point of the leaf and work first one half and then the other . Illustration : 77.  --  Raised Satin Stitch . Illustration : 78.  --  Point de Plume . ILLUSTRATION 78 shows the so-called point de plume on a scalloped leaf . It is worked like the satin stitch , only the needle is drawn through the material in a slanting direction . Illustration : 79.  --  Point de Minute .

You can work either in applique of muslin on muslin , or of muslin on net , or of net on net . Muslin on Brussels net is the prettiest way of working in applique ; we will therefore describe it : the other materials are worked in the same manner . Trace the pattern on the muslin , fasten the latter on the net , and trace the outlines of the pattern with very small stitches work them in overcast stitch with very fine cotton , taking care not to pucker the material . The veinings are worked in overcast . When the pattern has been embroidered cut away the muslin round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounding ( see No. 117 ) .

All depends on the fineness and regularity of the stitches ; they must be worked in overcast stitch . Work from left to right , and the letter when completed must look rather like raised printing than like embroidery .

In working the following Embroidery Patterns it will be found advisable to trace the design clearly upon tracing-paper with a sharp-pointed lead pencil . The pattern thus traced must be perforated with a fine needle in a succession of tiny holes , at the rate of about twenty to the inch . Those ladies who possess a sewing-machine will find no difficulty in accomplishing this . Several thicknesses of paper can be perforated at the same time , if required , by any ordinary machine . To transfer the traced and perforated design to the fabric to be embroidered , it is only necessary to rub a small quantity of powder blue through the holes. 131.  --  Insertion in Embroidery .

Illustration : A Crochet-Needle Cotton or thread , wool or silk , with a crochet-needle , are the materials required for working crochet . The needle , whether it be steel or bone , must be smoothly polished . The long wooden and bone crochet-needles are used for wool ; for cotton and silk work short steel needles screwed into a bone handle are best . The beauty of the crochet-work depends upon the regularity of the stitches , as is the case with every other style of needlework . The stitches must be elastic , but if too loose they look as bad as if too tight . The size of the needle and that of the cotton or wool must correspond ; work only with the point of the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle . The cotton with which you work must be of the very best quality ; for borders , insertions , rosettes , imitation of guipure , use Evans 's crochet cotton ; for couvrettes , counterpanes , covers , &c.,; use knitting-cotton . All crochet-work patterns are begun on a foundation chain ; there are three kinds of foundation chains  --  the plain foundation , the double foundation , and the purl foundation chain .

It can be employed for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk over straw . A ruche trimmed with beads and bows of brown silk ribbon form the trimming of the basket . The straws over which you crochet must be damp , so as not to be stiff .

Each half of the cover requires 9 rows ; the last one is worked over wire . The two halves are united at the straight sides by a brown silk ribbon 1-1/4 inch wide , which is sewed on underneath , and which forms a sort of hinge ; sew on also a piece of wire covered with brown silk , so as to make the hinge stronger . Form the handle with a piece of bamboo cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it in long stitches of brown silk , and let it go down to the bottom of the basket ; then sew the cover on the handle with the brown ribbon , which forms the two parts .

Walter Evans and Co. ' s crochet cotton , and a needle to match . This pattern , as can be seen in illustration , is an imitation of old guipure lace ; it is worked all in one piece for the bosom and sleeves , and is part of one of the shoulder-pieces in full size . Both strips of rosettes join at that place , and one is continued for the part round the bosom and the other for the sleeve . In the pattern there are 42 rosettes round the bosom , and 14 round each sleeve . These rosettes are fastened one to another in the course of the work . They are made in the following manner :  --  Make a chain of 6 stitches , and join it into a ring . 1st round : 8 chain , 1 slip stitch in the 4th chain , which forms a purl ( the 3 first chain are reckoned as 1 treble ) , 1 chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 slip stitch in the 1st to form a purl , 1 chain , 1 treble in the ring .

The joining between the part round the bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The space left between 4 rosettes is filled up with a star formed of chain stitches , marked in our illustration with an asterisk . For this star make a chain of 5 stitches , the 1st of which forms the centre ; slip the loop you have on the needle through one of the 8 purl that are free , make 5 chain , 1 double in the centre stitch . Repeat 7 times from * ; then tie the two ends tightly , or sew them together 3 of these stars are required for each shoulder . Illustration : 286.  --  Crochet Trimming for a Lady 's Chemise .

Knitting has never entirely quitted the hands of English and German ladies ; indeed , among all good housewives of any civilised country , it is reckoned an indispensable accomplishment . Knitting schools have been established of late years both in Ireland and Scotland , and Her Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as largely patronised the industrial knitters of Scotland . Of the rudiments of this useful art many ladies are at present ignorant ; it is in the hope of being useful to these that the following instructions are offered . To knit , two , three , four , or five needles , and either thread , cotton , silk , or wool are required . Knitting needles are made of steel , of ivory , or of wood ; the size to be used depends entirely upon the material employed , whether thread , cotton , silk , single or double wool , for knitting . As the size of the needles depends upon that of the cotton , a knitting gauge is used ( see No. 287 ) . The gauge ( page 290 ) is the exact size of Messrs . H. Walker and Co. ' s knitting gauge . Our readers will remark that English and foreign gauges differ very essentially ; the finest size of German needles , for example , is No. 1 , which is the size of the coarsest English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two needles only for round knitting for socks , stockings , &c.,; three , four , and five needles are employed . Illustration : 287.  --  Knitting Gauge. * * * * * 288.  --  Casting On . This term is used for placing the first row or round of knitting stitches on the needles  --  " casting them on "  --  and is done in two ways  --  by " knitting on " the stitches , or as follows :  --  Hold the thread between the first and second finger of the left hand , throw it over the thumb and first finger so as to form a loop , and pass the needle in the loop ; throw the thread lightly round the needle , pass it through the loop , and draw up the thread ; this forms the first stitch ( see No. 288 ) . Illustration : 288.  --  Casting On. 289.  --  To Knit On . Illustration : 289.  --  Knitting On . Take the needle on which the stitches are cast in the left hand , and another needle in the right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Hold the left-hand needle between the thumb and third finger , leaving the first finger free to move the points of the needles . ( The wonderful sense of touch in the first or index finger is so delicate , that an experienced knitter can work without ever looking at her fingers , by the help of this touch only  --  in fact , knitting becomes a purely mechanical labour , and as such is most useful . ) Insert the point of the right-hand needle in the loop or stitch formed on the left-hand needle , bring the thread once round , turning the point of the needle in front under the stitch , bringing up the thread thrown over , which in its turn becomes a stitch , and is placed on the left-hand needle . 290.  --  Simple Knitting ( plain ) . Illustration : 290.  --  Plain Knitting . Pass the right-hand needle into the 1st stitch of the left-hand needle , at the back throw the thread forward , and with the first finger pass the point of the needle under the stitch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in " knitting on , " only , instead of placing the newly-formed stitch on the left-hand needle , leave it on the right-hand needle , and let the stitch drop off the point of the left-hand needle . Continue thus until all the stitches are taken from the left to the right-hand needle , and the row is then complete . 291.  --  To Purl , Pearl , or Seam . Seaming or purling a stitch is done by taking up the stitch in front instead of at the back , throwing the thread over and knitting the stitch as in plain knitting ; but before beginning to purl , the thread must be brought in front of the needle , and if a plain stitch follows , the thread is passed back after the purl stitch is made ( see No. 291 ) . Illustration : 291.  --  Purling. 292.  --  To Increase . Increasing or making a stitch is done by throwing the thread once round the needle and in the next row knitting it as an ordinary stitch . Illustration : 292.  --  Increasing. 293. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : firstly , taking up two stitches and knitting them together as one ; secondly , by taking up a stitch without knitting it , called slipping , then by knitting the following stitch in the usual way , and then slipping the 1st ( unknitted ) over the 2nd ( knitted ) ( see No. 293 ) . When it is necessary to decrease two stitches at once , proceed thus :  --  Slip one , knit two stitches together , then slip the unknitted stitch over the two knitted together . Illustration : 293.  --  Decreasing. 294.  --  Round Knitting . To knit a round four or five needles are used ; it is thus that stockings , socks , cuffs , mittens , &c.,; are made . To knit with four needles , cast on , say , 32 stitches upon one needle , insert a second needle in the last stitch of the first , and cast on 30 stitches ; proceed in a similar way with a third needle , but casting on 28 only ; when this is done , knit the two extra stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes 30 stitches upon each needle , and completes the round . 295.  --  Casting Off . Knit two stitches , and with the left-hand needle slip the first stitch over the second ; continue this to the end of the row . Note .  --  The last knitted row , before casting off , should be knitted loosely . 296.  --  To Pick up a Stitch . This is done by taking up the thread between two stitches and forming a stitch with it . * * * * * The following Designs of New Stitches can be used for a variety of work :  --  297.  --  Peacock 's Tail Pattern . Needles , wood or ivory ; Messrs . Walter Evans and Co. ' s knitting cotton . Illustration : 297.  --  Peacock 's Tail Pattern . Cast on a number of stitches divisible by nine , as it takes nine stitches for each pattern , and two for each border ; the border , which is in plain knitting , will not be mentioned after the first row . 1st Row .  --  2 plain for border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeat this four times from * , make 1 , 2 plain ; repeat from the beginning  --  then 2 plain for border . 2nd Row .  --  2 purl , 11 plain , 2 purl ; repeat .

Then cut the strip down the centre , and unravel the wool on each side . The threads of wool all curling , resemble moss . They are held firmly by the selvedge of the knitting . * * * * * 301.  --  German Brioche Stitch Materials : Wood or ivory needles ; wool . Cast on an even number of stitches .

Note .  --  The made stitch and the slipped stitch of the previous row must always be knitted together , and the decreased stitch of that row slipped . * * * * * NETTING . 302.  --  NETTING is one of the prettiest and one of the easiest accomplishments of a lady . The materials are simple , while the effects produced by good netting are most elegant and of great durability . One great advantage of netting is that each stitch is finished and independent of the next , so that if an accident happens to one stitch it does not , as in crochet or knitting , spoil the whole work . Netting , so easy to do , is most difficult to describe . The materials required are  --  a netting-needle and mesh ( see illustration No. 302 ) . These are made of bone , of wood , of ivory , and most commonly of steel . The wood , bone , and ivory are only used for netting wool , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled by passing the end of the thread through the little hole at the left-hand point , and tying it ; then the thread is wound on the needle as on a tatting shuttle . The needles are numbered from 12 to 24 ; these last are extremely fine . The meshes correspond to the sizes of the needles , and are made of the same materials . The larger the size of the stitch required the thicker the mesh must be selected ; indeed , large hat meshes are often used for some patterns . A stirrup to slip over the foot to which the foundation is attached is required by those who do not use a netting cushion , placed before them on the table and heavily weighted ; to this the foundation is fastened . The stirrup is made of a loop of ribbon , to which the foundation is tied . Some ladies work a pretty stirrup of the exact shape of a horseman 's stirrup ; a loop of ribbon is passed through this , and the foundation fixed as before . Illustration 302.  --  Needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the thread , between the thumb and finger of the left hand ; it must rest on the middle of the finger and be held only by the thumb ( see illustration No. 303 ) . Take the needle in the right hand , pass the thread over the middle and ring finger and over the mesh , pass the needle upwards and behind the mesh in the large loop which forms the thread round the fingers , and at the same time through the first stitch or loop of the foundation . Draw the needle out , retaining the loops on the fingers and dropping them off , the little finger being the last to release the thread . As the thread tightens and the knot is firm , the loop on the little finger should be drawn up quickly and smartly . The next stitches are precisely similar , and row upon row is formed in the same manner . Having learnt the stitch , the next task is to make a foundation . Tie a large loop of strong thread on the stirrup ribbon , and net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five rows , and the foundation is ready . Illustration : 303.  --  Netting . Simple netting as above explained forms diamonds or lozenges . When a piece of netting is finished it is cut off the foundation , and the little ends of thread that held the stitches are drawn out . 304.  --  Square Netting . Is done precisely in the same manner as plain netting , only begin from one stitch , then net two stitches into this first , and increase by making two in the last loop of every row . As soon as the right number of stitches is complete diminish exactly in the same way by netting two stitches as one at the end of each row until one stitch alone remains . These squares are used for guipure d'art and for darning on . 305.  --  Round Netting Is nearly similar to plain netting . A little difference exists in the way of passing the needle through the stitch ; this is shown in No. 305 . After having passed the needle through the stitch it is drawn out and passed from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective for purses . Illustration : 305.  --  Round Netting. 306.  --  Diamond Netting Is often called " pointed netting , " and is made by netting from one stitch , increasing one stitch at the end of each row , and decreasing in the same way , as described at page 303. 307.  --  To Net Rounds . To form a circle , as for a purse , the needle must pass through the first stitch , keeping the last three or four on the mesh and removing this when required by the work . 308.  --  " English " Netting Is made as follows :  --  Net a row of plain netting , begin the second row by netting the second stitch , then net the first ; repeat , always passing by one stitch and taking it up . 3rd Row .  --  Plain . 4th Row .  --  Begin by a plain stitch , then continue as in the 2nd row . 5th Row .  --  Plain . Illustration : 308.  --  " English " Netting. 309.  --  Lace Edging . Begin by one stitch and net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many stitches are required for the narrowest part of the edge . * Increase one then in the two loops until the point of the edge or scallop is reached ; at the next row leave the squares which form the point , and begin from * . 310.  --  Open Lace . This kind of edging is made with two meshes of different sizes and extremely fine crochet cotton . Tie the thread to the foundation , net 3 rows with the small mesh of the required length . 4th Row .  --  On the large mesh , one stitch in each stitch . 5th Row .  --  On the small mesh take 3 stitches together to form 1 loop ; repeat to end of row . 6th Row .  --  On the large mesh make 5 loops in each stitch ; repeat to end of row . Illustration : 310.  --  Open Lace. 7th Row .  --  On the small mesh , one loop in each of the 4 first stitches , pass over the 5th , repeat to end . 8th Row .  --  On the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches , pass over the 4th ; repeat . 9th Row .  --  On the small mesh make a loop in each of the two first stitches , pass over the 3rd ; repeat . This lace is often used in fine wool of two colours to trim opera-caps , children 's hoods , &c.; 311.  --  Shell Border . This border is intended as an edging for square netting for couvrettes , d'oyleys , &c.; The mesh must be three times as long as that employed for the square netting . Make 12 stitches in the first stitch of the edge , pass over 8 , make 12 in the ninth , and repeat . Then take the mesh used for the square netting , and net one stitch in each stitch , take a still smaller mesh , and complete by adding another row of one stitch in each stitch . This border forms a very appropriate edging for all articles in square netting , as couvrettes , mats , also for trimming guipure d'art work , and should be netted in the row of holes edging the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners when a little fulness is required .

Materials for one pair : 4 ounces white fleecy , 3 ply ; 1 ounces light blue fleecy . Illustration : 314.  --  Knitted Sleeping Sock . These socks are knitted with white and blue wool in a diamond pattern , and in rounds like a stocking . Begin at the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue wool on pretty thick steel knitting-needles , and knit 20 rounds of the diamond pattern as follows :  --  1st round : Quite plain . 2nd round : Purled ; both these rounds are worked with blue wool . 3rd to 6th rounds : Knitted plain with white wool . 7th round : With blue wool ; knit 3 , draw the wool through the next stitch of the 2nd round worked with blue wool , draw it out as a loop , keep it on the needle , knit again 3 stitches , and so on . 8th round : With blue wool ; the loop which has been taken up on the preceding round is purled off together with the preceding stitch . Repeat the 3rd and 8th rounds twice more ; the loop of one round must be placed between those of the preceding one . Then knit with white wool 31 rounds , alternately 2 stitches knitted , 2 stitches purled , then work the foot in the diamond pattern in the same way as usual for a stocking . The heel is formed by leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted backwards and forwards in the diamond pattern . At the toe decrease so that the decreasings form a seam on both sides of the toe . This is obtained by knitting the 3rd and 4th stitches of the 1st needle together ; on the 2nd needle slip the 4th stitch before the last , knit the next stitch and draw the slipped stitch over the knitted one ; decrease in the same manner on the other 2 needles of this round . Repeat these decreasings exactly in the same direction and at the same places , so that there are always 4 stitches between the 2 decreasings at the end and at the beginning of 2 needles ; they always take place after 3 or 2 plain rounds , and at last after 1 plain round . The remaining stitches are knitted off 2 and 2 together . To complete the sock , the outline of the sole is marked by working slip stitches with blue wool in crochet all round it ; work also slip stitches on the selvedge stitch of the heel . The stocking is finished off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue wool , worked over a mesh four-fifths of an inch wide . * * * * * 315 and 316.  --  Netted Fichu or Cape . Material : Fine wool , or white and blue silk ; netting needle and meshes . This fichu or cape is made either with fine wool or with silk used three or four times double . It may be worn as an evening wrap , either over a cap or on the hair , or as a necktie . The ground in our pattern is white , the border blue . The illustration of the ground and of the border , in full size , will serve as a guide for the size of the meshes to be used . For the ground cast on the first mesh , with white silk , 56 stitches ; work 2 rows on the 56 stitches . From the 3rd row , always miss the last stitch , so that each row is decreased 1 stitch . Continue in this manner till the 39th row , when there will be but 19 stitches left . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each row . The ground is completed with the 46th row . The 1st row of the work is the cross-way side ; the last , the point at the bottom ; fasten on the blue silk to the 1st stitch of the 1st row , and on a larger mesh work 1 row round the ground of the fichu , not forgetting that the stitch on the outer edge at the sides must always be taken , and 2 stitches made in the 5th , 10th , 14th , Illustration : 315.  --  Netted Fichu , or Cape , for Evening Dress. 18th , 21st , 23rd , and 25th stitches at the sides , as well as in each of the 2 middle stitches of the last row ; in each of the other stitches 1 stitch should be made . On the corners of the sides increase once , on the cross-way side , seven times in all . This forms the 1st round of the edging or lace .

Materials : 2 skeins of black purse silk ; 2 skeins of scarlet ditto ; black jet beads ; a steel clasp with chain ; a tassel of black beads ; 5 steel knitting-needles . Illustration : 317.  --  Lady 's Knitted Purse . This purse is knitted with black and scarlet purse silk , and ornamented with black beads and a black bead tassel . Begin the purse with the black silk in the centre of the bottom part , and cast on for one part of it 7 stitches . Knit 14 rows on these backwards and forwards , in such a manner that the work is knitted on one side and purled on the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of this part is purled. * On that side where hangs the thread with which you work take the back chain of the 7 selvedge stitches of the part you have just knitted on a separate needle , and knit another part , which must have 15 rows , and the 1st row of which is knitted . Repeat 10 times more from * . The stitches of several parts can be taken on the same needle , so as not to be hindered in working by too many needles . When the 12th part is completed , take the selvedge stitches on the left hand on another needle , cast them off together with the cast on stitches of the 1st part , and fasten the silk thread . Then take the 7 right-hand selvedge stitches of one black part on a needle , take the red silk on which the beads have been strung and work 15 rows on these stitches , the 1st row from the wrong side , and therefore purled ; in the 1st , as well as in all the other purled rows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch of the next black part . In the purled rows , moreover , excepting in the first and last one , a bead must be worked in after casting off the 2nd , 4th , and 6th stitches . The stitch must be worked by inserting the needle into the back part , and in drawing through the silk which has been thrown forward , let the bead slide through the stitch so that it is on the right side of the work . In the following knitted row , the needle must also be inserted into the back part of the bead stitch . When 12 such red parts have been completed , work again 12 black parts on the selvedge stitch of the same , in which the beads are not knitted in , but sewn on afterwards , when the purse is completed . Then work 3 times more alternately 12 red and 12 black parts ; when the last 12 black parts have been completed cast off the stitches of the last black part together with the selvedge stitches , the 1st on the wrong side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same manner together with the selvedge stitches of the 7th . The red parts which remain to be worked on the black part are thus lessened by 2 ; the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th , and the 7th , 8th , and 9th of these parts must be by 6 rows longer . Then gather all the stitches and selvedge stitches of the 10 parts on 2 needles , in such a manner that the 2 black parts , the stitches and selvedge stitches of which have been cast off together , are placed on the sides of the purse , and knit as follows with black silk , first on the stitches of the one needle , and then on those of the other :  --  1 row knitted , knitting together every 3rd and 4th stitch ; then work 3 rows backwards and forwards on the same number of stitches , which must be knitted on the right side ; then work 8 rows more in the same manner , casting off the 2 first stitches of the 8 rows . Then cast off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts from illustration ; also the clasp and bead tassel . * * * * * 318 to 320.  --  Knitted Antimacassar or Berceaunelle Cover . Materials : Grey and violot fleecy wool . Illustration : 318.  --  Square for Antimacassar . This antimacassar , part of which is seen on No. 320 , smaller than full size , is made of rosettes and small squares , which are knitted separately with violet and grey fleecy wool with fine knitting-needles . In the middle of each rosette sew on a tatted circle of grey wool . The edge of the antimacassar is ornamented with a grey woollen fringe . For each rosette cast on 6 stitches with violet wool , and knit 12 rows backwards and forwards in such a manner that the work is knitted on one side and purled on the other : the first of these 12 rows is purled , the first stitch of every row is slipped ; * then take the first five selvedge stitches of the knitted part on a separate needle ( on the side where the end of wool hangs down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle into the back chain of the stitch ( the selvedge stitch which is next to the cast-on stitch remains , therefore , unworked upon ) , and knit on these a new part , which must have 13 rows ; the first row is knitted , and in this row work 2 stitches in the first stitch , one purled and one knitted , so that this new part is equally six stitches wide . Repeat 8 times more from * . After having worked several parts , the stitches can , of course , be taken on the same needle , so as not to increase the number of needles . When the 10th part is com-* *pleted , take the selvedge stitches of the left-hand side of the same on a separate needle , cast them off with the cast-on stitches of the first part , and fasten the wool . Then take the 6 selvedge stitches on the right hand of one part on a separate needle ; take the grey wool , and work on these stitches 13 rows backwards and forwards ; the first row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work ; in this , and in every following knitted row , knit the last stitch together with the next stitch of the next violet part . When 10 such grey parts are completed ( each of the remaining 9 parts consists of 13 rows , and begins with one knitted row ) , take all the stitches and the selvedge stitches of these parts on four needles and knit with these stitches , also with grey wool 1 row knitted , in which the 6 selvedge stitches must be decreased to 3 by knitting always 2 stitches together as 1 stitch ; each of the other stitches is knitted as usual . Then purl 2 rows with violet wool , and cast off . Illustration : 319.  --  Rosette for Antimacassar . Illustration : 320.  --  Part of Antimacassar . For the tatted circle in the centre of the rosette , work with grey wool a circle consisting of 1 double , and 11 times alternately 1 purl 3-10ths of an inch long , 2 double , then 1 purl and 1 double . The circle is sewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No. 319 shows such a rosette full size . The small squares ( see No. 318 ) are worked with grey wool ; cast on 36 stitches , join the stitches into a circle , and purl 2 rows . To form the corners , knit together 4 times 2 stitches after every 7 stitches in the first of these two rounds , in the second round knit together 2 stitches after every 6 stitches ; these decreasings and those of the other rounds must always take place , at the same places as in the preceding round . Then take the violet wool , and knit 7 rows ; in the first of these knit 4 times 2 stitches together after intervals of 5 stitches ; no decreasings take place in the 2nd , 4th , and 6th rows ; in the 3rd row knit together 4 times 3 stitches as 1 stitch , and in the 5th and 7th rows 4 times 2 stitches as 1 stitch . After the 7th round , the remaining stitches are cast off together as 1 stitch . Then fasten the wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squares together from No. 320 for a cover , and edge it round the border with a fringe of grey wool . * * * * * Illustration : 321.  --  Knitted Border. 321.  --  Knitted Border . Material : Messrs . Walter Evans and Co. ' s No. 10 or No. 50 knitting cotton .

This bodice is knitted in brioche stitch with black and purple wool , so that the raised ribs appear black on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits quite close . It is fastened in front with black bone buttons and a steel buckle . Two strips of silk elastic are knitted in at the bottom . Begin at the bottom of the bodice with black wool , and cast on 170 stitches . The needles must be rather fine , and the knitting not too loose . Work backwards and forwards 24 rows as follows :  --  Slip the 1st stitch , alternately throw the wool forward , slip 1 as if you were going to purl it , and knit 1 . In the next row knit together the stitch which has been slipped and the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward , slip the knitted stitch , after having thrown the wool forward . In the 25th row take the purple wool and work 1 row as before . Illustration : 324.  --  Knitted Bodice without Sleeves ( Back ) . Illustration : 325.  --  Knitted Bodice without Sleeves ( Front ) . Now work alternately 1 row with black wool and 1 row with purple , but as the wool is not cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purled . Work always 2 rows on the same side from right to left . The following 26th row is worked with black wool in common brioche stitch , only the slipped stitch of the preceding row is purled together with the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward . 27th row : Turn the work , with purple wool purled brioche stitch . 28th row : On the same side with black wool knitted brioche stitch . After having worked 40 rows all in the same manner , begin the front gore . Divide the stitches upon three needles , 82 stitches on one needle for the back , and 44 stitches for each front part on the two other needles . Then work the first 11 stitches of the left front part ( this row must be worked on that side of the work upon which the ribs appear purple ) in knitted brioche stitch ; the 11th stitch must have a slipped stitch , with the wool thrown forward , therefore it is a purple rib . After this stitch begin the gore with the following 13 stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one comes over a black one , and a black one over a purple one . Do not work upon the following black stitch ; knit the following stitch with the one formed by throwing the wool forward . Throw the wool forward , and then only slip the black stitch which had been left , so that it comes behind the stitch which has just been knitted . This crossing of the stitch is repeated once more , then knit the following stitch together with the one formed by throwing the wool forward , throw the wool forward , slip the crossed black stitch and the two following single black stitches . The slipped stitch and the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward before the 3rd single black stitch are then knitted together , so that the crossed stitches are placed in opposite directions . The three black stitches which are knitted off together as 1 stitch in the next row form the middle line of the front gore , and are continued in a straight line to the point of the gore . The crossing takes place twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped first . After the 24th stitch knit together the following stitch with the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward . Then continue to work in common brioche stitch to the other front part , where the gore begins before the 24th stitch from the end . In the next row , which is worked in purled brioche stitch with black wool , take up the black loop between two purple ribs after the 11th stitch ; purl it so as to form the stitch which is missing at that place . The 3 slipped stitches in the preceding row are purled together as one stitch with the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward between the ribs . The loop is also taken up on the other side of the front gore in the same manner , as well as on the other front part . Then work 6 rows without increasing or decreasing . The crossing of the stitch is repeated after every 7 rows , always on the knitted brioche stitch side , with purple wool . In the 18th row of the gore the 3 middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pattern must be decreased in 26 rows . In the back 30 stitches only must be decreased , two in every 6th row . After the 60th row another decreasing takes place on the outer edges of the front parts for the neck ; they decrease 2 stitches ( 1st rib ) after the 5th stitch from the front edge in every 3rd row . The 5 stitches which close to the neck are cast off together with the 5 stitches on the shoulders . Then cast off loosely the stitches of the back ; take all the selvedge stitches of the front on the needles , and knit 24 rows of brioche stitch with black wool , making 9 button-holes on the right front part . On the wrong side of this part sew on a strip of black silk , with slits worked round in button-hole stitch , stitching at the same time into the knitting . The following scallops are knitted round the top of the jacket and round the armholes with black wool :  --  Take the selvedge stitches on the needles , work 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thread the wool into a Berlin wool-work needle , * cast off 3 stitches together , draw the wool through the needle , and take the 2 following stitches on the wool in the worsted-needle ; repeat from * .
