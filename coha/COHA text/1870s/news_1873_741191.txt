txt The desperate struggle which the police justices are making to retain their offices rendered it necessary that Mr. Dermal , . B. Eaton should once again come to the defense of the Dill which is to sweep them from their places . He was summoned by telegraph last night from Boston to meet before the Governor to-day , Mr. Francis Kernan , Gov . Dix 's Democratic opponent . who had been retained by the juetiees to oppose the bill on the old ground of its unconstitutionality . Three hearings of most exhaustive character have been had on this measure before the Assembly Judiciary Committee , and another before the Senate Committee , at which Senator Murphy declared his opinion that the bill was quite constitutional , ? though he opposed it on party grounds . At each of these Mr. Eaton has had to meet the best counsel the justices could obtain . and as a last resort , they retain Mr. Kiernan to show the Governor he ought to veto the bill . It would be difficult to say anything now on these questions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented , but many old ones in a novel form and clearer light . What the action of the Governor will be is not doubtful . for every lawyer who has not taken a retainer from the justices , and has expressed an opinion of the bill , holds that its legality is clear . To Senator Murphy may be added Me . Crary. another Democrat and lawyer , who holds that the principle of the bill is sound law . THE COLLEGE LAND SCRIP . Mr. Cornell took the floor this evening , and asked as a personal favor from the House unanimous consent to offer the following resolution : Resolved , That if the Senate concur . Horatio Seymour of Oneida , Wm . G. Fargo of Erie , and Lewis G. Morris of Westchester are hereby appointed a commiesion to investigate the affairs of Cornell Univeraity , and for that pummel are hereby invested with the power and authority of a legislative committee . authorized to send for persons and papers said commission is directed to report to the Governor for transmission to the next Legislature , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atty . as to the security and condition of its funds , as to the management of Ezra Cornell in reference to the location and sale of the lands under his contract with the State in behalf of said Cornell University . and generally , as to all of the interests and affairs or the said university , and the execution of duties and trusts imposed by the laws of the United States , and of the State of New-York. in relation to the agricultural land grant . In case of a vacancy in said commission , by reason of a declination to serve , or otherwise . the Governor is authorized to till the same by appomtmeat . Mr. objected . He gave as his reason for so doing that resolutions covering the same subject were pending in the Senate . This action is regarded by many to have been a bad mistake on 's part , as it puts him in the suspicions position of taking an unfair advantage . If the resolution had been introduced , a fair debate could have been bad on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on canal footing . It is not doubted that he drew the resolutions which were offered in the Senate to-day , in which a commission is named said to be inimical to Mr. Ezra Cornell , whereas the commission named by the Speaker is disinterested , and composed of his political opponents , unless , as Mr. asserts , Mr. Fargo is a friend of Mr. Ezra Cornell . Mr. ' Cornell says he was not aware till the fact was stated on the floor that resolutions had been introduced in the senate . It has been suggested that he might have insisted . HIS resolution was a privileged one , and did not require unanimous consent , as the subject it related to was charges made against a State institution and its officers . But if there was any doubt on the point the Speaker did wisely on throwing himself on the generosity of the House . Mr. did not improve his position by coming forward with a solitary objection to the request . THE USURY VOTE . By an error in the list , Mr. Lewis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleman represents a distriot in which a profound veneration is felt for the existing Usury laws , and as he fought the bill as bitterly as his most earnest constituent could desire , he is naturally anxious to have the error corrected .
