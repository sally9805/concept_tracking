THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF NEW YORK . MORE direct executive power and responsibility are needed in city administration to relieve its financial burdens and sustain the property which bears them . Au examiuation of its different business interests will disclose modes of enlarging the amount of property on which its taxes are imposed , and will discover unexplored sources of city revenue . Three casual expressions attributed to Mr. Tweed , illustrated by his brief political history , indicate his theory of administration . The first was , " The way to have power is to take it ; " the second , " He is human ; " and the third , " What are you going to do about it U ' In his career was exhibited the despotic phase of municipal administration . He got for himself and his associates offices , one after the other , by taking them with or without right , until he held the power of the State , and then fortified his position by enacting appropriate laws . His means of doing this was to approach men through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , and money . His appreciation of this trait in the character of the men about him was expressed in his belief that they were " human . " The arrogance of the full possession of power and the defiance against the remonstrances of honest men drove him to the extreme of audacity , " What are you going to do about it ? " which preceded his fall . There was no greater popular mistake than to call Mr. Tweed and his associates a " ring . " They were so at the outset by the " cohesive power of public plunder , " but , once in possession , like a crew of pirates who had gained the deck of a prize , they became arrayed against each other . If they had been a ring , their compactness of purpose might have constituted a government , but they had so little hold upon or confidence in each other that they dissolved at the first shock . The effort was then made by Mr. // Tilden and Mr. O'Conor to take possession of the municipal administration . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of a man or a single event would have changed the whole situation . It was an attempt on the part of the ablest and purest men , who had the power and the patriotism , to make a peaceable revolution at a single stroke . If they had succeeded , for once in the history of the city of New York the best citizens would have been at the head , and thorough reform in organization and administration would have been certain . But legal forms and official delays furnished a line of breastworks behind which shelter was found , so that the positions were taken only one by one , through a long line of litigations full of disappointments and fruitless of great results , and the city administration rested upon the physical and mental obesity of Mr. Havemeyer . Thus , within a brief period , the difficulties of the problem of municipal administration in this city have received three illustrations : first , a successful despotic power , capable but corrupt ; secondly , an unsuccessful attempt by the best men to take the lead ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , of good purposes and low grade . These illustrations complete the circle . To-day the government is of the third class . An honest leader has unequal followers . It has the force and the weakness of a compact party organization , but fails to present or to carry out measures adequate to relieve the burdens of the people and provide for their prosperity . We vibrate to-day between two principles which are as old as society itself  --  the absolute power of a leader and the reaction from his abuse of power to the attempt of the people to govern themselves . History presents transitions from one to the other of these forms , with various intermediate stages . The solution of the problem is to put and keep the best men at the head , and the inability to reach it in any case is because the people do not easily recognize and adhere to their best men . These bare lines of the question are visible through all the discussions . Under a heterogeneous system of ancient and constitutional rights and of laws of excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three directions : a despairing cry for a leader ; the relegation of the government to the mass of the people and demagogism ; and between them to make a legal // machine which shall grind out good government and reject all evils . This attempt at the impracticable has made our problem of municipal government the hardest of all the problems of state . The despairing cry for a true leader is based on aspects of imperial government in Europe which show admirable examples of ability and success . It is an instinct of human nature , but it is revolutionary . In Rome it was the election of a dictator . In France , where Guizot has described the government as " the principle of despotism , checked by the right of insurrection , " it was a mad revolution . In this country , it was the wild cry in the first dark week of the rebellion for George Law ; and to-day it is the demand for a receiver of the city , as if it were an insolvent railroad company . Talleyrand concentrated it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man must ; when society can not organize a government , a government must create society . " The principle has been called divine . We need not doubt the result if a wise and good man had power to organize a government here , but we know as well that it is not the way . The extreme alternative of a government by the people through such representatives as they select is disheartening . It has proved a failure to this hour . It has produced the evils which have accumulated into a crushing weight , an increase of debt , a load of taxation , a waste of resources , the destruction of business , the depletion of life , and maladministration and extravagance in every direction , with men in power who look blankly at the situation without the ability to make an effort to relieve it . This is the direct work of the people , for it is by their votes that the men who have done it have gained the power . The result is their condemnation , and there is no answer to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patronage and places , and with the profits of the public expenditure . The system . is fatal , for it is the despotism of the people through bad men . Between these extremes we have been vibrating , and have fallen into legal machinery . An appeal to the Legislature of the State introduced the system of commissions . The departments of city administration were some of them placed under boards of several commissioners . It divided power between the two political parties ; it introduced bargaining ; it destroyed efficiency ; it stood between the agent and responsibility . Like all // foreign domination , it became tyrannical . It led to a complicated system of checks to the exercise of administrative power in every direction . The lack of power in an officer to do what he would , the necessity of a concurrence which was impracticable , produced a situation of inefficiency for which no one was responsible . No amount of machinery will compensate for the lack of an engineer , and with a poor one the machine stops working from its own friction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask it to produce what it does not contain . If the man able to devise the best measures were in power , he could not execute them . We are all familiar with the formula that " eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . " Goethe says : " If you want anything in this world , put forth your hand and take it ; all you have to do is to pay the price . " Power in the people by direct representation and intelligent and eternal vigilance over its exercise is a simple and the single principle ; but the subjects and functions of administration are multifarious , cross-woven , and incomprehensible , direct executive power is impeded , and the people can not find the single point on which their vigilance and force can be concentrated with effect . The habit of depreciating and maligning public men blinds the people in their search for their best men ; they are slow to recognize them when they do appear ; and , politically , men become valuable for negative qualities . What is needed is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis where every one may see that the result can be reached , and at one stroke . It would be effective and at the same time be in order . Men would cease looking to Albany . It would be opportune then to discuss the situation of the city and modes of relief . The influence of the press would be felt . An incapable officer would face the only light he feared . It would be the concentration with effect , on men and measures , of vigilant public opinion , the greatest and only political force in the country . The city of New York has passed through a long period of depression , and rests now at the bottom . Its need is an able man as mayor with power to work out affirmative measures of relief for the future prosperity of the city , and with direct responsibility . The financial difficulties of the city and its unexplored re // sources are deplorable enough to be saved from the indifference with which they are now treated . It is loaded with a great debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears heavy annual taxes to meet the interest on that debt , its proportion of the State taxes , and its own municipal expenditure . The real estate , upon which it imposes four-fifths of its taxation , is burdened with heavy assessments for premature improvements , and suffers a double taxation by the taxes on mortgages . Its commerce needs large expenditure for improved terminal facilities . Its banks , which represent its life-blood , suffer from unequal taxation . Its population and natural increase of wealth have for fifteen years been diverted into its suburbs beyond its taxation , and it invites further depletion by a large expenditure upon public works against its interest . Its municipal expenditure is heavy , and its actual and possible resources are greatly neglected . The interest paid on the city debt has been fixed at a high rate , far beyond the average of interest paid by a public borrower of such unquestioned resources . The worst injury in the theft of city money by the ring was that it was borrowed for long periods at high rates of interest , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This portion of the debt may be beyond reach , but the consolidation of the residue at low rates is an obvious measure which has received official attention . The amount paid by the city for State taxes is greater than its proportion of the total wealth or population of the State . Its valuations of property approach more nearly the market-value than the valuations of other counties . But , the greater the proportion of the State tax thrown . upon this city , the greater the relief to the rest of the State . The argument made to the justice of the State is an argument against their interest . To support these arguments so as to command attention is one of the imperative duties toward which the whole power and public opinion of the city should be directed . The city expenditures have been greatly reduced within the past few years , even to the extent of so wearing and wasting the city property as to require larger expenditure in the future . But the results show that extreme economy and retrenchment are wholly inadequate for financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexplored resources of the city . The leading effect of the hard times , aided by the policy // of city administration , has been to depress the property which bears the burden of the taxes . lilt was an inevitable retribution . For the large public debt the city has a few creditable worksthe Croton aqueduct and reservoirs , the public parks , a few public buildings , a beginning of public docks . If the residue of the debt , beyond the sum which these works have cost , had been expended or were now to be laid out in such other works as would render the city more attractive and finished for an incoming population , and facilitate its business interests , it can readily be seen how great the city would become . It is because there is so little to show for it , when so much was needed , that the debt is so burdensome . It was not well invested . Twelve years ago , at the close of the rebellion , the city was emerging from a period of great depression into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , business enterprise , and wealth , flow toward cities . It was anticipated that this natural accretion would settle within its own borders , and preparations were made to bring the region below and abreast of the Central Park into condition for immediate occupation , but these calculations were disappointed . Rapid transit , which was needed to reach regions so remote from the business centres , had been omitted from the plan . It entered upon its decade of discussion and controversy . In other directions , outside the city borders , people had more forethought , and the larger portion of the growth due to the city was diverted to Brooklyn and New Jersey , which by steam ferries and railroads were brought in time nearer to the City Hall than some of its own suburbs . Still the preparation of its own up-town areas went on in the most extravagant manner . A rough , rocky , elevated , and in part precipitous region had been subjected to the plan of rectangular and parallel streets and avenues , and level grades , without regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region was given to a city department , but the old plan was retained . Conceived without forethought of its necessary conditions , this plan was executed without calculation of its cost . The notable extravagance of the Court-house was matched by miles of boulevards up-town , costing three-quarters of a million , some a million , dollars the mile . The assessments for such improvements burdened the property in that region , within a period of ten years , with a load equal to ten million // dollars a square mile , a sum sufficient to cover the laud with average buildings . These proceedings were fatal . The land has fallen to a price less than the assessments and taxes . The owners have disappeared . The growth of the city has stopped . The middle class , who live between Murray Hill and a tenement-house , have in great numbers been driven from the city . The mechanics and laborers employed upon these street improvements and house-building have been forced into idleness . The same things are true of the other regions of the city . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives the greater portion of its taxes has been crushed , its future power of paying taxes and meeting the debt has been impaired , and the burden on improved property down-town is not lightened , as it might have been , by having the up-town regions built up and taxed as houses and lots , and not as vacant lots . The forty million dollars which have been expended by the city and property owners on the unoccupied regions of this island , north of Fiftyninth Street , lie there as dead and idle capital . To make it attractive to the next inflow of population , to gather there portly tax-payers , to cover it with residences and places of business , to make this dead capital active , will broaden and double the property from which the taxes are gathered , and thus will diminish the burden . Measures tending to develop this resource of the city deserve attention . A survey of the various business interests of the city may suggest some affirmative measures which will tend to restore prosperity and lead to the discovery of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon two general causes : first , its relations to the general commerce of the world ; secondly , its attractions as a place of residence . London illustrates the effects of the former , Paris of the latter . New York can combine them both . Its natural advantages for gathering population by attracting residents are as matchless as its commuercial advantages . Its population depends on its business prosperity . This prosperity is secured when all its citizens are engaged in profitable and productive labor . At the present time a large proportion of its labor-power is idle and wasted . The fields of labor are threefold : 1 . That connected with its commercial business ; 2 . That connected with its manufacturing business ; 3. // That connected with house-building and the preparation of its vacant areas by street and other improvements for building . Employment for this labor should not be forced , but obstacles may be taken out of the way . Primal causes of national prosperity , such as the quantity of natural products , the freedom of trade , and the purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now under review . The interests of the city as a great centre of foreign and internal commerce are subordinated to the interests of the whole country , and the legislation of the United States may be , and at times is , antagonistic to the interests of the city . It was freedom and independence in this respect that caused the great growth of the free cities of Europe three and four centuries ago . New York must contend , by the power of its representatives in Congress , to advance such mature views as will destroy this antagonism , by the demonstration that the interests of all are alike . The vital point upon which the city government can act directly is the increase of terminal facilities , by which the railroad-car can be brought alongside the vessel , and internal distribution be effected by steam . New York must connect and not break transportation ; the development of the elevated railroads will effect it . It would be a work for the Dock Department more important for the interests of the city than a reconstruction in iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulkheads , without any advance in design . The rivalry of other cities places the merchants of New York under great disadvantages for want of this close connection in the transfer and distribution of goods . They are left to their own unaided efforts . The whole power of the city government should be moved for them , and the city itself should derive an income for the privileges it grants . But it is quite as important to encourage the manufacturing interests of the city , to facilitate those now established , and to bring in new ones . They require short and cheap transportation and facilities for the receipt and delivery of raw materials and finished goods , cheap houses and living for their operatives , and low taxation . Low-priced lands in the central portions of the city and land along elevated railroads , unfitted for residences , will fall more and more into this use , to its great profit . The region of which the Third Avenue bridge over the Harlem River // is the centre , with proper modes of connecting the factory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site on this continent for manufacturing enterprise . The opening of Hell Gate now in progress and the proposed improvement of the Harlem River will contribute to the result . The new plans for laying out the district to the north have been adapted to it . The improvement of this region to this end is a most important city work , and should not be neglected an hour . To make it the centre of a great manufacturing business , as can be done , will largely increase business , population , and wealth , and broaden the basis on which the taxes are raised , and toward this result the action of the city should be immediate . The plan on which the city was laid out below One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street had this excuse , that there was in 1813 little topographical science , and few examples of the modern growth of cities now displayed everywhere ; but that excuse is not available to the men who had the area west of the Central Park to lay out in 1867 , and who adhered to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet by one hundred , in blocks two hundred feet wide , has been disastrous to the interests of the city . It was assumed to be the finality of human wisdom , whatever the topography , whatever the occupation , best alike for a palace and a tenement-house , a cathedral or a music-hall , a foundery or a lumber-yard . It has in fact excluded all great business enterprises which require unusual facilities or broader area . They , with all the advantages which follow their location , must go elsewhere ; and if one attempts it , as the Hudson River Railroad elevators and yards at Sixtieth Street , it only succeeds by the paramount right of eminent domain . The city should have power , and should exercise it freely , to obliterate and rearrange streets and avenues along its borders for factory and great establishments , and not present its gridiron plan as a Procrustean bed . The enlargement , among the laborers , of the class of artisans and skilled workmen , by the decrease of the common and unskilled , is equally important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the introduction of every new branch of light manufacture , art , or artisan-work . Here should be found the most skillful workmen , and here their best means of instruction . The Cooper Union is one of the noblest monuments in the // city ; there should be others like it . If Mr. Stewart had risen above the bread-and-butter level of feeding and lodging a few hundred young women , and founded a school , in a building whose store-rents would have supported it , where all women could have found the best instruction , through the whole range of occupations by which they earn their livings , from domestic service to art , from the quality of goods in a fancy-store to book-keeping , thousands every year would have been helped by it to independence . He would have been immortalized by the blessings of those whose blessings are worth the most . His project was an affront to human nature and to society . The unit of society is the family . The safeguard of society is in the women . The character of its young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a home . To take them away from home and offer them food and lodging was an offense . The project was impracticable , and it is to their honor and the honor of the city that the failure was so prompt and emphatic . If his noble purpose had been wisely directed , and every young woman who earned her living had found the school which they all seek , for the best practical instruction in the work she followed , the benefits to them and to the city , as the place for the finest work of the most skillful hands , would have been incalculable . He has left this path open . The unexampled growth of the city in years past has made house-building and street improvements one of the principal modes of employment , and has accumulated here great numbers engaged on that kind of work . They have become immovable , and their enforced idleness is a great disaster and obstruction to the prosperity of the city . These laborers are of two classes , a part mechanics , and the rest common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the accession of the inefficient and unemployed from all other classes . These men find employment when real estate is prosperous ; in its depression and by the cessation of public works , they are left destitute . The demand for houses gives them employment . If such a time is approaching , some preparation for it by undertaking works of unquestioned advantage is proper . Two general questions are now reached : What measures , safe , prudent , and moderate , will enlarge the amount of property // on which the taxes are raised , and what new sources of city revenue can be pointed out ? An increase of revenue will produce a diminution of annual taxes , or an addition to the sinking fund for the payment of the principal of the debt . The enlargement of the taxable valuations of property will bring us to raising $30,000,000 a year on fifteen hundred or two thousand millions of property , instead of eleven hundred millions . If the city held under its own taxation the taxable wealth by which New Jersey , within twenty-five miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , the taxes would now be raised on fifteen hundred instead of on eleven hundred millions , and this would reduce the rate of taxation for 1878 from 2.55 to 1.94 per cent . If necessary and advantageous works were in progress , they would give employment to laborers who would be supported by their profitable labor , and not as they now are , without labor , and the essential condition of prosperity would be met . The elevated railroads and the opening of Hell Gate are examples of such works . Paris is , rather than any other European city , the model for New York . It suffered under Baron llaussmann a great activity in the production of new boulevards and public works , and a great increase of the public debt . Under the siege it suffered as much as New York has by its depression of values and of business , yet it has recovered almost wholly , and has a city revenue which meets nearly all its annual expenditure of $50,000,000 for city purposes . The example will be found to present official intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance and administration . There has been for five years past a strong public opinion adverse to any public works . It has resulted in their general discontinuance ; yet it has remained true all the time that , if money had been borrowed at the low prevalent rates of interest , and had been expended judiciously in necessary works at the unexampled low prices for materials and labor , the results would have been great . The public judgment has not been exercised with this aspect of the question , it has been overcome with the single necessity of stopping expenditure . This is evident from the general interest taken in such works as the elevated railroads , and the improvement of Harlem River and Hell Gate . These the city // does not pay for , and they do not increase either the city 's debt or taxation . They are works which it is profitable to construct . This is demonstrated when these works are looked at in the light of their necessity to the growth of the city . There is dawning a general belief in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable as the return of the tides . The low prices of land and of building-materials will attract settlement , just as in years gone by high prices have repelled it . Starting from a basis of exceedingly low prices , every condition will be favorable to gathering here the natural growth which will belong to incoming years , not of speculative but of actual prosperity . The revival of trade will again cause the concentration of population in cities , labor will be again drawn from production to the work of interchanges . When all are at work , prosperity will return . A natural growth which secures its own accretions for its own support , and for its own taxation , will soon diminish the relative burden of the debt . In fact , by its erroneous policy the city has been supporting its neighbors . It has sent its citizens who labor and make money here into the neighboring places to live and to support their taxation . A slight change of policy will bring back this wealth , will bring in new capital , and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear its burdens . The study of the lines and extent of probable growth and of the law of the valuation of land will be a guide to the class of improvements which it will be profitable to undertake . In bringing into subjection new sources of city revenue , or in specific taxation , it is a controlling principle that it must not be imposed over so large a range of subjects or in such heavy amounts as to burden the business from which it arises . There are cases in which the benefits accruing to the citizens individually are more beneficial to the city , as in the cheap water-supply , than it would be to increase the revenue by doubling the tax . It should be laid on those sources only which are abundantly able to bear it , and not to an extent to abridge the benefit to the citizen . It should be supported on the clearest grounds of legal right and public policy . It should proceed with the growth of the city , and be derived from new improvements which bring in new benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be limited with the strictest justice . The investigation of the vanous // unexplored sources in this city will involve a consideration of the general principles of taxation , and the true relations of labor and capital here , as well as the best plans and simplest modes of accomplishing it . In 1825 the opening of the Erie Canal marked a period of great advance in the growth and prosperity of the city . In 1878 the establishment of rapid transit through and within its limits will make a like epoch . The elevated railroads should receive a consideration preliminary to the practical examination of the questions above stated . They will be found to have a vital bearing on each . The routes laid down by the Rapid Transit Commissioners , under the law of 1875 , were rudimentary . They overlooked or disregarded the conditions of the problem before them . It was not merely lines up and down town , with loops of connection at either end , but a system , that was needed . Terminal facilities , here as elsewhere , were as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approach and departure should have been reached . In this respect there was a public opinion far in advance of them which they did not heed . The people did not want to travel on one line , but to reach without change their point of destination  --  a ferry , a steamboat - landing , or a depot ; not one , but every one of them . The gap now between the Forty-second Street station of the New York Elevated Railway and the passenger entrances of the Grand Central Depot is as important to the traveler as the railroad itself . Close connection is imperative , but it was forgotten . They overlooked , too , the law under which the growth of a city is determined by its railroad lines and stations . The Western country shows instances of the growth of a town around a railroad-station as an initial point ; all occupation and improvement is adapted to it as a centre . At the East there are many towns which have changed their growth to a new centre at the station which was planted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its various occupations and improvements will conforms to its internal lines of transportation . Much of this is settling on lines which it will be expensive to change , and such disturbances might have been avoided . The future uses of rapid transit are not limited to passenger voi*. cxxvn .. - No. 265. 30 // traveling . Its adaptation to the uses which might have been provided for when the routes were laid out will be grafted on them at inconvenience and expense , and at fresh disturbance of the property interests , which adjust themselves to routes as they are opened . This disturbance has been a great obstacle to rapid transit through all its history . The unforeseen uses and necessities are manifold . Connection must be made with all the ferries and steamboat-landings at the lower end of the city . There was a great opportunity for forethought in providing a common southern terminus at the South Ferry , with a pier for general river departure . A river border-line , from Canal Street on the Hudson River to James Street on the East , and at those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal points in present use . Passengers should be landed and received from the elevated cars at the second story of the ferry and steamboat landings . The rest of the river border would soon demand the same conveniences . At the northern end of the island the various residence sections should be made accessible . In the new surveys of the Park Department these requirements were met in advance by laying out , in the district north of the Harlem River , a connecting series of distinct railroad avenues , which crossed the other streets and avenues at an under or over grade , and reached all sections . When the elevated roads reach the Harlem River , the ways for making the district north of it accessible are ready for them . Besides carrying passengers , these elevated roads must prepare to transport baggage , and do all the internal parcel-delivery of the city . By night they must do the business of moving freight from the freight-car to the vessel at the water-side ; freight-depots and open spaces like the down-town squares must be provided for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as every night gather at Fulton and Washington Markets , and delivering them to those or to new places of distribution . They must also be prepared to remove at night the accumulati*is of street-sweepings by day to lit places of final deposit . The people of this city are the only million in the country who have been denied the privilege of transportation by steam . They will enjoy what they have now , and ask for more . All this business will press upon the elevated railroad companies in time ; new // companies and forms of enterprise adapted to the business will be formed in connection with the roads . If these uses had been foreseen , the routes might have been laid out to meet all these future requirements ; as it is , they will be reached with great loss of time , by force of popular pressure , not for the interests of the people , but wrested from the rivalry of the railroad corporations , and amid great conflict and disturbance of property interests . It is obvious that these railroads will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . This profit should have been brought under a fair city taxation . It could have been done in advance , as a condition of the grant , on a just basis : it can be required now as the condition of inevitable future privileges . The city has a right to a portion of the profits , as a license fee or compensation for the grants by the city . This can be supported on sound principles of law and public policy . Through all the different cases of title to the bed of a street , in respect to the city and the adjacent owner , varying according to the origin of the street , it is generally true that all rights of ownership are in the city for the public use , and that the adjacent owner has none . The growth of a street shows that it is improved at the expense of the adjacent owners , for the public use , and that this extends to new and unforeseen uses . In a new settlement , the rudimentary street is a path between the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , and the street is open to the public ; at the demands of increased population and travel it is adapted to it , with sidewalks and paved carriageways ; it is curbed , lighted , sewered , and repaved with better material ; at the same demand rails are laid upon it for a new use  --  the street-cars  --  and again , posts are erected upon it for the support of another unforeseen use  --  the elevated steam railroad . The rights of the adjacent owners in a road-bed which has been improved in great part at their expense have passed to the city for the public use , and then for a mixed public and private userailroads-which serve the public and enrich their owners . Toward this use the city has contributed a graded right of way , on which the company have erected their road-structure . The company , by their issue of bonds and stocks , declare that their property is worth , per mile , several times more than the cost of the road-structure they have erected ; that is , that their franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the difference between their actual cost of construction and the larger amount of bonds and stock which they have issued . This furnishes an indisputable ground and reason why the city should receive payment for its contribution , and why the company should pay , annually , a rent or compensation to the city for the use of the graded road-bed . These relations have grown up and been established by public policy and the decisions of the courts of last resort , and the obligation as certainly follows them . The beneficial results of rapid transit are scarcely anticipated . It will counteract the depletion of the taxable wealth and popm* lation belonging to this city into Brooklyn and New Jersey , which has been going on for more than fifteen years , because of low ferriage , good railr6ads with low commutation , and the prospect of the Brooklyn Bridge . It will gather the next accretions of property and population within the city limits , and under its taxation . It will equalize values through the length of the city ; it will relieve taxation on real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vacant lots , but on houses and lots ; it will increase the advantages of the city as the location for all kinds of manufacturing business ; it will expedite these effects . Opened at a time when vacant land up-town is at very low prices , it will stimulate the erection of a large number of low-cost dwellings to meet a demand , on the first revival of business , for single houses by the families now doubled up in houses in the lower part of the city , the mere outburst of whom from such constraint will create a demand for such dwellings before there is any increase of population ; it will create a new city abreast of the Park , with advantages and adaptations for health , elegance , and economy , to which the people are now strangers . All the business of the city will adjust itself to these new lines . To some the transition will be burdensome . No existing state of things at any date is a finality ; the law is constant change and growth of the whole . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through whole sections , and , after the temporary disturbance is over , values have been increased ; on the railroad avenues this increase will be greatly augmented by the gathering of population along their upper borders , who will travel and trade upon the avenues . They will have the benefit of this // law of high values , that the greatest value follows the greatest travel . Broadway , below Fourteenth Street , furnishes an illustration . The effort , in the earlier days of rapid transit , was to concentrate travel by surface and underground roads on Broadway . It was successfully resisted by the owners , who now see the high values , which gave it its character , transferred to its upper length , above Fourteenth Street , where there is a railroad , and distributed among the other avenues . The operation of this law , aud there is no other , will ultimately give very high value to the Third and Sixth Avenues . The public attention is now engrossed by the minor annoyances , and their judgment has been affected by them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will cease to be heard of when the return of better times fixes these railroad avenues as the best business streets of the city . These companies are destined to possess high power and influence in the city , and they should have been harnessed in to do some of its work and sustain some of its burdens . It would come in the shape of annual rent and rent service . The payment of money can be best computed as a percentage on their gross receipts , to be paid periodically into the city treasury . There are not data enough at present to calculate the product of a percentage ; but , if , on the receipts which have been publicly anticipated and reported , a just percentage were secured as an addition to the sinking-fund , it would go far toward liquidating the debt before its maturity , and it would , by the certainty of such a future provision , relieve at once the weight of the burden . By the misapplication of its funds the city has incurred a great debt , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a wise husbanding of its resources if , by another public work of great profit and utility , toward the construction of which the city had contributed the greater proportion , provision could be made , on just principles , for the final extinguishment of the debt . These elevated railroads will ultimately dominate the city ; they ought now to be bound to its service . Wu*LT*xr IR . MARTIN .
