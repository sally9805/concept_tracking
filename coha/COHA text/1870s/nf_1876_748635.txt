txt // , vital work , and that most of his books will be only accessory to and corroborative of this . At any rate , his books can be well understood only by the aid of his letters and the continual explanations which he makes to those who consult him in their doubt , and request him to define more clearly his position . " There are , among celebrated people , many methods of correspondence . There are those to whom letter-writing is a bore , and who , assailed with questions and compliments , reply in the greatest haste , solely that the job may be over with , and who return politeness for politeness , mingling it with more or less wit . This kind of correspondence , though coming from celebrated people , is insignificant and unworthy of collection and classification . " After those who write letters in performance of a disagreeable duty , and almost side by side with them in point of insignificance , I should put those who write in a manner wholly external , wholly superficial , devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting it ; and those also who weigh every word , who reply formally and pompously , with a view to fine phrases and effects . They exchange words only , and choose them solely for their brilliancy and show . You think it is you , individually , to whom they speak ; but they are addressing themselves in your person to the four corners of Europe . Such letters are empty , and teach as nothing but theatrical execution and the favorite pose of their writers . " I will not class among the latter the more prudent and sagacious authors who , when writing to individuals , keep one eye on posterity . We know that many who pursue this method have written long , finished , charming , flattering , and tolerably natural letters . Beranger furnishes us with the best example of this class . " Proudhon , however , is a man of entirely different nature and habits . In writing , he thinks of nothing but his idea and the person whom he addresses : ad rem et ad hominem . A man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to be questioned does not annoy him . When approached , he cares only to know that your motive is not one of futile curiosity , but the love of truth ; he assumes you to be serious , he replies , he examines your objections , sometimes verbally , sometimes in writing ; for , as he remarks , ' if there be some points which correspondence can never settle , but which can be made clear by conversation in two minutes , at other times just the opposite is the case : an objection clearly stated in writing , a doubt well expressed , which elicits a direct and positive reply , helps things along more than ten hours of oral intercourse ! ' In writing to you he does not hesitate to treat the subject anew ; he unfolds to you the foundation and superstructure of his thought : rarely does he confess himself defeated  --  it is not his way ; he holds to his position , but admits the breaks , the variations , in short , the EVOLUTION of his mind . The history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be sought . " Proudhon , whoever addresses him , is always ready ; he quits the page of the book on which he is at work to answer you with the same pen , and that without losing patience , without getting confused , without sparing or complaining of his ink ; he is a public man , devoted to the propagation of his idea by all methods , and the best method , with him , is always the present one , the latest one . His very handwriting , bold , uniform , legible , even in the most tiresome passages , betrays no haste , no hurry to finish . Each line is accurate : nothing is left to chance ; the punctuation , very correct and a little emphatic and decided , indicates with precision and delicate distinction all the links in the chain of his argument . He is devoted entirely to you , to his business and yours , while writing to you , and never to anything else . All the letters of his which I have seen are serious : not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not at all artistic or affected ; he does not CONSTRUCT his letters , he does not revise them , he spends no time in reading them over ; we have a first draught , excellent and clear , a jet from the fountain-head , but that is all . The new arguments , which he discovers in support of his ideas and which opposition suggests to him , are an agreeable surprise , and shed a light which we should vainly search for even in his works . His correspondence differs essentially from his books , in that it gives you no uneasiness ; it places you in the very heart of the man , explains him to you , and leaves you with an impression of moral esteem and almost of intellectual security . We feel his sincerity . I know of no one to whom he can be more fitly compared in this respect than George Sand , whose correspondence is large , and at the same time full of sincerity . His role and his nature correspond . If he is writing to a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a young woman who asks him to decide delicate questions of conduct for her , his letter takes the form of a short moral essay , of a father-confessor 's advice . Has he perchance attended the theatre ( a rare thing for him ) to witness one of Ponsart 's comedies , or a drama of Charles Edmond 's , he feels bound to give an account of his impressions to the friend to whom he is indebted for this pleasure , and his letter becomes a literary and philosophical criticism , full of sense , and like no other . His familiarity is suited to his correspondent ; he affects no rudeness . The terms of civility or affection which he employs towards his correspondents are sober , measured , appropriate to each , and honest in their simplicity and cordiality . When he speaks of morals and the family , he seems at times like the patriarchs of the Bible . His command of language is complete , and he never fails to avail himself of it . Now and then a coarse word , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be suppressed in printing ; time , however , as it passes away , permits many things and renders them inoffensive . Am I right in saying that Proudhon 's correspondence , always substantial , will one day be the most accessible and attractive portion of his works ? " Almost the whole of Proudhon 's real biography is included in his correspondence . Up to 1837 , the date of the first letter which we have been able to collect , his life , narrated by Sainte Beuve , from whom we make numerous extracts , may be summed up in a few pages . Pierre Joseph Proudhon was born on the 15th of January , 1809 , in a suburb of Besancon , called Mouillere . His father and mother were employed in the great brewery belonging to M. Renaud . His father , though a cousin of the jurist Proudhon , the celebrated professor in the faculty of Dijon , was a journeyman brewer . His mother , a genuine peasant , was a common servant . She was an orderly person of great good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a superior woman of HEROIC character ,  --  to use the expression of the venerable M. Weiss , the librarian at Besancon . She it was especially that Proudhon resembled : she and his grandfather Tournesi , the soldier peasant of whom his mother told him , and whose courageous deeds he has described in his work on " Justice . " Proudhon , who always felt a great veneration for his mother Catharine , gave her name to the elder of his daughters . In 1814 , when Besancon was blockaded , Mouillere , which stood in front of the walls of the town , was destroyed in the defence of the place ; and Proudhon 's father established a cooper 's shop in a suburb of Battant , called Vignerons . Very honest , but simple-minded and short-sighted , this cooper , the father of five children , of whom Pierre Joseph was the eldest , passed his life in poverty . At eight years of age , Proudhon either made himself useful in the house , or tended the cattle out of doors . No one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on " Justice , " in which he describes the rural sports which he enjoyed when a neatherd . At the age of twelve , he was a cellar-boy in an inn . This , however , did not prevent him from studying . His mother was greatly aided by M. Renaud , the former owner of the brewery , who had at that time retired from business , and was engaged in the education of his children . Proudhon entered school as a day-scholar in the sixth class . He was necessarily irregular in his attendance ; domestic cares and restraints sometimes kept him from his classes . He succeeded nevertheless in his studies ; he showed great perseverance . His family were so poor that they could not afford to furnish him with books ; he was obliged to borrow them from his comrades , and copy the text of his lessons . He has himself told us that he was obliged to leave his wooden shoes outside the door , that he might not disturb the classes with his noise ; and that , having no hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the close of his studies , on returning from the distribution of the prizes , loaded with crowns , he found nothing to eat in the house . " In his eagerness for labor and his thirst for knowledge , Proudhon , " says Sainte Beuve , " was not content with the instruction of his teachers . From his twelfth to his fourteenth year , he was a constant frequenter of the town library . One curiosity led to another , and he called for book after book , sometimes eight or ten at one sitting . The learned librarian , the friend and almost the brother of Charles Nodier , M. Weiss , approached him one day , and said , smiling , ' But , my little friend , what do you wish to do with all these books ? ' The child raised his head , eyed his questioner , and replied : ' What 's that to you ? ' And the good M. Weiss remembers it to this day . " Forced to earn his living , Proudhon could not continue his studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becoming , soon after , a compositor , he made a tour of France in this capacity . At Toulon , where he found himself without money and without work , he had a scene with the mayor , which he describes in his work on " Justice . " Sainte Beuve says that , after his tour of France , his service book being filled with good certificates , Proudhon was promoted to the position of foreman . But he does not tell us , for the reason that he had no knowledge of a letter written by Fallot , of which we never heard until six months since , that the printer at that time contemplated quitting his trade in order to become a teacher . Towards 1829 , Fallot , who was a little older than Proudhon , and who , after having obtained the Suard pension in 1832 , died in his twenty-ninth year , while filling the position of assistant librarian at the Institute , was charged , Protestant though he was , with the revisal of a " Life of the Saints , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Fallot added some notes which also were in Latin . " But , " says Sainte Beuve , " it happened that some errors escaped his attention , which Proudhon , then proof-reader in the printing office , did not fail to point out to him . Surprised at finding so good a Latin scholar in a workshop , he desired to make his acquaintance ; and soon there sprung up between them a most earnest and intimate friendship : a friendship of the intellect and of the heart . " Addressed to a printer between twenty-two and twenty-three years of age , and predicting in formal terms his future fame , Fallot 's letter seems to us so interesting that we do not hesitate to reproduce it entire . " PARIS , December 5 , 1831 . " MY DEAR PROUDHON ,  --  YOU have a right to be surprised at , and even dissatisfied with , my long delay in replying to your kind letter ; I will tell you the cause of it . It became necessary to forward an account of your ideas to M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to them , and to await his definitive response , which reached me but a short time ago ; for M. J. is a sort of financial king , who takes no pains to be punctual in dealing with poor devils like ourselves . I , too , am careless in matters of business ; I sometimes push my negligence even to disorder , and the metaphysical musings which continually occupy my mind , added to the amusements of Paris , render me the most incapable man in the world for conducting a negotiation with despatch . " I have M. Jobard 's decision ; here it is : In his judgment , you are too learned and clever for his children ; he fears that you could not accommodate your mind and character to the childish notions common to their age and station . In short , he is what the world calls a good father ; that is , he wants to spoil his children , and , in order to do this easily , he thinks fit to retain his present instructor , who is not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous sports with wonderful facility , who points out the letters of the alphabet to the little girl , who takes the little boys to mass , and who , no less obliging than the worthy Abbe P. of our acquaintance , would readily dance for Madame 's amusement . Such a profession would not suit you , you who have a free , proud , and manly soul : you are refused ; let us dismiss the matter from our minds . Perhaps another time my solicitude will be less unfortunate . I can only ask your pardon for having thought of thus disposing of you almost without consulting you . I find my excuse in the motives which guided me ; I had in view your well-being and advancement in the ways of this world . " I see in your letter , my comrade , through its brilliant witticisms and beneath the frank and artless gayety with which you have sprinkled it , a tinge of sadness and despondency which pains me . You are unhappy , my friend : your present situation does not suit you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for you , it is beneath you ; you ought , by all means , to leave it , before its injurious influence begins to affect your faculties , and before you become settled , as they say , in the ways of your profession , were it possible that such a thing could ever happen , which I flatly deny . You are unhappy ; you have not yet entered upon the path which Nature has marked out for you . But , faint-hearted soul , is that a cause for despondency ? Ought you to feel discouraged ? Struggle , morbleu , struggle persistently , and you will triumph . J. J. Rousseau groped about for forty years before his genius was revealed to him . You are not J. J Rousseau ; but listen : I know not whether I should have divined the author of " Emile " when he was twenty years of age , supposing that I had been his contemporary , and had enjoyed the honor of his acquaintance . But I have known you , I have loved you , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ; for the first time in my life , I am going to risk a prophecy . Keep this letter , read it again fifteen or twenty years hence , perhaps twenty-five , and if at that time the prediction which I am about to make has not been fulfilled , burn it as a piece of folly out of charity and respect for my memory . This is my prediction : you will be , Proudhon , in spite of yourself , inevitably , by the fact of your destiny , a writer , an author ; you will be a philosopher ; you will be one of the lights of the century , and your name will occupy a place in the annals of the nineteenth century , like those of Gassendi , Descartes , Malebranche , and Bacon in the seventeenth , and those of Diderot , Montesquieu , Helvetius . Locke , Hume , and Holbach in the eighteenth . Such will be your lot ! Do now what you will , set type in a printing-office , bring up children , bury yourself in deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all one to me ; you can not escape your destiny ; you can not divest yourself of your noblest feature , that active , strong , and inquiring mind , with which you are endowed ; your place in the world has been appointed , and it can not remain empty . Go where you please , I expect you in Paris , talking philosophy and the doctrines of Plato ; you will have to come , whether you want to or not . I , who say this to you , must feel very sure of it in order to be willing to put it upon paper , since , without reward for my prophetic skill ,  --  to which , I assure you , I make not the slightest claim ,  --  I run the risk of passing for a hare-brained fellow , in case I prove to be mistaken : he plays a bold game who risks his good sense upon his cards , in return for the very trifling and insignificant merit of having divined a young man 's future . " When I say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial phrase which you must not allow to mislead you as to my projects and plans . To reside in Paris is disagreeable to me , very much so ; and when this fine-art fever which possesses me has left me , I shall abandon the place without regret to seek a more peaceful residence in a provincial town , provided always the town shall afford me the means of living , bread , a bed , books , rest , and solitude . How I miss , my good Proudhon , that dark , obscure , smoky chamber in which I dwelt in Besancon , and where we spent so many pleasant hours in the discussion of philosophy ! Do you remember it ? But that is now far away . Will that happy time ever return ? Shall we one day meet again ? Here my life is restless , uncertain , precarious , and , what is worse , indolent , illiterate , and vagrant . I do no work , I live in idleness , I ramble about ; I do not read , I no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I glance over a few metaphysical works , and after a days walk through dirty , filthy , crowded streets . I lie down with empty head and tired body , to repeat the performance on the following day . What is the object of these walks , you will ask . I make visits , my friend ; I hold interviews with stupid people . Then a fit of curiosity seizes me , the least inquisitive of beings : there are museums , libraries , assemblies , churches , palaces , gardens , and theatres to visit . I am fond of pictures , fond of music , fond of sculpture ; all these are beautiful and good , but they can not appease hunger , nor take the place of my pleasant readings of Bailly , Hume , and Tennemann , which I used to enjoy by my fireside when I was able to read . " But enough of complaints . Do not allow this letter to affect you too much , and do not think that I give way to dejection or despondency ; no , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not know yet what my calling is , nor for what branch of polite literature I am best fitted ; I do not even know whether I am , or ever shall be , fitted for any : but what matters it ? I suffer , I labor , I dream , I enjoy , I think ; and , in a word , when my last hour strikes , I shall have lived . " Proudhon , I love you , I esteem you ; and , believe me , these are not mere phrases . What interest could I have in flattering and praising a poor printer ? Are you rich , that you may pay for courtiers ? Have you a sumptuous table , a dashing wife , and gold to scatter , in order to attract them to your suite ? Have you the glory , honors , credit , which would render your acquaintance pleasing to their vanity and pride ? No ; you are poor , obscure , abandoned ; but , poor , obscure , and abandoned , you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which that word imposes upon honorable people , when they venture to assume it . That friend is myself : put me to the test . " GUSTAVE FALLOT . " It appears from this letter that if , at this period , Proudhon had already exhibited to the eyes of a clairvoyant friend his genius for research and investigation , it was in the direction of philosophical , rather than of economical and social , questions . Having become foreman in the house of Gauthier &; Co. , who carried on a large printing establishment at Besancon , he corrected the proofs of ecclesiastical writers , the Fathers of the Church . As they were printing a Bible , a Vulgate , he was led to compare the Latin with the original Hebrew . " In this way , " says Sainte Beuve , " he learned Hebrew by himself , and , as everything was connected in his mind , he was led to the study of comparative philology . As the house of Gauthier published many works on Church history and theology , he came also to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extensive knowledge of theology , which afterwards caused misinformed persons to think that he had been in an ecclesiastical seminary . " Towards 1836 , Proudhon left the house of Gauthier , and , in company with an associate , established a small printing-office in Besancon . His contribution to the partnership consisted , not so much in capital , as in his knowledge of the trade . His partner committing suicide in 1838 , Proudhon was obliged to wind up the business , an operation which he did not accomplish as quickly and as easily as he hoped . He was then urged by his friends to enter the ranks of the competitors for the Suard pension . This pension consisted of an income of fifteen hundred francs bequeathed to the Academy of Besancon by Madame Suard , the widow of the academician , to be given once in three years to the young man residing in the department of Doubs , a bachelor of letters or of science , and not possessing a fortune , whom the Academy of Besancon SHOULD DEEM BEST FITTED FOR A LITERARY OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF MEDICINE . The first to win the Suard pension was Gustave Fallot . Mauvais , who was a distinguished astronomer in the Academy of Sciences , was the second . Proudhon aspired to be the third . To qualify himself , he had to be received as a bachelor of letters , and was obliged to write a letter to the Academy of Besancon . In a phrase of this letter , the terms of which he had to modify , though he absolutely refused to change its spirit , Proudhon expressed his firm resolve to labor for the amelioration of the condition of his brothers , the working-men . The only thing which he had then published was an " Essay on General Grammar , " which appeared without the author 's signature . While reprinting , at Besancon , the " Primitive Elements of Languages , Discovered by the Comparison of Hebrew roots with those of the Latin and French , " by the Abbe Bergier , Proudhon had enlarged the edition of his " Essay on General Grammar . " The date of the edition , 1837 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competing for the Suard pension . In this work , which continued and completed that of the Abbe Bergier , Proudhon adopted the same point of view , that of Moses and of Biblical tradition . Two years later , in February , 1839 , being already in possession of the Suard pension , he addressed to the Institute , as a competitor for the Volney prize , a memoir entitled : " Studies in Grammatical Classification and the Derivation of some French words . " It was his first work , revised and presented in another form . Four memoirs only were sent to the Institute , none of which gained the prize . Two honorable mentions were granted , one of them to memoir No. 4 ; that is , to P. J. Proudhon , printer at Besancon . The judges were MM . Amedde Jaubert , Reinaud , and Burnouf . " The committee , " said the report presented at the annual meeting of the five academies on Thursday , May 2 , 1839 , " has paid especial attention to manuscripts No. 1 and No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant the prize to either of these works , because they do not appear to be sufficiently elaborated . The committee , which finds in No. 4 some ingenious analyses , particularly in regard to the mechanism of the Hebrew language , regrets that the author has resorted to hazardous conjectures , and has sometimes forgotten the special recommendation of the committee to pursue the experimental and comparative method . " Proudhon remembered this . He attended the lectures of Eugene Burnouf , and , as soon as he became acquainted with the labors and discoveries of Bopp and his successors , he definitively abandoned an hypothesis which had been condemned by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-lettres . He then sold , for the value of the paper , the remaining copies of the " Essay " published by him in 1837 . In 1850 , they were still lying in a grocer 's back-shop . A neighboring publisher then placed the edition on the market , with the attractive name of Proudhon upon it . A lawsuit ensued , in which the author was beaten . His enemies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been glad to have proved him a renegade and a recanter . Proudhon , in his work on " Justice , " gives some interesting details of this lawsuit . In possession of the Suard pension , Proudhon took part in the contest proposed by the Academy of Besancon on the question of the utility of the celebration of Sunday . His memoir obtained honorable mention , together with a medal which was awarded him , in open session , on the 24th of August , 1839 . The reporter of the committee , the Abbe Doney , since made Bishop of Montauban , called attention to the unquestionable superiority of his talent . " But , " says Sainte Beuve , " he reproached him with having adopted dangerous theories , and with having touched upon questions of practical politics and social organization , where upright intentions and zeal for the public welfare can not justify rash solutions . " Was it policy , we mean prudence , which induced Proudhon to screen his ideas of equality behind the Mosaic law ? Sainte Beuve , like many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that , having asked Proudhon , in August , 1848 , if he did not consider himself indebted in some respects to his fellow-countryman , Charles Fourier , we received from him the following reply : " I have certainly read Fourier , and have spoken of him more than once in my works ; but , upon the whole , I do not think that I owe anything to him . My real masters , those who have caused fertile ideas to spring up in my mind , are three in number : first , the Bible ; next , Adam Smith ; and last , Hegel . " Freely confessed in the " Celebration of Sunday , " the influence of the Bible on Proudhon is no less manifest in his first memoir on property . Proudhon undoubtedly brought to this work many ideas of his own ; but is not the very foundation of ancient Jewish law to be found in its condemnation of usurious interest and its denial of the right of personal appropriation of land ? The first memoir on property appeared in 1840 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government . " Proudhon dedicated it , in a letter which served as the preface , to the Academy of Besancon . The latter , finding itself brought to trial by its pensioner , took the affair to heart , and evoked it , says Sainte Beuve , with all possible haste . The pension narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold defender of the principle of equality of conditions . M. Vivien , then Minister of Justice , who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the author , wished first to obtain the opinion of the economist , Blanqui , a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences . Proudhon having presented to this academy a copy of his book , M. Blanqui was appointed to review it . This review , though it opposed Proudhon 's views , shielded him . Treated as a savant by M. Blanqui , the author was not prosecuted . He was always grateful to MM . Blanqui and Vivien for their handsome conduct in the matter . M. Blanqui 's review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 7th of September , 1840 , naturally led Proudhon to address to him , in the form of a letter , his second memoir on property , which appeared in April , 1841 . Proudhon had endeavored , in his first memoir , to demonstrate that the pursuit of equality of conditions is the true principle of right and of government . In the " Letter to M. Blanqui , " he passes in review the numerous and varied methods by which this principle gradually becomes realized in all societies , especially in modern society . In 1842 , a third memoir appeared , entitled , " A Notice to Proprietors , or a Letter to M. Victor Considerant , Editor of ' La Phalange , ' in Reply to a Defence of Property . " Here the influence of Adam Smith manifested itself , and was frankly admitted . Did not Adam Smith find , in the principle of equality , the first of all the laws which govern wages ? There are other laws , undoubtedly ; but Proudhon considers them all as springing from the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoir . Thus , in humanity , there are two principles ,  --  one which leads us to equality , another which separates us from it . By the former , we treat each other as associates ; by the latter , as strangers , not to say enemies . This distinction , which is constantly met with throughout the three memoirs , contained already , in germ , the idea which gave birth to the " System of Economical Contradictions , " which appeared in 1846 , the idea of antinomy or contre-loi . The " Notice to Proprietors " was seized by the magistrates of Besancon ; and Proudhon was summoned to appear before the assizes of Doubs within a week . He read his written defence to the jurors in person , and was acquitted . The jury , like M. Blanqui , viewed him only as a philosopher , an inquirer , a savant . In 1843 , Proudhon published the " Creation of Order in Humanity , " a large volume , which does not deal exclusively with questions of social economy . Religion , philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated at considerable length . Released from his printing-office on the 1st of March of the same year , Proudhon had to look for a chance to earn his living . Messrs . Gauthier Bros. , carriers by water between Mulhouse and Lyons , the eldest of whom was Proudhon 's companion in childhood , conceived the happy thought of employing him , of utilizing his ability in their business , and in settling the numerous points of difficulty which daily arose . Besides the large number of accounts which his new duties required him to make out , and which retarded the publication of the " System of Economical Contradictions , " until October , 1846 , we ought to mention a work , which , before it appeared in pamphlet form , was published in the " Revue des Economistes , "  --  " Competition between Railroads and Navigable Ways . " " Le Miserere , or the Repentance of a King , " which he published in March , 1845 , in the " Revue Independante , " during that Lenten season when Lacordaire was preaching in Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of economical problems , Proudhon had not lost his interest in questions of religious history . Among his writings on these questions , which he was unfortunately obliged to leave unfinished , we may mention a nearly completed history of the early Christian heresies , and of the struggle of Christianity against Caesarism . We have said that , in 1848 , Proudhon recognized three masters . Having no knowledge of the German language , he could not have read the works of Hegel , which at that time had not been translated into French . It was Charles Grun , a German , who had come to France to study the various philosophical and socialistic systems , who gave him the substance of the Hegelian ideas . During the winter of 1844-45 , Charles Grun had some long conversations with Proudhon , which determined , very decisively , not the ideas , which belonged exclusively to the bisontin thinker , but the form of the important work on which he labored after 1843 , and which was published in 1846 by Guillaumin . Hegel 's great idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability in the " System of Economical Contradictions , " is as follows : Antinomy , that is , the existence of two laws or tendencies which are opposed to each other , is possible , not only with two different things , but with one and the same thing . Considered in their thesis , that is , in the law or tendency which created them , all the economical categories are rational ,  --  competition , monopoly , the balance of trade , and property , as well as the division of labor , machinery , taxation , and credit . But , like communism and population , all these categories are antinomical ; all are opposed , not only to each other , but to themselves . All is opposition , and disorder is born of this system of opposition . Hence , the sub-title of the work ,  --  " Philosophy of Misery . " No category can be suppressed ; the opposition , antinomy , or contre-tendance , which exists in each of them , can not be suppressed . Where , then , lies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , Proudhon began to look for it in a superior synthesis , which should reconcile the thesis and antithesis . Afterwards , while at work upon his book on " Justice , " he saw that the antinomical terms do not cancel each other , any more than the opposite poles of an electric pile destroy each other ; that they are the procreative cause of motion , life , and progress ; that the problem is to discover , not their fusion , which would be death , but their equilibrium ,  --  an equilibrium for ever unstable , varying with the development of society . On the cover of the " System of Economical Contradictions , " Proudhon announced , as soon to appear , his " Solution of the Social Problem . " This work , upon which he was engaged when the Revolution of 1848 broke out , had to be cut up into pamphlets and newspaper articles . The two pamphlets , which he published in March , 1848 , before he became editor of " Le Representant du Peuple , " bear the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first , which is mainly a criticism of the early acts of the provisional government , is notable from the fact that in it Proudhon , in advance of all others , energetically opposed the establishment of national workshops . The second , " Organization of Credit and Circulation , " sums up in a few pages his idea of economical progress : a gradual reduction of interest , profit , rent , taxes , and wages . All progress hitherto has been made in this manner ; in this manner it must continue to be made . Those workingmen who favor a nominal increase of wages are , unconsciously following a back-track , opposed to all their interests . After having published in " Le Representant du Peuple , " the statutes of the Bank of Exchange ,  --  a bank which was to make no profits , since it was to have no stockholders , and which , consequently , was to discount commercial paper with out interest , charging only a commission sufficient to defray its running expenses ,  --  Proudhon endeavored , in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These articles have been collected in one volume , under the double title , " Resume of the Social Question ; Bank of Exchange . " His other articles , those which up to December , 1848 , were inspired by the progress of events , have been collected in another volume ,  --  " Revolutionary Ideas . " Almost unknown in March , 1848 , and struck off in April from the list of candidates for the Constituent Assembly by the delegation of workingmen which sat at the Luxembourg , Proudhon had but a very small number of votes at the general elections of April . At the complementary elections , which were held in the early days of June , he was elected in Paris by seventy-seven thousand votes . After the fatal days of June , he published an article on le terme , which caused the first suspension of " Le Representant du Peuple . " It was at that time that he introduced a bill into the Assembly , which , being referred to the Committee on the Finances , drew forth , first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proudhon delivered , on the 31st of July , in reply to this report . " Le Representant du Peuple , " reappearing a few days later , he wrote , a propos of the law requiring journals to give bonds , his famous article on " The Malthusians " ( August 10 , 1848 ) . Ten days afterwards , " Le Representant du Peuple , " again suspended , definitively ceased to appear . " Le Peuple , " of which he was the editor-in-chief , and the first number of which was issued in the early part of September , appeared weekly at first , for want of sufficient bonds ; it afterwards appeared daily , with a double number once a week . Before " Le Peuple " had obtained its first bond , Proudhon published a remarkable pamphlet on the " Right to Labor , "  --  a right which he denied in the form in which it was then affirmed . It was during the same period that he proposed , at the Poissonniere banquet , his Toast to the Revolution . Proudhon , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proposed in his stead , first , Ledru-Rollin , and then , in view of the reluctance of the organizers of the banquet , the illustrious president of the party of the Mountain , Lamennais . It was evidently his intention to induce the representatives of the Extreme Left to proclaim at last with him the Democratic and Social Republic . Lamennais being accepted by the organizers , the Mountain promised to be present at the banquet . The night before , all seemed right , when General Cavaignac replaced Minister Senart by Minister Dufaure-Vivien . The Mountain , questioning the government , proposed a vote of confidence in the old minister , and , tacitly , of want of confidence in the new . Proudhon abstained from voting on this proposition . The Mountain declared that it would not attend the banquet , if Proudhon was to be present . Five Montagnards , Mathieu of Drome at their head , went to the temporary office of " Le Peuple " to notify him of this . " Citizen Proudhon , " said they to the organizers in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition of the Mountain , has betrayed the Republican cause . " Proudhon , vehemently questioned , began his defence by recalling , on the one hand , the treatment which he had received from the dismissed minister ; and , on the other , the impartial conduct displayed towards him in 1840 by M. Vivien , the new minister . He then attacked the Mountain by telling its delegates that it sought only a pretext , and that really , in spite of its professions of Socialism in private conversation , whether with him or with the organizers of the banquet , it had not the courage to publicly declare itself Socialist . On the following day , in his Toast to the Revolution , a toast which was filled with allusions to the exciting scene of the night before , Proudhon commenced his struggle against the Mountain . His duel with Felix Pyat was one of the episodes of this struggle , which became less bitter on Proudhon 's side after the Mountain finally decided to publicly proclaim the Democratic and Social Republic . The campaign for the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proudhon made a very sharp attack on the candidacy of Louis Bonaparte in a pamphlet which is regarded as one of his literary chefs-d'oeuvre : the " Pamphlet on the Presidency . " An opponent of this institution , against which he had voted in the Constituent Assembly , he at first decided to take no part in the campaign . But soon seeing that he was thus increasing the chances of Louis Bonaparte , and that if , as was not at all probable , the latter should not obtain an absolute majority of the votes , the Assembly would not fail to elect General Cavaignac , he espoused , for the sake of form , the candidacy of Raspail , who was supported by his friends in the Socialist Committee . Charles Delescluze , the editor-in-chief of " La Revolution Democratique et Sociale , " who could not forgive him for having preferred Raspail to Ledru-Rollin , the candidate of the Mountain , attacked him on the day after the election with a violence which overstepped all bounds . At first , Proudhon had the wisdom to refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he became aggressive himself , and Delescluze sent him his seconds . This time , Proudhon positively refused to fight ; he would not have fought with Felix Pyat , had not his courage been called in question . On the 25th of January , 1849 , Proudhon , rising from a sick bed , saw that the existence of the Constituent Assembly was endangered by the coalition of the monarchical parties with Louis Bonaparte , who was already planning his coup d'Etat . He did not hesitate to openly attack the man who had just received five millions of votes . He wanted to break the idol ; he succeeded only in getting prosecuted and condemned himself . The prosecution demanded against him was authorized by a majority of the Constituent Assembly , in spite of the speech which he delivered on that occasion . Declared guilty by the jury , he was sentenced , in March , 1849 , to three years ' imprisonment and the payment of a fine of ten thousand francs . Proudhon had not abandoned for a single moment his project of a Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient number of merchants and manufacturers for adherents . This bank , which he then called the Bank of the People , and around which he wished to gather the numerous working-people 's associations which had been formed since the 24th of February , 1848 , had already obtained a certain number of subscribers and adherents , the latter to the number of thirty-seven thousand . It was about to commence operations , when Proudhon 's sentence forced him to choose between imprisonment and exile . He did not hesitate to abandon his project and return the money to the subscribers . He explained the motives which led him to this decision in an article in " Le Peuple . " Having fled to Belgium , he remained there but a few days , going thence to Paris , under an assumed name , to conceal himself in a house in the Rue de Chabrol . From his hiding-place he sent articles almost every day , signed and unsigned , to " Le Peuple . " In the evening , dressed in a blouse , he went to some secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , he risked an evening promenade upon the Boulevards , and afterwards carried his imprudence so far as to take a stroll by daylight in the neighborhood of the Gare du Nord . It was not long before he was recognized by the police , who arrested him on the 6th of June , 1849 , in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere . Taken to the office of the prefect of police , then to Sainte-Pelagie , he was in the Conciergerie on the day of the 13th of June , 1849 , which ended with the violent suppression of " Le Peuple . " He then began to write the " Confessions of a Revolutionist , " published towards the end of the year . He had been again transferred to Sainte-Pelagie , when he married , in December , 1849 , Mlle. Euphrasie Piegard , a young working girl whose hand he had requested in 1847 . Madame Proudhon bore him four daughters , of whom but two , Catherine and Stephanie , survived their father . Stephanie died in 1873 . In October , 1849 , " Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Voix du Peuple , " which Proudhon edited from his prison cell . In it were published his discussions with Pierre Leroux and Bastiat . The political articles which he sent to " La Voix du Peuple " so displeased the government finally , that it transferred him to Doullens , where he was secretly confined for some time . Afterwards taken back to Paris , to appear before the assizes of the Seine in reference to an article in " La Voix du Peuple , " he was defended by M. Cremieux and acquitted . From the Conciergerie he went again to Sainte-Pelagie , where he ended his three years in prison on the 6th of June , 1852 . " La Voix du Peuple , " suppressed before the promulgation of the law of the 31st of May , had been replaced by a weekly sheet , " Le Peuple " of 1850 . Established by the aid of the principal members of the Mountain , this journal soon met with the fate of its predecessors . In 1851 , several months before the coup d'Etat , Proudhon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineteenth Century , " in which , after having shown the logical series of unitary governments ,  --  from monarchy , which is the first term , to the direct government of the people , which is the last ,  --  he opposes the ideal of an-archy or self-government to the communistic or governmental ideal . At this period , the Socialist party , discouraged by the elections of 1849 , which resulted in a greater conservative triumph than those of 1848 , and justly angry with the national representative body which had just passed the law of the 31st of May , 1850 , demanded direct legislation and direct government . Proudhon , who did not want , at any price , the plebiscitary system which he had good reason to regard as destructive of liberty , did not hesitate to point out , to those of his friends who expected every thing from direct legislation , one of the antinomies of universal suffrage . In so far as it is an institution intended to achieve , for the benefit of the greatest number , the social reforms to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if it pretends to legislate or govern directly . For , until the social reforms are accomplished , the greatest number is of necessity the least enlightened , and consequently the least capable of understanding and effecting reforms . In regard to the antinomy , pointed out by him , of liberty and government ,  --  whether the latter be monarchic , aristocratic , or democratic in form ,  --  Proudhon , whose chief desire was to preserve liberty , naturally sought the solution in the free contract . But though the free contract may be a practical solution of purely economical questions , it can not be made use of in politics . Proudhon recognized this ten years later , when his beautiful study on " War and Peace " led him to find in the FEDERATIVE PRINCIPLE the exact equilibrium of liberty and government . " The Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d ' Etat " appeared in 1852 , a few months after his release from prison . At that time , terror prevailed to such an extent that no one was willing to publish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obtaining this permission by writing to Louis Bonaparte a letter which he published at the same time with the work . The latter being offered for sale , Proudhon was warned that he would not be allowed to publish any more books of the same character . At that time he entertained the idea of writing a universal history entitled " Chronos . " This project was never fulfilled . Already the father of two children , and about to be presented with a third , Proudhon was obliged to devise some immediate means of gaining a living ; he resumed his labors , and published , at first anonymously , the " Manual of a Speculator in the Stock-Exchange . " Later , in 1857 , after having completed the work , he did not hesitate to sign it , acknowledging in the preface his indebtedness to his collaborator , G. Duchene . Meantime , he vainly sought permission to establish a journal , or review . This permission was steadily refused him . The imperial government always suspected him after the publication of the " Social Revolution Demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1853 , Proudhon issued in Belgium a pamphlet entitled " The Philosophy of Progress . " Entirely inoffensive as it was , this pamphlet , which he endeavored to send into France , was seized on the frontier . Proudhon 's complaints were of no avail . The empire gave grants after grants to large companies . A financial society , having asked for the grant of a railroad in the east of France , employed Proudhon to write several memoirs in support of this demand . The grant was given to another company . The author was offered an indemnity as compensation , to be paid ( as was customary in such cases ) by the company which received the grant . It is needless to say that Proudhon would accept nothing . Then , wishing to explain to the public , as well as to the government , the end which he had in view , he published the work entitled " Reforms to be Effected in the Management of Railroads . " Towards the end of 1854 , Proudhon had already begun his book on " Justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he recovered with great difficulty . Ever afterwards his health was delicate . At last , on the 22d of April , 1858 , he published , in three large volumes , the important work upon which he had labored since 1854 . This work had two titles : the first , " Justice in the Revolution and in the Church ; " the second , " New Principles of Practical Philosophy , addressed to His Highness Monseigneur Mathieu , Cardinal-Archbishop of Besancon . " On the 27th of April , when there had scarcely been time to read the work , an order was issued by the magistrate for its seizure ; on the 28th the seizure was effected . To this first act of the magistracy , the author of the incriminated book replied on the 11th of May in a strongly-motived petition , demanding a revision of the concordat of 1802 ; or , in other words , a new adjustment of the relations between Church and State . At bottom , this petition was but the logical consequence of the work itself . An edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , the " Petition to the Senate " was regarded by the public prosecutor as an aggravation of the offence or offences discovered in the body of the work to which it was an appendix , and was seized in its turn on the 23d . On the first of June , the author appealed to the Senate in a second " Petition , " which was deposited with the first in the office of the Secretary of the Assembly , the guardian and guarantee , according to the constitution of 1852 , of the principles of ' 89 . On the 2d of June , the two processes being united , Proudhon appeared at the bar with his publisher , the printer of the book , and the printer of the petition , to receive the sentence of the police magistrate , which condemned him to three years ' imprisonment , a fine of four thousand francs , and the suppression of his work . It is needless to say that the publisher and printers were also condemned by the sixth chamber . Proudhon lodged an appeal ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of which he would have been liable to a new prosecution , gave him the power to publish previous to the hearing . Having decided to make use of the means which the law permitted , he urged in vain the printers who were prosecuted with him to lend him their aid . He then demanded of Attorney-General Chaix d'Est Ange a statement to the effect that the twenty-third article of the law of the 17th of May , 1819 , allows a written defence , and that a printer runs no risk in printing it . The attorney-general flatly refused . Proudhon then started for Belgium , where he printed his defence , which could not , of course , cross the French frontier . This memoir is entitled to rank with the best of Beaumarchais 's ; it is entitled : " Justice prosecuted by the Church ; An Appeal from the Sentence passed upon P. J. Proudhon by the Police Magistrate of the Seine , on the 2d of June , 1858 . " A very close discussion of the grounds of the judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent resume of his great work . Once in Belgium , Proudhon did not fail to remain there . In 1859 , after the general amnesty which followed the Italian war , he at first thought himself included in it . But the imperial government , consulted by his friends , notified him that , in its opinion , and in spite of the contrary advice of M. Faustin Helie , his condemnation was not of a political character . Proudhon , thus classed by the government with the authors of immoral works , thought it beneath his dignity to protest , and waited patiently for the advent of 1863 to allow him to return to France . In Belgium , where he was not slow in forming new friendships , he published in 1859-60 , in separate parts , a new edition of his great work on " Justice . " Each number contained , in addition to the original text carefully reviewed and corrected , numerous explanatory notes and some " Tidings of the Revolution . " In these tidings , which form a sort of review of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after having for a long time marched at the head of the progressive nations , France has become , without appearing to suspect it , the most retrogressive of nations ; and he considers her more than once as seriously threatened with moral death . The Italian war led him to write a new work , which he published in 1861 , entitled " War and Peace . " This work , in which , running counter to a multitude of ideas accepted until then without examination , he pronounced for the first time against the restoration of an aristocratic and priestly Poland , and against the establishment of a unitary government in Italy , created for him a multitude of enemies . Most of his friends , disconcerted by his categorical affirmation of a right of force , notified him that they decidedly disapproved of his new publication . " You see , " triumphantly cried those whom he had always combated , " this man is only a sophist . " Led by his previous studies to test every thing by the question of right , Proudhon asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a real right of which war is the vindication , and victory the demonstration . This right , which he roughly calls the right of the strongest or the right of force , and which is , after all , only the right of the most worthy to the preference in certain definite cases , exists , says Proudhon , independently of war . It can not be legitimately vindicated except where necessity clearly demands the subordination of one will to another , and within the limits in which it exists ; that is , without ever involving the enslavement of one by the other . Among nations , the right of the majority , which is only a corollary of the right of force , is as unacceptable as universal monarchy . Hence , until equilibrium is established and recognized between States or national forces , there must be war . War , says Proudhon , is not always necessary to determine which side is the strongest ; and he has no trouble in proving this by examples drawn from the family , the workshop , and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves that it by no means corresponds in practice to that which it ought to be according to his theory of the right of force . The systematic horrors of war naturally lead him to seek a cause for it other than the vindication of this right ; and then only does the economist take it upon himself to denounce this cause to those who , like himself , want peace . The necessity of finding abroad a compensation for the misery resulting in every nation from the absence of economical equilibrium , is , according to Proudhon , the ever real , though ever concealed , cause of war . The pages devoted to this demonstration and to his theory of poverty , which he clearly distinguishes from misery and pauperism , shed entirely new light upon the philosophy of history . As for the author 's conclusion , it is a very simple one . Since the treaty of Westphalia , and especially since the treaties of 1815 , equilibrium has been the international law of Europe . It remains now , not to destroy it , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation protected by it , for the equilibrium of economical forces . The last line of the book , evidently written to check imperial ambition , is : " Humanity wants no more war . " In 1861 , after Garibaldi 's expedition and the battle of Castelfidardo , Proudhon immediately saw that the establishment of Italian unity would be a severe blow to European equilibrium . It was chiefly in order to maintain this equilibrium that he pronounced so energetically in favor of Italian federation , even though it should be at first only a federation of monarchs . In vain was it objected that , in being established by France , Italian unity would break European equilibrium in our favor . Proudhon , appealing to history , showed that every State which breaks the equilibrium in its own favor only causes the other States to combine against it , and thereby diminishes its influence and power . He added that , nations being essentially selfish , Italy would not fail , when opportunity offered , to place her interest above her gratitude . To maintain European equilibrium by diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter in organized federations , not for attack , but for defence ; and with these federations , which , if they were not republican already , would quickly become so , to hold in check the great military monarchies ,  --  such , in the beginning of 1861 , was the political programme of Proudhon . The object of the federations , he said , will be to guarantee , as far as possible , the beneficent reign of peace ; and they will have the further effect of securing in every nation the triumph of liberty over despotism . Where the largest unitary State is , there liberty is in the greatest danger ; further , if this State be democratic , despotism without the counterpoise of majorities is to be feared . With the federation , it is not so . The universal suffrage of the federal State is checked by the universal suffrage of the federated States ; and the latter is offset in its turn by PROPERTY , the stronghold of liberty , which it tends , not to destroy , but to balance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others which were only hinted at in his work on " War and Peace , " were developed by Proudhon in his subsequent publications , one of which has for its motto , " Reforms always , Utopias never . " The thinker had evidently finished his evolution . The Council of State of the canton of Vaud having offered prizes for essays on the question of taxation , previously discussed at a congress held at Lausanne , Proudhon entered the ranks and carried off the first prize . His memoir was published in 1861 under the title of " The Theory of Taxation . " About the same time , he wrote at Brussels , in " L'Office de Publicite , " some remarkable articles on the question of literary property , which was discussed at a congress held in Belgium , These articles must not be confounded with " Literary Majorats , " a more complete work on the same subject , which was published in 1863 , soon after his return to France . Arbitrarily excepted from the amnesty in 1859 , Proudhon was pardoned two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of this favor , and seemed resolved to remain in Belgium until the 2d of June , 1863 , the time when he was to acquire the privilege of prescription , when an absurd and ridiculous riot , excited in Brussels by an article published by him on federation and unity in Italy , induced him to hasten his return to France . Stones were thrown against the house in which he lived , in the Faubourg d'Ixelles . After having placed his wife and daughters in safety among his friends at Brussels , he arrived in Paris in September , 1862 , and published there , " Federation and Italian Unity , " a pamphlet which naturally commences with the article which served as a pretext for the rioters in Brussels . Among the works begun by Proudhon while in Belgium , which death did not allow him to finish , we ought to mention a " History of Poland , " which will be published later ; and , " The Theory of Property , " which appeared in 1865 , before " The Gospels Annotated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art and its Social Destiny . " The publications of Proudhon , in 1863 , were : 1 . " Literary Majorats : An Examination of a Bill having for its object the Creation of a Perpetual Monopoly for the Benefit of Authors , Inventors , and Artists ; " 2 . " The Federative Principle and the Necessity of Re-establishing the Revolutionary party ; " 3 . " The Sworn Democrats and the Refractories ; " 4 . " Whether the Treaties of 1815 have ceased to exist ? Acts of the Future Congress . " The disease which was destined to kill him grew worse and worse ; but Proudhon labored constantly ! ... A series of articles , published in 1864 in " Le Messager de Paris , " have been collected in a pamphlet under the title of " New Observations on Italian Unity . " He hoped to publish during the same year his work on " The Political Capacity of the Working Classes , " but was unable to write the last chapter .... He grew weaker continually . His doctor prescribed rest . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent a month . Having returned to Paris , he resumed his labor with difficulty .... From the month of December onwards , the heart disease made rapid progress ; the oppression became insupportable , his legs were swollen , and he could not sleep .... On the 19th of January , 1865 , he died , towards two o'clock in the morning , in the arms of his wife , his sister-in-law , and the friend who writes these lines .... The publication of his correspondence , to which his daughter Catherine is faithfully devoted , will tend , no doubt , to increase his reputation as a thinker , as a writer , and as an honest man . J. A. LANGLOIS . PREFACE . The following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this memoir :  --  " To the Members of the Academy of Besancon " PARIS , June 30 , 1840 . " GENTLEMEN ,  --  In the course of your debate of the 9th of May , 1833 , in regard to the triennial pension established by Madame Suard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests the titulary to present it annually , during the first fortnight in July , with a succinct and logical statement of the various studies which he has pursued during the year which has just expired . ' " I now propose , gentlemen , to discharge this duty . " When I solicited your votes , I boldly avowed my intention to bend my efforts to the discovery of some means of AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL , MORAL , AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES . This idea , foreign as it may have seemed to the object of my candidacy , you received favorably ; and , by the precious distinction with which it has been your pleasure to honor me , you changed this formal offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation . Thenceforth I understood with how worthy and honorable a society I had to deal : my regard for its enlightenment , my recognition of its benefits , my enthusiasm for its glory , were unbounded . " Convinced at once that , in order to break loose from the beaten paths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my study of man and society by scientific methods , and in a rigorous manner , I devoted one year to philology and grammar ; linguistics , or the natural history of speech , being , of all the sciences , that which was best suited to the character of my mind , seemed to bear the closest relation to the researches which I was about to commence . A treatise , written at this period upon one of the most interesting questions of comparative grammar , 2 if it did not reveal the astonishing success , at least bore witness to the thoroughness , of my labors . " Since that time , metaphysics and moral science have been my only studies ; my perception of the fact that these sciences , though badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere , are , like the natural sciences , susceptible of demonstration and certainty , has already rewarded my efforts . " But , gentlemen , of all the masters whom I have followed , to none do I owe so much as to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished hopes , have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road ; this memoir on property is the child of your thought . " In 1838 , the Academy of Besancon proposed the following question : TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES , AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION ? " Thereby it asked , in less general terms , what was the cause of the social evil , and what was its remedy ? You admitted that yourselves , gentlemen when your committee reported that the competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of suicide , as well as the means of preventing each of them ; but that from this enumeration , chronicled with more or less skill , no positive information had been gained , either as to the primary cause of the evil , or as to its remedy . " In 1839 , your programme , always original and varied in its academical expression , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady , the neglect of the principles of religion and morality , the desire for wealth , the passion for enjoyment , and political disturbances . All these data were embodied by you in a single proposition : THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE , MORALITY , AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION . " In a Christian tongue you asked , gentlemen , what was the true system of society . A competitor 3 dared to maintain , and believed that he had proved , that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals is inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of conditions ; that without equality this institution is an anomaly and an impossibility : that equality alone can revive this ancient and mysterious keeping of the seventh day . This argument did not meet with your approbation , since , without denying the relation pointed out by the competitor , you judged , and rightly gentlemen , that the principle of equality of conditions not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hypotheses . " Finally , gentlemen , this fundamental principle of equality you presented for competition in the following terms : THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME , AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE , OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN . " Instead of confining one to common places without breadth or significance , it seems to me that your question should be developed as follows :  --  " If the law has been able to render the right of heredity common to all the children of one father , can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great-grandchildren ? " If the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family , can it not , by the right of heredity , cease to heed it in the race , in the tribe , in the nation ? " Can equality , by the right of succession , be preserved between citizens , as well as between cousins and brothers ? In a word , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question : What is the principle of heredity ? What are the foundations of inequality ? What is property ? " Such , gentlemen , is the object of the memoir that I offer you to day . " If I have rightly grasped the object of your thought ; if I succeed in bringing to light a truth which is indisputable , but , from causes which I am bold enough to claim to have explained , has always been misunderstood ; if by an infallible method of investigation , I establish the dogma of equality of conditions ; if I determine the principle of civil law , the essence of justice , and the form of society ; if I annihilate property forever ,  --  to you , gentlemen , will redound all the glory , for it is to your aid and your inspiration that I owe it . " My purpose in this work is the application of method to the problems of philosophy ; every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right ; but I should be unjust did I not distinguish between this pretended science and the men who practise it . Devoted to studies both laborious and severe , entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow-citizens by their knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach , that of an excessive deference to arbitrary laws . " I have been pitiless in my criticism of the economists : for them I confess that , in general , I have no liking . The arrogance and the emptiness of their writings , their impertinent pride and their unwarranted blunders , have disgusted me . Whoever , knowing them , pardons them , may read them . " I have severely blamed the learned Christian Church : it was my duty . This blame results from the facts which I call attention to : why has the Church decreed concerning things which it does not understand ? The Church has erred in dogma and in morals ; physics and mathematics testify against her . It may be wrong for me to say it , but surely it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore religion , gentlemen , it is necessary to condemn the Church . " Perhaps you will regret , gentlemen , that , in giving all my attention to method and evidence , I have too much neglected form and style : in vain should I have tried to do better . Literary hope and faith I have none . The nineteenth century is , in my eyes , a genesic era , in which new principles are elaborated , but in which nothing that is written shall endure . That is the reason , in my opinion , why , among so many men of talent , France to-day counts not one great writer . In a society like ours , to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism . Of what use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth ? Pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end , that which it behooves us to do is to precipitate the catastrophe . The most deserving among us is he who plays best this part . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I not confess it , gentlemen ? I have aspired to your suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner , hating all which exists and full of projects for its destruction ; I shall finish this investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation . I have derived more peace from the knowledge of the truth , than anger from the feeling of oppression ; and the most precious fruit that I could wish to gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and its cause , and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm . My hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded ; perhaps at times I have been guilty , in my indignation , of confounding persons and things ; at present I can only despise and complain ; to cease to hate I only needed to know . " It is for you now , gentlemen , whose mission and character are the proclamation of the truth , it is for you to instruct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hope and what they ought to fear . The people , incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them , applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas , provided that in them they get a taste of flattery : to them the laws of thought are like the confines of the possible ; to-day they can no more distinguish between a savant and a sophist , than formerly they could tell a physician from a sorcerer . ' Inconsiderately accepting , gathering together , and accumulating everything that is new , regarding all reports as true and indubitable , at the breath or ring of novelty they assemble like bees at the sound of a basin . ' 4 " May you , gentlemen , desire equality as I myself desire it ; may you , for the eternal happiness of our country , become its propagators and its heralds ; may I be the last of your pensioners ! Of all the wishes that I can frame , that , gentlemen , is the most worthy of you and the most honorable for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most earnest gratitude , " Your pensioner , " P. August 24th , replied to the address of its pensioner by a note , the text of which I give below :  --  " A member calls the attention of the Academy to a pamphlet , published last June by the titulary of the Suard pension , entitled , " What is property ? " and dedicated by the author to the Academy . He is of the opinion that the society owes it to justice , to example , and to its own dignity , to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti-social doctrines contained in this publication . In consequence he demands : " 1 . That the Academy disavow and condemn , in the most formal manner , the work of the Suard pensioner , as having been published without its assent , and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members ; " 2 . That the pensioner be charged , in case he should publish a second edition of his book , to omit the dedication ; " 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records . " These three propositions , put to vote , are adopted . " After this ludicrous decree , which its authors thought to render powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction , I can only beg the reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our Academy . While my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating anathemas against my brochure , a man , who was a stranger to Franche-Comte , who did not know me , who might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which I had passed upon the economists , a publicist as learned as he was modest , loved by the people whose sorrows he felt , honored by the power which he sought to enlighten without flattering or disgracing it , M. Blanqui  --  member of the Institute , professor of political economy , defender of property  --  took up my defence before his associates and before the ministry , and saved me from the blows of a justice which is always blind , because it is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peruse with pleasure the letter which M. Blanqui did me the honor to write to me upon the publication of my second memoir , a letter as honorable to its author as it is flattering to him to whom it is addressed . " PARIS , May 1 , 1841 . " MONSIEUR ,  --  I hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second memoir upon property . I have read it with all the interest that an acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire . I am very glad that you have modified somewhat the rudeness of form which gave to a work of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet ; for you quite frightened me , sir , and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard to your intentions . One does not expend so much real knowledge with the purpose of inflaming his country . This proposition , now coming into notice  --  PROPERTY IS ROBBERY !  --  was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances , had you persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have softened the form , you are none the less faithful to the ground-work of your doctrines ; and although you have done me the honor to give me a share in this perilous teaching , I can not accept a partnership which , as far as talent goes , would surely be a credit to me , but which would compromise me in all other respects . " I agree with you in one thing only ; namely , that all kinds of property get too frequently abused in this world . But I do not reason from the abuse to the abolition ,  --  an heroic remedy too much like death , which cures all evils . I will go farther : I will confess that , of all abuses , the most hateful to me are those of property ; but once more , there is a remedy for this evil without violating it , all the more without destroying it . If the present laws allow abuse , we can reconstruct them . Our civil code is not the Koran ; it is not wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the use of property , but be sparing of anathemas ; for , logically , where is the honest man whose hands are entirely clean ? Do you think that one can be a robber without knowing it , without wishing it , without suspecting it ? Do you not admit that society in its present state , like every man , has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors ? Is property , then , in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you can re-knead and equalize it , if I may so speak , in your metaphysical mill ? One who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours can not be a pure and unwavering utopist . You are too well acquainted with the economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words of revolutions . I believe , then , that you have handled property as Rousseau , eighty years ago , handled letters , with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is what I said to the Institute at the time when I presented my report upon your book . I knew that they wished to proceed against you in the courts ; you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance I succeeded in preventing them . 5 What chagrin I should always have felt , if the king 's counsel , that is to say , the intellectual executioner , had followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person ! I actually passed two terrible nights , and I succeeded in restraining the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical dissertation , and not the manifesto of an incendiary . Your style is too lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest questions of our social order , use paving-stones as their weapons . But see to it , sir , that ere long they do not come , in spite of you , to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal , and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might discuss the question in the presence of a starving audience : we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration . " I feel as deeply as you , sir , the abuses which you point out ; but I have so great an affection for order ,  --  not that common and strait-laced order with which the police are satisfied , but the majestic and imposing order of human societies ,  --  that I sometimes find myself embarrassed in attacking certain abuses . I like to rebuild with one hand when I am compelled to destroy with the other . In pruning an old tree , we guard against destruction of the buds and fruit . You know that as well as any one . You are a wise and learned man ; you have a thoughtful mind . The terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your intentions ; but you conclude in favor of the abolition of property ! You wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind ; you attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word you arrest the formation of capital , and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock . That I can not agree to ; and for that reason I have criticised your book , so full of beautiful pages , so brilliant with knowledge and fervor ! " I wish , sir , that my impaired health would permit me to examine with you , page by page , the memoir which you have done me the honor to address to me publicly and personally ; I think I could offer some important criticisms . For the moment , I must content myself with thanking you for the kind words in which you have seen fit to speak of me . We each possess the merit of sincerity ; I desire also the merit of prudence . You know how deep-seated is the disease under which the working-people are suffering ; I know how many noble hearts beat under those rude garments , and I feel an irresistible and fraternal sympathy with the thousands of brave people who rise early in the morning to labor , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I try to serve and enlighten them , whereas some endeavor to mislead them . You have not written directly for them . You have issued two magnificent manifestoes , the second more guarded than the first ; issue a third more guarded than the second , and you will take high rank in science , whose first precept is calmness and impartiality . " Farewell , sir ! No man 's esteem for another can exceed mine for you . " BLANQUI . " I should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent letter ; but I confess that I am more inclined to realize the prediction with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of my antagonists . So much controversy fatigues and wearies me . The intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in battle : it is intelligence wasted . M. Blanqui acknowledges that property is abused in many harmful ways ; I call PROPERTY the sum these abuses exclusively . To each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need knocking off ; but , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a polygon ( an hypothesis admitted in mathematics , although not proven ) , while I consider that this figure will be a circle . Honest people can at least understand one another . For the rest , I allow that , in the present state of the question , the mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition of property . To gain the victory for one 's cause , it does not suffice simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized , which has the indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political theories ; it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle , and to formulate the system which must proceed from it . Still further , it is necessary to show the method by which the new system will satisfy all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of the first . On the following conditions , then , of subsequent evidence , depends the correctness of my preceding arguments :  --  The discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing institutions , save property , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place , but may themselves serve as instruments of equality : individual liberty , the division of power , the public ministry , the jury system , administrative and judicial organization , the unity and completeness of instruction , marriage , the family , heredity in direct and collateral succession , the right of sale and exchange , the right to make a will , and even birthright ,  --  a system which , better than property , guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage of all ; which , from a superior point of view , explains , corrects , and completes the theories of association hitherto proposed , from Plato and Pythagoras to Babeuf , Saint Simon , and Fourier ; a system , finally , which , serving as a means of transition , is immediately applicable . A work so vast requires , I am aware , the united efforts of twenty Montesquieus ; nevertheless , if it is not given to a single man to finish , a single one can commence , the enterprise . The road that he shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . WHAT IS PROPERTY ? OR , AN INQUIRY INTO THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND OF GOVERNMENT . FIRST MEMOIR . Adversus hostem aeterna auctertas esto . Against the enemy , revendication is eternal . LAW OF THE TWELVE TABLES . CHAPTER I. METHOD PURSUED IN THIS WORK .  --  THE IDEA OF A REVOLUTION . If I were asked to answer the following question : WHAT IS SLAVERY ? and I should answer in one word , IT IS MURDER , my meaning would be understood at once . No extended argument would be required to show that the power to take from a man his thought , his will , his personality , is a power of life and death ; and that to enslave a man is to kill him . Why , then , to this other question : WHAT IS PROPERTY ! may I not likewise answer , IT IS ROBBERY , without the certainty of being misunderstood ; the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first ? I undertake to discuss the vital principle of our government and our institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be mistaken in the conclusion which shall result from my investigations : I am in my right . I think best to place the last thought of my book first : still am I in my right . Such an author teaches that property is a civil right , born of occupation and sanctioned by law ; another maintains that it is a natural right , originating in labor ,  --  and both of these doctrines , totally opposed as they may seem , are encouraged and applauded . I contend that neither labor , nor occupation , nor law , can create property ; that it is an effect without a cause : am I censurable ? But murmurs arise ! PROPERTY IS ROBBERY ! That is the war-cry of ' 93 ! That is the signal of revolutions ! Reader , calm yourself : I am no agent of discord , no firebrand of sedition . I anticipate history by a few days ; I disclose a truth whose development we may try in vain to arrest ; I write the preamble of our future constitution . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would , if our prejudices allowed us to consider it , be recognized as the lightning-rod to shield us from the coming thunderbolt ; but too many interests stand in the way ! ... Alas ! philosophy will not change the course of events : destiny will fulfill itself regardless of prophecy . Besides , must not justice be done and our education be finished ? PROPERTY IS ROBBERY ! ... What a revolution in human ideas ! PROPRIETOR and ROBBER have been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings whom they designate are hostile ; all languages have perpetuated this opposition . On what authority , then , do you venture to attack universal consent , and give the lie to the human race ? Who are you , that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages ? Of what consequence to you , reader , is my obscure individuality ? I live , like you , in a century in which reason submits only to fact and to evidence . My name , like yours , is TRUTH-SEEKER. 6 My mission is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HATRED AND WITHOUT FEAR ; TELL THAT WHICH THOU KNOWEST ! The work of our race is to build the temple of science , and this science includes man and Nature . Now , truth reveals itself to all ; to-day to Newton and Pascal , tomorrow to the herdsman in the valley and the journeyman in the shop . Each one contributes his stone to the edifice ; and , his task accomplished , disappears . Eternity precedes us , eternity follows us : between two infinites , of what account is one poor mortal that the century should inquire about him ? Disregard then , reader , my title and my character , and attend only to my arguments . It is in accordance with universal consent that I undertake to correct universal error ; from the OPINION of the human race I appeal to its FAITH . Have the courage to follow me ; and , if your will is untrammelled , if your conscience is free , if your mind can unite two propositions and deduce a third therefrom , my ideas will inevitably become yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my purpose to warn you , not to defy you ; for I am certain that , if you read me , you will be compelled to assent . The things of which I am to speak are so simple and clear that you will be astonished at not having perceived them before , and you will say : " I have neglected to think . " Others offer you the spectacle of genius wresting Nature 's secrets from her , and unfolding before you her sublime messages ; you will find here only a series of experiments upon JUSTICE and RIGHT a sort of verification of the weights and measures of your conscience . The operations shall be conducted under your very eyes ; and you shall weigh the result . Nevertheless , I build no system . I ask an end to privilege , the abolition of slavery , equality of rights , and the reign of law . Justice , nothing else ; that is the alpha and omega of my argument : to others I leave the business of governing the world . One day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery in society ? Must man always be wretched ? And not satisfied with the explanations given by the reformers ,  --  these attributing the general distress to governmental cowardice and incapacity , those to conspirators and emeutes , still others to ignorance and general corruption ,  --  and weary of the interminable quarrels of the tribune and the press , I sought to fathom the matter myself . I have consulted the masters of science ; I have read a hundred volumes of philosophy , law , political economy , and history : would to God that I had lived in a century in which so much reading had been useless ! I have made every effort to obtain exact information , comparing doctrines , replying to objections , continually constructing equations and reductions from arguments , and weighing thousands of syllogisms in the scales of the most rigorous logic . In this laborious work , I have collected many interesting facts which I shall share with my friends and the public as soon as I have leisure . But I must say that I recognized at once that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common and yet so sacred : JUSTICE , EQUITY , LIBERTY ; that concerning each of these principles our ideas have been utterly obscure ; and , in fact , that this ignorance was the sole cause , both of the poverty that devours us , and of all the calamities that have ever afflicted the human race . My mind was frightened by this strange result : I doubted my reason . What ! said I , that which eye has not seen , nor ear heard , nor insight penetrated , you have discovered ! Wretch , mistake not the visions of your diseased brain for the truths of science ! Do you not know ( great philosophers have said so ) that in points of practical morality universal error is a contradiction ? I resolved then to test my arguments ; and in entering upon this new labor I sought an answer to the following questions : Is it possible that humanity can have been so long and so universally mistaken in the application of moral principles ? How and why could it be mistaken ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? These questions , on the solution of which depended the certainty of my conclusions , offered no lengthy resistance to analysis . It will be seen , in chapter V. of this work , that in morals , as in all other branches of knowledge , the gravest errors are the dogmas of science ; that , even in works of justice , to be mistaken is a privilege which ennobles man ; and that whatever philosophical merit may attach to me is infinitely small . To name a thing is easy : the difficulty is to discern it before its appearance . In giving expression to the last stage of an idea ,  --  an idea which permeates all minds , which to-morrow will be proclaimed by another if I fail to announce it to-day ,  --  I can claim no merit save that of priority of utterance . Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn ? Yes : all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is identical with equality of rights ; that PROPERTY and ROBBERY are synonymous terms ; that every social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of superior talent or service , is iniquity and extortion . All men in their hearts , I say , bear witness to these truths ; they need only to be made to understand it . Before entering directly upon the question before me , I must say a word of the road that I shall traverse . When Pascal approached a geometrical problem , he invented a method of solution ; to solve a problem in philosophy a method is equally necessary . Well , by how much do the problems of which philosophy treats surpass in the gravity of their results those discussed by geometry ! How much more imperatively , then , do they demand for their solution a profound and rigorous analysis ! It is a fact placed for ever beyond doubt , say the modern psychologists , that every perception received by the mind is determined by certain general laws which govern the mind ; is moulded , so to speak , in certain types pre-existing in our understanding , and which constitutes its original condition . Hence , say they , if the mind has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , for example , every phenomenon is of necessity conceived by us as happening in TIME and SPACE ,  --  that compels us to infer a CAUSE of its occurrence ; every thing which exists implies the ideas of SUBSTANCE , MODE , RELATION , NUMBER , &C.; in a word , we form no idea which is not related to some one of the general principles of reason , independent of which nothing exists . These axioms of the understanding , add the psychologists , these fundamental types , by which all our judgments and ideas are inevitably shaped , and which our sensations serve only to illuminate , are known in the schools as CATEGORIES . Their primordial existence in the mind is to-day demonstrated ; they need only to be systematized and catalogued . Aristotle recognized ten ; Kant increased the number to fifteen ; M. Cousin has reduced it to three , to two , to one ; and the indisputable glory of this professor will be due to the fact that , if he has not discovered the true theory of categories , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else the vast importance of this question ,  --  the greatest and perhaps the only one with which metaphysics has to deal . I confess that I disbelieve in the innateness , not only of IDEAS , but also of FORMS or LAWS of our understanding ; and I hold the metaphysics of Reid and Kant to be still farther removed from the truth than that of Aristotle . However , as I do not wish to enter here into a discussion of the mind , a task which would demand much labor and be of no interest to the public , I shall admit the hypothesis that our most general and most necessary ideas  --  such as time , space , substance , and cause  --  exist originally in the mind ; or , at least , are derived immediately from its constitution . But it is a psychological fact none the less true , and one to which the philosophers have paid too little attention , that habit , like a second nature , has the power of fixing in the mind new categorical forms derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objective reality , but whose influence over our judgments is no less predetermining than that of the original categories . Hence we reason by the ETERNAL and ABSOLUTE laws of our mind , and at the same time by the secondary rules , ordinarily faulty , which are suggested to us by imperfect observation . This is the most fecund source of false prejudices , and the permanent and often invincible cause of a multitude of errors . The bias resulting from these prejudices is so strong that often , even when we are fighting against a principle which our mind thinks false , which is repugnant to our reason , and which our conscience disapproves , we defend it without knowing it , we reason in accordance with it , and we obey it while attacking it . Enclosed within a circle , our mind revolves about itself , until a new observation , creating within us new ideas , brings to view an external principle which delivers us from the phantom by which our imagination is possessed . Thus , we know to-day that , by the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bodies ( no obstacle intervening ) tend to unite by an accelerated impelling force which we call GRAVITATION . It is gravitation which causes unsupported bodies to fall to the ground , which gives them weight , and which fastens us to the earth on which we live . Ignorance of this cause was the sole obstacle which prevented the ancients from believing in the antipodes . " Can you not see , " said St. Augustine after Lactantius , " that , if there were men under our feet , their heads would point downward , and that they would fall into the sky ? " The bishop of Hippo , who thought the earth flat because it appeared so to the eye , supposed in consequence that , if we should connect by straight lines the zenith with the nadir in different places , these lines would be parallel with each other ; and in the direction of these lines he traced every movement from above to below . Thence he naturally concluded that the stars were rolling torches set in the vault of the sky ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth in a shower of fire ; that the earth was one vast plain , forming the lower portion of the world , &c.; If he had been asked by what the world itself was sustained , he would have answered that he did not know , but that to God nothing is impossible . Such were the ideas of St. Augustine in regard to space and movement , ideas fixed within him by a prejudice derived from an appearance , and which had become with him a general and categorical rule of judgment . Of the reason why bodies fall his mind knew nothing ; he could only say that a body falls because it falls . With us the idea of a fall is more complex : to the general ideas of space and movement which it implies , we add that of attraction or direction towards a centre , which gives us the higher idea of cause . But if physics has fully corrected our judgment in this respect , we still make use of the prejudice of St. Augustine ; and when we say that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general that there has been an effect of gravitation , but specially and in particular that it is towards the earth , and FROM ABOVE TO BELOW , that this movement has taken place . Our mind is enlightened in vain ; the imagination prevails , and our language remains forever incorrigible . To DESCEND FROM HEAVEN is as incorrect an expression as to MOUNT TO HEAVEN ; and yet this expression will live as long as men use language . All these phrases  --  FROM ABOVE TO BELOW ; TO DESCEND FROM HEAVEN ; TO FALL FROM THE CLOUDS , &C.;  --  are henceforth harmless , because we know how to rectify them in practice ; but let us deign to consider for a moment how much they have retarded the progress of science . If , indeed , it be a matter of little importance to statistics , mechanics , hydrodynamics , and ballistics , that the true cause of the fall of bodies should be known , and that our ideas of the general movements in space should be exact , it is quite otherwise when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of tides , the shape of the earth , and its position in the heavens : to understand these things we must leave the circle of appearances . In all ages there have been ingenious mechanicians , excellent architects , skilful artillerymen : any error , into which it was possible for them to fall in regard to the rotundity of the earth and gravitation , in no wise retarded the development of their art ; the solidity of their buildings and accuracy of their aim was not affected by it . But sooner or later they were forced to grapple with phenomena , which the supposed parallelism of all perpendiculars erected from the earth 's surface rendered inexplicable : then also commenced a struggle between the prejudices , which for centuries had sufficed in daily practice , and the unprecedented opinions which the testimony of the eyes seemed to contradict . Thus , on the one hand , the falsest judgments , whether based on isolated facts or only on appearances , always embrace some truths whose sphere , whether large or small , affords room for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ideas of St. Augustine , for example , contained the following truths : that bodies fall towards the earth , that they fall in a straight line , that either the sun or the earth moves , that either the sky or the earth turns , &c.; These general facts always have been true ; our science has added nothing to them . But , on the other hand , it being necessary to account for every thing , we are obliged to seek for principles more and more comprehensive : that is why we have had to abandon successively , first the opinion that the world was flat , then the theory which regards it as the stationary centre of the universe , &c.; If we pass now from physical nature to the moral world , we still find ourselves subject to the same deceptions of appearance , to the same influences of spontaneity and habit . But the distinguishing feature of this second division of our knowledge is , on the one hand , the good or the evil which we derive from our opinions ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the prejudice which is tormenting and killing us . Whatever theory we embrace in regard to the shape of the earth and the cause of its weight , the physics of the globe does not suffer ; and , as for us , our social economy can derive therefrom neither profit nor damage . But it is in us and through us that the laws of our moral nature work ; now , these laws can not be executed without our deliberate aid , and , consequently , unless we know them . If , then , our science of moral laws is false , it is evident that , while desiring our own good , we are accomplishing our own evil ; if it is only incomplete , it may suffice for a time for our social progress , but in the long run it will lead us into a wrong road , and will finally precipitate us into an abyss of calamities . Then it is that we need to exercise our highest judgments ; and , be it said to our glory , they are never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old prejudices and new ideas . Days of conflagration and anguish ! We are told of the time when , with the same beliefs , with the same institutions , all the world seemed happy : why complain of these beliefs ; why banish these institutions ? We are slow to admit that that happy age served the precise purpose of developing the principle of evil which lay dormant in society ; we accuse men and gods , the powers of earth and the forces of Nature . Instead of seeking the cause of the evil in his mind and heart , man blames his masters , his rivals , his neighbors , and himself ; nations arm themselves , and slay and exterminate each other , until equilibrium is restored by the vast depopulation , and peace again arises from the ashes of the combatants . So loath is humanity to touch the customs of its ancestors , and to change the laws framed by the founders of communities , and confirmed by the faithful observance of the ages . Nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est : Distrust all innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were man not compelled to change : but what ! because he is born ignorant , because he exists only on condition of gradual self-instruction , must he abjure the light , abdicate his reason , and abandon himself to fortune ? Perfect health is better than convalescence : should the sick man , therefore , refuse to be cured ? Reform , reform ! cried , ages since , John the Baptist and Jesus Christ . Reform , reform ! cried our fathers , fifty years ago ; and for a long time to come we shall shout , Reform , reform ! Seeing the misery of my age , I said to myself : Among the principles that support society , there is one which it does not understand , which its ignorance has vitiated , and which causes all the evil that exists . This principle is the most ancient of all ; for it is a characteristic of revolutions to tear down the most modern principles , and to respect those of long-standing . Now the evil by which we suffer is anterior to all revolutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cherished ; for if it were not cherished it would harm nobody , it would be without influence . But this principle , right in its purpose , but misunderstood : this principle , as old as humanity , what is it ? Can it be religion ? All men believe in God : this dogma belongs at once to their conscience and their mind . To humanity God is a fact as primitive , an idea as inevitable , a principle as necessary as are the categorical ideas of cause , substance , time , and space to our understanding . God is proven to us by the conscience prior to any inference of the mind ; just as the sun is proven to us by the testimony of the senses prior to all the arguments of physics . We discover phenomena and laws by observation and experience ; only this deeper sense reveals to us existence . Humanity believes that God is ; but , in believing in God , what does it believe ? In a word , what is God ? The nature of this notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in the race ,  --  the human mind has not yet fathomed . At each step that we take in our investigation of Nature and of causes , the idea of God is extended and exalted ; the farther science advances , the more God seems to grow and broaden . Anthropomorphism and idolatry constituted of necessity the faith of the mind in its youth , the theology of infancy and poesy . A harmless error , if they had not endeavored to make it a rule of conduct , and if they had been wise enough to respect the liberty of thought . But having made God in his own image , man wished to appropriate him still farther ; not satisfied with disfiguring the Almighty , he treated him as his patrimony , his goods , his possessions . God , pictured in monstrous forms , became throughout the world the property of man and of the State . Such was the origin of the corruption of morals by religion , and the source of pious feuds and holy wars . Thank Heaven ! we have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral laws outside the pale of religion . Instead of legislating as to the nature and attributes of God , the dogmas of theology , and the destiny of our souls , we wisely wait for science to tell us what to reject and what to accept . God , soul , religion ,  --  eternal objects of our unwearied thought and our most fatal aberrations , terrible problems whose solution , for ever attempted , for ever remains unaccomplished ,  --  concerning all these questions we may still be mistaken , but at least our error is harmless . With liberty in religion , and the separation of the spiritual from the temporal power , the influence of religious ideas upon the progress of society is purely negative ; no law , no political or civil institution being founded on religion . Neglect of duties imposed by religion may increase the general corruption , but it is not the primary cause ; it is only an auxiliary or result . It is universally admitted , and especially in the matter which now engages our attention , that the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal misery , and of governmental embarrassments  --  can no longer be traced to religion : we must go farther back , and dig still deeper . But what is there in man older and deeper than the religious sentiment ? There is man himself ; that is , volition and conscience , free-will and law , eternally antagonistic . Man is at war with himself : why ? " Man , " say the theologians , " transgressed in the beginning ; our race is guilty of an ancient offence . For this transgression humanity has fallen ; error and ignorance have become its sustenance . Read history , you will find universal proof of this necessity for evil in the permanent misery of nations . Man suffers and always will suffer ; his disease is hereditary and constitutional . Use palliatives , employ emollients ; there is no remedy . " Nor is this argument peculiar to the theologians ; we find it expressed in equivalent language in the philosophical writings of the materialists , believers in infinite perfectibility . Destutt de Tracy teaches formally that poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social state ; necessary evils , against which it would be folly to revolt . So , call it NECESSITY OF EVIL or ORIGINAL DEPRAVITY , it is at bottom the same philosophy . " The first man transgressed . " If the votaries of the Bible interpreted it faithfully , they would say : MAN ORIGINALLY TRANSGRESSED , that is , made a mistake ; for TO TRANSGRESS , TO FAIL , TO MAKE A MISTAKE , all mean the same thing . " The consequences of Adam 's transgression are inherited by the race ; the first is ignorance . " Truly , the race , like the individual , is born ignorant ; but , in regard to a multitude of questions , even in the moral and political spheres , this ignorance of the race has been dispelled : who says that it will not depart altogether ? Mankind makes continual progress toward truth , and light ever triumphs over darkness . Our disease is not , then , absolutely incurable , and the theory of the theologians is worse than inadequate ; it is ridiculous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errs , because he errs . " While the true statement is this : " Man errs , because he learns . " Now , if man arrives at a knowledge of all that he needs to know , it is reasonable to believe that , ceasing to err , he will cease to suffer . But if we question the doctors as to this law , said to be engraved upon the heart of man , we shall immediately see that they dispute about a matter of which they know nothing ; that , concerning the most important questions , there are almost as many opinions as authors ; that we find no two agreeing as to the best form of government , the principle of authority , and the nature of right ; that all sail hap-hazard upon a shoreless and bottomless sea , abandoned to the guidance of their private opinions which they modestly take to be right reason . And , in view of this medley of contradictory opinions , we say : " The object of our investigations is the law , the determination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the social scientists , do not understand each other ; then the error lies in themselves ; and , as every error has a reality for its object , we must look in their books to find the truth which they have unconsciously deposited there . " Now , of what do the lawyers and the publicists treat ? Of JUSTICE , EQUITY , LIBERTY , NATURAL LAW , CIVIL LAWS , &c.; But what is justice ? What is its principle , its character , its formula ? To this question our doctors evidently have no reply ; for otherwise their science , starting with a principle clear and well defined , would quit the region of probabilities , and all disputes would end . What is justice ? The theologians answer : " All justice comes from God . " That is true ; but we know no more than before . The philosophers ought to be better informed : they have argued so much about justice and injustice ! Unhappily , an examination proves that their knowledge amounts to nothing , and that with them  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply O ! O !  --  it is a cry of admiration , love , and enthusiasm ; but who does not know that the sun attaches little meaning to the interjection O ! That is exactly our position toward the philosophers in regard to justice . Justice , they say , is a DAUGHTER OF HEAVEN ; A LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINES EVERY MAN THAT COMES INTO THE WORLD ; THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PREROGATIVE OF OUR NATURE ; THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BEASTS AND LIKENS US TO GOD  --  and a thousand other similar things . What , I ask , does this pious litany amount to ? To the prayer of the savages : O ! All the most reasonable teachings of human wisdom concerning justice are summed up in that famous adage : DO UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU ; DO NOT UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD NOT THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU . But this rule of moral practice is unscientific : what have I a right to wish that others should do or not do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my duty is equal to my right , unless I am told at the same time what my right is . Let us try to arrive at something more precise and positive . Justice is the central star which governs societies , the pole around which the political world revolves , the principle and the regulator of all transactions . Nothing takes place between men save in the name of RIGHT ; nothing without the invocation of justice . Justice is not the work of the law : on the contrary , the law is only a declaration and application of JUSTICE in all circumstances where men are liable to come in contact . If , then , the idea that we form of justice and right were ill-defined , if it were imperfect or even false , it is clear that all our legislative applications would be wrong , our institutions vicious , our politics erroneous : consequently there would be disorder and social chaos . This hypothesis of the perversion of justice in our minds , and , as a necessary result , in our acts , becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men have not borne a constant relation to the notion of justice and its applications ; that at different periods they have undergone modifications : in a word , that there has been progress in ideas . Now , that is what history proves by the most overwhelming testimony . Eighteen Hundred years ago , the world , under the rule of the Caesars , exhausted itself in slavery , superstition , and voluptuousness . The people  --  intoxicated and , as it were , stupefied by their long-continued orgies  --  had lost the very notion of right and duty : war and dissipation by turns swept them away ; usury and the labor of machines ( that is of slaves ) , by depriving them of the means of subsistence , hindered them from continuing the species . Barbarism sprang up again , in a hideous form , from this mass of corruption , and spread like a devouring leprosy over the depopulated provinces . The wise foresaw the downfall of the empire , but could devise no remedy . What could they think indeed ? To save this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of public esteem and veneration , and to abolish the rights affirmed by a justice purely secular ; they said : " Rome has conquered through her politics and her gods ; any change in theology and public opinion would be folly and sacrilege . Rome , merciful toward conquered nations , though binding them in chains , spared their lives ; slaves are the most fertile source of her wealth ; freedom of the nations would be the negation of her rights and the ruin of her finances . Rome , in fact , enveloped in the pleasures and gorged with the spoils of the universe , is kept alive by victory and government ; her luxury and her pleasures are the price of her conquests : she can neither abdicate nor dispossess herself . " Thus Rome had the facts and the law on her side . Her pretensions were justified by universal custom and the law of nations . Her institutions were based upon idolatry in religion , slavery in the State , and epicurism in private life ; to touch those was to shake society to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to open the abyss of revolutions . So the idea occurred to no one ; and yet humanity was dying in blood and luxury . All at once a man appeared , calling himself The Word of God . It is not known to this day who he was , whence he came , nor what suggested to him his ideas . He went about proclaiming everywhere that the end of the existing society was at hand , that the world was about to experience a new birth ; that the priests were vipers , the lawyers ignoramuses , and the philosophers hypocrites and liars ; that master and slave were equals , that usury and every thing akin to it was robbery , that proprietors and idlers would one day burn , while the poor and pure in heart would find a haven of peace . This man  --  The Word of God  --  was denounced and arrested as a public enemy by the priests and the lawyers , who well understood how to induce the people to demand his death . But this judicial murder , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the doctrinal seeds which The Word of God had sown . After his death , his original disciples travelled about in all directions , preaching what they called the GOOD NEWS , creating in their turn millions of missionaries ; and , when their task seemed to be accomplished , dying by the sword of Roman justice . This persistent agitation , the war of the executioners and martyrs , lasted nearly three centuries , ending in the conversion of the world . Idolatry was destroyed , slavery abolished , dissolution made room for a more austere morality , and the contempt for wealth was sometimes pushed almost to privation . Society was saved by the negation of its own principles , by a revolution in its religion , and by violation of its most sacred rights . In this revolution , the idea of justice spread to an extent that had not before been dreamed of , never to return to its original limits . Heretofore justice had existed only for the masters ; 7 it then commenced to exist for the slaves . Nevertheless , the new religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits . There was a perceptible improvement of the public morals , and a partial release from oppression ; but , other than that , the SEEDS SOWN BY THE SON OF MAN , having fallen into idolatrous hearts , had produced nothing save innumerable discords and a quasi-poetical mythology . Instead of developing into their practical consequences the principles of morality and government taught by The Word of God , his followers busied themselves in speculations as to his birth , his origin , his person , and his actions ; they discussed his parables , and from the conflict of the most extravagant opinions upon unanswerable questions and texts which no one understood , was born THEOLOGY ,  --  which may be defined as the SCIENCE OF THE INFINITELY ABSURD . The truth of CHRISTIANITY did not survive the age of the apostles ; the GOSPEL , commented upon and symbolized by the Greeks and Latins , loaded with pagan fables , became literally a mass of contradictions ; and to this day the reign of the INFALLIBLE CHURCH has been a long era of darkness . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that THE WORD OF GOD will return , and that one day men will know truth and justice ; but that will be the death of Greek and Roman Catholicism , just as in the light of science disappeared the caprices of opinion . The monsters which the successors of the apostles were bent on destroying , frightened for a moment , reappeared gradually , thanks to the crazy fanaticism , and sometimes the deliberate connivance , of priests and theologians . The history of the enfranchisement of the French communes offers constantly the spectacle of the ideas of justice and liberty spreading among the people , in spite of the combined efforts of kings , nobles , and clergy . In the year 1789 of the Christian era , the French nation , divided by caste , poor and oppressed , struggled in the triple net of royal absolutism , the tyranny of nobles and parliaments , and priestly intolerance . There was the right of the king and the right of the priest , the right of the patrician and the right of the plebeian ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trades ; and , at the bottom of all , violence , immorality , and misery . For some time they talked of reformation ; those who apparently desired it most favoring it only for their own profit , and the people who were to be the gainers expecting little and saying nothing . For a long time these poor people , either from distrust , incredulity , or despair , hesitated to ask for their rights : it is said that the habit of serving had taken the courage away from those old communes , which in the middle ages were so bold . Finally a book appeared , summing up the whole matter in these two propositions : WHAT IS THE THIRD ESTATE ?  --  NOTHING . WHAT OUGHT IT TO BE ?  --  EVERY THING . Some one added by way of comment : WHAT IS THE KING ?  --  THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE . This was a sudden revelation : the veil was torn aside , a thick bandage fell from all eyes . The people commenced to reason thus :  --  If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; If he ought to report to us , he is subject to control ; If he can be controlled , he is responsible ; If he is responsible , he is punishable ; If he is punishable , he ought to be punished according to his merits ; If he ought to be punished according to his merits , he can be punished with death . Five years after the publication of the brochure of Sieyes , the third estate was every thing ; the king , the nobility , the clergy , were no more . In 1793 , the nation , without stopping at the constitutional fiction of the inviolability of the sovereign , conducted Louis XVI . to the scaffold ; in 1830 , it accompanied Charles X. to Cherbourg . In each case , it may have erred , in fact , in its judgment of the offence ; but , in right , the logic which led to its action was irreproachable . The people , in punishing their sovereign , did precisely that which the government of July was so severely censured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the affair of Strasburg : they struck the true culprit . It was an application of the common law , a solemn decree of justice enforcing the penal laws . 8 The spirit which gave rise to the movement of ' 89 was a spirit of negation ; that , of itself , proves that the order of things which was substituted for the old system was not methodical or well-considered ; that , born of anger and hatred , it could not have the effect of a science based on observation and study ; that its foundations , in a word , were not derived from a profound knowledge of the laws of Nature and society . Thus the people found that the republic , among the so-called new institutions , was acting on the very principles against which they had fought , and was swayed by all the prejudices which they had intended to destroy . We congratulate ourselves , with inconsiderate enthusiasm , on the glorious French Revolution , the regeneration of 1789 , the great changes that have been effected , and the reversion of institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any subject , material , intellectual , or social , undergo a thorough change in consequence of new observations , I call that movement of the mind REVOLUTION . If the ideas are simply extended or modified , there is only PROGRESS . Thus the system of Ptolemy was a step in astronomical progress , that of Copernicus was a revolution . So , in 1789 , there was struggle and progress ; revolution there was none . An examination of the reforms which were attempted proves this . The nation , so long a victim of monarchical selfishness , thought to deliver itself for ever by declaring that it alone was sovereign . But what was monarchy ? The sovereignty of one man . What is democracy ? The sovereignty of the nation , or , rather , of the national majority . But it is , in both cases , the sovereignty of man instead of the sovereignty of the law , the sovereignty of the will instead of the sovereignty of the reason ; in one word , the passions instead of justice . Undoubtedly , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is progress , because in multiplying the sovereigns we increase the opportunities of the reason to substitute itself for the will ; but in reality there is no revolution in the government , since the principle remains the same . Now , we have the proof to-day that , with the most perfect democracy , we can not be free . 9 Nor is that all . The nation-king can not exercise its sovereignty itself ; it is obliged to delegate it to agents : this is constantly reiterated by those who seek to win its favor . Be these agents five , ten , one hundred , or a thousand , of what consequence is the number ; and what matters the name ? It is always the government of man , the rule of will and caprice . I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized ? We know , too , how this sovereignty was exercised ; first by the Convention , then by the Directory , afterwards confiscated by the Consul . As for the Emperor , the strong man so much adored and mourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it ; but , as if intending to set its sovereignty at defiance , he dared to demand its suffrage : that is , its abdication , the abdication of this inalienable sovereignty ; and he obtained it . But what is sovereignty ? It is , they say , the POWER TO MAKE LAW . 10 Another absurdity , a relic of despotism . The nation had long seen kings issuing their commands in this form : FOR SUCH IS OUR PLEASURE ; it wished to taste in its turn the pleasure of making laws . For fifty years it has brought them forth by myriads ; always , be it understood , through the agency of representatives . The play is far from ended . The definition of sovereignty was derived from the definition of the law . The law , they said , is THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE SOVEREIGN : then , under a monarchy , the law is the expression of the will of the king ; in a republic , the law is the expression of the will of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two systems are exactly identical : both share the same error , namely , that the law is the expression of a will ; it ought to be the expression of a fact . Moreover they followed good leaders : they took the citizen of Geneva for their prophet , and the contrat social for their Koran . Bias and prejudice are apparent in all the phrases of the new legislators . The nation had suffered from a multitude of exclusions and privileges ; its representatives issued the following declaration : ALL MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE AND BEFORE THE LAW ; an ambiguous and redundant declaration . MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE : does that mean that they are equal in size , beauty , talents , and virtue ? No ; they meant , then , political and civil equality . Then it would have been sufficient to have said : ALL MEN ARE EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW . But what is equality before the law ? Neither the constitution of 1790 , nor that of ' 93 , nor the granted charter , nor the accepted charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fortune and station incompatible with even a shadow of equality in rights . In this respect it may be said that all our constitutions have been faithful expressions of the popular will : I am going , to prove it . Formerly the people were excluded from civil and military offices ; it was considered a wonder when the following high-sounding article was inserted in the Declaration of Rights : " All citizens are equally eligible to office ; free nations know no qualifications in their choice of officers save virtues and talents . " They certainly ought to have admired so beautiful an idea : they admired a piece of nonsense . Why ! the sovereign people , legislators , and reformers , see in public offices , to speak plainly , only opportunities for pecuniary advancement . And , because it regards them as a source of profit , it decrees the eligibility of citizens . For of what use would this precaution be , if there were nothing to gain by it ? No one would think of ordaining that none but astronomers and geographers should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre and the opera . The nation was still aping the kings : like them it wished to award the lucrative positions to its friends and flatterers . Unfortunately , and this last feature completes the resemblance , the nation did not control the list of livings ; that was in the hands of its agents and representatives . They , on the other hand , took care not to thwart the will of their gracious sovereign . This edifying article of the Declaration of Rights , retained in the charters of 1814 and 1830 , implies several kinds of civil inequality ; that is , of inequality before the law : inequality ofstation , since the public functions are sought only for the consideration and emoluments which they bring ; inequality of wealth , since , if it had been desired to equalize fortunes , public service would have been regarded as a duty , not as a reward ; inequality of privilege , the law not stating what it means by TALENTS and VIRTUES . Under the empire , virtue and talent consisted simply in military bravery and devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nobility , and attempted to connect it with the ancients . To-day , the man who pays taxes to the amount of two hundred francs is virtuous ; the talented man is the honest pickpocket : such truths as these are accounted trivial . The people finally legalized property . God forgive them , for they knew not what they did ! For fifty years they have suffered for their miserable folly . But how came the people , whose voice , they tell us , is the voice of God , and whose conscience is infallible ,  --  how came the people to err ? How happens it that , when seeking liberty and equality , they fell back into privilege and slavery ? Always through copying the ancient regime . Formerly , the nobility and the clergy contributed towards the expenses of the State only by voluntary aid and gratuitous gift ; their property could not be seized even for debt ,  --  while the plebeian , overwhelmed by taxes and statute-labor , was continually tormented , now by the king 's tax-gatherers , now by those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mortmain could neither bequeath nor inherit property ; he was treated like the animals , whose services and offspring belong to their master by right of accession . The people wanted the conditions of OWNERSHIP to be alike for all ; they thought that every one should ENJOY AND FREELY DISPOSE OF HIS POSSESSIONS HIS INCOME AND THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND INDUSTRY . The people did not invent property ; but as they had not the same privileges in regard to it , which the nobles and clergy possessed , they decreed that the right should be exercised by all under the same conditions . The more obnoxious forms of property  --  statute-labor , mortmain , maitrise , and exclusion from public office  --  have disappeared ; the conditions of its enjoyment have been modified : the principle still remains the same . There has been progress in the regulation of the right ; there has been no revolution . These , then , are the three fundamental principles of modern society , established one after another by the movements of 1789 and 1830 : 1 . SOVEREIGNTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . INEQUALITY OF WEALTH AND RANK . 3 . PROPERTY  --  above JUSTICE , always invoked as the guardian angel of sovereigns , nobles , and proprietors ; JUSTICE , the general , primitive , categorical law of all society . We must ascertain whether the ideas of DESPOTISM , CIVIL INEQUALITY and PROPERTY , are in harmony with the primitive notion of JUSTICE , and necessarily follow from it ,  --  assuming various forms according to the condition , position , and relation of persons ; or whether they are not rather the illegitimate result of a confusion of different things , a fatal association of ideas . And since justice deals especially with the questions of government , the condition of persons , and the possession of things , we must ascertain under what conditions , judging by universal opinion and the progress of the human mind , government is just , the condition of citizens is just , and the possession of things is just ; then , striking out every thing which fails to meet these conditions , the result will at once tell us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and what the legitimate possession of things is ; and finally , as the last result of the analysis , what JUSTICE is . Is the authority of man over man just ? Everybody answers , " No ; the authority of man is only the authority of the law , which ought to be justice and truth . " The private will counts for nothing in government , which consists , first , in discovering truth and justice in order to make the law ; and , second , in superintending the execution of this law . I do not now inquire whether our constitutional form of government satisfies these conditions ; whether , for example , the will of the ministry never influences the declaration and interpretation of the law ; or whether our deputies , in their debates , are more intent on conquering by argument than by force of numbers : it is enough for me that my definition of a good government is allowed to be correct . This idea is exact . Yet we see that nothing seems more just to the Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ancients and in the opinion of the philosophers themselves , slavery was just ; that in the middle ages the nobles , the priests , and the bishops felt justified in holding slaves ; that Louis XIV . thought that he was right when he said , " The State ! I am the State ; " and that Napoleon deemed it a crime for the State to oppose his will . The idea of justice , then , applied to sovereignty and government , has not always been what it is to-day ; it has gone on developing and shaping itself by degrees , until it has arrived at its present state . But has it reached its last phase ? I think not : only , as the last obstacle to be overcome arises from the institution of property which we have kept intact , in order to finish the reform in government and consummate the revolution , this very institution we must attack . Is political and civil inequality just ? Some say yes ; others no . To the first I would reply that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did it , in all probability , because it was for their advantage ; why then do they favor the privileges of fortune more than those of rank and race ? Because , say they , political inequality is a result of property ; and without property society is impossible : thus the question just raised becomes a question of property . To the second I content myself with this remark : If you wish to enjoy political equality , abolish property ; otherwise , why do you complain ? Is property just ? Everybody answers without hesitation , " Yes , property is just . " I say everybody , for up to the present time no one who thoroughly understood the meaning of his words has answered no . For it is no easy thing to reply understandingly to such a question ; only time and experience can furnish an answer . Now , this answer is given ; it is for us to understand it . I undertake to prove it . We are to proceed with the demonstration in the following order :  --  I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we deny nothing ; we accept as sound all the arguments alleged in favor of property , and confine ourselves to a search for its principle , in order that we may then ascertain whether this principle is faithfully expressed by property . In fact , property being defensible on no ground save that of justice , the idea , or at least the intention , of justice must of necessity underlie all the arguments that have been made in defence of property ; and , as on the other hand the right of property is only exercised over those things which can be appreciated by the senses , justice , secretly objectifying itself , so to speak , must take the shape of an algebraic formula . By this method of investigation , we soon see that every argument which has been invented in behalf of property , WHATEVER IT MAY BE , always and of necessity leads to equality ; that is , to the negation of property . The first part covers two chapters : one treating of occupation , the foundation of our right ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and social inequality . The first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation OBSTRUCTS property ; the second that the right of labor DESTROYS it . II . Property , then , being of necessity conceived as existing only in connection with equality , it remains to find out why , in spite of this necessity of logic , equality does not exist . This new investigation also covers two chapters : in the first , considering the fact of property in itself , we inquire whether this fact is real , whether it exists , whether it is possible ; for it would imply a contradiction , were these two opposite forms of society , equality and inequality , both possible . Then we discover , singularly enough , that property may indeed manifest itself accidentally ; but that , as an institution and principle , it is mathematically impossible . So that the axiom of the school  --  ab actu ad posse valet consecutio : from the actual to the possible the inference is good  --  is given the lie as far as property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology to our aid , and probing man 's nature to the bottom , we shall disclose the principle of JUSTICE  --  its formula and character ; we shall state with precision the organic law of society ; we shall explain the origin of property , the causes of its establishment , its long life , and its approaching death ; we shall definitively establish its identity with robbery . And , after having shown that these three prejudices  --  THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MAN , THE INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS , AND PROPERTY  --  are one and the same ; that they may be taken for each other , and are reciprocally convertible ,  --  we shall have no trouble in inferring therefrom , by the principle of contradiction , the basis of government and right . There our investigations will end , reserving the right to continue them in future works . The importance of the subject which engages our attention is recognized by all minds . " Property , " says M. Hennequin , " is the creative and conservative principle of civil society . Property is one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented too soon ; for it must not be forgotten , and the publicist and statesman must know , that on the answer to the question whether property is the principle or the result of social order , whether it is to be considered as a cause or an effect , depends all morality , and , consequently , all the authority of human institutions . " These words are a challenge to all men of hope and faith ; but , although the cause of equality is a noble one , no one has yet picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the advocates of property ; no one has been courageous enough to enter upon the struggle . The spurious learning of haughty jurisprudence , and the absurd aphorisms of a political economy controlled by property have puzzled the most generous minds ; it is a sort of password among the most influential friends of liberty and the interests of the people that EQUALITY IS A CHIMERA ! So many false theories and meaningless analogies influence minds otherwise keen , but which are unconsciously controlled by popular prejudice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , shall we desert our flag in the hour of triumph ? A defender of equality , I shall speak without bitterness and without anger ; with the independence becoming a philosopher , with the courage and firmness of a free man . May I , in this momentous struggle , carry into all hearts the light with which I am filled ; and show , by the success of my argument , that equality failed to conquer by the sword only that it might conquer by the pen ! CHAPTER II . PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT .  --  OCCUPATION AND CIVIL LAW AS EFFICIENT BASES OF PROPERTY . DEFINITIONS . The Roman law defined property as the right to use and abuse one 's own within the limits of the law  --  jus utendi et abutendi re sua , guatenus juris ratio patitur . A justification of the word ABUSE has been attempted , on the ground that it signifies , not senseless and immoral abuse , but only absolute domain . Vain distinction ! invented as an excuse for property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it neither prevents nor represses . The proprietor may , if he chooses , allow his crops to rot under foot ; sow his field with salt ; milk his cows on the sand ; change his vineyard into a desert , and use his vegetable-garden as a park : do these things constitute abuse , or not ? In the matter of property , use and abuse are necessarily indistinguishable . According to the Declaration of Rights , published as a preface to the Constitution of ' 93 , property is " the right to enjoy and dispose at will of one 's goods , one 's income , and the fruit of one 's labor and industry . " Code Napoleon , article 544 : " Property is the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner , provided we do not overstep the limits prescribed by the laws and regulations . " These two definitions do not differ from that of the Roman law : all give the proprietor an absolute right over a thing ; and as for the restriction imposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESCRIBED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ,  --  its object is not to limit property , but to prevent the domain of one proprietor from interfering with that of another . That is a confirmation of the principle , not a limitation of it . There are different kinds of property : 1 . Property pure and simple , the dominant and seigniorial power over a thing ; or , as they term it , NAKED PROPERTY . 2 . POSSESSION . " Possession , " says Duranton , " is a matter of fact , not of right . " Toullier : " Property is a right , a legal power ; possession is a fact . " The tenant , the farmer , the commandite ' , the usufructuary , are possessors ; the owner who lets and lends for use , the heir who is to come into possession on the death of a usufructuary , are proprietors . If I may venture the comparison : a lover is a possessor , a husband is a proprietor . This double definition of property  --  domain and possession  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly understood , in order to comprehend what is to follow . From the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of rights : the jus in re , the right in a thing , the right by which I may reclaim the property which I have acquired , in whatever hands I find it ; and the jus ad rem , the right TO a thing , which gives me a claim to become a proprietor . Thus the right of the partners to a marriage over each other 's person is the jus in re ; that of two who are betrothed is only the jus ad rem . In the first , possession and property are united ; the second includes only naked property . With me who , as a laborer , have a right to the possession of the products of Nature and my own industry ,  --  and who , as a proletaire , enjoy none of them ,  --  it is by virtue of the jus ad rem that I demand admittance to the jus in re . This distinction between the jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous distinction between possessoire and petitoire ,  --  actual categories of jurisprudence , the whole of which is included within their vast boundaries . Petitoire refers to every thing relating to property ; possessoire to that relating to possession . In writing this memoir against property , I bring against universal society an action petitoire : I prove that those who do not possess to-day are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess ; but , instead of inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all , I demand , in the name of general security , its entire abolition . If I fail to win my case , there is nothing left for us ( the proletarian class and myself ) but to cut our throats : we can ask nothing more from the justice of nations ; for , as the code of procedure ( art 26 ) tells us in its energetic style , THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAS BEEN NON-SUITED IN AN ACTION PETITOIRE , IS DEBARRED THEREBY FROM BRINGING AN ACTION POSSESSOIRE . If , on the contrary , I gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we may be reinstated in the enjoyment of the wealth of which we are deprived by property . I hope that we shall not be forced to that extremity ; but these two actions can not be prosecuted at once , such a course being prohibited by the same code of procedure . Before going to the heart of the question , it will not be useless to offer a few preliminary remarks . % 1 .  --  Property as a Natural Right . The Declaration of Rights has placed property in its list of the natural and inalienable rights of man , four in all : LIBERTY , EQUALITY , PROPERTY , SECURITY . What rule did the legislators of ' 93 follow in compiling this list ? None . They laid down principles , just as they discussed sovereignty and the laws ; from a general point of view , and according to their own opinion . They did every thing in their own blind way . If we can believe Toullier : " The absolute rights can be reduced to three : SECURITY , LIBERTY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; why ? Is it because LIBERTY implies it , or because property prohibits it ? On this point the author of " Droit Civil Explique " is silent : it has not even occurred to him that the matter is under discussion . Nevertheless , if we compare these three or four rights with each other , we find that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others ; that for the majority of citizens it exists only potentially , and as a dormant faculty without exercise ; that for the others , who do enjoy it , it is susceptible of certain transactions and modifications which do not harmonize with the idea of a natural right ; that , in practice , governments , tribunals , and laws do not respect it ; and finally that everybody , spontaneously and with one voice , regards it as chimerical . Liberty is inviolable . I can neither sell nor alienate my liberty ; every contract , every condition of a contract , which has in view the alienation or suspension of liberty , is null : the slave , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment becomes a free man . When society seizes a malefactor and deprives him of his liberty , it is a case of legitimate defence : whoever violates the social compact by the commission of a crime declares himself a public enemy ; in attacking the liberty of others , he compels them to take away his own . Liberty is the original condition of man ; to renounce liberty is to renounce the nature of man : after that , how could we perform the acts of man ? Likewise , equality before the law suffers neither restriction nor exception . All Frenchmen are equally eligible to office : consequently , in the presence of this equality , condition and family have , in many cases , no influence upon choice . The poorest citizen can obtain judgment in the courts against one occupying the most exalted station . Let the millionaire , Ahab , build a chateau upon the vineyard of Naboth : the court will have the power , according to the circumstances , to order the destruction of the chateau , though it has cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vineyard to its original state , and pay the damages . The law wishes all property , that has been legitimately acquired , to be kept inviolate without regard to value , and without respect for persons . The charter demands , it is true , for the exercise of certain political rights , certain conditions of fortune and capacity ; but all publicists know that the legislator 's intention was not to establish a privilege , but to take security . Provided the conditions fixed by law are complied with , every citizen may be an elector , and every elector eligible . The right , once acquired , is the same for all ; the law compares neither persons nor votes . I do not ask now whether this system is the best ; it is enough that , in the opinion of the charter and in the eyes of every one , equality before the law is absolute , and , like liberty , admits of no compromise . It is the same with the right of security . Society promises its members no half-way protection , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind themselves to it . It does not say to them , " I will shield you , provided it costs me nothing ; I will protect you , if I run no risks thereby . " It says , " I will defend you against everybody ; I will save and avenge you , or perish myself . " The whole strength of the State is at the service of each citizen ; the obligation which binds them together is absolute . How different with property ! Worshipped by all , it is acknowledged by none : laws , morals , customs , public and private conscience , all plot its death and ruin . To meet the expenses of government , which has armies to support , tasks to perform , and officers to pay , taxes are needed . Let all contribute to these expenses : nothing more just . But why should the rich pay more than the poor ? That is just , they say , because they possess more . I confess that such justice is beyond my comprehension . Why are taxes paid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  liberty , equality , security , and property ; to maintain order in the State ; to furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences . Now , does it cost more to defend the rich man 's life and liberty than the poor man 's ? Who , in time of invasion , famine , or plague , causes more trouble ,  --  the large proprietor who escapes the evil without the assistance of the State , or the laborer who sits in his cottage unprotected from danger ? Is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen , or by the artisan and journeyman ? Why , the police have more to fear from a few hundred laborers , out of work , than from two hundred thousand electors ! Does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the poor man national festivities , clean streets , and beautiful monuments ? Why , he prefers his country-seat to all the popular pleasures ; and when he wants to enjoy himself , he does not wait for the greased pole ! One of two things is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger tax-payers , or else it is a wrong . Because , if property is a natural right , as the Declaration of ' 93 declares , all that belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as my person ; it is my blood , my life , myself : whoever touches it offends the apple of my eye . My income of one hundred thousand francs is as inviolable as the grisette 's daily wage of seventy-five centimes ; her attic is no more sacred than my suite of apartments . The tax is not levied in proportion to strength , size , or skill : no more should it be levied in proportion to property . If , then , the State takes more from me , let it give me more in return , or cease to talk of equality of rights ; for otherwise , society is established , not to defend property , but to destroy it . The State , through the proportional tax , becomes the chief of robbers ; the State sets the example of systematic pillage : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of those hideous brigands , that execrable mob which it now kills from motives of professional jealousy . But , they say , the courts and the police force are established to restrain this mob ; government is a company , not exactly for insurance , for it does not insure , but for vengeance and repression . The premium which this company exacts , the tax , is divided in proportion to property ; that is , in proportion to the trouble which each piece of property occasions the avengers and repressers paid by the government . This is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property . Under this system the poor and the rich distrust , and make war upon , each other . But what is the object of the war ? Property . So that property is necessarily accompanied by war upon property . The liberty and security of the rich do not suffer from the liberty and security of the poor ; far from that , they mutually strengthen and sustain each other . The rich man 's right of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the poor man 's desire for property . What a contradiction ! In England they have a poor-rate : they wish me to pay this tax . But what relation exists between my natural and inalienable right of property and the hunger from which ten million wretched people are suffering ? When religion commands us to assist our fellows , it speaks in the name of charity , not in the name of law . The obligation of benevolence , imposed upon me by Christian morality , can not be imposed upon me as a political tax for the benefit of any person or poor-house . I will give alms when I see fit to do so , when the sufferings of others excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk , and in which I do not believe : I will not be forced to bestow them . No one is obliged to do more than comply with this injunction : IN THE EXERCISE OF YOUR OWN RIGHTS DO NOT ENCROACH UPON THE RIGHTS OF ANOTHER ; an injunction which is the exact definition of liberty . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a claim upon them : I object to the placing of the third theological virtue in the order of the day . Everybody , in France , demands the conversion of the five per cent . bonds ; they demand thereby the complete sacrifice of one species of property . They have the right to do it , if public necessity requires it ; but where is the just indemnity promised by the charter ? Not only does none exist , but this indemnity is not even possible ; for , if the indemnity were equal to the property sacrificed , the conversion would be useless . The State occupies the same position to-day toward the bondholders that the city of Calais did , when besieged by Edward III , toward its notables . The English conqueror consented to spare its inhabitants , provided it would surrender to him its most distinguished citizens to do with as he pleased . Eustache and several others offered themselves ; it was noble in them , and our ministers should recommend their example to the bondholders . But had the city the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolute ; the country can require no one to sacrifice himself . The soldier standing guard within the enemy 's range is no exception to this rule . Wherever a citizen stands guard , the country stands guard with him : to-day it is the turn of the one , to-morrow of the other . When danger and devotion are common , flight is parricide . No one has the right to flee from danger ; no one can serve as a scapegoat . The maxim of Caiaphas  --  IT IS RIGHT THAT A MAN SHOULD DIE FOR HIS NATION  --  is that of the populace and of tyrants ; the two extremes of social degradation . It is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable . This maxim of civil law , applied to the State , is good for those who wish to return to the natural equality of labor and wealth ; but , from the point of view of the proprietor , and in the mouth of conversionists , it is the language of bankrupts . The State is not only a borrower , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of security , it assures the most inviolable possession . How , then , can it force open the hands of its creditors , who have confidence in it , and then talk to them of public order and security of property ? The State , in such an operation , is not a debtor who discharges his debt ; it is a stock-company which allures its stockholders into a trap , and there , contrary to its authentic promise , exacts from them twenty , thirty , or forty per cent . of the interest on their capital . That is not all . The State is a university of citizens joined together under a common law by an act of society . This act secures all in the possession of their property ; guarantees to one his field , to another his vineyard , to a third his rents , and to the bondholder , who might have bought real estate but who preferred to come to the assistance of the treasury , his bonds . The State can not demand , without offering an equivalent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vineyard ; still less can it lower rents : why should it have the right to diminish the interest on bonds ? This right could not justly exist , unless the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal advantage ; but being confined to the State , where can he find a place to invest them , since the cause of conversion , that is , the power to borrow to better advantage , lies in the State ? That is why a government , based on the principle of property , can not redeem its annuities without the consent of their holders . The money deposited with the republic is property which it has no right to touch while other kinds of property are respected ; to force their redemption is to violate the social contract , and outlaw the bondholders . The whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds finally reduces itself to this :  --  QUESTION . Is it just to reduce to misery forty-five thousand families who derive an income from their bonds of one hundred francs or less ? ANSWER . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a tax of five francs , when they should pay only three ? It is clear , in the first place , that the reply is in reality no reply ; but , to make the wrong more apparent , let us change it thus : Is it just to endanger the lives of one hundred thousand men , when we can save them by surrendering one hundred heads to the enemy ? Reader , decide ! All this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present system . Yet , nevertheless , sooner or later , the conversion will be effected and property be violated , because no other course is possible ; because property , regarded as a right , and not being a right , must of right perish ; because the force of events , the laws of conscience , and physical and mathematical necessity must , in the end , destroy this illusion of our minds . To sum up : liberty is an absolute right , because it is to man what impenetrability is to matter ,  --  a sine qua non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without equality there is no society ; security is an absolute right , because in the eyes of every man his own liberty and life are as precious as another 's . These three rights are absolute ; that is , susceptible of neither increase nor diminution ; because in society each associate receives as much as he gives ,  --  liberty for liberty , equality for equality , security for security , body for body , soul for soul , in life and in death . But property , in its derivative sense , and by the definitions of law , is a right outside of society ; for it is clear that , if the wealth of each was social wealth , the conditions would be equal for all , and it would be a contradiction to say : PROPERTY IS A MAN 'S RIGHT TO DISPOSE AT WILL OF SOCIAL PROPERTY . Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty , equality , and security , we are not associated for the sake of property ; then if property is a NATURAL right , this natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society are utterly irreconcilable institutions . It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles . Either society must perish , or it must destroy property . If property is a natural , absolute , imprescriptible , and inalienable right , why , in all ages , has there been so much speculation as to its origin ?  --  for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics . The origin of a natural right ! Good God ! who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty , security , or equality ? They exist by the same right that we exist ; they are born with us , they live and die with us . With property it is very different , indeed . By law , property can exist without a proprietor , like a quality without a subject . It exists for the human being who as yet is not , and for the octogenarian who is no more . And yet , in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor of the eternal and the infinite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors still disagree . On one point only are they in harmony : namely , that the validity of the right of property depends upon the authenticity of its origin . But this harmony is their condemnation . Why have they acknowledged the right before settling the question of origin ? Certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property , and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history . They wish to hold to this proposition : that property is a fact ; that it always has been , and always will be . With that proposition the savant Proudhon 11 commenced his " Treatise on the Right of Usufruct , " regarding the origin of property as a useless question . Perhaps I would subscribe to this doctrine , believing it inspired by a commendable love of peace , were all my fellow-citizens in comfortable circumstances ; but , no ! I will not subscribe to it . The titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are two in number : OCCUPATION and LABOR . I shall examine them successively , under all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader that , to whatever authority we appeal , I shall prove beyond a doubt that property , to be just and possible , must necessarily have equality for its condition . % 2.  --  Occupation , as the Title to Property . It is remarkable that , at those meetings of the State Council at which the Code was discussed , no controversy arose as to the origin and principle of property . All the articles of Vol . II. , Book 2 , concerning property and the right of accession , were passed without opposition or amendment . Bonaparte , who on other questions had given his legists so much trouble , had nothing to say about property . Be not surprised at it : in the eyes of that man , the most selfish and wilful person that ever lived , property was the first of rights , just as submission to authority was the most holy of duties . The right of OCCUPATION , or of the FIRST OCCUPANT , is that which results from the actual , physical , real possession of a thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am the proprietor , until the contrary is proved . We know that originally such a right can not be legitimate unless it is reciprocal ; the jurists say as much . Cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre : Quemadmodum theatrum cum commune sit , recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum quem quisque occuparit . This passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the origin of property . The theatre , says Cicero , is common to all ; nevertheless , the place that each one occupies is called HIS OWN ; that is , it is a place POSSESSED , not a place APPROPRIATED . This comparison annihilates property ; moreover , it implies equality . Can I , in a theatre , occupy at the same time one place in the pit , another in the boxes , and a third in the gallery ? Not unless I have three bodies , like Geryon , or can exist in different places at the same time , as is related of the magician Apollonius . According to Cicero , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true interpretation of his famous axiom  --  suum quidque cujusque sit , to each one that which belongs to him  --  an axiom that has been strangely applied . That which belongs to each is not that which each MAY possess , but that which each HAS A RIGHT to possess . Now , what have we a right to possess ? That which is required for our labor and consumption ; Cicero 's comparison of the earth to a theatre proves it . According to that , each one may take what place he will , may beautify and adorn it , if he can ; it is allowable : but he must never allow himself to overstep the limit which separates him from another . The doctrine of Cicero leads directly to equality ; for , occupation being pure toleration , if the toleration is mutual ( and it can not be otherwise ) the possessions are equal . Grotius rushes into history ; but what kind of reasoning is that which seeks the origin of a right , said to be natural , elsewhere than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact exists , then it is necessary , then it is just , then its antecedents are just also . Nevertheless , let us look into it . " Originally , all things were common and undivided ; they were the property of all . " Let us go no farther . Grotius tells us how this original communism came to an end through ambition and cupidity ; how the age of gold was followed by the age of iron , &c.; So that property rested first on war and conquest , then on treaties and agreements . But either these treaties and agreements distributed wealth equally , as did the original communism ( the only method of distribution with which the barbarians were acquainted , and the only form of justice of which they could conceive ; and then the question of origin assumes this form : how did equality afterwards disappear ? )  --  or else these treaties and agreements were forced by the strong upon the weak , and in that case they are null ; the tacit consent of posterity does not make them valid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . We never can conceive how the equality of conditions , having once existed , could afterwards have passed away . What was the cause of such degeneration ? The instincts of the animals are unchangeable , as well as the differences of species ; to suppose original equality in human society is to admit by implication that the present inequality is a degeneration from the nature of this society ,  --  a thing which the defenders of property can not explain . But I infer therefrom that , if Providence placed the first human beings in a condition of equality , it was an indication of its desires , a model that it wished them to realize in other forms ; just as the religious sentiment , which it planted in their hearts , has developed and manifested itself in various ways . Man has but one nature , constant and unalterable : he pursues it through instinct , he wanders from it through reflection , he returns to it through judgment ; who shall say that we are not returning now ? According to Grotius , man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to it . How came he to abandon it ? Why will he return to it ? These are questions for future consideration . Reid writes as follows :  --  " The right of property is not innate , but acquired . It is not grounded upon the constitution of man , but upon his actions . Writers on jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy every man of common understanding . " The earth is given to men in common for the purposes of life , by the bounty of Heaven . But to divide it , and appropriate one part of its produce to one , another part to another , must be the work of men who have power and understanding given them , by which every man may accommodate himself , WITHOUT HURT TO ANY OTHER . " This common right of every man to what the earth produces , before it be occupied and appropriated by others , was , by ancient moralists , very properly compared to the right which every citizen had to the public theatre , where every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby acquire a right to it while the entertainment lasted ; but no man had a right to dispossess another . " The earth is a great theatre , furnished by the Almighty , with perfect wisdom and goodness , for the entertainment and employment of all mankind . Here every man has a right to accommodate himself as a spectator , and to perform his part as an actor ; but without hurt to others . " Consequences of Reid 's doctrine . 1 . That the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no one , it must be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be shared , divided by the number of those who are to share it ; 2 . The number of places being of necessity equal at all times to that of the spectators , no spectator can occupy two places , nor can any actor play several parts ; 3 . Whenever a spectator comes in or goes out , the places of all contract or enlarge correspondingly : for , says Reid , " THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not absolute ; consequently , the occupancy on which it is based , being a conditional fact , can not endow this right with a stability which it does not possess itself . This seems to have been the thought of the Edinburgh professor when he added :  --  " A right to life implies a right to the necessary means of life ; and that justice , which forbids the taking away the life of an innocent man , forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means of life . He has the same right to defend the one as the other . To hinder another man 's innocent labor , or to deprive him of the fruit of it , is an injustice of the same kind , and has the same effect as to put him in fetters or in prison , and is equally a just object of resentment . " Thus the chief of the Scotch school , without considering at all the inequality of skill or labor , posits a priori the equality of the means of labor , abandoning thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the eternal axiom : WHOSO DOES WELL , SHALL FARE WELL . The philosopher Reid is lacking , not in knowledge of the principle , but in courage to pursue it to its ultimate . If the right of life is equal , the right of labor is equal , and so is the right of occupancy . Would it not be criminal , were some islanders to repulse , in the name of property , the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach the shore ? The very idea of such cruelty sickens the imagination . The proprietor , like Robinson Crusoe on his island , wards off with pike and musket the proletaire washed overboard by the wave of civilization , and seeking to gain a foothold upon the rocks of property . " Give me work ! " cries he with all his might to the proprietor : " do n't drive me away , I will work for you at any price . " " I do not need your services , " replies the proprietor , showing the end of his pike or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . " " I need my income to live upon . " " How can I pay you , when I can get no work ? " " That is your business . " Then the unfortunate proletaire abandons himself to the waves ; or , if he attempts to land upon the shore of property , the proprietor takes aim , and kills him . We have just listened to a spiritualist ; we will now question a materialist , then an eclectic : and having completed the circle of philosophy , we will turn next to law . According to Destutt de Tracy , property is a necessity of our nature . That this necessity involves unpleasant consequences , it would be folly to deny . But these consequences are necessary evils which do not invalidate the principle ; so that it as unreasonable to rebel against property on account of the abuses which it generates , as to complain of life because it is sure to end in death . This brutal and pitiless philosophy promises at least frank and close reasoning . Let us see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the conditions of property , ... as if it was our province to decide what constitutes property .... It would seem , to hear certain philosophers and legislators , that at a certain moment , spontaneously and without cause , people began to use the words THINE and MINE ; and that they might have , or ought to have , dispensed with them . But THINE and MINE were never invented . " A philosopher yourself , you are too realistic . THINE and MINE do not necessarily refer to self , as they do when I say your philosophy , and my equality ; for your philosophy is you philosophizing , and my equality is I professing equality . THINE and MINE oftener indicate a relation ,  --  YOUR country , YOUR parish , YOUR tailor , YOUR milkmaid ; MY chamber , MY seat at the theatre , MY company and MY battalion in the National Guard . In the former sense , we may sometimes say MY labor , MY skill , MY virtue ; never MY grandeur nor MY majesty : in the latter sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MY capital ,  --  precisely as the banker 's clerk says MY cash-box . In short , THINE and MINE are signs and expressions of personal , but equal , rights ; applied to things outside of us , they indicate possession , function , use , not property . It does not seem possible , but , nevertheless , I shall prove , by quotations , that the whole theory of our author is based upon this paltry equivocation . " Prior to all covenants , men are , not exactly , as Hobbes says , in a state of HOSTILITY , but of ESTRANGEMENT . In this state , justice and injustice are unknown ; the rights of one bear no relation to the rights of another . All have as many rights as needs , and all feel it their duty to satisfy those needs by any means at their command . " Grant it ; whether true or false , it matters not . Destutt de Tracy can not escape equality . On this theory , men , while in a state of ESTRANGEMENT , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to satisfy their needs without regard to the needs of others , and consequently the right to exercise their power over Nature , each according to his strength and ability . That involves the greatest inequality of wealth . Inequality of conditions , then , is the characteristic feature of estrangement or barbarism : the exact opposite of Rousseau 's idea . But let us look farther :  --  " Restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the time when covenants , either implied or expressed , are agreed upon . Then appears for the first time justice and injustice ; that is , the balance between the rights of one and the rights of another , which up to that time were necessarily equal . " Listen : RIGHTS WERE EQUAL ; that means that each individual had the right to SATISFY HIS NEEDS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE NEEDS OF OTHERS . In other words , that all had the right to injure each other ; that there was no right save force and cunning . They injured each other , not only by war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to abolish this equal right to use force and stratagem ,  --  this equal right to do evil , the sole source of the inequality of benefits and injuries ,  --  they commenced to make COVENANTS EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED , and established a balance . Then these agreements and this balance were intended to secure to all equal comfort ; then , by the law of contradictions , if isolation is the principle of inequality , society must produce equality . The social balance is the equalization of the strong and the weak ; for , while they are not equals , they are strangers ; they can form no associations ,  --  they live as enemies . Then , if inequality of conditions is a necessary evil , so is isolation , for society and inequality are incompatible with each other . Then , if society is the true condition of man 's existence , so is equality also . This conclusion can not be avoided . This being so , how is it that , ever since the establishment of this balance , inequality has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and isolation always accompany each other ? Destutt de Tracy shall reply :  --  " NEEDS and MEANS , RIGHTS and DUTIES , are products of the will . If man willed nothing , these would not exist . But to have needs and means , rights and duties , is to HAVE , to POSSESS , something . They are so many kinds of property , using the word in its most general sense : they are things which belong to us . " Shameful equivocation , not justified by the necessity for generalization ! The word PROPERTY has two meanings : 1 . It designates the quality which makes a thing what it is ; the attribute which is peculiar to it , and especially distinguishes it . We use it in this sense when we say THE PROPERTIES OF THE TRIANGLE or of NUMBERS ; THE PROPERTY OF THE MAGNET , &c.; 2 . It expresses the right of absolute control over a thing by a free and intelligent being . It is used in this sense by writers on jurisprudence . Thus , in the phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROPERTY does not convey the same idea that it does in this one : I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS MAGNET AS MY PROPERTY . To tell a poor man that he HAS property because he HAS arms and legs ,  --  that the hunger from which he suffers , and his power to sleep in the open air are his property ,  --  is to play upon words , and to add insult to injury . " The sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of personality . As soon as property is born at all , it is born , of necessity , in all its fulness . As soon as an individual knows HIMSELF ,  --  his moral personality , his capacities of enjoyment , suffering , and action ,  --  he necessarily sees also that this SELF is exclusive proprietor of the body in which it dwells , its organs , their powers , faculties , &c....; Inasmuch as artificial and conventional property exists , there must be natural property also ; for nothing can exist in art without its counterpart in Nature . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man has properties ; that is , in the first acceptation of the term , faculties . He has property ; that is , in its second acceptation , the right of domain . He has , then , the property of the property of being proprietor . How ashamed I should be to notice such foolishness , were I here considering only the authority of Destutt de Tracy ! But the entire human race , since the origination of society and language , when metaphysics and dialectics were first born , has been guilty of this puerile confusion of thought . All which man could call his own was identified in his mind with his person . He considered it as his property , his wealth ; a part of himself , a member of his body , a faculty of his mind . The possession of things was likened to property in the powers of the body and mind ; and on this false analogy was based the right of property ,  --  THE IMITATION OF NATURE BY ART , as Destutt de Tracy so elegantly puts it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proprietor even of his own faculties ? Man has powers , attributes , capacities ; they are given him by Nature that he may live , learn , and love : he does not own them , but has only the use of them ; and he can make no use of them that does not harmonize with Nature 's laws . If he had absolute mastery over his faculties , he could avoid hunger and cold ; he could eat unstintedly , and walk through fire ; he could move mountains , walk a hundred leagues in a minute , cure without medicines and by the sole force of his will , and could make himself immortal . He could say , " I wish to produce , " and his tasks would be finished with the words ; he could say . " I wish to know , " and he would know ; " I love , " and he would enjoy . What then ? Man is not master of himself , but may be of his surroundings . Let him use the wealth of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let him abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor , and remember that he is called so only metaphorically . To sum up : Destutt de Tracy classes together the external PRODUCTIONS of nature and art , and the POWERS or FACULTIES of man , making both of them species of property ; and upon this equivocation he hopes to establish , so firmly that it can never be disturbed , the right of property . But of these different kinds of property some are INNATE , as memory , imagination , strength , and beauty ; while others are ACQUIRED , as land , water , and forests . In the state of Nature or isolation , the strongest and most skilful ( that is , those best provided with innate property ) stand the best chance of obtaining acquired property . Now , it is to prevent this encroachment and the war which results therefrom , that a balance ( justice ) has been employed , and covenants ( implied or expressed ) agreed upon : it is to correct , as far as possible , inequality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the division remains unequal , so long the partners remain enemies ; and it is the purpose of the covenants to reform this state of things . Thus we have , on the one hand , isolation , inequality , enmity , war , robbery , murder ; on the other , society , equality , fraternity , peace , and love . Choose between them ! M. Joseph Dutens  --  a physician , engineer , and geometrician , but a very poor legist , and no philosopher at all  --  is the author of a " Philosophy of Political Economy , " in which he felt it his duty to break lances in behalf of property . His reasoning seems to be borrowed from Destutt de Tracy . He commences with this definition of property , worthy of Sganarelle : " Property is the right by which a thing is one 's own . " Literally translated : Property is the right of property . After getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will , liberty , and personality ; after having distinguished between IMMATERIAL-NATURAL property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tracy 's of innate and acquired property ,  --  M. Joseph Dutens concludes with these two general propositions : 1 . Property is a natural and inalienable right of every man ; 2 . Inequality of property is a necessary result of Nature ,  --  which propositions are convertible into a simpler one : All men have an equal right of unequal property . He rebukes M. de Sismondi for having taught that landed property has no other basis than law and conventionality ; and he says himself , speaking of the respect which people feel for property , that " their good sense reveals to them the nature of the ORIGINAL CONTRACT made between society and proprietors . " He confounds property with possession , communism with equality , the just with the natural , and the natural with the possible . Now he takes these different ideas to be equivalents ; now he seems to distinguish between them , so much so that it would be infinitely easier to refute him than to understand him . Attracted first by the title of the work , " Philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's obscurities , only the most ordinary ideas . For that reason I will not speak of him . M. Cousin , in his " Moral Philosophy , " page 15 , teaches that all morality , all laws , all rights are given to man with this injunction : " FREE BEING , REMAIN FREE . " Bravo ! master ; I wish to remain free if I can . He continues :  --  " Our principle is true ; it is good , it is social . Do not fear to push it to its ultimate . " 1 . If the human person is sacred , its whole nature is sacred ; and particularly its interior actions , its feelings , its thoughts , its voluntary decisions . This accounts for the respect due to philosophy , religion , the arts industry , commerce , and to all the results of liberty . I say respect , not simply toleration ; for we do not tolerate a right , we respect it . " I bow my head before this philosophy . " 2 . My liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument which we call the body : the body participates then in the sacredness of liberty ; it is then inviolable . This is the basis of the principle of individual liberty . " 3 . My liberty needs , for its objective action , material to work upon ; in other words , property or a thing . This thing or property naturally participates then in the inviolability of my person . For instance , I take possession of an object which has become necessary and useful in the outward manifestation of my liberty . I say , ' This object is mine since it belongs to no one else ; consequently , I possess it legitimately . ' So the legitimacy of possession rests on two conditions . First , I possess only as a free being . Suppress free activity , you destroy my power to labor . Now it is only by labor that I can use this property or thing , and it is only by using it that I possess it . Free activity is then the principle of the right of property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free ; all can use property by labor . Does that mean that all men have a right to all property ? Not at all . To possess legitimately , I must not only labor and produce in my capacity of a free being , but I must also be the first to occupy the property . In short , if labor and production are the principle of the right of property , the fact of first occupancy is its indispensable condition . " 4 . I possess legitimately : then I have the right to use my property as I see fit . I have also the right to give it away . I have also the right to bequeath it ; for if I decide to make a donation , my decision is as valid after my death as during my life . " In fact , to become a proprietor , in M. Cousin 's opinion , one must take possession by occupation and labor . I maintain that the element of time must be considered also ; for if the first occupants have occupied every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become of them , having an instrument with which to work , but no material to work upon ? Must they devour each other ? A terrible extremity , unforeseen by philosophical prudence ; for the reason that great geniuses neglect little things . Notice also that M. Cousin says that neither occupation nor labor , taken separately , can legitimate the right of property ; and that it is born only from the union of the two . This is one of M. Cousin 's eclectic turns , which he , more than any one else , should take pains to avoid . Instead of proceeding by the method of analysis , comparison , elimination , and reduction ( the only means of discovering the truth amid the various forms of thought and whimsical opinions ) , he jumbles all systems together , and then , declaring each both right and wrong , exclaims : " There you have the truth . " But , adhering to my promise , I will not refute him . I will only prove , by all the arguments with which he justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills it . As I have already said , my sole intent is this : to show at the bottom of all these positions that inevitable major , EQUALITY ; hoping hereafter to show that the principle of property vitiates the very elements of economical , moral , and governmental science , thus leading it in the wrong direction . Well , is it not true , from M. Cousin 's point of view , that , if the liberty of man is sacred , it is equally sacred in all individuals ; that , if it needs property for its objective action , that is , for its life , the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all ; that , if I wish to be respected in my right of appropriation , I must respect others in theirs ; and , consequently , that though , in the sphere of the infinite , a person 's power of appropriation is limited only by himself , in the sphere of the finite this same power is limited by the mathematical relation between the number of persons and the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one individual can not prevent another  --  his fellow-man  --  from appropriating an amount of material equal to his own , no more can he prevent individuals yet to come ; because , while individuality passes away , universality persists , and eternal laws can not be determined by a partial view of their manifestations ? Must we not conclude , therefore , that whenever a person is born , the others must crowd closer together ; and , by reciprocity of obligation , that if the new comer is afterwards to become an heir , the right of succession does not give him the right of accumulation , but only the right of choice ? I have followed M. Cousin so far as to imitate his style , and I am ashamed of it . Do we need such high-sounding terms , such sonorous phrases , to say such simple things ? Man needs to labor in order to live ; consequently , he needs tools to work with and materials to work upon . His need to produce constitutes his right to produce . Now , this right is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement to that effect . One hundred thousand men settle in a large country like France with no inhabitants : each man has a right to 1/100,000 of the land . If the number of possessors increases , each one 's portion diminishes in consequence ; so that , if the number of inhabitants rises to thirty-four millions , each one will have a right only to 1/34,000,000 . Now , so regulate the police system and the government , labor , exchange , inheritance , &c.,; that the means of labor shall be shared by all equally , and that each individual shall be free ; and then society will be perfect . Of all the defenders of property , M. Cousin has gone the farthest . He has maintained against the economists that labor does not establish the right of property unless preceded by occupation , and against the jurists that the civil law can determine and apply a natural right , but can not create it . In fact , it is not sufficient to say , " The right of property is demonstrated by the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely declaratory . " To say that , is to confess that there is no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the fact itself . Every right must be justifiable in itself , or by some antecedent right ; property is no exception . For this reason , M. Cousin has sought to base it upon the SANCTITY of the human personality , and the act by which the will assimilates a thing . " Once touched by man , " says one of M. Cousin 's disciples , " things receive from him a character which transforms and humanizes them . " I confess , for my part , that I have no faith in this magic , and that I know of nothing less holy than the will of man . But this theory , fragile as it seems to psychology as well as jurisprudence , is nevertheless more philosophical and profound than those theories which are based upon labor or the authority of the law . Now , we have just seen to what this theory of which we are speaking leads ,  --  to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint , and is not sufficiently practical ; perhaps from the exalted summit of speculation men seem so small to the metaphysician that he can not distinguish between them ; perhaps , indeed , the equality of conditions is one of those principles which are very true and sublime as generalities , but which it would be ridiculous and even dangerous to attempt to rigorously apply to the customs of life and to social transactions . Undoubtedly , this is a case which calls for imitation of the wise reserve of moralists and jurists , who warn us against carrying things to extremes , and who advise us to suspect every definition ; because there is not one , they say , which can not be utterly destroyed by developing its disastrous results  --  Omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa est : parum est enim ut non subverti possit . Equality of conditions ,  --  a terrible dogma in the ears of the proprietor , a consoling truth at the poor-man 's sick-bed , a frightful reality under the knife of the anatomist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civil , and industrial spheres , is only an alluring impossibility , an inviting bait , a satanic delusion . It is never my intention to surprise my reader . I detest , as I do death , the man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct . From the first page of this book , I have expressed myself so plainly and decidedly that all can see the tendency of my thought and hopes ; and they will do me the justice to say , that it would be difficult to exhibit more frankness and more boldness at the same time . I do not hesitate to declare that the time is not far distant when this reserve , now so much admired in philosophers  --  this happy medium so strongly recommended by professors of moral and political science  --  will be regarded as the disgraceful feature of a science without principle , and as the seal of its reprobation . In legislation and morals , as well as in geometry , axioms are absolute , definitions are certain ; and all the results of a principle are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deplorable pride ! We know nothing of our nature , and we charge our blunders to it ; and , in a fit of unaffected ignorance , cry out , " The truth is in doubt , the best definition defines nothing ! " We shall know some time whether this distressing uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the nature of its investigations , or from our prejudices ; whether , to explain social phenomena , it is not enough to change our hypothesis , as did Copernicus when he reversed the system of Ptolemy . But what will be said when I show , as I soon shall , that this same jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality ? What reply can be made ? % 3.  --  Civil Law as the Foundation and Sanction of Property . Pothier seems to think that property , like royalty , exists by divine right . He traces back its origin to God himself  --  ab Jove principium . He begins in this way :  --  " God is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains : Domini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitant in eo . For the human race he has created the earth and all its creatures , and has given it a control over them subordinate only to his own . ' Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands ; thou hast put all things under his feet , ' says the Psalmist . God accompanied this gift with these words , addressed to our first parents after the creation : ' Be fruitful , and multiply and replenish the earth , ' " &c.; After this magnificent introduction , who would refuse to believe the human race to be an immense family living in brotherly union , and under the protection of a venerable father ? But , heavens ! are brothers enemies ? Are fathers unnatural , and children prodigal ? GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE : why then have I received none ? HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET ,  --  and I have not where to lay my head ! MULTIPLY , he tells us through his interpreter , Pothier . Ah , learned Pothier ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you must give moss to the bird for its nest . " The human race having multiplied , men divided among themselves the earth and most of the things upon it ; that which fell to each , from that time exclusively belonged to him . That was the origin of the right of property . " Say , rather , the right of possession . Men lived in a state of communism ; whether positive or negative it matters little . Then there was no property , not even private possession . The genesis and growth of possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support , they agreed either formally or tacitly ,  --  it makes no difference which ,  --  that the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor ; that is , they simply declared the fact that thereafter none could live without working . It necessarily followed that , to obtain equality of products , there must be equality of labor ; and that , to obtain equality of labor , there must be equality of facilities for labor . Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of another 's means of subsistence , destroyed equality , and placed himself above or outside of the law . Whoever monopolized the means of production on the ground of greater industry , also destroyed equality . Equality being then the expression of right , whoever violated it was UNJUST . Thus , labor gives birth to private possession ; the right in a thing  --  jus in re . But in what thing ? Evidently IN THE PRODUCT , not IN THE SOIL . So the Arabs have always understood it ; and so , according to Caesar and Tacitus , the Germans formerly held . " The Arabs , " says M. de Sismondi , " who admit a man 's property in the flocks which he has raised , do not refuse the crop to him who planted the seed ; but they do not see why another , his equal , should not have a right to plant in his turn . The inequality which results from the pretended right of the first occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of justice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of inhabitants , there results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the nation , to which they do not wish to submit . " Well , they have shared the land . I admit that therefrom results a more powerful organization of labor ; and that this method of distribution , fixed and durable , is advantageous to production : but how could this division give to each a transferable right of property in a thing to which all had an inalienable right of possession ? In the terms of jurisprudence , this metamorphosis from possessor to proprietor is legally impossible ; it implies in the jurisdiction of the courts the union of possessoire and petitoire ; and the mutual concessions of those who share the land are nothing less than traffic in natural rights . The original cultivators of the land , who were also the original makers of the law , were not as learned as our legislators , I admit ; and had they been , they could not have done worse : they did not foresee the consequences of the transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute property . But why have not those , who in later times have established the distinction between jus in re and jus ad rem , applied it to the principle of property itself ? Let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their own maxims . The right of property , provided it can have a cause , can have but one  --  Dominium non potest nisi ex una causa contingere . I can possess by several titles ; I can become proprietor by only one  --  Non ut ex pluribus causis idem nobis deberi potest , ita ex pluribus causis idem potest nostrum esse . The field which I have cleared , which I cultivate , on which I have built my house , which supports myself , my family , and my livestock , I can possess : 1st . As the original occupant ; 2d . As a laborer ; 3d . By virtue of the social contract which assigns it to me as my share . But none of these titles confer upon me the right of property . For , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am the original occupant . " If I appeal to my labor , it will say , " It is only on that condition that you possess . " If I speak of agreements , it will respond , " These agreements establish only your right of use . " Such , however , are the only titles which proprietors advance . They never have been able to discover any others . Indeed , every right  --  it is Pothier who says it  --  supposes a producing cause in the person who enjoys it ; but in man who lives and dies , in this son of earth who passes away like a shadow , there exists , with respect to external things , only titles of possession , not one title of property . Why , then , has society recognized a right injurious to itself , where there is no producing cause ? Why , in according possession , has it also conceded property ? Why has the law sanctioned this abuse of power ? The German Ancillon replies thus :  --  " Some philosophers pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ,  --  say a field or a tree ,  --  acquires a right only to the improvements which he makes , to the form which he gives to the object , not to the object itself . Useless distinction ! If the form could be separated from the object , perhaps there would be room for question ; but as this is almost always impossible , the application of man 's strength to the different parts of the visible world is the foundation of the right of property , the primary origin of riches . " Vain pretext ! If the form can not be separated from the object , nor property from possession , possession must be shared ; in any case , society reserves the right to fix the conditions of property . Let us suppose that an appropriated farm yields a gross income of ten thousand francs ; and , as very seldom happens , that this farm can not be divided . Let us suppose farther that , by economical calculation , the annual expenses of a family are three thousand francs : the possessor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good father of a family , by paying to society ten thousand francs ,  --  less the total costs of cultivation , and the three thousand francs required for the maintenance of his family . This payment is not rent , it is an indemnity . What sort of justice is it , then , which makes such laws as this :  --  " Whereas , since labor so changes the form of a thing that the form and substance can not be separated without destroying the thing itself , either society must be disinherited , or the laborer must lose the fruit of his labor ; and " Whereas , in every other case , property in raw material would give a title to added improvements , minus their cost ; and whereas , in this instance , property in improvements ought to give a title to the principal ; " Therefore , the right of appropriation by labor shall never be admitted against individuals , but only against society . " In such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property . The law is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rights of each against each , and each against all ; and , as if a proportion could exist with less than four terms , the law-makers always disregard the latter . As long as man is opposed to man , property offsets property , and the two forces balance each other ; as soon as man is isolated , that is , opposed to the society which he himself represents , jurisprudence is at fault : Themis has lost one scale of her balance . Listen to the professor of Rennes , the learned Toullier :  --  " How could this claim , made valid by occupation , become stable and permanent property , which might continue to stand , and which might be reclaimed after the first occupant had relinquished possession ? " Agriculture was a natural consequence of the multiplication of the human race , and agriculture , in its turn , favors population , and necessitates the establishment of permanent property ; for who would take the trouble to plough and sow , if he were not certain that he would reap ? " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of his crop ; admit even that he should have been protected in his right of occupation of land , as long as he remained its cultivator . That was all that he had a right to expect ; that was all that the advance of civilization demanded . But property , property ! the right of escheat over lands which one neither occupies nor cultivates ,  --  who had authority to grant it ? who pretended to have it ? " Agriculture alone was not sufficient to establish permanent property ; positive laws were needed , and magistrates to execute them ; in a word , the civil State was needed . " The multiplication of the human race had rendered agriculture necessary ; the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of his labor made permanent property necessary , and also laws for its protection . So we are indebted to property for the creation of the civil State . " Yes , of our civil State , as you have made it ; a State which , at first , was despotism , then monarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Without the ties of property it never would have been possible to subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law ; and without permanent property the earth would have remained a vast forest . Let us admit , then , with the most careful writers , that if transient property , or the right of preference resulting from occupation , existed prior to the establishment of civil society , permanent property , as we know it to-day , is the work of civil law . It is the civil law which holds that , when once acquired , property can be lost only by the action of the proprietor , and that it exists even after the proprietor has relinquished possession of the thing , and it has fallen into the hands of a third party . " Thus property and possession , which originally were confounded , became through the civil law two distinct and independent things ; two things which , in the language of the law , have nothing whatever in common . In this we see what a wonderful change has been effected in property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the civil laws . " Thus the law , in establishing property , has not been the expression of a psychological fact , the development of a natural law , the application of a moral principle . It has literally CREATED a right outside of its own province . It has realized an abstraction , a metaphor , a fiction ; and that without deigning to look at the consequences , without considering the disadvantages , without inquiring whether it was right or wrong . It has sanctioned selfishness ; it has indorsed monstrous pretensions ; it has received with favor impious vows , as if it were able to fill up a bottomless pit , and to satiate hell ! Blind law ; the law of the ignorant man ; a law which is not a law ; the voice of discord , deceit , and blood ! This it is which , continually revived , reinstated , rejuvenated , restored , re-enforced  --  as the palladium of society  --  has troubled the consciences of the people , has obscured the minds of the masters , and has induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is which Christianity has condemned , but which its ignorant ministers deify ; who have as little desire to study Nature and man , as ability to read their Scriptures . But , indeed , what guide did the law follow in creating the domain of property ? What principle directed it ? What was its standard ? Would you believe it ? It was equality . Agriculture was the foundation of territorial possession , and the original cause of property . It was of no use to secure to the farmer the fruit of his labor , unless the means of production were at the same time secured to him . To fortify the weak against the invasion of the strong , to suppress spoliation and fraud , the necessity was felt of establishing between possessors permanent lines of division , insuperable obstacles . Every year saw the people multiply , and the cupidity of the husbandman increase : it was thought best to put a bridle on ambition by setting boundaries which ambition would in vain attempt to overstep . Thus the soil came to be appropriated through need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceable possession . Undoubtedly the division was never geographically equal ; a multitude of rights , some founded in Nature , but wrongly interpreted and still more wrongly applied , inheritance , gift , and exchange ; others , like the privileges of birth and position , the illegitimate creations of ignorance and brute force ,  --  all operated to prevent absolute equality . But , nevertheless , the principle remained the same : equality had sanctioned possession ; equality sanctioned property . The husbandman needed each year a field to sow ; what more convenient and simple arrangement for the barbarians ,  --  instead of indulging in annual quarrels and fights , instead of continually moving their houses , furniture , and families from spot to spot ,  --  than to assign to each individual a fixed and inalienable estate ? It was not right that the soldier , on returning from an expedition , should find himself dispossessed on account of the services which he had just rendered to his country ; his estate ought to be restored to him . It became , therefore , customary to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sacrificed only with the consent and by the action of the proprietor . It was necessary that the equality in the division should be kept up from one generation to another , without a new distribution of the land upon the death of each family ; it appeared therefore natural and just that children and parents , according to the degree of relationship which they bore to the deceased , should be the heirs of their ancestors . Thence came , in the first place , the feudal and patriarchal custom of recognizing only one heir ; then , by a quite contrary application of the principle of equality , the admission of all the children to a share in their father 's estate , and , very recently also among us , the definitive abolition of the right of primogeniture . But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science ? How could these men , who never had the faintest idea of statistics , valuation , or political economy , furnish us with principles of legislation ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the expression of a social want , the declaration of a fact : the legislator does not make it , he declares it . ' This definition is not exact . The law is a method by which social wants must be satisfied ; the people do not vote it , the legislator does not express it : the savant discovers and formulates it . " But in fact , the law , according to M. Ch . Comte , who has devoted half a volume to its definition , was in the beginning only the EXPRESSION OF A WANT , and the indication of the means of supplying it ; and up to this time it has been nothing else . The legists  --  with mechanical fidelity , full of obstinacy , enemies of philosophy , buried in literalities  --  have always mistaken for the last word of science that which was only the inconsiderate aspiration of men who , to be sure , were well-meaning , but wanting in foresight . They did not foresee , these old founders of the domain of property , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a right which seemed to them equitable , because it was common ,  --  involves the right to transfer , sell , give , gain , and lose it ; that it tends , consequently , to nothing less than the destruction of that equality which they established it to maintain . And though they should have foreseen it , they disregarded it ; the present want occupied their whole attention , and , as ordinarily happens in such cases , the disadvantages were at first scarcely perceptible , and they passed unnoticed . They did not foresee , these ingenuous legislators , that if property is retainable by intent alone  --  nudo animo  --  it carries with it the right to let , to lease , to loan at interest , to profit by exchange , to settle annuities , and to levy a tax on a field which intent reserves , while the body is busy elsewhere . They did not foresee , these fathers of our jurisprudence , that , if the right of inheritance is any thing other than Nature 's method of preserving equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous exclusions ; and society , pierced to the heart by one of its most sacred principles , will come to its death through opulence and misery . 12 Under whatever form of government we live , it can always be said that le mort saisit le vif ; that is , that inheritance and succession will last for ever , whoever may be the recognized heir . But the St. Simonians wish the heir to be designated by the magistrate ; others wish him to be chosen by the deceased , or assumed by the law to be so chosen : the essential point is that Nature 's wish be satisfied , so far as the law of equality allows . To-day the real controller of inheritance is chance or caprice ; now , in matters of legislation , chance and caprice can not be accepted as guides . It is for the purpose of avoiding the manifold disturbances which follow in the wake of chance that Nature , after having created us equal , suggests to us the principle of heredity ; which serves as a voice by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , him whom we judge best fitted to complete our unfinished work . They did not foresee .... But why need I go farther ? The consequences are plain enough , and this is not the time to criticise the whole Code . The history of property among the ancient nations is , then , simply a matter of research and curiosity . It is a rule of jurisprudence that the fact does not substantiate the right . Now , property is no exception to this rule : then the universal recognition of the right of property does not legitimate the right of property . Man is mistaken as to the constitution of society , the nature of right , and the application of justice ; just as he was mistaken regarding the cause of meteors and the movement of the heavenly bodies . His old opinions can not be taken for articles of faith . Of what consequence is it to us that the Indian race was divided into four classes ; that , on the banks of the Nile and the Ganges , blood and position formerly determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans placed property under the protection of the gods ; that they accompanied with religious ceremonies the work of partitioning the land and appraising their goods ? The variety of the forms of privilege does not sanction injustice . The faith of Jupiter , the proprietor , 13 proves no more against the equality of citizens , than do the mysteries of Venus , the wanton , against conjugal chastity . The authority of the human race is of no effect as evidence in favor of the right of property , because this right , resting of necessity upon equality , contradicts its principle ; the decision of the religions which have sanctioned it is of no effect , because in all ages the priest has submitted to the prince , and the gods have always spoken as the politicians desired ; the social advantages , attributed to property , can not be cited in its behalf , because they all spring from the principle of equality of possession . What means , then , this dithyramb upon property ? " The right of property is the most important of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most glorious . " The original cause of man 's prosperity upon earth . " Because justice was supposed to be its principle . " Property became the legitimate end of his ambition , the hope of his existence , the shelter of his family ; in a word , the corner-stone of the domestic dwelling , of communities , and of the political State . " Possession alone produced all that . " Eternal principle ,  --  " Property is eternal , like every negation ,  --  " Of all social and civil institutions . " For that reason , every institution and every law based on property will perish . " It is a boon as precious as liberty . " For the rich proprietor . " In fact , the cause of the cultivation of the habitable earth . " If the cultivator ceased to be a tenant , would the land be worse cared for ? " The guarantee and the morality of labor . " Under the regime of property , labor is not a condition , but a privilege . " The application of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A balance with false weights . " All morality ,  --  " A famished stomach knows no morality ,  --  " All public order ,  --  " Certainly , the preservation of property ,  --  " Rest on the right of property . " 14 Corner-stone of all which is , stumbling-block of all which ought to be ,  --  such is property . To sum up and conclude :  --  Not only does occupation lead to equality , it PREVENTS property . For , since every man , from the fact of his existence , has the right of occupation , and , in order to live , must have material for cultivation on which he may labor ; and since , on the other hand , the number of occupants varies continually with the births and deaths ,  --  it follows that the quantity of material which each laborer may claim varies with the number of occupants ; consequently , that occupation is always subordinate to population . Finally , that , inasmuch as possession , in right , can never remain fixed , it is impossible , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant is , then , necessarily a possessor or usufructuary ,  --  a function which excludes proprietorship . Now , this is the right of the usufructuary : he is responsible for the thing entrusted to him ; he must use it in conformity with general utility , with a view to its preservation and development ; he has no power to transform it , to diminish it , or to change its nature ; he can not so divide the usufruct that another shall perform the labor while he receives the product . In a word , the usufructuary is under the supervision of society , submitted to the condition of labor and the law of equality . Thus is annihilated the Roman definition of property  --  THE RIGHT OF USE AND ABUSE  --  an immorality born of violence , the most monstrous pretension that the civil laws ever sanctioned . Man receives his usufruct from the hands of society , which alone is the permanent possessor . The individual passes away , society is deathless . What a profound disgust fills my soul while discussing such simple truths ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to again take arms for their triumph ? And can force , in default of reason , alone introduce them into our laws ? ALL HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT OF OCCUPANCY . THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED , NOT BY THE WILL , BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER , PROPERTY CAN NOT EXIST . This no code has ever expressed ; this no constitution can admit ! These are axioms which the civil law and the law of nations deny ! ..... But I hear the exclamations of the partisans of another system : " Labor , labor ! that is the basis of property ! " Reader , do not be deceived . This new basis of property is worse than the first , and I shall soon have to ask your pardon for having demonstrated things clearer , and refuted pretensions more unjust , than any which we have yet considered . CHAPTER III . LABOR AS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY . Nearly all the modern writers on jurisprudence , taking their cue from the economists , have abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have adopted that which regards property as born of labor . In this they are deluded ; they reason in a circle . To labor it is necessary to occupy , says M. Cousin . Consequently , I have added in my turn , all having an equal right of occupancy , to labor it is necessary to submit to equality . " The rich , " exclaims Jean Jacques , " have the arrogance to say , ' I built this wall ; I earned this land by my labor . ' Who set you the tasks ? we may reply , and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you ? " All sophistry falls to the ground in the presence of this argument . But the partisans of labor do not see that their system is an absolute contradiction of the Code , all the articles and provisions of which suppose property to be based upon the fact of first occupancy . If labor , through the appropriation which results from it , alone gives birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a falsehood , our whole social system is a violation of right . To this conclusion shall we come , at the end of the discussion which is to occupy our attention in this chapter and the following one , both as to the right of labor and the fact of property . We shall see , on the one hand , our legislation in opposition to itself ; and , on the other hand , our new jurisprudence in opposition both to its own principle and to our legislation . I have asserted that the system which bases property upon labor implies , no less than that which bases it upon occupation , the equality of fortunes ; and the reader must be impatient to learn how I propose to deduce this law of equality from the inequality of skill and faculties : directly his curiosity shall be satisfied . But it is proper that I should call his attention for a moment to this remarkable feature of the process ; to wit , the substitution of labor for occupation as the principle of property ; and that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietors are accustomed to appeal , which legislation has sanctioned , and which the system of labor completely overthrows . Reader , were you ever present at the examination of a criminal ? Have you watched his tricks , his turns , his evasions , his distinctions , his equivocations ? Beaten , all his assertions overthrown , pursued like a fallow deer by the in exorable judge , tracked from hypothesis to hypothesis ,  --  he makes a statement , he corrects it , retracts it , contradicts it , he exhausts all the tricks of dialectics , more subtle , more ingenious a thousand times than he who invented the seventy-two forms of the syllogism . So acts the proprietor when called upon to defend his right . At first he refuses to reply , he exclaims , he threatens , he defies ; then , forced to accept the discussion , he arms himself with chicanery , he surrounds himself with formidable artillery ,  --  crossing his fire , opposing one by one and all together occupation , possession , limitation , covenants , immemorial custom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a wounded boar , turns on his pursuers . " I have done more than occupy , " he cries with terrible emotion ; " I have labored , produced , improved , transformed , CREATED . This house , these fields , these trees are the work of my hands ; I changed these brambles into a vineyard , and this bush into a fig-tree ; and to-day I reap the harvest of my labors . I have enriched the soil with my sweat ; I have paid those men who , had they not had the work which I gave them , would have died of hunger . No one shared with me the trouble and expense ; no one shall share with me the benefits . " You have labored , proprietor ! why then do you speak of original occupancy ? What , were you not sure of your right , or did you hope to deceive men , and make justice an illusion ? Make haste , then , to acquaint us with your mode of defence , for the judgment will be final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restitution . You have labored ! but what is there in common between the labor which duty compels you to perform , and the appropriation of things in which there is a common interest ? Do you not know that domain over the soil , like that over air and light , can not be lost by prescription ? You have labored ! have you never made others labor ? Why , then , have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them ? You have labored ! very well ; but let us see the results of your labor . We will count , weigh , and measure them . It will be the judgment of Balthasar ; for I swear by balance , level , and square , that if you have appropriated another 's labor in any way whatsoever , you shall restore it every stroke . Thus , the principle of occupation is abandoned ; no longer is it said , " The land belongs to him who first gets possession of it . " Property , forced into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed , retracts her maxims , and sorrow lowers her bandage over her blushing cheeks . And it was but yesterday that this progress in social philosophy began : fifty centuries required for the extirpation of a lie ! During this lamentable period , how many usurpations have been sanctioned , how many invasions glorified , how many conquests celebrated ! The absent dispossessed , the poor banished , the hungry excluded by wealth , which is so ready and bold in action ! Jealousies and wars , incendiarism and bloodshed , among the nations ! But henceforth , thanks to the age and its spirit , it is to be admitted that the earth is not a prize to be won in a race ; in the absence of any other obstacle , there is a place for everybody under the sun . Each one may harness his goat to the bearn , drive his cattle to pasture , sow a corner of a field , and bake his bread by his own fireside . But , no ; each one can not do these things . I hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry ! to each according to his capacity ; to each capacity according to its results ! " And I see three-fourths of the human race again despoiled , the labor of a few being a scourge to the labor of the rest . " The problem is solved , " exclaims M. Hennequin . " Property , the daughter of labor , can be enjoyed at present and in the future only under the protection of the laws . It has its origin in natural law ; it derives its power from civil law ; and from the union of these two ideas , LABOR and PROTECTION , positive legislation results . " ... Ah ! THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED ! PROPERTY IS THE DAUGHTER OF LABOR ! What , then , is the right of accession , and the right of succession , and the right of donation , &c.,; if not the right to become a proprietor by simple occupancy ? What are your laws concerning the age of majority , emancipation , guardianship , and interdiction , if not the various conditions by which he who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , property ? Being unable , at this time , to enter upon a detailed discussion of the Code , I shall content myself with examining the three arguments oftenest resorted to in support of property . 1 . APPROPRIATION , or the formation of property by possession ; 2 . THE CONSENT OF MANKIND ; 3 . PRESCRIPTION . I shall then inquire into the effects of labor upon the relative condition of the laborers and upon property . % 1 .  --  The Land can not be Appropriated . " It would seem that lands capable of cultivation ought to be regarded as natural wealth , since they are not of human creation , but Nature 's gratuitous gift to man ; but inasmuch as this wealth is not fugitive , like the air and water ,  --  inasmuch as a field is a fixed and limited space which certain men have been able to appropriate , to the exclusion of all others who in their turn have consented to this appropriation ,  --  the land , which was a natural and gratuitous gift , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to pay . "  --  SAY : POLITICAL ECONOMY . Was I wrong in saying , at the beginning of this chapter , that the economists are the very worst authorities in matters of legislation and philosophy ? It is the FATHER of this class of men who clearly states the question , How can the supplies of Nature , the wealth created by Providence , become private property ? and who replies by so gross an equivocation that we scarcely know which the author lacks , sense or honesty . What , I ask , has the fixed and solid nature of the earth to do with the right of appropriation ? I can understand that a thing LIMITED and STATIONARY , like the land , offers greater chances for appropriation than the water or the sunshine ; that it is easier to exercise the right of domain over the soil than over the atmosphere : but we are not dealing with the difficulty of the thing , and Say confounds the right with the possibility . We do not ask why the earth has been appropriated to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know by what right man has appropriated wealth WHICH HE DID NOT CREATE , AND WHICH NATURE GAVE TO HIM GRATUITOUSLY . Say , then , did not solve the question which he asked . But if he had solved it , if the explanation which he has given us were as satisfactory as it is illogical , we should know no better than before who has a right to exact payment for the use of the soil , of this wealth which is not man 's handiwork . Who is entitled to the rent of the land ? The producer of the land , without doubt . Who made the land ? God . Then , proprietor , retire ! But the creator of the land does not sell it : he gives it ; and , in giving it , he is no respecter of persons . Why , then , are some of his children regarded as legitimate , while others are treated as bastards ? If the equality of shares was an original right , why is the inequality of conditions a posthumous right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water were not of a FUGITIVE nature , they would have been appropriated . Let me observe in passing that this is more than an hypothesis ; it is a reality . Men have appropriated the air and the water , I will not say as often as they could , but as often as they have been allowed to . The Portuguese , having discovered the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope , pretended to have the sole right to that route ; and Grotius , consulted in regard to this matter by the Dutch who refused to recognize this right , wrote expressly for this occasion his treatise on the " Freedom of the Seas , " to prove that the sea is not liable to appropriation . The right to hunt and fish used always to be confined to lords and proprietors ; to-day it is leased by the government and communes to whoever can pay the license-fee and the rent . To regulate hunting and fishing is an excellent idea , but to make it a subject of sale is to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A universal recommendation of the traveller 's person ; a certificate of security for himself and his property . The treasury , whose nature it is to spoil the best things , has made the passport a means of espionage and a tax . Is not this a sale of the right to travel ? Finally , it is permissible neither to draw water from a spring situated in another 's grounds without the permission of the proprietor , because by the right of accession the spring belongs to the possessor of the soil , if there is no other claim ; nor to pass a day on his premises without paying a tax ; nor to look at a court , a garden , or an orchard , without the consent of the proprietor ; nor to stroll in a park or an enclosure against the owner 's will : every one is allowed to shut himself up and to fence himself in . All these prohibitions are so many positive interdictions , not only of the land , but of the air and water . We who belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et aqua , et aere , et igne interdicti sumus . Men could not appropriate the most fixed of all the elements without appropriating the three others ; since , by French and Roman law , property in the surface carries with it property from zenith to nadir  --  Cujus est solum , ejus est usque ad caelum . Now , if the use of water , air , and fire excludes property , so does the use of the soil . This chain of reasoning seems to have been presented by M. Ch . Comte , in his " Treatise on Property , " chap . 5 . " If a man should be deprived of air for a few moments only , he would cease to exist , and a partial deprivation would cause him severe suffering ; a partial or complete deprivation of food would produce like effects upon him though less suddenly ; it would be the same , at least in certain climates ! were he deprived of all clothing and shelter .... To sustain life , then , man needs continually to appropriate many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like proportions . Some , such as the light of the stars , the atmosphere of the earth , the water composing the seas and oceans , exist in such large quantities that men can not perceive any sensible increase or diminution ; each one can appropriate as much as his needs require without detracting from the enjoyment of others , without causing them the least harm . Things of this sort are , so to speak , the common property of the human race ; the only duty imposed upon each individual in this regard is that of infringing not at all upon the rights of others . " Let us complete the argument of M. Ch . Comte . A man who should be prohibited from walking in the highways , from resting in the fields , from taking shelter in caves , from lighting fires , from picking berries , from gathering herbs and boiling them in a bit of baked clay ,  --  such a man could not live . Consequently the earth  --  like water , air , and light  --  is a primary object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without infringing another 's right . Why , then , is the earth appropriated ? M. Ch . Comte 's reply is a curious one . Say pretends that it is because it is not FUGITIVE ; M. Ch . Comte assures us that it is because it is not INFINITE . The land is limited in amount . Then , according to M. Ch . Comte , it ought to be appropriated . It would seem , on the contrary , that he ought to say , Then it ought not to be appropriated . Because , no matter how large a quantity of air or light any one appropriates , no one is damaged thereby ; there always remains enough for all . With the soil , it is very different . Lay hold who will , or who can , of the sun 's rays , the passing breeze , or the sea 's billows ; he has my consent , and my pardon for his bad intentions . But let any living man dare to change his right of territorial possession into the right of property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the death ! M. Ch . Comte 's argument disproves his position . " Among the things necessary to the preservation of life , " he says , " there are some which exist in such large quantities that they are inexhaustible ; others which exist in lesser quantities , and can satisfy the wants of only a certain number of persons . The former are called COMMON , the latter PRIVATE . " This reasoning is not strictly logical . Water , air , and light are COMMON things , not because they are INEXHAUSTIBLE , but because they are INDISPENSABLE ; and so indispensable that for that very reason Nature has created them in quantities almost infinite , in order that their plentifulness might prevent their appropriation . Likewise the land is indispensable to our existence ,  --  consequently a common thing , consequently insusceptible of appropriation ; but land is much scarcer than the other elements , therefore its use must be regulated , not for the profit of a few , but in the interest and for the security of all . In a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , equality of rights , in the case of a commodity which is limited in amount , can be realized only by equality of possession . An agrarian law underlies M. Ch . Comte 's arguments . From whatever point we view this question of property  --  provided we go to the bottom of it  --  we reach equality . I will not insist farther on the distinction between things which can , and things which can not , be appropriated . On this point , economists and legists talk worse than nonsense . The Civil Code , after having defined property , says nothing about susceptibility of appropriation ; and if it speaks of things which are in THE MARKET , it always does so without enumerating or describing them . However , light is not wanting . There are some few maxims such as these : Ad reges potestas omnium pertinet , ad singulos proprietas ; Omnia rex imperio possidet , singula dominio . Social sovereignty opposed to private property !  --  might not that be called a prophecy of equality , a republican oracle ? Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the estates of the crown , the fiefs of the nobility were inalienable and imprescriptible . If , instead of abolishing this privilege , the Constituent had extended it to every individual ; if it had declared that the right of labor , like liberty , can never be forfeited ,  --  at that moment the revolution would have been consummated , and we could now devote ourselves to improvement in other directions . % 2.  --  Universal Consent no Justification of Property . In the extract from Say , quoted above , it is not clear whether the author means to base the right of property on the stationary character of the soil , or on the consent which he thinks all men have granted to this appropriation . His language is such that it may mean either of these things , or both at once ; which entitles us to assume that the author intended to say , " The right of property resulting originally from the exercise of the will , the stability of the soil permitted it to be applied to the land , and universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , can men legitimate property by mutual consent ? I say , no . Such a contract , though drafted by Grotius , Montesquieu , and J. J. Rousseau , though signed by the whole human race , would be null in the eyes of justice , and an act to enforce it would be illegal . Man can no more give up labor than liberty . Now , to recognize the right of territorial property is to give up labor , since it is to relinquish the means of labor ; it is to traffic in a natural right , and divest ourselves of manhood . But I wish that this consent , of which so much is made , had been given , either tacitly or formally . What would have been the result ? Evidently , the surrenders would have been reciprocal ; no right would have been abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange . We thus come back to equality again ,  --  the sine qua non of appropriation ; so that , after having justified property by universal consent , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inequality of conditions by property . Never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma . Indeed , if , in the terms of the social compact , property has equality for its condition , at the moment when equality ceases to exist , the compact is broken and all property becomes usurpation . We gain nothing , then , by this pretended consent of mankind . % 3.  --  Prescription Gives No Title to Property . The right of property was the origin of evil on the earth , the first link in the long chain of crimes and misfortunes which the human race has endured since its birth . The delusion of prescription is the fatal charm thrown over the intellect , the death sentence breathed into the conscience , to arrest man 's progress towards truth , and bolster up the worship of error . The Code defines prescription thus : " The process of gaining and losing through the lapse of time . " In applying this definition to ideas and beliefs , we may use the word PRESCRIPTION to denote the everlasting prejudice in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often furious and bloody , with which new light has always been received , and which makes the sage a martyr . Not a principle , not a discovery , not a generous thought but has met , at its entrance into the world , with a formidable barrier of preconceived opinions , seeming like a conspiracy of all old prejudices . Prescriptions against reason , prescriptions against facts , prescriptions against every truth hitherto unknown ,  --  that is the sum and substance of the statu quo philosophy , the watchword of conservatives throughout the centuries . When the evangelical reform was broached to the world , there was prescription in favor of violence , debauchery , and selfishness ; when Galileo , Descartes , Pascal , and their disciples reconstructed philosophy and the sciences , there was prescription in favor of the Aristotelian philosophy ; when our fathers of ' 89 demanded liberty and equality , there was prescription in favor of tyranny and privilege . " There always have been proprietors and there always will be : " it is with this profound utterance , the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friends of social inequality hope to repel the attacks of their adversaries ; thinking undoubtedly that ideas , like property , can be lost by prescription . Enlightened to-day by the triumphal march of science , taught by the most glorious successes to question our own opinions , we receive with favor and applause the observer of Nature , who , by a thousand experiments based upon the most profound analysis , pursues a new principle , a law hitherto undiscovered . We take care to repel no idea , no fact , under the pretext that abler men than ourselves lived in former days , who did not notice the same phenomena , nor grasp the same analogies . Why do we not preserve a like attitude towards political and philosophical questions ? Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said , which means that we know all about mental and moral science ? Why is the proverb , THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN , applied exclusively to metaphysical investigations ? Because we still study philosophy with the imagination , instead of by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as judges , in the place of arguments and facts ,  --  it has been impossible to this day to distinguish the charlatan from the philosopher , the savant from the impostor . Since the days of Solomon and Pythagoras , imagination has been exhausted in guessing out social and psychological laws ; all systems have been proposed . Looked at in this light , it is probably true that EVERY THING HAS BEEN SAID ; but it is no less true that EVERY THING REMAINS TO BE PROVED . In politics ( to take only this branch of philosophy ) , in politics every one is governed in his choice of party by his passion and his interests ; the mind is submitted to the impositions of the will ,  --  there is no knowledge , there is not even a shadow of certainty . In this way , general ignorance produces general tyranny ; and while liberty of thought is written in the charter , slavery of thought , under the name of MAJORITY RULE , is decreed by the charter . In order to confine myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall refrain from beginning a discussion upon this worn-out objection brought forward by proprietors ; it would be too tiresome and declamatory . Everybody knows that there are rights which can not be prescribed ; and , as for those things which can be gained through the lapse of time , no one is ignorant of the fact that prescription requires certain conditions , the omission of one of which renders it null . If it is true , for example , that the proprietor 's possession has been CIVIL , PUBLIC , PEACEABLE , and UNINTERRUPTED , it is none the less true that it is not based on a just title ; since the only titles which it can show  --  occupation and labor  --  prove as much for the proletaire who demands , as for the proprietor who defends . Further , this possession is DISHONEST , since it is founded on a violation of right , which prevents prescription , according to the saying of St. Paul  --  Nunquam in usucapionibus juris error possessori prodest . The violation of right lies either in the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usufructuary ; or in the fact that he has purchased a thing which no one had a right to transfer or sell . Another reason why prescription can not be adduced in favor of property ( a reason borrowed from jurisprudence ) is that the right to possess real estate is a part of a universal right which has never been totally destroyed even at the most critical periods ; and the proletaire , in order to regain the power to exercise it fully , has only to prove that he has always exercised it in part . He , for example , who has the universal right to possess , give , exchange , loan , let , sell , transform , or destroy a thing , preserves the integrity of this right by the sole act of loaning , though he has never shown his authority in any other manner . Likewise we shall see that EQUALITY OF POSSESSIONS , EQUALITY OF RIGHTS , LIBERTY , WILL , PERSONALITY , are so many identical expressions of one and the same idea ,  --  the RIGHT OF PRESERVATION and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against which there can be no prescription until the human race has vanished from the face of the earth . Finally , as to the time required for prescription , it would be superfluous to show that the right of property in general can not be acquired by simple possession for ten , twenty , a hundred , a thousand , or one hundred thousand years ; and that , so long as there exists a human head capable of understanding and combating the right of property , this right will never be prescribed . For principles of jurisprudence and axioms of reason are different from accidental and contingent facts . One man 's possession can prescribe against another man 's possession ; but just as the possessor can not prescribe against himself , so reason has always the faculty of change and reformation . Past error is not binding on the future . Reason is always the same eternal force . The institution of property , the work of ignorant reason , may be abrogated by a more enlightened reason . Consequently , property can not be established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on it rests the maxim that in the matter of prescription a violation of right goes for nothing . But I should be recreant to my method , and the reader would have the right to accuse me of charlatanism and bad faith , if I had nothing further to advance concerning prescription . I showed , in the first place , that appropriation of land is illegal ; and that , supposing it to be legal , it must be accompanied by equality of property . I have shown , in the second place , that universal consent proves nothing in favor of property ; and that , if it proves any thing , it proves equality of property . I have yet to show that prescription , if admissible at all , presupposes equality of property . This demonstration will be neither long nor difficult . I need only to call attention to the reasons why prescription was introduced . " Prescription , " says Dunod , " seems repugnant to natural equity , which permits no one either to deprive another of his possessions without his knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . But as it might often happen , in the absence of prescription , that one who had honestly earned would be ousted after long possession ; and even that he who had received a thing from its rightful owner , or who had been legitimately relieved from all obligations , would , on losing his title , be liable to be dispossessed or subjected again ,  --  the public welfare demanded that a term should be fixed , after the expiration of which no one should be allowed to disturb actual possessors , or reassert rights too long neglected .... The civil law , in regulating prescription , has aimed , then , only to perfect natural law , and to supplement the law of nations ; and as it is founded on the public good , which should always be considered before individual welfare ,  --  bono publico usucapio introducta est ,  --  it should be regarded with favor , provided the conditions required by the law are fulfilled . " Toullier , in his " Civil Law , " says : " In order that the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby injure the public welfare , disturbing the peace of families and the stability of social transactions , the law has fixed a time when all claims shall be cancelled , and possession shall regain its ancient prerogative through its transformation into property . " Cassiodorus said of property , that it was the only safe harbor in which to seek shelter from the tempests of chicanery and the gales of avarice  --  Hic unus inter humanas pro cellas portus , quem si homines fervida voluntate praeterierint ; in undosis semper jurgiis errabunt . Thus , in the opinion of the authors , prescription is a means of preserving public order ; a restoration in certain cases of the original mode of acquiring property ; a fiction of the civil law which derives all its force from the necessity of settling differences which otherwise would never end . For , as Grotius says , time has no power to produce effects ; all things happen in time , but nothing is done by time . Prescription , or the right of acquisition through the lapse of time , is , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all property necessarily originated in prescription , or , as the Latins say , in usucapion ; that is , in continued possession . I ask , then , in the first place , how possession can become property by the lapse of time ? Continue possession as long as you wish , continue it for years and for centuries , you never can give duration  --  which of itself creates nothing , changes nothing , modifies nothing  --  the power to change the usufructuary into a proprietor . Let the civil law secure against chance-comers the honest possessor who has held his position for many years ,  --  that only confirms a right already respected ; and prescription , applied in this way , simply means that possession which has continued for twenty , thirty , or a hundred years shall be retained by the occupant . But when the law declares that the lapse of time changes possessor into proprietor , it supposes that a right can be created without a producing cause ; it unwarrantably alters the character of the subject ; it legislates on a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Public order and private security ask only that possession shall be protected . Why has the law created property ? Prescription was simply security for the future ; why has the law made it a matter of privilege ? Thus the origin of prescription is identical with that of property itself ; and since the latter can legitimate itself only when accompanied by equality , prescription is but another of the thousand forms which the necessity of maintaining this precious equality has taken . And this is no vain induction , no far-fetched inference . The proof is written in all the codes . And , indeed , if all nations , through their instinct of justice and their conservative nature , have recognized the utility and the necessity of prescription ; and if their design has been to guard thereby the interests of the possessor ,  --  could they not do something for the absent citizen , separated from his family and his country by commerce , war , or captivity , and in no position to exercise his right of possession ? No . Also , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was admitted that property is preserved by intent alone ,  --  nudo animo . Now , if property is preserved by intent alone , if it can be lost only by the action of the proprietor , what can be the use of prescription ? How does the law dare to presume that the proprietor , who preserves by intent alone , intended to abandon that which he has allowed to be prescribed ? What lapse of time can warrant such a conjecture ; and by what right does the law punish the absence of the proprietor by depriving him of his goods ? What then ! we found but a moment since that prescription and property were identical ; and now we find that they are mutually destructive ! Grotius , who perceived this difficulty , replied so singularly that his words deserve to be quoted : Bene sperandum de hominibus , ac propterea non putandum eos hoc esse animo ut , rei caducae causa , hominem alterum velint in perpetuo peccato versari , quo d evitari saepe non poterit sine tali derelictione . " Where is the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul that , for a trifle , he would perpetuate the trespass of a possessor , which would inevitably be the result if he did not consent to abandon his right ? " By the Eternal ! I am that man . Though a million proprietors should burn for it in hell , I lay the blame on them for depriving me of my portion of this world 's goods . To this powerful consideration Grotius rejoins , that it is better to abandon a disputed right than to go to law , disturb the peace of nations , and stir up the flames of civil war . I accept , if you wish it , this argument , provided you indemnify me . But if this indemnity is refused me , what do I , a proletaire , care for the tranquillity and security of the rich ? I care as little for PUBLIC ORDER as for the proprietor 's safety . I ask to live a laborer ; otherwise I will die a warrior . Whichever way we turn , we shall come to the conclusion that prescription is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property are two forms of the same principle , but two forms which serve to correct each other ; and ancient and modern jurisprudence did not make the least of its blunders in pretending to reconcile them . Indeed , if we see in the institution of property only a desire to secure to each individual his share of the soil and his right to labor ; in the distinction between naked property and possession only an asylum for absentees , orphans , and all who do not know , or can not maintain , their rights ; in prescription only a means , either of defence against unjust pretensions and encroachments , or of settlement of the differences caused by the removal of possessors ,  --  we shall recognize in these various forms of human justice the spontaneous efforts of the mind to come to the aid of the social instinct ; we shall see in this protection of all rights the sentiment of equality , a constant levelling tendency . And , looking deeper , we shall find in the very exaggeration of these principles the confirmation of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association are not soon realized , it will be owing to the obstacle thrown for the time in the way of the common sense of the people by the stupidity of legislators and judges ; and also to the fact that , while society in its original state was illuminated with a flash of truth , the early speculations of its leaders could bring forth nothing but darkness . After the first covenants , after the first draughts of laws and constitutions , which were the expression of man 's primary needs , the legislator 's duty was to reform the errors of legislation ; to complete that which was defective ; to harmonize , by superior definitions , those things which seemed to conflict . Instead of that , they halted at the literal meaning of the laws , content to play the subordinate part of commentators and scholiasts . Taking the inspirations of the human mind , at that time necessarily weak and faulty , for axioms of eternal and unquestionable truth ,  --  influenced by public opinion , enslaved by the popular religion ,  --  they have invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the theologians ) that that is infallibly true which has been admitted by all persons , in all places , and at all times  --  quod ab omnibus , quod ubique , quod semper ; as if a general but spontaneous opinion was any thing more than an indication of the truth . Let us not be deceived : the opinion of all nations may serve to authenticate the perception of a fact , the vague sentiment of a law ; it can teach us nothing about either fact or law . The consent of mankind is an indication of Nature ; not , as Cicero says , a law of Nature . Under the indication is hidden the truth , which faith can believe , but only thought can know . Such has been the constant progress of the human mind in regard to physical phenomena and the creations of genius : how can it be otherwise with the facts of conscience and the rules of human conduct ? % 4.  --  Labor  --  That Labor Has No Inherent Power to Appropriate Natural Wealth . We shall show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , by the authorities recognized by property ,  --  1 . That labor has no inherent power to appropriate natural wealth . 2 . That , if we admit that labor has this power , we are led directly to equality of property ,  --  whatever the kind of labor , however scarce the product , or unequal the ability of the laborers. 3 . That , in the order of justice , labor DESTROYS property . Following the example of our opponents , and that we may leave no obstacles in the path , let us examine the question in the strongest possible light . M. Ch . Comte says , in his " Treatise on Property : "  --  " France , considered as a nation , has a territory which is her own . " France , as an individuality , possesses a territory which she cultivates ; it is not her property . Nations are related to each other as individuals are : they are commoners and workers ; it is an abuse of language to call them proprietors . The right of use and abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time will come when a war waged for the purpose of checking a nation in its abuse of the soil will be regarded as a holy war . Thus , M. Ch . Comte  --  who undertakes to explain how property comes into existence , and who starts with the supposition that a nation is a proprietor  --  falls into that error known as BEGGING THE QUESTION ; a mistake which vitiates his whole argument . If the reader thinks it is pushing logic too far to question a nation 's right of property in the territory which it possesses , I will simply remind him of the fact that at all ages the results of the fictitious right of national property have been pretensions to suzerainty , tributes , monarchical privileges , statute-labor , quotas of men and money , supplies of merchandise , &c.; ending finally in refusals to pay taxes , insurrections , wars , and depopulations . " Scattered through this territory are extended tracts of land , which have not been converted into individual property . These lands , which consist mainly of forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which receives the revenues , uses or ought to use them in the interest of all . " OUGHT TO USE is well said : a lie is avoided thereby . " Let them be offered for sale .... " Why offered for sale ? Who has a right to sell them ? Even were the nation proprietor , can the generation of to-day dispossess the generation of to-morrow ? The nation , in its function of usufructuary , possesses them ; the government rules , superintends , and protects them . If it also granted lands , it could grant only their use ; it has no right to sell them or transfer them in any way whatever . Not being a proprietor , how can it transmit property ? " Suppose some industrious man buys a portion , a large swamp for example . This would be no usurpation , since the public would receive the exact value through the hands of the government , and would be as rich after the sale as before . " How ridiculous ! What ! because a prodigal , imprudent , incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ward of the State ,  --  I who have neither an advisory nor a deliberative voice in the State councils ,  --  while I am allowed to make no opposition to the sale , this sale is right and legal ! The guardians of the nation waste its substance , and it has no redress ! I have received , you tell me , through the hands of the government my share of the proceeds of the sale : but , in the first place , I did not wish to sell ; and , had I wished to , I could not have sold . I had not the right . And then I do not see that I am benefited by the sale . My guardians have dressed up some soldiers , repaired an old fortress , erected in their pride some costly but worthless monument ,  --  then they have exploded some fireworks and set up a greased pole ! What does all that amount to in comparison with my loss ? The purchaser draws boundaries , fences himself in , and says , " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Here , then , is a piece of land upon which , henceforth , no one has a right to step , save the proprietor and his friends ; which can benefit nobody , save the proprietor and his servants . Let these sales multiply , and soon the people  --  who have been neither able nor willing to sell , and who have received none of the proceeds of the sale  --  will have nowhere to rest , no place of shelter , no ground to till . They will die of hunger at the proprietor 's door , on the edge of that property which was their birthright ; and the proprietor , watching them die , will exclaim , " So perish idlers and vagrants ! " To reconcile us to the proprietor 's usurpation , M. Ch . Comte assumes the lands to be of little value at the time of sale . " The importance of these usurpations should not be exaggerated : they should be measured by the number of men which the occupied land would support , and by the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , that if a piece of land which is worth to-day one thousand francs was worth only five centimes when it was usurped , we really lose only the value of five centimes . A square league of earth would be hardly sufficient to support a savage in distress ; to-day it supplies one thousand persons with the means of existence . Nine hundred and ninety-nine parts of this land is the legitimate property of the possessors ; only one-thousandth of the value has been usurped . " A peasant admitted one day , at confession , that he had destroyed a document which declared him a debtor to the amount of three hundred francs . Said the father confessor , " You must return these three hundred francs . " " No , " replied the peasant , " I will return a penny to pay for the paper . " M. Ch . Comte 's logic resembles this peasant 's honesty . The soil has not only an integrant and actual value , it has also a potential value ,  --  a value of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , and to employ it in our work . Destroy a bill of exchange , a promissory note , an annuity deed ,  --  as a paper you destroy almost no value at all ; but with this paper you destroy your title , and , in losing your title , you deprive yourself of your goods . Destroy the land , or , what is the same thing , sell it ,  --  you not only transfer one , two , or several crops , but you annihilate all the products that you could derive from it ; you and your children and your children 's children . When M. Ch . Comte , the apostle of property and the eulogist of labor , supposes an alienation of the soil on the part of the government , we must not think that he does so without reason and for no purpose ; it is a necessary part of his position . As he rejected the theory of occupancy , and as he knew , moreover , that labor could not constitute the right in the absence of a previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission with the authority of the government , which means that property is based upon the sovereignty of the people ; in other words , upon universal consent . This theory we have already considered . To say that property is the daughter of labor , and then to give labor material on which to exercise itself , is , if I am not mistaken , to reason in a circle . Contradictions will result from it . " A piece of land of a certain size produces food enough to supply a man for one day . If the possessor , through his labor , discovers some method of making it produce enough for two days , he doubles its value . This new value is his work , his creation : it is taken from nobody ; it is his property . " I maintain that the possessor is paid for his trouble and industry in his doubled crop , but that he acquires no right to the land . " Let the laborer have the fruits of his labor . " Very good ; but I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw material . Does the skill of the fisherman , who on the same coast can catch more fish than his fellows , make him proprietor of the fishing-grounds ? Can the expertness of a hunter ever be regarded as a property-title to a game-forest ? The analogy is perfect ,  --  the industrious cultivator finds the reward of his industry in the abundancy and superiority of his crop . If he has made improvements in the soil , he has the possessor 's right of preference . Never , under any circumstances , can he be allowed to claim a property-title to the soil which he cultivates , on the ground of his skill as a cultivator . To change possession into property , something is needed besides labor , without which a man would cease to be proprietor as soon as he ceased to be a laborer . Now , the law bases property upon immemorial , unquestionable possession ; that is , prescription . Labor is only the sensible sign , the physical act , by which occupation is manifested . If , then , the cultivator remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his possession , first conceded , then tolerated , finally becomes inalienable ,  --  it happens by permission of the civil law , and by virtue of the principle of occupancy . So true is this , that there is not a bill of sale , not a farm lease , not an annuity , but implies it . I will quote only one example . How do we measure the value of land ? By its product . If a piece of land yields one thousand francs , we say that at five per cent . it is worth twenty thousand francs ; at four per cent . twenty-five thousand francs , &c.; which means , in other words , that in twenty or twenty-five years ' time the purchaser would recover in full the amount originally paid for the land . If , then , after a certain length of time , the price of a piece of land has been wholly recovered , why does the purchaser continue to be proprietor ? Because of the right of occupancy , in the absence of which every sale would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , then , a contradiction of the Code ; and when the partisans of this theory pretend to explain the laws thereby , they contradict themselves . " If men succeed in fertilizing land hitherto unproductive , or even death-producing , like certain swamps , they create thereby property in all its completeness . " What good does it do to magnify an expression , and play with equivocations , as if we expected to change the reality thereby ? THEY CREATE PROPERTY IN ALL ITS COMPLETENESS . You mean that they create a productive capacity which formerly did not exist ; but this capacity can not be created without material to support it . The substance of the soil remains the same ; only its qualities and modifications are changed . Man has created every thing  --  every thing save the material itself . Now , I maintain that this material he can only possess and use , on condition of permanent labor ,  --  granting , for the time being , his right of property in things which he has produced . This , then , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant so much , does not carry with it property in the means of production ; that seems to me to need no further demonstration . There is no difference between the soldier who possesses his arms , the mason who possesses the materials committed to his care , the fisherman who possesses the water , the hunter who possesses the fields and forests , and the cultivator who possesses the lands : all , if you say so , are proprietors of their products  --  not one is proprietor of the means of production . The right to product is exclusive  --  jus in re ; the right to means is common  --  jus ad rem . % 5.  --  That Labor leads to Equality of Property . Admit , however , that labor gives a right of property in material . Why is not this principle universal ? Why is the benefit of this pretended law confined to a few and denied to the mass of laborers ? A philosopher , arguing that all animals sprang up formerly out of the earth warmed by the rays of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth no longer yielded crops of that nature , replied : " Because it is old , and has lost its fertility . " Has labor , once so fecund , likewise become sterile ? Why does the tenant no longer acquire through his labor the land which was formerly acquired by the labor of the proprietor ? " Because , " they say , " it is already appropriated . " That is no answer . A farm yields fifty bushels per hectare ; the skill and labor of the tenant double this product : the increase is created by the tenant . Suppose the owner , in a spirit of moderation rarely met with , does not go to the extent of absorbing this product by raising the rent , but allows the cultivator to enjoy the results of his labor ; even then justice is not satisfied . The tenant , by improving the land , has imparted a new value to the property ; he , therefore , has a right to a part of the property . If the farm was originally worth one hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its value has risen to one hundred and fifty thousand francs , the tenant , who produced this extra value , is the legitimate proprietor of one-third of the farm . M. Ch . Comte could not have pronounced this doctrine false , for it was he who said :  --  " Men who increase the fertility of the earth are no less useful to their fellow-men , than if they should create new land . " Why , then , is not this rule applicable to the man who improves the land , as well as to him who clears it ? The labor of the former makes the land worth one ; that of the latter makes it worth two : both create equal values . Why not accord to both equal property ? I defy any one to refute this argument , without again falling back on the right of first occupancy . " But , " it will be said , " even if your wish should be granted , property would not be distributed much more evenly than now . Land does not go on increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it attains its maximum fertility . That which is added by the agricultural art results rather from the progress of science and the diffusion of knowledge , than from the skill of the cultivator . Consequently , the addition of a few laborers to the mass of proprietors would be no argument against property . " This discussion would , indeed , prove a well-nigh useless one , if our labors culminated in simply extending land-privilege and industrial monopoly ; in emancipating only a few hundred laborers out of the millions of proletaires . But this also is a misconception of our real thought , and does but prove the general lack of intelligence and logic . If the laborer , who adds to the value of a thing , has a right of property in it , he who maintains this value acquires the same right . For what is maintenance ? It is incessant addition ,  --  continuous creation . What is it to cultivate ? It is to give the soil its value every year ; it is , by annually renewed creation , to prevent the diminution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admitting , then , that property is rational and legitimate ,  --  admitting that rent is equitable and just ,  --  I say that he who cultivates acquires property by as good a title as he who clears , or he who improves ; and that every time a tenant pays his rent , he obtains a fraction of property in the land entrusted to his care , the denominator of which is equal to the proportion of rent paid . Unless you admit this , you fall into absolutism and tyranny ; you recognize class privileges ; you sanction slavery . Whoever labors becomes a proprietor  --  this is an inevitable deduction from the acknowledged principles of political economy and jurisprudence . And when I say proprietor , I do not mean simply ( as do our hypocritical economists ) proprietor of his allowance , his salary , his wages ,  --  I mean proprietor of the value which he creates , and by which the master alone profits . As all this relates to the theory of wages and of the distribution of products ,  --  and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I ask permission to insist on it : this discussion will not be useless to the work in hand . Many persons talk of admitting working-people to a share in the products and profits ; but in their minds this participation is pure benevolence : they have never shown  --  perhaps never suspected  --  that it was a natural , necessary right , inherent in labor , and inseparable from the function of producer , even in the lowest forms of his work . This is my proposition : THE LABORER RETAINS , EVEN AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED HIS WAGES , A NATURAL RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN THE THING WHICH HE HAS PRODUCED . I again quote M. Ch . Comte :  --  " Some laborers are employed in draining marshes , in cutting down trees and brushwood ,  --  in a word , in cleaning up the soil . They increase the value , they make the amount of property larger ; they are paid for the value which they add in the form of food and daily wages : it then becomes the property of the capitalist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers has created a value ; now this value is their property . But they have neither sold nor exchanged it ; and you , capitalist , you have not earned it . That you should have a partial right to the whole , in return for the materials that you have furnished and the provisions that you have supplied , is perfectly just . You contributed to the production , you ought to share in the enjoyment . But your right does not annihilate that of the laborers , who , in spite of you , have been your colleagues in the work of production . Why do you talk of wages ? The money with which you pay the wages of the laborers remunerates them for only a few years of the perpetual possession which they have abandoned to you . Wages is the cost of the daily maintenance and refreshment of the laborer . You are wrong in calling it the price of a sale . The workingman has sold nothing ; he knows neither his right , nor the extent of the concession which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you pretend to have made with him . On his side , utter ignorance ; on yours , error and surprise , not to say deceit and fraud . Let us make this clearer by another and more striking example . No one is ignorant of the difficulties that are met with in the conversion of untilled land into arable and productive land . These difficulties are so great , that usually an isolated man would perish before he could put the soil in a condition to yield him even the most meagre living . To that end are needed the united and combined efforts of society , and all the resources of industry . M. Ch . Comte quotes on this subject numerous and well-authenticated facts , little thinking that he is amassing testimony against his own system . Let us suppose that a colony of twenty or thirty families establishes itself in a wild district , covered with underbrush and forests ; and from which , by agreement , the natives consent to withdraw . Each one of these families possesses a moderate but sufficient amount of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to choose ,  --  animals , seeds , tools , and a little money and food . The land having been divided , each one settles himself as comfortably as possible , and begins to clear away the portion allotted to him . But after a few weeks of fatigue , such as they never before have known , of inconceivable suffering , of ruinous and almost useless labor , our colonists begin to complain of their trade ; their condition seems hard to them ; they curse their sad existence . Suddenly , one of the shrewdest among them kills a pig , cures a part of the meat ; and , resolved to sacrifice the rest of his provisions , goes to find his companions in misery . " Friends , " he begins in a very benevolent tone , " how much trouble it costs you to do a little work and live uncomfortably ! A fortnight of labor has reduced you to your last extremity ! ... Let us make an arrangement by which you shall all profit . I offer you provisions and wine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together , and , zounds ! my friends , we will be happy and contented ! " Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation ? The hungriest of them follow the treacherous tempter . They go to work ; the charm of society , emulation , joy , and mutual assistance double their strength ; the work can be seen to advance . Singing and laughing , they subdue Nature . In a short time , the soil is thoroughly changed ; the mellowed earth waits only for the seed . That done , the proprietor pays his laborers , who , on going away , return him their thanks , and grieve that the happy days which they have spent with him are over . Others follow this example , always with the same success . Then , these installed , the rest disperse ,  --  each one returns to his grubbing . But , while grubbing , it is necessary to live . While they have been clearing away for their neighbor , they have done no clearing for themselves . One year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated that in lending their labor they could not but gain , since they would save their own provisions ; and , while living better , would get still more money . False calculation ! they have created for another the means wherewith to produce , and have created nothing for themselves . The difficulties of clearing remain the same ; their clothing wears out , their provisions give out ; soon their purse becomes empty for the profit of the individual for whom they have worked , and who alone can furnish the provisions which they need , since he alone is in a position to produce them . Then , when the poor grubber has exhausted his resources , the man with the provisions ( like the wolf in the fable , who scents his victim from afar ) again comes forward . One he offers to employ again by the day ; from another he offers to buy at a favorable price a piece of his bad land , which is not , and never can be , of any use to him : that is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another for his own benefit . So that at the end of twenty years , of thirty individuals originally equal in point of wealth , five or six have become proprietors of the whole district , while the rest have been philanthropically dispossessed ! In this century of bourgeoisie morality , in which I have had the honor to be born , the moral sense is so debased that I should not be at all surprised if I were asked , by many a worthy proprietor , what I see in this that is unjust and illegitimate ? Debased creature ! galvanized corpse ! how can I expect to convince you , if you can not tell robbery when I show it to you ? A man , by soft and insinuating words , discovers the secret of taxing others that he may establish himself ; then , once enriched by their united efforts , he refuses , on the very conditions which he himself dictated , to advance the well-being of those who made his fortune for him : and you ask how such conduct is fraudulent ! Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owes them nothing more , that he has nothing to gain by putting himself at the service of others , while his own occupations claim his attention ,  --  he refuses , I say , to aid others in getting a foothold , as he was aided in getting his own ; and when , in the impotence of their isolation , these poor laborers are compelled to sell their birthright , he  --  this ungrateful proprietor , this knavish upstart  --  stands ready to put the finishing touch to their deprivation and their ruin . And you think that just ? Take care ! I read in your startled countenance the reproach of a guilty conscience , much more clearly than the innocent astonishment of involuntary ignorance . " The capitalist , " they say , " has paid the laborers their DAILY WAGES . " To be accurate , it must be said that the capitalist has paid as many times one day 's wage as he has employed laborers each day ,  --  which is not at all the same thing . For he has paid nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony of laborers , and the convergence and simultaneousness of their efforts . Two hundred grenadiers stood the obelisk of Luxor upon its base in a few hours ; do you suppose that one man could have accomplished the same task in two hundred days ? Nevertheless , on the books of the capitalist , the amount of wages paid would have been the same . Well , a desert to prepare for cultivation , a house to build , a factory to run ,  --  all these are obelisks to erect , mountains to move . The smallest fortune , the most insignificant establishment , the setting in motion of the lowest industry , demand the concurrence of so many different kinds of labor and skill , that one man could not possibly execute the whole of them . It is astonishing that the economists never have called attention to this fact . Strike a balance , then , between the capitalist 's receipts and his payments . The laborer needs a salary which will enable him to live while he works ; for unless he consumes , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support , or wages enough to procure the same . That is the first thing to be done in all production . I admit , for the moment , that in this respect the capitalist has discharged his duty . It is necessary that the laborer should find in his production , in addition to his present support , a guarantee of his future support ; otherwise the source of production would dry up , and his productive capacity would become exhausted : in other words , the labor accomplished must give birth perpetually to new labor  --  such is the universal law of reproduction . In this way , the proprietor of a farm finds : 1 . In his crops , means , not only of supporting himself and his family , but of maintaining and improving his capital , of feeding his live-stock  --  in a word , means of new labor and continual reproduction ; 2 . In his ownership of a productive agency , a permanent basis of cultivation and labor . But he who lends his services ,  --  what is his basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unwarranted supposition that he wishes to employ him . Just as the commoner once held his land by the munificence and condescension of the lord , so to-day the working-man holds his labor by the condescension and necessities of the master and proprietor : that is what is called possession by a precarious 15 title . But this precarious condition is an injustice , for it implies an inequality in the bargain . The laborer 's wages exceed but little his running expenses , and do not assure him wages for to-morrow ; while the capitalist finds in the instrument produced by the laborer a pledge of independence and security for the future . Now , this reproductive leaven  --  this eternal germ of life , this preparation of the land and manufacture of implements for production  --  constitutes the debt of the capitalist to the producer , which he never pays ; and it is this fraudulent denial which causes the poverty of the laborer , the luxury of idleness , and the inequality of conditions . This it is , above all other things , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of three things must be done . Either the laborer must be given a portion of the product in addition to his wages ; or the employer must render the laborer an equivalent in productive service ; or else he must pledge himself to employ him for ever . Division of the product , reciprocity of service , or guarantee of perpetual labor ,  --  from the adoption of one of these courses the capitalist can not escape . But it is evident that he can not satisfy the second and third of these conditions  --  he can neither put himself at the service of the thousands of working-men , who , directly or indirectly , have aided him in establishing himself , nor employ them all for ever . He has no other course left him , then , but a division of the property . But if the property is divided , all conditions will be equal  --  there will be no more large capitalists or large proprietors . Consequently , when M. Ch . Comte  --  following out his hypothesis  --  shows us his capitalist acquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sinks deeper and deeper into the mire ; and , as his argument does not change , our reply of course remains the same . " Other laborers are employed in building : some quarry the stone , others transport it , others cut it , and still others put it in place . Each of them adds a certain value to the material which passes through his hands ; and this value , the product of his labor , is his property . He sells it , as fast as he creates it , to the proprietor of the building , who pays him for it in food and wages . " Divide et impera  --  divide , and you shall command ; divide , and you shall grow rich ; divide , and you shall deceive men , you shall daze their minds , you shall mock at justice ! Separate laborers from each other , perhaps each one 's daily wage exceeds the value of each individual 's product ; but that is not the question under consideration . A force of one thousand men working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be paid for working fifty-five years ; but this force of one thousand has done in twenty days what a single man could not have accomplished , though he had labored for a million centuries . Is the exchange an equitable one ? Once more , no ; when you have paid all the individual forces , the collective force still remains to be paid . Consequently , there remains always a right of collective property which you have not acquired , and which you enjoy unjustly . Admit that twenty days ' wages suffice to feed , lodge , and clothe this multitude for twenty days : thrown out of employment at the end of that time , what will become of them , if , as fast as they create , they abandon their creations to the proprietors who will soon discharge them ? While the proprietor , firm in his position ( thanks to the aid of all the laborers ) , dwells in security , and fears no lack of labor or bread , the laborer 's only dependence is upon the benevolence of this same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . If , then , the proprietor , shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights , refuses to employ the laborer , how can the laborer live ? He has ploughed an excellent field , and can not sow it ; he has built an elegant and commodious house , and can not live in it ; he has produced all , and can enjoy nothing . Labor leads us to equality . Every step that we take brings us nearer to it ; and if laborers had equal strength , diligence , and industry , clearly their fortunes would be equal also . Indeed , if , as is pretended ,  --  and as we have admitted ,  --  the laborer is proprietor of the value which he creates , it follows :  --  1 . That the laborer acquires at the expense of the idle proprietor ; 2 . That all production being necessarily collective , the laborer is entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his labor ; 3 . That all accumulated capital being social property , no one can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone would suffice to revolutionize our whole economical system , and change our institutions and our laws . Why do the very persons , who laid down this principle , now refuse to be guided by it ? Why do the Says , the Comtes , the Hennequins , and others  --  after having said that property is born of labor  --  seek to fix it by occupation and prescription ? But let us leave these sophists to their contradictions and blindness . The good sense of the people will do justice to their equivocations . Let us make haste to enlighten it , and show it the true path . Equality approaches ; already between it and us but a short distance intervenes : to-morrow even this distance will have been traversed. % 6.  --  That in Society all Wages are Equal . When the St. Simonians , the Fourierists , and , in general , all who in our day are connected with social economy and reform , inscribe upon their banner ,  --  " TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPACITY , TO EACH CAPACITY ACCORDING TO ITS RESULTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO HIS CAPITAL , HIS LABOR , AND HIS SKILL " ( Fourier ) ,  --  they mean  --  although they do not say so in so many words  --  that the products of Nature procured by labor and industry are a reward , a palm , a crown offered to all kinds of preeminence and superiority . They regard the land as an immense arena in which prizes are contended for ,  --  no longer , it is true , with lances and swords , by force and by treachery ; but by acquired wealth , by knowledge , talent , and by virtue itself . In a word , they mean  --  and everybody agrees with them  --  that the greatest capacity is entitled to the greatest reward ; and , to use the mercantile phraseology ,  --  which has , at least , the merit of being straightforward ,  --  that salaries must be governed by capacity and its results . The disciples of these two self-styled reformers can not deny that such is their thought ; for , in doing so , they would contradict their official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , such a denial on their part is not to be feared . The two sects glory in laying down as a principle inequality of conditions ,  --  reasoning from Nature , who , they say , intended the inequality of capacities . They boast only of one thing ; namely , that their political system is so perfect , that the social inequalities always correspond with the natural inequalities . They no more trouble themselves to inquire whether inequality of conditions  --  I mean of salaries  --  is possible , than they do to fix a measure of capacity. 1 1 In St. Simon 's system , the St.-Simonian priest determines the capacity of each by virtue of his pontifical infallibility , in imitation of the Roman Church : in Fourier 's , the ranks and merits are decided by vote , in imitation of the constitutional regime . Clearly , the great man is an object of ridicule to the reader ; he did not mean to tell his secret . " To each according to his capacity , to each capacity according to its results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , and his skill . " Since the death of St. Simon and Fourier , not one among their numerous disciples has attempted to give to the public a scientific demonstration of this grand maxim ; and I would wager a hundred to one that no Fourierist even suspects that this biform aphorism is susceptible of two interpretations . " To each according to his capacity , to each capacity according to its results . " " To each according to his capital , his labor , and his skill . " This proposition , taken , as they say , in sensu obvio  --  in the sense usually attributed to it  --  is false , absurd , unjust , contradictory , hostile to liberty , friendly to tyranny , anti-social , and was unluckily framed under the express influence of the property idea . And , first , CAPITAL must be crossed off the list of elements which are entitled to a reward . The Fourierists  --  as far as I have been able to learn from a few of their pamphlets  --  deny the right of occupancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a like premise , they would have seen  --  had they reasoned upon the matter  --  that capital is a source of production to its proprietor only by virtue of the right of occupancy , and that this production is therefore illegitimate . Indeed , if labor is the sole basis of property , I cease to be proprietor of my field as soon as I receive rent for it from another . This we have shown beyond all cavil . It is the same with all capital ; so that to put capital in an enterprise , is , by the law 's decision , to exchange it for an equivalent sum in products . I will not enter again upon this now useless discussion , since I propose , in the following chapter , to exhaust the subject of PRODUCTION BY CAPITAL . Thus , capital can be exchanged , but can not be a source of income . LABOR and SKILL remain ; or , as St. Simon puts it , RESULTS and CAPACITIES . I will examine them successively . Should wages be governed by labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does the most should get the most ? I beg the reader to pay the closest attention to this point . To solve the problem with one stroke , we have only to ask ourselves the following question : " Is labor a CONDITION or a STRUGGLE ? " The reply seems plain . God said to man , " In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , "  --  that is , thou shalt produce thy own bread : with more or less ease , according to thy skill in directing and combining thy efforts , thou shalt labor . God did not say , " Thou shalt quarrel with thy neighbor for thy bread ; " but , " Thou shalt labor by the side of thy neighbor , and ye shall dwell together in harmony . " Let us develop the meaning of this law , the extreme simplicity of which renders it liable to misconstruction . In labor , two things must be noticed and distinguished : ASSOCIATION and AVAILABLE MATERIAL . In so far as laborers are associated , they are equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be paid more than another . For , as the product of one laborer can be paid for only in the product of another laborer , if the two products are unequal , the remainder  --  or the difference between the greater and the smaller  --  will not be acquired by society ; and , therefore , not being exchanged , will not affect the equality of wages . There will result , it is true , in favor of the stronger laborer a natural inequality , but not a social inequality ; no one having suffered by his strength and productive energy . In a word , society exchanges only equal products  --  that is , rewards no labor save that performed for her benefit ; consequently , she pays all laborers equally : with what they produce outside of her sphere she has no more to do , than with the difference in their voices and their hair . I seem to be positing the principle of inequality : the reverse of this is the truth . The total amount of labor which can be performed for society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being , within a given space , as much greater as the laborers are more numerous , and as the task assigned to each is less in magnitude ,  --  it follows that natural inequality neutralizes itself in proportion as association extends , and as the quantity of consumable values produced thereby increases . So that in society the only thing which could bring back the inequality of labor would be the right of occupancy ,  --  the right of property . Now , suppose that this daily social task consists in the ploughing , hoeing , or reaping of two square decameters , and that the average time required to accomplish it is seven hours : one laborer will finish it in six hours , another will require eight ; the majority , however , will work seven . But provided each one furnishes the quantity of labor demanded of him , whatever be the time he employs , they are entitled to equal wages . Shall the laborer who is capable of finishing his task in six hours have the right , on the ground of superior strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilful laborer , and thus rob him of his labor and bread ? Who dares maintain such a proposition ? He who finishes before the others may rest , if he chooses ; he may devote himself to useful exercise and labors for the maintenance of his strength , and the culture of his mind , and the pleasure of his life . This he can do without injury to any one : but let him confine himself to services which affect him solely . Vigor , genius , diligence , and all the personal advantages which result therefrom , are the work of Nature and , to a certain extent , of the individual ; society awards them the esteem which they merit : but the wages which it pays them is measured , not by their power , but by their production . Now , the product of each is limited by the right of all . If the soil were infinite in extent , and the amount of available material were exhaustless , even then we could not accept this maxim ,  --  TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever be the number of its subjects , is forced to pay them all the same wages , since she pays them only in their own products . Only , on the hypothesis just made , inasmuch as the strong can not be prevented from using all their advantages , the inconveniences of natural inequality would reappear in the very bosom of social equality . But the land , considering the productive power of its inhabitants and their ability to multiply , is very limited ; further , by the immense variety of products and the extreme division of labor , the social task is made easy of accomplishment . Now , through this limitation of things producible , and through the ease of producing them , the law of absolute equality takes effect . Yes , life is a struggle . But this struggle is not between man and man  --  it is between man and Nature ; and it is each one 's duty to take his share in it . If , in the struggle , the strong come to the aid of the weak , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accepted as a free gift ,  --  not imposed by force , nor offered at a price . All have the same career before them , neither too long nor too difficult ; whoever finishes it finds his reward at the end : it is not necessary to get there first . In printing-offices , where the laborers usually work by the job , the compositor receives so much per thousand letters set ; the pressman so much per thousand sheets printed . There , as elsewhere , inequalities of talent and skill are to be found . When there is no prospect of dull times ( for printing and typesetting , like all other trades , sometimes come to a stand-still ) , every one is free to work his hardest , and exert his faculties to the utmost : he who does more gets more ; he who does less gets less . When business slackens , compositors and pressmen divide up their labor ; all monopolists are detested as no better than robbers or traitors . There is a philosophy in the action of these printers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If our legislators had introduced into their codes the principle of distributive justice which governs printing-offices ; if they had observed the popular instincts ,  --  not for the sake of servile imitation , but in order to reform and generalize them ,  --  long ere this liberty and equality would have been established on an immovable basis , and we should not now be disputing about the right of property and the necessity of social distinctions . It has been calculated that if labor were equally shared by the whole number of able-bodied individuals , the average working-day of each individual , in France , would not exceed five hours . This being so , how can we presume to talk of the inequality of laborers ? It is the LABOR of Robert Macaire that causes inequality . The principle , TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS LABOR , interpreted to mean , WHO WORKS MOST SHOULD RECEIVE MOST , is based , therefore , on two palpable errors : one , an error in economy , that in the labor of society tasks must necessarily be unequal ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit to the amount of producible things . " But , " it will be said , " suppose there are some people who wish to perform only half of their task ? " ... Is that very embarrassing ? Probably they are satisfied with half of their salary . Paid according to the labor that they had performed , of what could they complain ? and what injury would they do to others ? In this sense , it is fair to apply the maxim ,  --  TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS RESULTS . It is the law of equality itself . Further , numerous difficulties , relative to the police system and the organization of industry , might be raised here . I will reply to them all with this one sentence ,  --  that they must all be solved by the principle of equality . Thus , some one might observe , " Here is a task which can not be postponed without detriment to production . Ought society to suffer from the negligence of a few ? and will she not venture  --  out of respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands the product which they refuse her ? In such a case , to whom will the salary belong ? " To society ; who will be allowed to perform the labor , either herself , or through her representatives , but always in such a way that the general equality shall never be violated , and that only the idler shall be punished for his idleness . Further , if society may not use excessive severity towards her lazy members , she has a right , in self-defence , to guard against abuses . But every industry needs  --  they will add  --  leaders , instructors , superintendents , &c.; Will these be engaged in the general task ? No ; since their task is to lead , instruct , and superintend . But they must be chosen from the laborers by the laborers themselves , and must fulfil the conditions of eligibility . It is the same with all public functions , whether of administration or instruction . Then , article first of the universal constitution will be :  --  " The limited quantity of available material proves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers . The capacity , given to all , of accomplishing a social task ,  --  that is , an equal task ,  --  and the impossibility of paying one laborer save in the products of another , justify the equality of wages . " % 7.  --  That Inequality of Powers is the Necessary Condition of Equality of Fortunes . It is objected ,  --  and this objection constitutes the second part of the St. Simonian , and the third part of the Fourierstic , maxims ,  --  " That all kinds of labor can not be executed with equal ease . Some require great superiority of skill and intelligence ; and on this superiority is based the price . The artist , the savant , the poet , the statesman , are esteemed only because of their excellence ; and this excellence destroys all similitude between them and other men : in the presence of these heights of science and genius the law of equality disappears . Now , if equality is not absolute , there is no equality . From the poet we descend to the novelist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mason ; from the chemist to the cook , &c.; Capacities are classified and subdivided into orders , genera , and species . The extremes of talent are connected by intermediate talents . Humanity is a vast hierarchy , in which the individual estimates himself by comparison , and fixes his price by the value placed upon his product by the public . " This objection always has seemed a formidable one . It is the stumbling-block of the economists , as well as of the defenders of equality . It has led the former into egregious blunders , and has caused the latter to utter incredible platitudes . Gracchus Babeuf wished all superiority to be STRINGENTLY REPRESSED , and even PERSECUTED AS A SOCIAL CALAMITY . To establish his communistic edifice , he lowered all citizens to the stature of the smallest . Ignorant eclectics have been known to object to the inequality of knowledge , and I should not be surprised if some one should yet rebel against the inequality of virtue . Aristotle was banished , Socrates drank the hemlock , Epaminondas was called to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dissolute and foolish demagogues . Such follies will be re-enacted , so long as the inequality of fortunes justifies a populace , blinded and oppressed by the wealthy , in fearing the elevation of new tyrants to power . Nothing seems more unnatural than that which we examine too closely , and often nothing seems less like the truth than the truth itself . On the other hand , according to J. J. Rousseau , " it takes a great deal of philosophy to enable us to observe once what we see every day ; " and , according to d'Alembert , " the ordinary truths of life make but little impression on men , unless their attention is especially called to them . " The father of the school of economists ( Say ) , from whom I borrow these two quotations , might have profited by them ; but he who laughs at the blind should wear spectacles , and he who notices him is near-sighted . Strange ! that which has frightened so many minds is not , after all , an objection to equality  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural inequality the condition of equality of fortunes ! ... What a paradox ! ... I repeat my assertion , that no one may think I have blundered  --  inequality of powers is the sine qua non of equality of fortunes . There are two things to be considered in society  --  FUNCTIONS and RELATIONS . I. FUNCTIONS . Every laborer is supposed to be capable of performing the task assigned to him ; or , to use a common expression , " every workman must know his trade . " The workman equal to his work ,  --  there is an equation between functionary and function . In society , functions are not alike ; there must be , then , different capacities . Further ,  --  certain functions demand greater intelligence and powers ; then there are people of superior mind and talent . For the performance of work necessarily involves a workman : from the need springs the idea , and the idea makes the producer . We only know what our senses long for and our intelligence demands ; we have no keen desire for things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of conception , the greater our capabilities of production . Thus , functions arising from needs , needs from desires , and desires from spontaneous perception and imagination , the same intelligence which imagines can also produce ; consequently , no labor is superior to the laborer . In a word , if the function calls out the functionary , it is because the functionary exists before the function . Let us admire Nature 's economy . With regard to these various needs which she has given us , and which the isolated man can not satisfy unaided , Nature has granted to the race a power refused to the individual . This gives rise to the principle of the DIVISION OF LABOR ,  --  a principle founded on the SPECIALITY OF VOCATIONS . The satisfaction of some needs demands of man continual creation ; while others can , by the labor of a single individual , be satisfied for millions of men through thousands of centuries . For example , the need of clothing and food requires perpetual reproduction ; while a knowledge of the system of the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The perpetual current of rivers supports our commerce , and runs our machinery ; but the sun , alone in the midst of space , gives light to the whole world . Nature , who might create Platos and Virgils , Newtons and Cuviers , as she creates husbandmen and shepherds , does not see fit to do so ; choosing rather to proportion the rarity of genius to the duration of its products , and to balance the number of capacities by the competency of each one of them . I do not inquire here whether the distance which separates one man from another , in point of talent and intelligence , arises from the deplorable condition of civilization , nor whether that which is now called the INEQUALITY OF POWERS would be in an ideal society any thing more than a DIVERSITY OF POWERS . I take the worst view of the matter ; and , that I may not be accused of tergiversation and evasion of difficulties , I acknowledge all the inequalities that any one can desire . 16 Certain philosophers , in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that all differences are the result of education . I am no believer , I confess , in this doctrine ; which , even if it were true , would lead to a result directly opposite to that desired . For , if capacities are equal , whatever be the degree of their power ( as no one can be coerced ) , there are functions deemed coarse , low , and degrading , which deserve higher pay ,  --  a result no less repugnant to equality than to the principle , TO EACH CAPACITY ACCORDING TO ITS RESULTS . Give me , on the contrary , a society in which every kind of talent bears a proper numerical relation to the needs of the society , and which demands from each producer only that which his special function requires him to produce ; and , without impairing in the least the hierarchy of functions , I will deduce the equality of fortunes . This is my second point . II . RELATIONS . In considering the element of labor , I have shown that in the same class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task being possessed by all , no inequality of reward can be based upon an inequality of individual powers . However , it is but fair to say that certain capacities seem quite incapable of certain services ; so that , if human industry were entirely confined to one class of products , numerous incapacities would arise , and , consequently , the greatest social inequality . But every body sees , without any hint from me , that the variety of industries avoids this difficulty ; so clear is this that I shall not stop to discuss it . We have only to prove , then , that functions are equal to each other ; just as laborers , who perform the same function , are equal to each other . Property makes man a eunuch , and then reproaches him for being nothing but dry wood , a decaying tree . Are you astonished that I refuse to genius , to knowledge , to courage ,  --  in a word , to all the excellences admired by the world ,  --  the homage of dignities , the distinctions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : it is economy , it is justice , it is liberty . Liberty ! for the first time in this discussion I appeal to her . Let her rise in her own defence , and achieve her victory . Every transaction ending in an exchange of products or services may be designated as a COMMERCIAL OPERATION . Whoever says commerce , says exchange of equal values ; for , if the values are not equal , and the injured party perceives it , he will not consent to the exchange , and there will be no commerce . Commerce exists only among free men . Transactions may be effected between other people by violence or fraud , but there is no commerce . A free man is one who enjoys the use of his reason and his faculties ; who is neither blinded by passion , nor hindered or driven by oppression , nor deceived by erroneous opinions . So , in every exchange , there is a moral obligation that neither of the contracting parties shall gain at the expense of the other ; that is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt from all inequality . This is the first condition of commerce . Its second condition is , that it be voluntary ; that is , that the parties act freely and openly . I define , then , commerce or exchange as an act of society . The negro who sells his wife for a knife , his children for some bits of glass , and finally himself for a bottle of brandy , is not free . The dealer in human flesh , with whom he negotiates , is not his associate ; he is his enemy . The civilized laborer who bakes a loaf that he may eat a slice of bread , who builds a palace that he may sleep in a stable , who weaves rich fabrics that he may dress in rags , who produces every thing that he may dispense with every thing ,  --  is not free . His employer , not becoming his associate in the exchange of salaries or services which takes place between them , is his enemy . The soldier who serves his country through fear instead of through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ministers or organs of military justice , are all his enemies . The peasant who hires land , the manufacturer who borrows capital , the tax-payer who pays tolls , duties , patent and license fees , personal and property taxes , &c.,; and the deputy who votes for them ,  --  all act neither intelligently nor freely . Their enemies are the proprietors , the capitalists , the government . Give men liberty , enlighten their minds that they may know the meaning of their contracts , and you will see the most perfect equality in exchanges without regard to superiority of talent and knowledge ; and you will admit that in commercial affairs , that is , in the sphere of society , the word superiority is void of sense . Let Homer sing his verse . I listen to this sublime genius in comparison with whom I , a simple herdsman , an humble farmer , am as nothing . What , indeed ,  --  if product is to be compared with product ,  --  are my cheeses and my beans in the presence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take from me all that I possess , and make me his slave in return for his inimitable poem , I will give up the pleasure of his lays , and dismiss him . I can do without his " Iliad , " and wait , if necessary , for the " AEneid . " Homer can not live twenty-four hours without my products . Let him accept , then , the little that I have to offer ; and then his muse may instruct , encourage , and console me . " What ! do you say that such should be the condition of one who sings of gods and men ? Alms , with the humiliation and suffering which they bring with them !  --  what barbarous generosity ! " ... Do not get excited , I beg of you . Property makes of a poet either a Croesus or a beggar ; only equality knows how to honor and to praise him . What is its duty ? To regulate the right of the singer and the duty of the listener . Now , notice this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question : both are free , the one to sell , the other to buy . Henceforth their respective pretensions go for nothing ; and the estimate , whether fair or unfair , that they place , the one upon his verse , the other upon his liberality , can have no influence upon the conditions of the contract . We must no longer , in making our bargains , weigh talent ; we must consider products only . In order that the bard of Achilles may get his due reward , he must first make himself wanted : that done , the exchange of his verse for a fee of any kind , being a free act , must be at the same time a just act ; that is , the poet 's fee must be equal to his product . Now , what is the value of this product ? Let us suppose , in the first place , that this " Iliad "  --  this chef-d ' oeuvre that is to be equitably rewarded  --  is really above price , that we do not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to purchase it , refuse to do so , it is clear that , the poem being unexchangeable , its intrinsic value will not be diminished ; but that its exchangeable value , or its productive utility , will be reduced to zero , will be nothing at all . Then we must seek the amount of wages to be paid between infinity on the one hand and nothing on the other , at an equal distance from each , since all rights and liberties are entitled to equal respect ; in other words , it is not the intrinsic value , but the relative value , of the thing sold that needs to be fixed . The question grows simpler : what is this relative value ? To what reward does a poem like the " Iliad " entitle its author ? The first business of political economy , after fixing its definitions , was the solution of this problem ; now , not only has it not been solved , but it has been declared insoluble . According to the economists , the relative or exchangeable value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The value of a thing , " says Say , " is a positive quantity , but only for a given moment . It is its nature to perpetually vary , to change from one point to another . Nothing can fix it absolutely , because it is based on needs and means of production which vary with every moment . These variations complicate economical phenomena , and often render them very difficult of observation and solution . I know no remedy for this ; it is not in our power to change the nature of things . " Elsewhere Say says , and repeats , that value being based on utility , and utility depending entirely on our needs , whims , customs , &c.,; value is as variable as opinion . Now , political economy being the science of values , of their production , distribution , exchange , and consumption ,  --  if exchangeable value can not be absolutely determined , how is political economy possible ? How can it be a science ? How can two economists look each other in the face without laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! that fool of a Descartes imagined that philosophy needed an immovable base  --  an aliquid inconcussum  --  on which the edifice of science might be built , and he was simple enough to search for it ! And the Hermes of economy , Trismegistus Say , devoting half a volume to the amplification of that solemn text , political economy is a science , has the courage to affirm immediately afterwards that this science can not determine its object ,  --  which is equivalent to saying that it is without a principle or foundation ! He does not know , then , the illustrious Say , the nature of a science ; or rather , he knows nothing of the subject which he discusses . Say 's example has borne its fruits . Political economy , as it exists at present , resembles ontology : discussing effects and causes , it knows nothing , explains nothing , decides nothing . The ideas honored with the name of economic laws are nothing more than a few trifling generalities , to which the economists thought to give an appearance of depth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been made by the economists to solve social problems , all that can be said of them is , that , if a glimmer of sense occasionally appears in their lucubrations , they immediately fall back into absurdity . For twenty-five years political economy , like a heavy fog , has weighed upon France , checking the efforts of the mind , and setting limits to liberty . Has every creation of industry a venal , absolute , unchangeable , and consequently legitimate and true value ?  --  Yes . Can every product of man be exchanged for some other product of man ?  --  Yes , again . How many nails is a pair of shoes worth ? If we can solve this appalling problem , we shall have the key of the social system for which humanity has been searching for six thousand years . In the presence of this problem , the economist recoils confused ; the peasant who can neither read nor write replies without hesitation : " As many as can be made in the same time , and with the same expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its cost in time and expense . How much is a diamond worth which costs only the labor of picking it up ?  --  Nothing ; it is not a product of man . How much will it be worth when cut and mounted ?  --  The time and expense which it has cost the laborer . Why , then , is it sold at so high a price ?  --  Because men are not free . Society must regulate the exchange and distribution of the rarest things , as it does that of the most common ones , in such a way that each may share in the enjoyment of them . What , then , is that value which is based upon opinion ?  --  Delusion , injustice , and robbery . By this rule , it is easy to reconcile every body . If the mean term , which we are searching for , between an infinite value and no value at all is expressed in the case of every product , by the amount of time and expense which the product cost , a poem which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay of ten thousand francs in journeys , books , &c.,; must be paid for by the ordinary wages received by a laborer during thirty years , PLUS ten thousand francs indemnity for expense incurred . Suppose the whole amount to be fifty thousand francs ; if the society which gets the benefit of the production include a million of men , my share of the debt is five centimes . This gives rise to a few observations . 1 . The same product , at different times and in different places , may cost more or less of time and outlay ; in this view , it is true that value is a variable quantity . But this variation is not that of the economists , who place in their list of the causes of the variation of values , not only the means of production , but taste , caprice , fashion , and opinion . In short , the true value of a thing is invariable in its algebraic expression , although it may vary in its monetary expression . 2 . The price of every product in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither more nor less : every product not in demand is a loss to the producer  --  a commercial non-value. 3 . The ignorance of the principle of evaluation , and the difficulty under many circumstances of applying it , is the source of commercial fraud , and one of the most potent causes of the inequality of fortunes . 4 . To reward certain industries and pay for certain products , a society is needed which corresponds in size with the rarity of talents , the costliness of the products , and the variety of the arts and sciences . If , for example , a society of fifty farmers can support a schoolmaster , it requires one hundred for a shoemaker , one hundred and fifty for a blacksmith , two hundred for a tailor , &c.; If the number of farmers rises to one thousand , ten thousand , one hundred thousand , &c.,; as fast as their number increases , that of the functionaries which are earliest required must increase in the same proportion ; so that the highest functions become possible only in the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the character of genius , the seal of its glory , can not arise and develop itself , except in the bosom of a great nation . But this physiological condition , necessary to the existence of genius , adds nothing to its social rights : far from that ,  --  the delay in its appearance proves that , in economical and civil affairs , the loftiest intelligence must submit to the equality of possessions ; an equality which is anterior to it , and of which it constitutes the crown . This is severe on our pride , but it is an inexorable truth . And here psychology comes to the aid of social economy , giving us to understand that talent and material recompense have no common measure ; that , in this respect , the condition of all producers is equal : consequently , that all comparison between them , and all distinction in fortunes , is impossible . In fact , every work coming from the hands of man  --  compared with the raw material of which it is composed  --  is beyond price . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of wooden shoes and the trunk of a walnut-tree , as between a statue by Scopas and a block of marble . The genius of the simplest mechanic exerts as much influence over the materials which he uses , as does the mind of a Newton over the inert spheres whose distances , volumes , and revolutions he calculates . You ask for talent and genius a corresponding degree of honor and reward . Fix for me the value of a wood-cutter 's talent , and I will fix that of Homer . If any thing can reward intelligence , it is intelligence itself . That is what happens , when various classes of producers pay to each other a reciprocal tribute of admiration and praise . But if they contemplate an exchange of products with a view to satisfying mutual needs , this exchange must be effected in accordance with a system of economy which is indifferent to considerations of talent and genius , and whose laws are deduced , not from vague and meaningless admiration , but from a just balance between DEBIT and CREDIT ; in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may imagine that the liberty of buying and selling is the sole basis of the equality of wages , and that society 's sole protection against superiority of talent lies in a certain force of inertia which has nothing in common with right , I shall proceed to explain why all capacities are entitled to the same reward , and why a corresponding difference in wages would be an injustice . I shall prove that the obligation to stoop to the social level is inherent in talent ; and on this very superiority of genius I will found the equality of fortunes . I have just given the negative argument in favor of rewarding all capacities alike ; I will now give the direct and positive argument . Listen , first , to the economist : it is always pleasant to see how he reasons , and how he understands justice . Without him , moreover , without his amusing blunders and his wonderful arguments , we should learn nothing . Equality , so odious to the economist , owes every thing to political economy . " When the parents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so good an example have expended on his education forty thousand francs , this sum may be regarded as so much capital invested in his head . It is therefore permissible to consider it as yielding an annual income of four thousand francs . If the physician earns thirty thousand , there remains an income of twenty-six thousand francs due to the personal talents given him by Nature . This natural capital , then , if we assume ten per cent . as the rate of interest , amounts to two hundred and sixty thousand francs ; and the capital given him by his parents , in defraying the expenses of his education , to forty thousand francs . The union of these two kinds of capital constitutes his fortune . "  --  Say : Complete Course , &c.; Say divides the fortune of the physician into two parts : one is composed of the capital which went to pay for his education , the other represents his personal talents . This division is just ; it is in conformity with the nature of things ; it is universally admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument which establishes the inequality of capacities . I accept this premise without qualification ; let us look at the consequences . 1 . Say CREDITS the physician with forty thousand francs ,  --  the cost of his education . This amount should be entered upon the DEBIT side of the account . For , although this expense was incurred for him , it was not incurred by him . Then , instead of appropriating these forty thousand francs , the physician should add them to the price of his product , and repay them to those who are entitled to them . Notice , further , that Say speaks of INCOME instead of REIMBURSEMENT ; reasoning on the false principle of the productivity of capital . The expense of educating a talent is a debt contracted by this talent . From the very fact of its existence , it becomes a debtor to an amount equal to the cost of its production . This is so true and simple that , if the education of some one child in a family has cost double or triple that of its brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property previous to its division . There is no difficulty about this in the case of guardianship , when the estate is administered in the name of the minors . 2 . That which I have just said of the obligation incurred by talent of repaying the cost of its education does not embarrass the economist . The man of talent , he says , inheriting from his family , inherits among other things a claim to the forty thousand francs which his education costs ; and he becomes , in consequence , its proprietor . But this is to abandon the right of talent , and to fall back upon the right of occupancy ; which again calls up all the questions asked in Chapter II . What is the right of occupancy ? what is inheritance ? Is the right of succession a right of accumulation or only a right of choice ? how did the physician 's father get his fortune ? was he a proprietor , or only a usufructuary ? If he was rich , let him account for his wealth ; if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he received aid , what right had he to use that aid to the disadvantage of his benefactors , &c.?; 3 . " There remains an income of twenty-six thousand francs due to the personal talents given him by Nature . " ( Say ,  --  as above quoted . ) Reasoning from this premise , Say concludes that our physician 's talent is equivalent to a capital of two hundred and sixty thousand francs . This skilful calculator mistakes a consequence for a principle . The talent must not be measured by the gain , but rather the gain by the talent ; for it may happen , that , notwithstanding his merit , the physician in question will gain nothing at all , in which case will it be necessary to conclude that his talent or fortune is equivalent to zero ? To such a result , however , would Say 's reasoning lead ; a result which is clearly absurd . Now , it is impossible to place a money value on any talent whatsoever , since talent and money have no common measure . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be paid two , three , or a hundred times as much as a peasant ? An unavoidable difficulty , which has never been solved save by avarice , necessity , and oppression . It is not thus that the right of talent should be determined . But how is it to be determined ? 4 . I say , first , that the physician must be treated with as much favor as any other producer , that he must not be placed below the level of others . This I will not stop to prove . But I add that neither must he be lifted above that level ; because his talent is collective property for which he did not pay , and for which he is ever in debt . Just as the creation of every instrument of production is the result of collective force , so also are a man 's talent and knowledge the product of universal intelligence and of general knowledge slowly accumulated by a number of masters , and through the aid of many inferior industries . When the physician has paid for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other items of his educational expenses , he has no more paid for his talent than the capitalist pays for his house and land when he gives his employees their wages . The man of talent has contributed to the production in himself of a useful instrument . He has , then , a share in its possession ; he is not its proprietor . There exist side by side in him a free laborer and an accumulated social capital . As a laborer , he is charged with the use of an instrument , with the superintendence of a machine ; namely , his capacity . As capital , he is not his own master ; he uses himself , not for his own benefit , but for that of others . Even if talent did not find in its own excellence a reward for the sacrifices which it costs , still would it be easier to find reasons for lowering its reward than for raising it above the common level . Every producer receives an education ; every laborer is a talent , a capacity ,  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents are not equally costly . It takes but few teachers , but few years , and but little study , to make a farmer or a mechanic : the generative effort and  --  if I may venture to use such language  --  the period of social gestation are proportional to the loftiness of the capacity . But while the physician , the poet , the artist , and the savant produce but little , and that slowly , the productions of the farmer are much less uncertain , and do not require so long a time . Whatever be then the capacity of a man ,  --  when this capacity is once created ,  --  it does not belong to him . Like the material fashioned by an industrious hand , it had the power of BECOMING , and society has given it BEING . Shall the vase say to the potter , " I am that I am , and I owe you nothing " ? The artist , the savant , and the poet find their just recompense in the permission that society gives them to devote themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality they do not labor for themselves , but for society , which creates them , and requires of them no other duty . Society can , if need be , do without prose and verse , music and painting , and the knowledge of the movements of the moon and stars ; but it can not live a single day without food and shelter . Undoubtedly , man does not live by bread alone ; he must , also ( according to the Gospel ) , LIVE BY THE WORD OF GOD ; that is , he must love the good and do it , know and admire the beautiful , and study the marvels of Nature . But in order to cultivate his mind , he must first take care of his body ,  --  the latter duty is as necessary as the former is noble . If it is glorious to charm and instruct men , it is honorable as well to feed them . When , then , society  --  faithful to the principle of the division of labor  --  intrusts a work of art or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon ordinary labor , it owes him an indemnity for all which it prevents him from producing industrially ; but it owes him nothing more . If he should demand more , society should , by refusing his services , annihilate his pretensions . Forced , then , in order to live , to devote himself to labor repugnant to his nature , the man of genius would feel his weakness , and would live the most distasteful of lives . They tell of a celebrated singer who demanded of the Empress of Russia ( Catherine II ) twenty thousand roubles for his services : " That is more than I give my field-marshals , " said Catherine . " Your majesty , " replied the other , " has only to make singers of her field-marshals . " If France ( more powerful than Catherine II ) should say to Mademoiselle Rachel , " You must act for one hundred louis , or else spin cotton ; " to M. Duprez , " You must sing for two thousand four hundred francs , or else work in the vineyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the singer Duprez , would abandon the stage ? If they did , they would be the first to repent it . Mademoiselle Rachel receives , they say , sixty thousand francs annually from the Comedie-Francaise . For a talent like hers , it is a slight fee . Why not one hundred thousand francs , two hundred thousand francs ? Why ! not a civil list ? What meanness ! Are we really guilty of chaffering with an artist like Mademoiselle Rachel ? It is said , in reply , that the managers of the theatre can not give more without incurring a loss ; that they admit the superior talent of their young associate ; but that , in fixing her salary , they have been compelled to take the account of the company 's receipts and expenses into consideration also . That is just , but it only confirms what I have said ; namely , that an artist 's talent may be infinite , but that its mercenary claims are necessarily limited ,  --  on the one hand , by its usefulness to the society which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this society : in other words , that the demand of the seller is balanced by the right of the buyer . Mademoiselle Rachel , they say , brings to the treasury of the Theatre-Francais more than sixty thousand francs . I admit it ; but then I blame the theatre . From whom does the Theatre-Francais take this money ? From some curious people who are perfectly free . Yes ; but the workingmen , the lessees , the tenants , those who borrow by pawning their possessions , from whom these curious people recover all that they pay to the theatre ,  --  are they free ? And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play , do you assure me that their families are not in want ? Until the French people , reflecting on the salaries paid to all artists , savants , and public functionaries , have plainly expressed their wish and judgment as to the matter , the salaries of Mademoiselle Rachel and all her fellow-artists will be a compulsory tax extorted by violence , to reward pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither free nor sufficiently enlightened , that we submit to be cheated in our bargains ; that the laborer pays the duties levied by the prestige of power and the selfishness of talent upon the curiosity of the idle , and that we are perpetually scandalized by these monstrous inequalities which are encouraged and applauded by public opinion . The whole nation , and the nation only , pays its authors , its savants , its artists , its officials , whatever be the hands through which their salaries pass . On what basis should it pay them ? On the basis of equality . I have proved it by estimating the value of talent . I shall confirm it in the following chapter , by proving the impossibility of all social inequality . What have we shown so far ? Things so simple that really they seem silly :  --  That , as the traveller does not appropriate the route which he traverses , so the farmer does not appropriate the field which he sows ; That if , nevertheless , by reason of his industry , a laborer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material becomes , by the same title , a proprietor ; That all capital , whether material or mental , being the result of collective labor , is , in consequence , collective property ; That the strong have no right to encroach upon the labor of the weak , nor the shrewd to take advantage of the credulity of the simple ; Finally , that no one can be forced to buy that which he does not want , still less to pay for that which he has not bought ; and , consequently , that the exchangeable value of a product , being measured neither by the opinion of the buyer nor that of the seller , but by the amount of time and outlay which it has cost , the property of each always remains the same . Are not these very simple truths ? Well , as simple as they seem to you , reader , you shall yet see others which surpass them in dullness and simplicity . For our course is the reverse of that of the geometricians : with them , the farther they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , after having commenced with the most abstruse propositions , shall end with the axioms . But I must close this chapter with an exposition of one of those startling truths which never have been dreamed of by legists or economists . % 8.  --  That , from the Stand-point of Justice , Labor destroys Property . This proposition is the logical result of the two preceding sections , which we have just summed up . The isolated man can supply but a very small portion of his wants ; all his power lies in association , and in the intelligent combination of universal effort . The division and co-operation of labor multiply the quantity and the variety of products ; the individuality of functions improves their quality . There is not a man , then , but lives upon the products of several thousand different industries ; not a laborer but receives from society at large the things which he consumes , and , with these , the power to reproduce . Who , indeed , would venture the assertion , " I produce , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the aid of no one else " ? The farmer , whom the early economists regarded as the only real producer  --  the farmer , housed , furnished , clothed , fed , and assisted by the mason , the carpenter , the tailor , the miller , the baker , the butcher , the grocer , the blacksmith , &c.,;  --  the farmer , I say , can he boast that he produces by his own unaided effort ? The various articles of consumption are given to each by all ; consequently , the production of each involves the production of all . One product can not exist without another ; an isolated industry is an impossible thing . What would be the harvest of the farmer , if others did not manufacture for him barns , wagons , ploughs , clothes , &c.?; Where would be the savant without the publisher ; the printer without the typecaster and the machinist ; and these , in their turn , without a multitude of other industries ? ... Let us not prolong this catalogue  --  so easy to extend  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are united by mutual relations in a single group ; all productions do reciprocal service as means and end ; all varieties of talent are but a series of changes from the inferior to the superior . Now , this undisputed and indisputable fact of the general participation in every species of product makes all individual productions common ; so that every product , coming from the hands of the producer , is mortgaged in advance by society . The producer himself is entitled to only that portion of his product , which is expressed by a fraction whose denominator is equal to the number of individuals of which society is composed . It is true that in return this same producer has a share in all the products of others , so that he has a claim upon all , just as all have a claim upon him ; but is it not clear that this reciprocity of mortgages , far from authorizing property , destroys even possession ? The laborer is not even possessor of his product ; scarcely has he finished it , when society claims it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if that is so  --  even if the product does not belong to the producer  --  still society gives each laborer an equivalent for his product ; and this equivalent , this salary , this reward , this allowance , becomes his property . Do you deny that this property is legitimate ? And if the laborer , instead of consuming his entire wages , chooses to economize ,  --  who dare question his right to do so ? " The laborer is not even proprietor of the price of his labor , and can not absolutely control its disposition . Let us not be blinded by a spurious justice . That which is given the laborer in exchange for his product is not given him as a reward for past labor , but to provide for and secure future labor . We consume before we produce . The laborer may say at the end of the day , " I have paid yesterday 's expenses ; to-morrow I shall pay those of today . " At every moment of his life , the member of society is in debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it possible for him to accumulate ? They talk of economy  --  it is the proprietor 's hobby . Under a system of equality , all economy which does not aim at subsequent reproduction or enjoyment is impossible  --  why ? Because the thing saved , since it can not be converted into capital , has no object , and is without a FINAL CAUSE . This will be explained more fully in the next chapter . To conclude :  --  The laborer , in his relation to society , is a debtor who of necessity dies insolvent . The proprietor is an unfaithful guardian who denies the receipt of the deposit committed to his care , and wishes to be paid for his guardianship down to the last day . Lest the principles just set forth may appear to certain readers too metaphysical , I shall reproduce them in a more concrete form , intelligible to the dullest brains , and pregnant with the most important consequences . Hitherto , I have considered property as a power of EXCLUSION ; hereafter , I shall examine it as a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last resort of proprietors ,  --  the overwhelming argument whose invincible potency reassures them ,  --  is that , in their opinion , equality of conditions is impossible . " Equality of conditions is a chimera , " they cry with a knowing air ; " distribute wealth equally to-day  --  to-morrow this equality will have vanished . " To this hackneyed objection , which they repeat everywhere with the most marvellous assurance , they never fail to add the following comment , as a sort of GLORY BE TO THE FATHER : " If all men were equal , nobody would work . " This anthem is sung with variations . " If all were masters , nobody would obey . " " If nobody were rich , who would employ the poor ? " And , " If nobody were poor , who would labor for the rich ? " But let us have done with invective  --  we have better arguments at our command . If I show that property itself is impossible  --  that it is property which is a contradiction , a chimera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by metaphysics and jurisprudence , but by figures , equations , and calculations ,  --  imagine the fright of the astounded proprietor ! And you , reader ; what do you think of the retort ? Numbers govern the world  --  mundum regunt numeri . This proverb applies as aptly to the moral and political , as to the sidereal and molecular , world . The elements of justice are identical with those of algebra ; legislation and government are simply the arts of classifying and balancing powers ; all jurisprudence falls within the rules of arithmetic . This chapter and the next will serve to lay the foundations of this extraordinary doctrine . Then will be unfolded to the reader 's vision an immense and novel career ; then shall we commence to see in numerical relations the synthetic unity of philosophy and the sciences ; and , filled with admiration and enthusiasm for this profound and majestic simplicity of Nature , we shall shout with the apostle : " Yes , the Eternal has made all things by number , weight , and measure ! " We shall understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all else is impossible ; that this seeming impossibility which we charge upon it arises from the fact that we always think of it in connection either with the proprietary or the communistic regime ,  --  political systems equally irreconcilable with human nature . We shall see finally that equality is constantly being realized without our knowledge , even at the very moment when we are pronouncing it incapable of realization ; that the time draws near when , without any effort or even wish of ours , we shall have it universally established ; that with it , in it , and by it , the natural and true political order must make itself manifest . It has been said , in speaking of the blindness and obstinacy of the passions , that , if man had any thing to gain by denying the truths of arithmetic , he would find some means of unsettling their certainty : here is an opportunity to try this curious experiment . I attack property , no longer with its own maxims , but with arithmetic . Let the proprietors prepare to verify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures prove accurate , the proprietors are lost . In proving the impossibility of property , I complete the proof of its injustice . In fact ,  --  That which is JUST must be USEFUL ; That which is useful must be TRUE ; That which is true must be POSSIBLE ; Therefore , every thing which is impossible is untrue , useless , unjust . Then ,  --  a priori ,  --  we may judge of the justice of any thing by its possibility ; so that if the thing were absolutely impossible , it would be absolutely unjust . PROPERTY IS PHYSICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE . DEMONSTRATION . AXIOM .  --  Property is the Right of Increase claimed by the Proprietor over any thing which he has stamped as his own . This proposition is purely an axiom , because ,  --  1 . It is not a definition , since it does not express all that is included in the right of property  --  the right of sale , of exchange , of gift ; the right to transform , to alter , to consume , to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many different powers of property , which we may consider separately ; but which we disregard here , that we may devote all our attention to this single one ,  --  the right of increase . 2 . It is universally admitted . No one can deny it without denying the facts , without being instantly belied by universal custom . 3 . It is self-evident , since property is always accompanied ( either actually or potentially ) by the fact which this axiom expresses ; and through this fact , mainly , property manifests , establishes , and asserts itself . 4 . Finally , its negation involves a contradiction . The right of increase is really an inherent right , so essential a part of property , that , in its absence , property is null and void . OBSERVATIONS .  --  Increase receives different names according to the thing by which it is yielded : if by land , FARM-RENT ; if by houses and furniture , RENT ; if by life-investments , REVENUE ; if by money , INTEREST ; if by exchange , ADVANTAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confounded with the wages or legitimate price of labor ) . Increase  --  a sort of royal prerogative , of tangible and consumable homage  --  is due to the proprietor on account of his nominal and metaphysical occupancy . His seal is set upon the thing ; that is enough to prevent any one else from occupying it without HIS permission . This permission to use his things the proprietor may , if he chooses , freely grant . Commonly he sells it . This sale is really a stellionate and an extortion ; but by the legal fiction of the right of property , this same sale , severely punished , we know not why , in other cases , is a source of profit and value to the proprietor . The amount demanded by the proprietor , in payment for this permission , is expressed in monetary terms by the dividend which the supposed product yields in nature . So that , by the right of increase , the proprietor reaps and does not plough ; gleans and does not till ; consumes and does not produce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idols of the Psalmist are the gods of property : the former had hands and felt not ; the latter , on the contrary , manus habent et palpabunt . The right of increase is conferred in a very mysterious and supernatural manner . The inauguration of a proprietor is accompanied by the awful ceremonies of an ancient initiation . First , comes the CONSECRATION of the article ; a consecration which makes known to all that they must offer up a suitable sacrifice to the proprietor , whenever they wish , by his permission obtained and signed , to use his article . Second , comes the ANATHEMA , which prohibits  --  except on the conditions aforesaid  --  all persons from touching the article , even in the proprietor 's absence ; and pronounces every violator of property sacrilegious , infamous , amenable to the secular power , and deserving of being handed over to it . Finally , the DEDICATION , which enables the proprietor or patron saint  --  the god chosen to watch over the article  --  to inhabit it mentally , like a divinity in his sanctuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article  --  so to speak  --  becomes converted into the person of the proprietor , who is regarded as ever present in its form . This is exactly the doctrine of the writers on jurisprudence . " Property , " says Toullier , " is a MORAL QUALITY inherent in a thing ; AN ACTUAL BOND which fastens it to the proprietor , and which can not be broken save by his act . " Locke humbly doubted whether God could make matter INTELLIGENT . Toullier asserts that the proprietor renders it MORAL . How much does he lack of being a God ? These are by no means exaggerations . PROPERTY IS THE RIGHT OF INCREASE ; that is , the power to produce without labor . Now , to produce without labor is to make something from nothing ; in short , to create . Surely it is no more difficult to do this than to moralize matter . The jurists are right , then , in applying to proprietors this passage from the Scriptures ,  --  Ego dixi : Dii estis et filii Excelsi omnes ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of you are children of the Most High . " PROPERTY IS THE RIGHT OF INCREASE . To us this axiom shall be like the name of the beast in the Apocalypse ,  --  a name in which is hidden the complete explanation of the whole mystery of this beast . It was known that he who should solve the mystery of this name would obtain a knowledge of the whole prophecy , and would succeed in mastering the beast . Well ! by the most careful interpretation of our axiom we shall kill the sphinx of property . Starting from this eminently characteristic fact  --  the RIGHT OF INCREASE  --  we shall pursue the old serpent through his coils ; we shall count the murderous entwinings of this frightful taenia , whose head , with its thousand suckers , is always hidden from the sword of its most violent enemies , though abandoning to them immense fragments of its body . It requires something more than courage to subdue this monster . It was written that it should not die until a proletaire , armed with a magic wand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE THING INCREASED . Whatever be the rate of interest ,  --  whether it rise to three , five , or ten per cent. , or fall to one-half , one-fourth , one-tenth ,  --  it does not matter ; the law of increase remains the same . The law is as follows :  --  All capital  --  the cash value of which can be estimated  --  may be considered as a term in an arithmetical series which progresses in the ratio of one hundred , and the revenue yielded by this capital as the corresponding term of another arithmetical series which progresses in a ratio equal to the rate of interest . Thus , a capital of five hundred francs being the fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is one hundred , its revenue at three per cent . will be indicated by the fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is three :  --  100 . 200 . 300 . 400 . 500. 3 . 6 . 9 . 12 . 15 . An acquaintance with this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high degree , are possessed by proprietors  --  will give us the key to the most puzzling problems , and cause us to experience a series of surprises . By this LOGARITHMIC theory of the right of increase , a piece of property , together with its income , may be defined as A NUMBER WHOSE LOGARITHM IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS UNITS DIVIDED BY ONE HUNDRED , AND MULTIPLIED BY THE RATE OF INTEREST . For instance ; a house valued at one hundred thousand francs , and leased at five per cent. , yields a revenue of five thousand francs , according to the formula 100,000 x 5 / 100 = five thousand . Vice versa , a piece of land which yields , at two and a half per cent. , a revenue of three thousand francs is worth one hundred and twenty thousand francs , according to this other formula ; 3,000 x 100/ 2 1/2 = one hundred and twenty thousand . In the first case , the ratio of the progression which marks the increase of interest is five ; in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The forms of increase known as farm-rent , income , and interest are paid annually ; rent is paid by the week , the month , or the year ; profits and gains are paid at the time of exchange . Thus , the amount of increase is proportional both to the thing increased , and the time during which it increases ; in other words , usury grows like a cancer  --  foenus serpit sicut cancer . 2 . THE INCREASE PAID TO THE PROPRIETOR BY THE OCCUPANT IS A DEAD LOSS TO THE LATTER . For if the proprietor owed , in exchange for the increase which he receives , some thing more than the permission which he grants , his right of property would not be perfect  --  he would not possess jure optimo , jure perfecto ; that is , he would not be in reality a proprietor . Then , all which passes from the hands of the occupant into those of the proprietor in the name of increase , and as the price of the permission to occupy , is a permanent gain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former ; to whom none of it will return , save in the forms of gift , alms , wages paid for his services , or the price of merchandise which he has delivered . In a word , increase perishes so far as the borrower is concerned ; or to use the more energetic Latin phrase ,  --  res perit solventi. 3 . THE RIGHT OF INCREASE OPPRESSES THE PROPRIETOR AS WELL AS THE STRANGER . The master of a thing , as its proprietor , levies a tax for the use of his property upon himself as its possessor , equal to that which he would receive from a third party ; so that capital bears interest in the hands of the capitalist , as well as in those of the borrower and the commandite . If , indeed , rather than accept a rent of five hundred francs for my apartment , I prefer to occupy and enjoy it , it is clear that I shall become my own debtor for a rent equal to that which I deny myself . This principle is universally practised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists . Manufacturers , also , who have the advantage of being proprietors of their floating capital , although they owe no interest to any one , in calculating their profits subtract from them , not only their running expenses and the wages of their employees , but also the interest on their capital . For the same reason , money-lenders retain in their own possession as little money as possible ; for , since all capital necessarily bears interest , if this interest is supplied by no one , it comes out of the capital , which is to that extent diminished . Thus , by the right of increase , capital eats itself up . This is , doubtless , the idea that Papinius intended to convey in the phrase , as elegant as it is forcible  --  Foenus mordet solidam . I beg pardon for using Latin so frequently in discussing this subject ; it is an homage which I pay to the most usurious nation that ever existed . FIRST PROPOSITION . Property is impossible , because it demands Something for Nothing . The discussion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farm-rent , which is so much debated by the economists . When I read the writings of the greater part of these men , I can not avoid a feeling of contempt mingled with anger , in view of this mass of nonsense , in which the detestable vies with the absurd . It would be a repetition of the story of the elephant in the moon , were it not for the atrocity of the consequences . To seek a rational and legitimate origin of that which is , and ever must be , only robbery , extortion , and plunder  --  that must be the height of the proprietor 's folly ; the last degree of bedevilment into which minds , otherwise judicious , can be thrown by the perversity of selfishness . " A farmer , " says Say , " is a wheat manufacturer who , among other tools which serve him in modifying the material from which he makes the wheat , employs one large tool , which we call a field . If he is not the proprietor of the field , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the productive service of this tool . The tenant is reimbursed by the purchaser , the latter by another , until the product reaches the consumer ; who redeems the first payment , PLUS all the others , by means of which the product has at last come into his hands . " Let us lay aside the subsequent payments by which the product reaches the consumer , and , for the present , pay attention only to the first one of all ,  --  the rent paid to the proprietor by the tenant . On what ground , we ask , is the proprietor entitled to this rent ? According to Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill , farm-rent , properly speaking , is simply the EXCESS OF THE PRODUCT OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND OVER THAT OF LANDS OF AN INFERIOR QUALITY ; so that farm-rent is not demanded for the former until the increase of population renders necessary the cultivation of the latter . It is difficult to see any sense in this . How can a right to the land be based upon a difference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engender a principle of legislation and politics ? This reasoning is either so subtle , or so stupid , that the more I think of it , the more bewildered I become . Suppose two pieces of land of equal area ; the one , A , capable of supporting ten thousand inhabitants ; the other , B , capable of supporting nine thousand only : when , owing to an increase in their number , the inhabitants of A shall be forced to cultivate B , the landed proprietors of A will exact from their tenants in A a rent proportional to the difference between ten and nine . So say , I think , Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill . But if A supports as many inhabitants as it can contain ,  --  that is , if the inhabitants of A , by our hypothesis , have only just enough land to keep them alive ,  --  how can they pay farm-rent ? If they had gone no farther than to say that the difference in land has OCCASIONED farm-rent , instead of CAUSED it , this observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that farm-rent grew out of a desire for equality . Indeed , if all men have an equal right to the possession of good land , no one can be forced to cultivate bad land without indemnification . Farm-rent  --  according to Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill  --  would then have been a compensation for loss and hardship . This system of practical equality is a bad one , no doubt ; but it sprang from good intentions . What argument can Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill develop therefrom in favor of property ? Their theory turns against themselves , and strangles them . Malthus thinks that farm-rent has its source in the power possessed by land of producing more than is necessary to supply the wants of the men who cultivate it . I would ask Malthus why successful labor should entitle the idle to a portion of the products ? But the worthy Malthus is mistaken in regard to the fact . Yes ; land has the power of producing more than is needed by those who cultivate it , if by CULTIVATORS is meant tenants only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cabinet-maker more furniture than he uses . But , since the various professions imply and sustain one another , not only the farmer , but the followers of all arts and trades  --  even to the doctor and the school-teacher  --  are , and ought to be , regarded as CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND . Malthus bases farm-rent upon the principle of commerce . Now , the fundamental law of commerce being equivalence of the products exchanged , any thing which destroys this equivalence violates the law . There is an error in the estimate which needs to be corrected . Buchanan  --  a commentator on Smith  --  regarded farm-rent as the result of a monopoly , and maintained that labor alone is productive . Consequently , he thought that , without this monopoly , products would rise in price ; and he found no basis for farm-rent save in the civil law . This opinion is a corollary of that which makes the civil law the basis of property . But why has the civil law  --  which ought to be the written expression of justice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . Now , to say that farm-rent is a monopoly sanctioned by the law , is to say that injustice is based on justice ,  --  a contradiction in terms . Say answers Buchanan , that the proprietor is not a monopolist , because a monopolist " is one who does not increase the utility of the merchandise which passes through his hands . " How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant 's products ? Has he ploughed , sowed , reaped , mowed , winnowed , weeded ? These are the processes by which the tenant and his employees increase the utility of the material which they consume for the purpose of reproduction . " The landed proprietor increases the utility of products by means of his implement , the land . This implement receives in one state , and returns in another the materials of which wheat is composed . The action of the land is a chemical process , which so modifies the material that it multiplies it by destroying it . The soil is then a producer of utility ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit , or farm rent , for its proprietor , it at the same time gives something to the consumer in exchange for the amount which the consumer pays it . It gives him a produced utility ; and it is the production of this utility which warrants us in calling land productive , as well as labor . " Let us clear up this matter . The blacksmith who manufactures for the farmer implements of husbandry , the wheelwright who makes him a cart , the mason who builds his barn , the carpenter , the basket-maker , &c.,;  --  all of whom contribute to agricultural production by the tools which they provide ,  --  are producers of utility ; consequently , they are entitled to a part of the products . " Undoubtedly , " says Say ; " but the land also is an implement whose service must be paid for , then .... " I admit that the land is an implement ; but who made it ? Did the proprietor ? Did he  --  by the efficacious virtue of the right of property , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vigor and fertility ? Exactly there lies the monopoly of the proprietor ; in the fact that , though he did not make the implement , he asks pay for its use . When the Creator shall present himself and claim farm-rent , we will consider the matter with him ; or even when the proprietor  --  his pretended representative  --  shall exhibit his power-of-attorney . " The proprietor 's service , " adds Say , " is easy , I admit . " It is a frank confession . " But we can not disregard it . Without property , one farmer would contend with another for the possession of a field without a proprietor , and the field would remain uncultivated .... " Then the proprietor 's business is to reconcile farmers by robbing them . O logic ! O justice ! O the marvellous wisdom of economists ! The proprietor , if they are right , is like Perrin-Dandin who , when summoned by two travellers to settle a dispute about an oyster , opened it , gobbled it , and said to them :  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing worse be said of property ? Will Say tell us why the same farmers , who , if there were no proprietors , would contend with each other for possession of the soil , do not contend to-day with the proprietors for this possession ? Obviously , because they think them legitimate possessors , and because their respect for even an imaginary right exceeds their avarice . I proved , in Chapter II. , that possession is sufficient , without property , to maintain social order . Would it be more difficult , then , to reconcile possessors without masters than tenants controlled by proprietors ? Would laboring men , who respect  --  much to their own detriment  --  the pretended rights of the idler , violate the natural rights of the producer and the manufacturer ? What ! if the husbandman forfeited his right to the land as soon as he ceased to occupy it , would he become more covetous ? And would the impossibility of demanding increase , of taxing another 's labor , be a source of quarrels and law-suits ? The economists use singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the proprietor is the legitimate master of the land . " The land is an instrument of production , " they say . That is true . But when , changing the noun into an adjective , they alter the phrase , thus , " The land is a productive instrument , " they make a wicked blunder . According to Quesnay and the early economists , all production comes from the land . Smith , Ricardo , and de Tracy , on the contrary , say that labor is the sole agent of production . Say , and most of his successors , teach that BOTH land AND labor AND capital are productive . The latter constitute the eclectic school of political economy . The truth is , that NEITHER land NOR labor NOR capital is productive . Production results from the co-operation of these three equally necessary elements , which , taken separately , are equally sterile . Political economy , indeed , treats of the production , distribution , and consumption of wealth or values . But of what values ? Of the values produced by human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter by man , that he may appropriate it to his own use , and not at all of Nature 's spontaneous productions . Man 's labor consists in a simple laying on of hands . When he has taken that trouble , he has produced a value . Until then , the salt of the sea , the water of the springs , the grass of the fields , and the trees of the forests are to him as if they were not . The sea , without the fisherman and his line , supplies no fish . The forest , without the wood-cutter and his axe , furnishes neither fuel nor timber . The meadow , without the mower , yields neither hay nor aftermath . Nature is a vast mass of material to be cultivated and converted into products ; but Nature produces nothing for herself : in the economical sense , her products , in their relation to man , are not yet products . Capital , tools , and machinery are likewise unproductive . The hammer and the anvil , without the blacksmith and the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miller and the grain , does not grind , &c.; Bring tools and raw material together ; place a plough and some seed on fertile soil ; enter a smithy , light the fire , and shut up the shop ,  --  you will produce nothing . The following remark was made by an economist who possessed more good sense than most of his fellows : " Say credits capital with an active part unwarranted by its nature ; left to itself , it is an idle tool . " ( J. Droz : Political Economy . ) Finally , labor and capital together , when unfortunately combined , produce nothing . Plough a sandy desert , beat the water of the rivers , pass type through a sieve ,  --  you will get neither wheat , nor fish , nor books . Your trouble will be as fruitless as was the immense labor of the army of Xerxes ; who , as Herodotus says , with his three million soldiers , scourged the Hellespont for twenty-four hours , as a punishment for having broken and scattered the pontoon bridge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , land and labor , considered individually and abstractly , are not , literally speaking , productive . The proprietor who asks to be rewarded for the use of a tool , or the productive power of his land , takes for granted , then , that which is radically false ; namely , that capital produces by its own effort ,  --  and , in taking pay for this imaginary product , he literally receives something for nothing . OBJECTION .  --  But if the blacksmith , the wheelwright , all manufacturers in short , have a right to the products in return for the implements which they furnish ; and if land is an implement of production ,  --  why does not this implement entitle its proprietor , be his claim real or imaginary , to a portion of the products ; as in the case of the manufacturers of ploughs and wagons ? REPLY .  --  Here we touch the heart of the question , the mystery of property ; which we must clear up , if we would understand any thing of the strange effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer 's tools receives the price ONCE , either at the time of delivery , or in several payments ; and when this price is once paid to the manufacturer , the tools which he has delivered belong to him no more . Never does he claim double payment for the same tool , or the same job of repairs . If he annually shares in the products of the farmer , it is owing to the fact that he annually makes something for the farmer . The proprietor , on the contrary , does not yield his implement ; eternally he is paid for it , eternally he keeps it . In fact , the rent received by the proprietor is not intended to defray the expense of maintaining and repairing the implement ; this expense is charged to the borrower , and does not concern the proprietor except as he is interested in the preservation of the article . If he takes it upon himself to attend to the repairs , he takes care that the money which he expends for this purpose is repaid . This rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself the implement produces nothing ; we have just proved this , and we shall prove it more clearly still by its consequences . Finally , this rent does not represent the participation of the proprietor in the production ; since this participation could consist , like that of the blacksmith and the wheelwright , only in the surrender of the whole or a part of his implement , in which case he would cease to be its proprietor , which would involve a contradiction of the idea of property . Then , between the proprietor and his tenant there is no exchange either of values or services ; then , as our axiom says , farm-rent is real increase ,  --  an extortion based solely upon fraud and violence on the one hand , and weakness and ignorance upon the other . PRODUCTS say the economists , ARE BOUGHT ONLY BY PRODUCTS . This maxim is property 's condemnation . The proprietor , producing neither by his own labor nor by his implement , and receiving products in exchange for nothing , is either a parasite or a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , property is impossible . COROLLARIES.  --  1 . The republican constitution of 1793 , which defined property as " the right to enjoy the fruit of one 's labor , " was grossly mistaken . It should have said , " Property is the right to enjoy and dispose at will of another 's goods ,  --  the fruit of another 's industry and labor . " 2 . Every possessor of lands , houses , furniture , machinery , tools , money , &c.,; who lends a thing for a price exceeding the cost of repairs ( the repairs being charged to the lender , and representing products which he exchanges for other products ) , is guilty of swindling and extortion . In short , all rent received ( nominally as damages , but really as payment for a loan ) is an act of property ,  --  a robbery . HISTORICAL COMMENT .  --  The tax which a victorious nation levies upon a conquered nation is genuine farm-rent . The seigniorial rights abolished by the Revolution of 1789 ,  --  tithes , mortmain , statute-labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they who under the titles of nobles , seigneurs , prebendaries , &c.; enjoyed these rights , were neither more nor less than proprietors . To defend property to-day is to condemn the Revolution . SECOND PROPOSITION . Property is impossible because wherever it exists Production costs more than it is worth . The preceding proposition was legislative in its nature ; this one is economical . It serves to prove that property , which originates in violence , results in waste . " Production , " says Say , " is exchange on a large scale . To render the exchange productive the value of the whole amount of service must be balanced by the value of the product . If this condition is not complied with , the exchange is unequal ; the producer gives more than he receives . " Now , value being necessarily based upon utility , it follows that every useless product is necessarily valueless ,  --  that it can not be exchanged ; and , consequently , that it can not be given in payment for productive services . Then , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for there is no real production save where there is a production of utility , and there is no utility save where there is a possibility of consumption . Thus , so much of every product as is rendered by excessive abundance inconsumable , becomes useless , valueless , unexchangeable ,  --  consequently , unfit to be given in payment for any thing whatever , and is no longer a product . Consumption , on the other hand , to be legitimate ,  --  to be true consumption ,  --  must be reproductive of utility ; for , if it is unproductive , the products which it destroys are cancelled values  --  things produced at a pure loss ; a state of things which causes products to depreciate in value . Man has the power to destroy , but he consumes only that which he reproduces . Under a right system of economy , there is then an equation between production and consumption . These points established , let us suppose a community of one thousand families , enclosed in a territory of a given circumference , and deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , scattered over the face of the earth , is really isolated . In fact , the difference between a community and the human race being only a numerical one , the economical results will be absolutely the same in each case . Suppose , then , that these thousand families , devoting themselves exclusively to wheat-culture , are obliged to pay to one hundred individuals , chosen from the mass , an annual revenue of ten per cent . on their product . It is clear that , in such a case , the right of increase is equivalent to a tax levied in advance upon social production . Of what use is this tax ? It can not be levied to supply the community with provisions , for between that and farm-rent there is nothing in common ; nor to pay for services and products ,  --  for the proprietors , laboring like the others , have labored only for themselves . Finally , this tax is of no use to its recipients who , having harvested wheat enough for their own consumption , and not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing else in exchange for it , thereby lose the advantage of their income . In such a society , one-tenth of the product being inconsumable , one-tenth of the labor goes unpaid  --  production costs more than it is worth . Now , change three hundred of our wheat-producers into artisans of all kinds : one hundred gardeners and wine-growers , sixty shoemakers and tailors , fifty carpenters and blacksmiths , eighty of various professions , and , that nothing may be lacking , seven school-masters , one mayor , one judge , and one priest ; each industry furnishes the whole community with its special product . Now , the total production being one thousand , each laborer 's consumption is one ; namely , wheat , meat , and grain , 0.7 ; wine and vegetables , 0.1 ; shoes and clothing , 0.06 ; iron-work and furniture , 0.05 ; sundries , 0.08 ; instruction , 0.007 ; administration , 0.002 ; mass , 0.001 , Total 1 . But the community owes a revenue of ten per cent. ; and it matters little whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for it ,  --  the result is the same . The farmer raises the price of his products in proportion to his share of the debt ; the other laborers follow his example . Then , after some fluctuations , equilibrium is established , and all pay nearly the same amount of the revenue . It would be a grave error to assume that in a nation none but farmers pay farm-rent  --  the whole nation pays it . I say , then , that by this tax of ten per cent . each laborer 's consumption is reduced as follows : wheat , 0.63 ; wine and vegetables , 0.09 ; clothing and shoes , 0.054 ; furniture and iron-work , 0.045 ; other products , 0.072 ; schooling , 0.0063 ; administration , 0.0018 ; mass , 0.0009 . Total 0.9 . The laborer has produced 1 ; he consumes only 0.9 . He loses , then , one-tenth of the price of his labor ; his production still costs more than it is worth . On the other hand , the tenth received by the proprietors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they , like the others , possess in the nine-tenths of their product the wherewithal to live : they want for nothing . Why should they wish their proportion of bread , wine , meat , clothes , shelter , &c.,; to be doubled , if they can neither consume nor exchange them ? Then farm-rent , with them as with the rest of the laborers , is a waste , and perishes in their hands . Extend the hypothesis , increase the number and variety of the products , you still have the same result . Hitherto , we have considered the proprietor as taking part in the production , not only ( as Say says ) by the use of his instrument , but in an effective manner and by the labor of his hands . Now , it is easy to see that , under such circumstances , property will never exist . What happens ? The proprietor  --  an essentially libidinous animal , without virtue or shame  --  is not satisfied with an orderly and disciplined life . He loves property , because it enables him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleases . Having obtained the means of life , he gives himself up to trivialities and indolence ; he enjoys , he fritters away his time , he goes in quest of curiosities and novel sensations . Property  --  to enjoy itself  --  has to abandon ordinary life , and busy itself in luxurious occupations and unclean enjoyments . Instead of giving up a farm-rent , which is perishing in their hands , and thus lightening the labor of the community , our hundred proprietors prefer to rest . In consequence of this withdrawal ,  --  the absolute production being diminished by one hundred , while the consumption remains the same ,  --  production and consumption seem to balance . But , in the first place , since the proprietors no longer labor , their consumption is , according to economical principles , unproductive ; consequently , the previous condition of the community  --  when the labor of one hundred was rewarded by no products  --  is superseded by one in which the products of one hundred are consumed without labor . The deficit is always the same , whichever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either the maxims of political economy are false , or else property , which contradicts them , is impossible . The economists  --  regarding all unproductive consumption as an evil , as a robbery of the human race  --  never fail to exhort proprietors to moderation , labor , and economy ; they preach to them the necessity of making themselves useful , of remunerating production for that which they receive from it ; they launch the most terrible curses against luxury and laziness . Very beautiful morality , surely ; it is a pity that it lacks common sense . The proprietor who labors , or , as the economists say , WHO MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL , is paid for this labor and utility ; is he , therefore , any the less idle as concerns the property which he does not use , and from which he receives an income ? His condition , whatever he may do , is an unproductive and FELONIOUS one ; he can not cease to waste and destroy without ceasing to be a proprietor . But this is only the least of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle people , whether or no . It will always have the blind , the maimed , the insane , and the idiotic . It can easily support a few sluggards . At this point , the impossibilities thicken and become complicated . THIRD PROPOSITION . Property is impossible , because , with a given capital , Production is proportional to labor , not to property . To pay a farm-rent of one hundred at the rate of ten per cent . of the product , the product must be one thousand ; that the product may be one thousand , a force of one thousand laborers is needed . It follows , that in granting a furlough , as we have just done , to our one hundred laborer-proprietors , all of whom had an equal right to lead the life of men of income ,  --  we have placed ourselves in a position where we are unable to pay their revenues . In fact , the productive power , which at first was one thousand , being now but nine hundred , the production is also reduced to nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , ten proprietors out of the one hundred can not be paid ,  --  provided the remaining ninety are to get the whole amount of their farm-rent ,  --  or else all must consent to a decrease of ten per cent . For it is not for the laborer , who has been wanting in no particular , who has produced as in the past , to suffer by the withdrawal of the proprietor . The latter must take the consequences of his own idleness . But , then , the proprietor becomes poorer for the very reason that he wishes to enjoy ; by exercising his right , he loses it ; so that property seems to decrease and vanish in proportion as we try to lay hold of it ,  --  the more we pursue it , the more it eludes our grasp . What sort of a right is that which is governed by numerical relations , and which an arithmetical calculation can destroy ? The laborer-proprietor received , first , as laborer , 0.9 in wages ; second , as proprietor , 1 in farm-rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have enough and to spare without my labor . " And thus it is that the income upon which he calculated gets diminished by one-tenth ,  --  he at the same time not even suspecting the cause of this diminution . By taking part in the production , he was himself the creator of this tenth which has vanished ; and while he thought to labor only for himself , he unwittingly suffered a loss in exchanging his products , by which he was made to pay to himself one-tenth of his own farm-rent . Like every one else , he produced 1 , and received but 0.9 If , instead of nine hundred laborers , there had been but five hundred , the whole amount of farm-rent would have been reduced to fifty ; if there had been but one hundred , it would have fallen to ten . We may posit , then , the following axiom as a law of proprietary economy : INCREASE MUST DIMINISH AS THE NUMBER OF IDLERS AUGMENTS . This first result will lead us to another more surprising still . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils of property , without abolishing it , without wronging proprietors , and by a highly conservative process . We have just proved that , if the farm-rent in a community of one thousand laborers is one hundred , that of nine hundred would be ninety , that of eight hundred , eighty , that of one hundred , ten , &c.; So that , in a community where there was but one laborer , the farm-rent would be but 0.1 ; no matter how great the extent and value of the land appropriated . Therefore , WITH A GIVEN LANDED CAPITAL , PRODUCTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO LABOR , NOT TO PROPERTY . Guided by this principle , let us try to ascertain the maximum increase of all property whatever . What is , essentially , a farm-lease ? It is a contract by which the proprietor yields to a tenant possession of his land , in consideration of a portion of that which it yields him , the proprietor . If , in consequence of an increase in his household , the tenant becomes ten times as strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would the proprietor in such a case be justified in raising the farm-rent tenfold ? His right is not , The more you produce , the more I demand . It is , The more I sacrifice , the more I demand . The increase in the tenant 's household , the number of hands at his disposal , the resources of his industry ,  --  all these serve to increase production , but bear no relation to the proprietor . His claims are to be measured by his own productive capacity , not that of others . Property is the right of increase , not a poll-tax . How could a man , hardly capable of cultivating even a few acres by himself , demand of a community , on the ground of its use of ten thousand acres of his property , ten thousand times as much as he is incapable of producing from one acre ? Why should the price of a loan be governed by the skill and strength of the borrower , rather than by the utility sacrificed by the proprietor ? We must recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEASURED BY A FRACTION OF THE PROPRIETORS PRODUCTION . Now , this production , what is it ? In other words , What can the lord and master of a piece of land justly claim to have sacrificed in lending it to a tenant ? The productive capacity of a proprietor , like that of any laborer , being one , the product which he sacrifices in surrendering his land is also one . If , then , the rate of increase is ten per cent. , the maximum increase is 0.1 . But we have seen that , whenever a proprietor withdraws from production , the amount of products is lessened by 1 . Then the increase which accrues to him , being equal to 0.1 while he remains among the laborers , will be equal after his withdrawal , by the law of the decrease of farm-rent , to 0.09 . Thus we are led to this final formula : THE MAXIMUM INCOME OF A PROPRIETOR IS EQUAL TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE PRODUCT OF ONE LABORER ( some number being agreed upon to express this product ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROPRIETOR IS IDLE , IS EQUAL TO A FRACTION WHOSE NUMERATOR IS 1 , AND WHOSE DENOMINATOR IS THE NUMBER WHICH EXPRESSES THE PRODUCT . Thus the maximum income of an idle proprietor , or of one who labors in his own behalf outside of the community , figured at ten per cent . on an average production of one thousand francs per laborer , would be ninety francs . If , then , there are in France one million proprietors with an income of one thousand francs each , which they consume unproductively , instead of the one thousand millions which are paid them annually , they are entitled in strict justice , and by the most accurate calculation , to ninety millions only . It is something of a reduction , to take nine hundred and ten millions from the burdens which weigh so heavily upon the laboring class ! Nevertheless , the account is not finished , and the laborer is still ignorant of the full extent of his rights . What is the right of increase when confined within just limits ? A recognition of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of occupancy , every man is by the same title a proprietor . Every man has a right to an income equal to a fraction of his product . If , then , the laborer is obliged by the right of property to pay a rent to the proprietor , the proprietor is obliged by the same right to pay the same amount of rent to the laborer ; and , since their rights balance each other , the difference between them is zero . Scholium.  --  If farm-rent is only a fraction of the supposed product of the proprietor , whatever the amount and value of the property , the same is true in the case of a large number of small and distinct proprietors . For , although one man may use the property of each separately , he can not use the property of all at the same time . To sum up . The right of increase , which can exist only within very narrow limits , defined by the laws of production , is annihilated by the right of occupancy . Now , without the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible . FOURTH PROPOSITION . Property is impossible , because it is Homicide . If the right of increase could be subjected to the laws of reason and justice , it would be reduced to an indemnity or reward whose MAXIMUM never could exceed , for a single laborer , a certain fraction of that which he is capable of producing . This we have just shown . But why should the right of increase  --  let us not fear to call it by its right name , the right of robbery  --  be governed by reason , with which it has nothing in common ? The proprietor is not content with the increase allotted him by good sense and the nature of things : he demands ten times , a hundred times , a thousand times , a million times as much . By his own labor , his property would yield him a product equal only to one ; and he demands of society , no longer a right proportional to his productive capacity , but a per capita tax . He taxes his fellows in proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A son is born to a farmer . " Good ! " says the proprietor ; " one more chance for increase ! " By what process has farm-rent been thus changed into a poll-tax ? Why have our jurists and our theologians failed , with all their shrewdness , to check the extension of the right of increase ? The proprietor , having estimated from his own productive capacity the number of laborers which his property will accommodate , divides it into as many portions , and says : " Each one shall yield me revenue . " To increase his income , he has only to divide his property . Instead of reckoning the interest due him on his labor , he reckons it on his capital ; and , by this substitution , the same property , which in the hands of its owner is capable of yielding only one , is worth to him ten , a hundred , a thousand , a million . Consequently , he has only to hold himself in readiness to register the names of the laborers who apply to him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with the lightness of his duties , the proprietor does not intend to bear even the deficit resulting from his idleness ; he throws it upon the shoulders of the producer , of whom he always demands the same reward . When the farm-rent of a piece of land is once raised to its highest point , the proprietor never lowers it ; high prices , the scarcity of labor , the disadvantages of the season , even pestilence itself , have no effect upon him  --  why should he suffer from hard times when he does not labor ? Here commences a new series of phenomena . Say  --  who reasons with marvellous clearness whenever he assails taxation , but who is blind to the fact that the proprietor , as well as the tax-gatherer , steals from the tenant , and in the same manner  --  says in his second letter to Malthus :  --  " If the collector of taxes and those who employ him consume one-sixth of the products , they thereby compel the producers to feed , clothe , and support themselves on five-sixths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time that it is possible for each one to live on five-sixths of what he produces . " I admit that , if they insist upon it ; but I ask if they believe that the producer would live as well , in case they demanded of him , instead of one-sixth , two-sixths , or one-third , of their products ? No ; but he would still live . Then I ask whether he would still live , in case they should rob him of two-thirds , ... then three-quarters ? But I hear no reply . " If the master of the French economists had been less blinded by his proprietary prejudices , he would have seen that farm-rent has precisely the same effect . Take a family of peasants composed of six persons ,  --  father , mother , and four children ,  --  living in the country , and cultivating a small piece of ground . Let us suppose that by hard labor they manage , as the saying is , to make both ends meet ; that , having lodged , warmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , but have laid up nothing . Taking the years together , they contrive to live . If the year is prosperous , the father drinks a little more wine , the daughters buy themselves a dress , the sons a hat ; they eat a little cheese , and , occasionally , some meat . I say that these people are on the road to wreck and ruin . For , by the third corollary of our axiom , they owe to themselves the interest on their own capital . Estimating this capital at only eight thousand francs at two and a half per cent. , there is an annual interest of two hundred francs to be paid . If , then , these two hundred francs , instead of being subtracted from the gross product to be saved and capitalized , are consumed , there is an annual deficit of two hundred francs in the family assets ; so that at the end of forty years these good people , without suspecting it , will have eaten up their property and become bankrupt ! This result seems ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the conscription ? An act of property exercised over families by the government without warning  --  a robbery of men and money . The peasants do not like to part with their sons ,  --  in that I do not think them wrong . It is hard for a young man of twenty to gain any thing by life in the barracks ; unless he is depraved , he detests it . You can generally judge of a soldier 's morality by his hatred of his uniform . Unfortunate wretches or worthless scamps ,  --  such is the make-up of the French army . This ought not to be the case ,  --  but so it is . Question a hundred thousand men , and not one will contradict my assertion . Our peasant , in redeeming his two conscripted sons , expends four thousand francs , which he borrows for that purpose ; the interest on this , at five per cent. , is two hundred francs ;  --  a sum equal to that referred to above . If , up to this time , the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been one thousand two hundred francs , or two hundred francs per persons  --  in order to pay this interest , either the six laborers must produce as much as seven , or must consume as little as five . Curtail consumption they can not  --  how can they curtail necessity ? To produce more is impossible ; they can work neither harder nor longer . Shall they take a middle course , and consume five and a half while producing six and a half ? They would soon find that with the stomach there is no compromise  --  that beyond a certain degree of abstinence it is impossible to go  --  that strict necessity can be curtailed but little without injury to the health ; and , as for increasing the product ,  --  there comes a storm , a drought , an epizootic , and all the hopes of the farmer are dashed . In short , the rent will not be paid , the interest will accumulate , the farm will be seized , and the possessor ejected . Thus a family , which lived in prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls into misery as soon as the exercise of this right becomes a necessity . Property requires of the husbandman the double power of enlarging his land , and fertilizing it by a simple command . While a man is simply possessor of the land , he finds in it means of subsistence ; as soon as he pretends to proprietorship , it suffices him no longer . Being able to produce only that which he consumes , the fruit of his labor is his recompense for his trouble  --  nothing is left for the instrument . Required to pay what he can not produce ,  --  such is the condition of the tenant after the proprietor has retired from social production in order to speculate upon the labor of others by new methods . Let us now return to our first hypothesis . The nine hundred laborers , sure that their future production will equal that of the past , are quite surprised , after paying their farm-rent , to find themselves poorer by one-tenth than they were the previous year . In fact , this tenth  --  which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the production , and paid part of the  --  public expenses  --  now has not been produced , and has been paid . It must then have been taken from the producer 's consumption . To choke this inexplicable deficit , the laborer borrows , confident of his intention and ability to return ,  --  a confidence which is shaken the following year by a new loan , PLUS the interest on the first . From whom does he borrow ? From the proprietor . The proprietor lends his surplus to the laborer ; and this surplus , which he ought to return , becomes  --  being lent at interest  --  a new source of profit to him . Then debts increase indefinitely ; the proprietor makes advances to the producer who never returns them ; and the latter , constantly robbed and constantly borrowing from the robbers , ends in bankruptcy , defrauded of all that he had . Suppose that the proprietor  --  who needs his tenant to furnish him with an income  --  then releases him from his debts . He will thus do a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the curate 's prayers ; while the poor tenant , overwhelmed by this unstinted charity , and taught by his catechism to pray for his benefactors , will promise to redouble his energy , and suffer new hardships that he may discharge his debt to so kind a master . This time he takes precautionary measures ; he raises the price of grains . The manufacturer does the same with his products . The reaction comes , and , after some fluctuation , the farm-rent  --  which the tenant thought to put upon the manufacturer 's shoulders  --  becomes nearly balanced . So that , while he is congratulating himself upon his success , he finds himself again impoverished , but to an extent somewhat smaller than before . For the rise having been general , the proprietor suffers with the rest ; so that the laborers , instead of being poorer by one-tenth , lose only nine-hundredths . But always it is a debt which necessitates a loan , the payment of interest , economy , and fasting . Fasting for the nine-hundredths which ought not to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts ; fasting to pay the interest on them . Let the crop fail , and the fasting becomes starvation . They say , " IT IS NECESSARY TO WORK MORE . " That means , obviously , that IT IS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE MORE . By what conditions is production effected ? By the combined action of labor , capital , and land . As for the labor , the tenant undertakes to furnish it ; but capital is formed only by economy . Now , if the tenant could accumulate any thing , he would pay his debts . But granting that he has plenty of capital , of what use would it be to him if the extent of the land which he cultivates always remained the same ? He needs to enlarge his farm . Will it be said , finally , that he must work harder and to better advantage ? But , in our estimation of farm-rent , we have assumed the highest possible average of production . Were it not the highest , the proprietor would increase the farm-rent . Is not this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rents , as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property ? The proprietor is a foreigner to society ; but , like the vulture , his eyes fixed upon his prey , he holds himself ready to pounce upon and devour it . The facts to which we have called attention , in a community of one thousand persons , are reproduced on a large scale in every nation and wherever human beings live , but with infinite variations and in innumerable forms , which it is no part of my intention to describe . In fine , property  --  after having robbed the laborer by usury  --  murders him slowly by starvation . Now , without robbery and murder , property can not exist ; with robbery and murder , it soon dies for want of support . Therefore it is impossible . FIFTH PROPOSITION . Property is impossible , because , if it exists , Society devours itself . When the ass is too heavily loaded , he lies down ; man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor  --  well knowing that it exists  --  bases his hopes of speculation . The free laborer produces ten ; for me , thinks the proprietor , he will produce twelve . Indeed ,  --  before consenting to the confiscation of his fields , before bidding farewell to the paternal roof ,  --  the peasant , whose story we have just told , makes a desperate effort ; he leases new land ; he will sow one-third more ; and , taking half of this new product for himself , he will harvest an additional sixth , and thereby pay his rent . What an evil ! To add one-sixth to his production , the farmer must add , not one-sixth , but two-sixths to his labor . At such a price , he pays a farm-rent which in God 's eyes he does not owe . The tenant 's example is followed by the manufacturer . The former tills more land , and dispossesses his neighbors ; the latter lowers the price of his merchandise , and endeavors to monopolize its manufacture and sale , and to crush out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce beyond his needs . Then , he must produce beyond his strength ; for , by the withdrawal of laborers who become proprietors , the one always follows from the other . But to produce beyond his strength and needs , he must invade the production of another , and consequently diminish the number of producers . Thus the proprietor  --  after having lessened production by stepping outside  --  lessens it still further by encouraging the monopoly of labor . Let us calculate it . The laborer 's deficit , after paying his rent , being , as we have seen , one-tenth , he tries to increase his production by this amount . He sees no way of accomplishing this save by increasing his labor : this also he does . The discontent of the proprietors who have not received the full amount of their rent ; the advantageous offers and promises made them by other farmers , whom they suppose more diligent , more industrious , and more reliable ; the secret plots and intrigues ,  --  all these give rise to a movement for the re-division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers . Out of nine hundred , ninety will be ejected , that the production of the others may be increased one-tenth . But will the total product be increased ? Not in the least : there will be eight hundred and ten laborers producing as nine hundred , while , to accomplish their purpose , they would have to produce as one thousand . Now , it having been proved that farm-rent is proportional to the landed capital instead of to labor , and that it never diminishes , the debts must continue as in the past , while the labor has increased . Here , then , we have a society which is continually decimating itself , and which would destroy itself , did not the periodical occurrence of failures , bankruptcies , and political and economical catastrophes re-establish equilibrium , and distract attention from the real causes of the universal distress . The monopoly of land and capital is followed by economical processes which also result in throwing laborers out of employment . Interest being a constant burden upon the shoulders of the farmer and the manufacturer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the means wherewith to pay my rent and interest , had I not to pay so many hands . " Then those admirable inventions , intended to assure the easy and speedy performance of labor , become so many infernal machines which kill laborers by thousands . " A few years ago , the Countess of Strafford ejected fifteen thousand persons from her estate , who , as tenants , added to its value . This act of private administration was repeated in 1820 , by another large Scotch proprietor , towards six hundred tenants and their families . "  --  Tissot : on Suicide and Revolt . The author whom I quote , and who has written eloquent words concerning the revolutionary spirit which prevails in modern society , does not say whether he would have disapproved of a revolt on the part of these exiles . For myself , I avow boldly that in my eyes it would have been the first of rights , and the holiest of duties ; and all that I desire to-day is that my profession of faith be understood .

These two modes of suicide are at first simultaneous ; but soon the first is given additional force by the second , famine uniting with usury to render labor at once more necessary and more scarce . By the principles of commerce and political economy , that an industrial enterprise may be successful , its product must furnish ,  --  1 . The interest on the capital employed ; 2 . Means for the preservation of this capital ; 3 . The wages of all the employees and contractors . Further , as large a profit as possible must be realized . The financial shrewdness and rapacity of property is worthy of admiration . Each different name which increase takes affords the proprietor an opportunity to receive it ,  --  1 . In the form of interest ; 2 . In the form of profit . For , it says , a part of the income derived from manufactures consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs have been invested in a manufacturing enterprise , and in a year 's time five thousand francs have been received therefrom in addition to the expenses , there has been no profit , but only interest on the capital . Now , the proprietor is not a man to labor for nothing . Like the lion in the fable , he gets paid in each of his capacities ; so that , after he has been served , nothing is left for his associates . Ego primam tollo , nominor quia leo . Secundam quia sum fortis tribuctis mihi . Tum quia plus valeo , me sequetur tertia . Malo adficietur , si quis quartam tetigerit . I know nothing prettier than this fable . " I am the contractor . I take the first share . I am the laborer , I take the second . I am the capitalist , I take the third . I am the proprietor , I take the whole . " In four lines , Phaedrus has summed up all the forms of property . I say that this interest , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers in relation to each other ? So many members of a large industrial society , to each of whom is assigned a certain portion of the general production , by the principle of the division of labor and functions . Suppose , first , that this society is composed of but three individuals ,  --  a cattle-raiser , a tanner , and a shoemaker . The social industry , then , is that of shoemaking . If I should ask what ought to be each producer 's share of the social product , the first schoolboy whom I should meet would answer , by a rule of commerce and association , that it should be one-third . But it is not our duty here to balance the rights of laborers conventionally associated : we have to prove that , whether associated or not , our three workers are obliged to act as if they were ; that , whether they will or no , they are associated by the force of things , by mathematical necessity . Three processes are required in the manufacture of shoes ,  --  the rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cutting and sewing . If the hide , on leaving the farmer 's stable , is worth one , it is worth two on leaving the tanner 's pit , and three on leaving the shoemaker 's shop . Each laborer has produced a portion of the utility ; so that , by adding all these portions together , we get the value of the article . To obtain any quantity whatever of this article , each producer must pay , then , first for his own labor , and second for the labor of the other producers . Thus , to obtain as many shoes as can be made from ten hides , the farmer will give thirty raw hides , and the tanner twenty tanned hides . For , the shoes that are made from ten hides are worth thirty raw hides , in consequence of the extra labor bestowed upon them ; just as twenty tanned hides are worth thirty raw hides , on account of the tanner 's labor . But if the shoemaker demands thirty-three in the farmer 's product , or twenty-two in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no exchange ; for , if there were , the farmer and the tanner , after having paid the shoemaker ten for his labor , would have to pay eleven for that which they had themselves sold for ten ,  --  which , of course , would be impossible . 18 Well , this is precisely what happens whenever an emolument of any kind is received ; be it called revenue , farm-rent , interest , or profit . In the little community of which we are speaking , if the shoemaker  --  in order to procure tools , buy a stock of leather , and support himself until he receives something from his investment  --  borrows money at interest , it is clear that to pay this interest he will have to make a profit off the tanner and the farmer . But as this profit is impossible unless fraud is used , the interest will fall back upon the shoulders of the unfortunate shoemaker , and ruin him . I have imagined a case of unnatural simplicity . There is no human society but sustains more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to-day , the number of industrial functions ( I mean by industrial functions all useful functions ) exceeds , perhaps , a thousand . However numerous the occupations , the economic law remains the same ,  --  THAT THE PRODUCER MAY LIVE , HIS WAGES MUST REPURCHASE HIS PRODUCT . The economists can not be ignorant of this rudimentary principle of their pretended science : why , then , do they so obstinately defend property , and inequality of wages , and the legitimacy of usury , and the honesty of profit ,  --  all of which contradict the economic law , and make exchange impossible ? A contractor pays one hundred thousand francs for raw material , fifty thousand francs in wages , and then expects to receive a product of two hundred thousand francs ,  --  that is , expects to make a profit on the material and on the labor of his employees ; but if the laborers and the purveyor of the material can not , with their combined wages , repurchase that which they have produced for the contractor , how can they live ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the workingman receives for his labor an average of three francs per day , his employer ( in order to gain any thing beyond his own salary , if only interest on his capital ) must sell the day 's labor of his employee , in the form of merchandise , for more than three francs . The workingman can not , then , repurchase that which he has produced for his master . It is thus with all trades whatsoever . The tailor , the hatter , the cabinet-maker , the blacksmith , the tanner , the mason , the jeweller , the printer , the clerk , &c.,; even to the farmer and wine-grower , can not repurchase their products ; since , producing for a master who in one form or another makes a profit , they are obliged to pay more for their own labor than they get for it . In France , twenty millions of laborers , engaged in all the branches of science , art , and industry , produce every thing which is useful to man . Their annual wages amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in consequence of the right of property , and the multifarious forms of increase , premiums , tithes , interests , fines , profits , farm-rents , house-rents , revenues , emoluments of every nature and description , their products are estimated by the proprietors and employers at twenty-five thousand millions . What does that signify ? That the laborers , who are obliged to repurchase these products in order to live , must either pay five for that which they produced for four , or fast one day in five . If there is an economist in France able to show that this calculation is false , I summon him to appear ; and I promise to retract all that I have wrongfully and wickedly uttered in my attacks upon property . Let us now look at the results of this profit . If the wages of the workingmen were the same in all pursuits , the deficit caused by the proprietor 's tax would be felt equally everywhere ; but also the cause of the evil would be so apparent , that it would soon be discovered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wages ( from that of the scavenger up to that of the minister of state ) as of property , robbery continually rebounds from the stronger to the weaker ; so that , since the laborer finds his hardships increase as he descends in the social scale , the lowest class of people are literally stripped naked and eaten alive by the others . The laboring people can buy neither the cloth which they weave , nor the furniture which they manufacture , nor the metal which they forge , nor the jewels which they cut , nor the prints which they engrave . They can procure neither the wheat which they plant , nor the wine which they grow , nor the flesh of the animals which they raise . They are allowed neither to dwell in the houses which they build , nor to attend the plays which their labor supports , nor to enjoy the rest which their body requires . And why ? Because the right of increase does not permit these things to be sold at the cost-price , which is all that laborers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouses which he in his poverty admires , the laborer reads in large letters : " This is thy work , and thou shalt not have it . " Sic vos non vobis ! Every manufacturer who employs one thousand laborers , and gains from them daily one sou each , is slowly pushing them into a state of misery . Every man who makes a profit has entered into a conspiracy with famine . But the whole nation has not even this labor , by means of which property starves it . And why ? Because the workers are forced by the insufficiency of their wages to monopolize labor ; and because , before being destroyed by dearth , they destroy each other by competition . Let us pursue this truth no further . If the laborer 's wages will not purchase his product , it follows that the product is not made for the producer . For whom , then , is it intended ? For the richer consumer ; that is , for only a fraction of society . But when the whole society labors , it produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of society consumes , sooner or later a part of society will be idle . Now , idleness is death , as well for the laborer as for the proprietor . This conclusion is inevitable . The most distressing spectacle imaginable is the sight of producers resisting and struggling against this mathematical necessity , this power of figures to which their prejudices blind them . If one hundred thousand printers can furnish reading-matter enough for thirty-four millions of men , and if the price of books is so high that only one-third of that number can afford to buy them , it is clear that these one hundred thousand printers will produce three times as much as the booksellers can sell . That the products of the laborers may never exceed the demands of the consumers , the laborers must either rest two days out of three , or , separating into three groups , relieve each other three times a week , month , or quarter ; that is , during two-thirds of their life they must not live . But industry , under the influence of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce a great deal in a short time , because the greater the amount of products , and the shorter the time of production , the less each product costs . As soon as a demand begins to be felt , the factories fill up , and everybody goes to work . Then business is lively , and both governors and governed rejoice . But the more they work to-day , the more idle will they be hereafter ; the more they laugh , the more they shall weep . Under the rule of property , the flowers of industry are woven into none but funeral wreaths . The laborer digs his own grave . If the factory stops running , the manufacturer has to pay interest on his capital the same as before . He naturally tries , then , to continue production by lessening expenses . Then comes the lowering of wages ; the introduction of machinery ; the employment of women and children to do the work of men ; bad workmen , and wretched work . They still produce , because the decreased cost creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , the cheapness being due to the quantity and rapidity of production , the productive power tends more than ever to outstrip consumption . It is when laborers , whose wages are scarcely sufficient to support them from one day to another , are thrown out of work , that the consequences of the principle of property become most frightful . They have not been able to economize , they have made no savings , they have accumulated no capital whatever to support them even one day more . Today the factory is closed . To-morrow the people starve in the streets . Day after tomorrow they will either die in the hospital , or eat in the jail . And still new misfortunes come to complicate this terrible situation . In consequence of the cessation of business , and the extreme cheapness of merchandise , the manufacturer finds it impossible to pay the interest on his borrowed capital ; whereupon his frightened creditors hasten to withdraw their funds . Production is suspended , and labor comes to a standstill . Then people are astonished to see capital desert commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once heard M. Blanqui bitterly lamenting the blind ignorance of capitalists . The cause of this movement of capital is very simple ; but for that very reason an economist could not understand it , or rather must not explain it . The cause lies solely in COMPETITION . I mean by competition , not only the rivalry between two parties engaged in the same business , but the general and simultaneous effort of all kinds of business to get ahead of each other . This effort is to-day so strong , that the price of merchandise scarcely covers the cost of production and distribution ; so that , the wages of all laborers being lessened , nothing remains , not even interest for the capitalists . The primary cause of commercial and industrial stagnations is , then , interest on capital ,  --  that interest which the ancients with one accord branded with the name of usury , whenever it was paid for the use of money , but which they did not dare to condemn in the forms of house-rent , farm-rent , or profit : as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for the lending ; that is , robbery . In proportion to the increase received by the capitalist will be the frequency and intensity of commercial crises ,  --  the first being given , we always can determine the two others ; and vice versa . Do you wish to know the regulator of a society ? Ascertain the amount of active capital ; that is , the capital bearing interest , and the legal rate of this interest . The course of events will be a series of overturns , whose number and violence will be proportional to the activity of capital . In 1839 , the number of failures in Paris alone was one thousand and sixty-four . This proportion was kept up in the early months of 1840 ; and , as I write these lines , the crisis is not yet ended . It is said , further , that the number of houses which have wound up their business is greater than the number of declared failures . By this flood , we may judge of the waterspout 's power of suction . The decimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and violent ; it depends upon the course which property takes . In a country where the property is pretty evenly distributed , and where little business is done ,  --  the rights and claims of each being balanced by those of others ,  --  the power of invasion is destroyed . There  --  it may be truly said  --  property does not exist , since the right of increase is scarcely exercised at all . The condition of the laborers  --  as regards security of life  --  is almost the same as if absolute equality prevailed among them . They are deprived of all the advantages of full and free association , but their existence is not endangered in the least . With the exception of a few isolated victims of the right of property  --  of this misfortune whose primary cause no one perceives  --  the society appears to rest calmly in the bosom of this sort of equality . But have a care ; it is balanced on the edge of a sword : at the slightest shock , it will fall and meet with death ! Ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , farm-rent stops at a certain point ; on the other , in consequence of competition and over-production , the price of manufactured goods does not rise ,  --  so that the condition of the peasant varies but little , and depends mainly on the seasons . The devouring action of property bears , then , principally upon business . We commonly say COMMERCIAL CRISES , not AGRICULTURAL CRISES ; because , while the farmer is eaten up slowly by the right of increase , the manufacturer is swallowed at a single mouthful . This leads to the cessation of business , the destruction of fortunes , and the inactivity of the working people ; who die one after another on the highways , and in the hospitals , prisons , and galleys . To sum up this proposition :  --  Property sells products to the laborer for more than it pays him for them ; therefore it is impossible . APPENDIX TO THE FIFTH PROPOSITION . I. Certain reformers , and even the most of the publicists  --  who , though belonging to no particular school , busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poorer and more numerous class  --  lay much stress now-a-days on a better organization of labor . The disciples of Fourier , especially , never stop shouting , " ON TO THE PHALANX ! " declaiming in the same breath against the foolishness and absurdity of other sects . They consist of half-a-dozen incomparable geniuses who have discovered that FIVE AND FOUR MAKE NINE ; TAKE TWO AWAY , AND NINE REMAIN ,  --  and who weep over the blindness of France , who refuses to believe in this astonishing arithmetic. 1 1 Fourier , having to multiply a whole number by a fraction , never failed , they say , to obtain a product much greater than the multiplicand . He affirmed that under his system of harmony the mercury would solidify when the temperature was above zero . He might as well have said that the Harmonians would make burning ice . I once asked an intelligent phalansterian what he thought of such physics . " I do not know , " he answered ; " but I believe . " And yet the same man disbelieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Fourierists proclaim themselves , on the one hand , defenders of property , of the right of increase , which they have thus formulated : TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPITAL , HIS LABOR , AND HIS SKILL . On the other hand , they wish the workingman to come into the enjoyment of all the wealth of society ; that is ,  --  abridging the expression ,  --  into the undivided enjoyment of his own product . Is not this like saying to the workingman , " Labor , you shall have three francs per day ; you shall live on fifty-five sous ; you shall give the rest to the proprietor , and thus you will consume three francs " ? If the above speech is not an exact epitome of Charles Fourier 's system , I will subscribe to the whole phalansterian folly with a pen dipped in my own blood . Of what use is it to reform industry and agriculture ,  --  of what use , indeed , to labor at all ,  --  if property is maintained , and labor can never meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of labor is neither more nor less than a delusion . If production should be quadrupled ,  --  a thing which does not seem to me at all impossible ,  --  it would be labor lost : if the additional product was not consumed , it would be of no value , and the proprietor would decline to receive it as interest ; if it was consumed , all the disadvantages of property would reappear . It must be confessed that the theory of passional attraction is gravely at fault in this particular , and that Fourier , when he tried to harmonize the PASSION for property ,  --  a bad passion , whatever he may say to the contrary ,  --  blocked his own chariot-wheels . The absurdity of the phalansterian economy is so gross , that many people suspect Fourier , in spite of all the homage paid by him to proprietors , of having been a secret enemy of property . This opinion might be supported by plausible arguments ; still it is not mine . Charlatanism was too important a part for such a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather think Fourier ignorant ( which is generally admitted ) than disingenuous . As for his disciples , before they can formulate any opinion of their own , they must declare once for all , unequivocally and with no mental reservation , whether they mean to maintain property or not , and what they mean by their famous motto ,  --  " To each according to his capital , his labor//
