txt The exhibition of wealth and resources made by South American States at the Centennial last year must have surprised North Americans more than Europeans , for , owing to lack of communication , South America is further off from us than from England , France , and Germany . Yet there were the evidences of a number of States not merely important in population and the exports which they make , but also , plainly enough , open fields for imports such as only the United States can offer . The chief of these States , those that are not only stocked with the most energetic and enterprising populations , but embrace almost the whole of the best territory of the half continent , are Brazil , Chili , and the Argentine Republic . The nearest one to us , and by far the richest in products demanded by the United States , is Brazil ; after Brazil comes the Argentine Republic . The latter is a Federal Government modeled closely upon our own , and the former , although it is an Empire , yet pursues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO , seems to be tending toward a practical Republic under the name of an Empire . It is not necessary to recall how the Emperor behaved when in this , country last year , or the speeches he uttered , or the significant visits he made to mercantile , industrial , or educational establishments . What it all meant was this : He proposed to study the United States , and adopt from them the best methods of teaching ; manufacturing , and trading . The natural sequence of such a course , if nothing hindered the legitimate consequences , would be a great increase iu the trade relations between the largest nations on the two respective half continents . It was pretty well understood that Dom PEDRO liked a good deal of what lie saw in the United States , and , naturally enough , the next thought was of how the relations between the two countries should be opened up and strengthened . But lie found that there was no line of steamers running between New-York and Rio do Janeiro ; that mails and merchandise had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy Atlantic , and submit to a transshipment , instead of following the comparatively quiet coast waters that stretch between Cape Hatteras and the mouth of the Amazon ! Nor did there seem any prospect of a new line being started , any more than there does now . It is true that a company did exist once , and moreover was supported by a subsidy of several hundred thousand dollars from the Governments of Brazil and the United States . But when the Pacific Mail subsidy was attacked and overthrown in Congress , Mr. C. R. G.tmirsos refused to continue his line between Rio and New-York , alleging , if our memory serves us , that without the subsidy it would be impossible to continue , owing partly to the loss of a number of ships by wreck . So that even that line , which was maintained for a few years on the charity of the two nations , collapsed as soon as the assistance was withdrawn . The fact , however , remains that under good management a steam-shin company ought to be able to make money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil without governmental It may well be that what proved the ruin of Mr. GARRISON 'S line was the subsidy . A company that has au income is very apt to be careless and rely too much on that fixed amount , even if it does not get into the habit of expecting more . There can not be much doubt that charity , unless very carefully administered , is as demoralizing to a corporation as to au individual . But there are the two countries and their respective products . It does not stand to reason that honest efforts would not establish a paying lino of communication . If the NowEngland States can cottons in Manchester , they can undersell the English in South America . The vast number of labor-saving machines in use in America can be furnished better and cheaper by us than by England . Coal ought to find a market at lower prices than the British article , and our iron mines , on a fair competition , will outbid those of Europe . The Australian Commissioner sent around the world to examine railways , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new countries they will always be rough  --  the American locomotives are altogether the best to stick to the track . We have supplied Russia and Peru , and there is no reason why we should not do the same by all of South America . Tim great transcontinental railway , which is to do for Buenos Ayres and the capital of Chili what ours has for Now-York and San Francisco , has already got close to the Cordilleras . It will open up a market in Chili now reached with groat difficulty via Panama . The President of the Argentine Republic was recently at Tucuman , far in the interior of La Plata , in order to preside at the opening of the line to that point . This President long ago recognized the eame importance in a communication between our country and his , that Dom PEDRO has shown . Ho offered a yearly subsidy of forty or fifty thousand dollars to the lino of steamers formerly running to Rio , if they would extend their trips southward the four or five days ' journey which lies between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken so decided a stand against subsidies , it is not likely that the President of the Argentine States er the Emperor of Brazil will renew their offers , even if Congress should change its policy . But in view of the desirability of steamship communication , one might almost say the absolute necessity for it , why should there be . no alternative 7 If a subsidy destroys the energy of a corporation , and may even cause the establishment of a line on a fraudulent basis for the mere purpose of getting that subsidy in the hands of corrupt men , perhaps a reward might work beneficially . Of course , this must be understood as merely speculative ; but why should not the Governments of Brazil , La Plata , and the United States pass a law that the steam-ship line which ran a certain number of boats a certain number of years in succession should , at the end of that time , and their good faith being proved to the satisfaction of a joint committee , receive a lump sum as a sort of prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receipt of the amount , yet the good already accomplished in the way of uniting business and other interests would be ample satisfaction for the national outlays . We would merely be paying for what we had already received .
