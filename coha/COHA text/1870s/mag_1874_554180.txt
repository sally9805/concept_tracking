Miose Evans . MOSE EVANS . PART II . I. I WAS very busy in my land matters , here and there over Brown County , for some weeks after Mr. Robinson had told me of the disaster to Mose Evans from the unconscious hands - I should rather say eyes - of Miss Agnes ThroQp . I can not recall how long it was after said conversation that I heard , as I rode into Brownstown one foggy day , of the disaster , in a more terrible sense , to the mother of Mose Evans . It was Dr. Alexis Jones who told me of it , nearly running me down as I floundered along through the mud , his " bright bay " in a foam under him , a portentous case of surgical instruments upon the pommel of his saddle . He told me the news without drawing rein , and Dick Frazier informed me afterwards that the doctor was only withheld by a good deal of profanity and physical force on the part of Frazier himself and others , from fleshing his maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interests of medical science ! " Mrs. Evans is dead ! - yes , sir , - as a hammer ! " Dr. Alexis Jones said it , as he joined me , with the keen satisfaction which we all have in telling news , bad as well as good ; and as if , in some way , his personal importance was augmented thereby . " Broke a blood-vessel in a dispute with Odd Archer ! " he explained . " It was about those cattle of hers he insisted were only strayed , and she knew had been run off by Dob Butler , that rascally client of his . What business had he to be on her place talking about it ? The court room was the only place for any talk about that , with judge and sheriff to keep the peace . Primed himself , you bet , with some of Dick Frazier 's strychnine whisky before he went . You see , her son , Mose Evans , has gone down to the Port* with a load of cotton . Odd Archer knew that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me ; post mortem , you see ; glad of the chance ! " And , with a cut of his whip , Dr. Jones added as he galloped off , " Nobody will ever know the facts . The coroner examined Archer , of course . Mere form ; they did n't pretend to believe the man even under oath . A gentlemanly fellow ; but who would ? From all I could learn , in the excitement that followed the painful event , Mrs. Evans flew into a violent passion during her conversation with Archer about the cattle , burst a blood-vessel in the torrent of her wrath , fell at his feet , the blood gushing from her lips upon the well-scrubbed floor , and died ! The lawyer rushed for his horse , sending into the house an old negro man who was chopping at the woodpile , no woman being about the place , and put spurs for his - rifle ! Not a moment of peace until he has that in his grasp , armed with two revolvers as he already was . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the most pressing importance that he should kill , and at the earliest moment possible , the son also . The entire question , To be or not to be , was with him , To shoot or to be shot . Brown County would very cheerfully have cast an unanimous vote for the last alternative in this case . Odd Archer himself preferred the other , strange as it seemed for even the owner thereof to care for so miserable a life ! With the whole population , Archer included , my interest was henceforth in Mose Evans ! Under the circumstances it was impossible to put off the funeral until the arrival of the son , and , Mr. Parkinson officiating , in those indefinite statements to which clergymen are compelled in many a like case , the burial service was duly performed . It was almost enough to cause Mrs. 824 // Evans to rise in wrath from her coffin , - the confusion throughout her house , the very abode , during her life , of neatness and housewifely care . All the reoion round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flocked in to the funeral , bringing upon their feet specimens of all the varieties of mud throughout the county . They pressed to the coffin as if to the side of a panther , if I may so express the actual fact , - a panther long famous but killed at last . And this was the long secluded and dread mother of Mose Evans , he as universally liked as she was feared ! No trace , however , of tbe wild animaluniversal disappointment in that in the face of the dead I A sudden return in the calm visage to something , even , of the girlish beauty , I suppose , which had won the heart of her husband from his books so many years before . Under the reading of the Scriptures and the generalities of Mr. Parkinson , there fell strange calm upon the crowd . Old New Hampshire led the singing with wonderful success , in virtue of the voices of the many negroes crowding porch and front yard . We escorted the hearse , an ambulance of Dick Frazier 's , stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cemetery in the outskirts of Brownstown ; and , with the benediction over the heaped grave , the mind of every person of the crowd dispersing homeward ran into the same demand , " Mose Evans ? * ' The men present would have consented to the hunting up and lynching of Odd Archer , Esq. , with the greatest pleasure , if merely for the excitement 's sak* . But something more than the unpopularity of the deceased prevented that . Somehow , there was a unanimous conviction that the absent son would be anything but gratified thereby . The absent son ! I doubt if a person at the grave failed , as he stood there , to say to himself , " Just room between her grave and that live-oak for Mose . " I knew the man had to be shot as well as any there ! I had been quartermaster , compulsory , in the Confederate service during the war , in a certain 825 city and , while there , had learned a lesson in human nature worth interrupting my narrative for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imagined herself to be , insulted by a Mr. Jackson . As soon as her letter detailing the fact arrived , and her husband could get leave of absence from building torpedoes at Savannah , he hurried home and shot his foe . Hastening rapidly across the city to the office of the dead man 's only son , who had never even heard of the insult , be shot him also . It is true one of the flying bullets passed through the head , by accident , of a youth of fourteen , the only support of a widowed mother , who happened to be passing . " But then one has to be in a hurry at times , " Mr. Archer , to whom I narrated the circumstance one day , explained . " When you and the other gentlerrian are both armed , " he continued , " if you have a little difficulty , you are compelled to shoot at the earliest moment , because you know if you do n't , he may ; best to anticipate him* you observe ; procrastination is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a case ! If you kill your man , of course you must kill his next relative ; if you dd not , you run the same risk from him ; a fool could see that ! We may kill a man or so , occasionally , " Mr. Archer added , " but , thank Heaven , we do not lie and cheat and steal and poison people as is done elsewbere ! " an emphasis upon the last word making his meaning clear . 0 sufficiently Mr. Archer would have admitted , however , that I had shown Yankee energy , at least , in my conduct follow mo ' the 0 upon death of Mrs. Evans . Leaving Brown County in going home from the funeral , I had ridden fifty miles down the river by daybreak of the morning after , to meet and warn Mose Evans on his way home . The truth is , I had come by this time to take an interest in the man , certainly far greater than in any other person native to that re0ion . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new home , as well as land affairs generally . There AKijose Evans . // was a something in him I find it impossible fully to express by the phrases sincerity , frankness , genuine manliness . I had been used all my life before to people who felt themselves very thoroughly informed in regard to all 0s in heaven and earth , people who had read books , heard lectures , seen siehts ; people who , young and old , male and female , were like so many venerable Solomons , aged queens of Sheba , knowing everything , and in vious to surprise . I suppose it was the zest of this ignorant man for information , the freshness of his pleasure in all I told him of the outside world , as new to him , almost , and as wonderful , . as if I was on a visit to him from the sun . But you can find inquisitive ignorance in Africa ; it was the original ore of the race in Evans , something of the virgin gold of human nature in eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lay , but General Throop , in his heavier way , was as much interested in him as myself . And so I went to meet and warn him against Odd Archer , any letter or telegrams being out of the question . It was the noon after the funeral , on Friday , I remember , when I met my friend . He was on his way home from the Port , the money for his cotton in his belt . Just as I arrived he was finishincr his dinner on the grass beneath a tree by the road-side , his horse grazing , roped to a swinging vine near by . Ihad planned , as I floundered along the miry road , what I would say . My well-arranged words were , as is always the case , never once thought of when we met . He rose to meet me , and had the whole story inside of five minutes . As I spoke , he stood listening to me , his full eyes in mine , erect as a statue , passing the palm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spoke . Singular contrast of my eager narrative to his quiet attention ! I ceased my earnest admonitions as to the need of caution upon his part , - ceased , because they seemed childish before his grave composure . Beyond the first exclamation at meeting , I do not recall his saying a syllable . As I finished , he mechanically drew first one and then the other revolver from its sheath by his side , saw that all the caps were in place , and then put them quietly back , and proceeded to coil in the lariat of his horse , untying it from the vine and hanging the coil by its thong behind the saddle . " Thank you , Mr. Anderson . If you will please ride on a little I will join you after a while , * ' was all he said as he mounted . I confess I was almost angry , after all my most fatiguing ride , too ! It was noon when we thus parted , and the night was almost upon me , riding slowly along in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the man had been weepin&amp; I studied his face as closely as the gathering darkness allowed ; there was deep sorrow , the simple bearing of a child in * , rief , but so little to say , beyond thanking me again for coming ! He even asked me one or two questions about General Throop and our land matters . I mentioned casually that Mrs. Throop had been prevented from attending the funeral , but that General Throop and his daughter had been present . The fact is , to General Throop Mrs. Evans had always been " woman . " With myself , as with Brown County , the phrase would have been wild cat ; rather ! We rode together , now side by side , then one in advance of the other , as the emergencies of the miserable highway allowed , through mud and darkness , and almost unbroken silence at last , until ten o'clock , when we reached the wretched roadside cabin in which we passed the night . I remember eating ravenously of the pork and corn bread and " big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our supper that night . In spite of my remonstrance my companion rolled himself up , as soon as supper was ended , in his huge Mexican blanket , and lay down upon the puncheon floor before the wide fireplace , his broad felt hat over his face . I did not hear him make the least motion through the night , and would be glad this hour to know if he really slept during that dismal time . As // to myself I was so worn out , that , in spite of pork and coffee , I slept like the dead , - slept , although , by some hurry in the making of the bed , the corn-cobs as well as shucks had been left therein ! " Archer is a gentleman , " I said to Evans as we rode along next day , " and lie will not fire upon you from ambush . If I was you * - " I think I know exactly what he will do , Mr. Anderson . Excuse my talking so little . I am by myself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heartily . I do n't know , but I hope it has saved the man 's life . We will see now , any moment . " About four o'clock in the afternoon , our road running beside the very edge of the river , my companion broke the silence as we journeyed along , by drawing up his horse and saying with less excitement than when he had called my duller attention once or twice before to a deer in the woods , - " Yes , sir . There he is ! " dismounting as he said so . I was dreadfully excited , yet nothing could be more chivalrous upon the lawyer 's part , for it was the lawyer . He had tied his horse to one side and stood in the centre of the road , rifle in hand . I suppose he had taken for granted that his adversary , duly warned , would have had a rifle . To my surprise , as soon as the man saw Mose Evans advancing upon him without one , he deliberately stooped to lay his carefully down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stepped back into the open road , a revolver in either hand , a long knife held by its hiade in his teeth . As General Philip Sheridan once told me of one of his battles , " It was beautiful ! " I caught my friend 's horse by the bridle , thinking , a little nervously , of Helen and of coming bullets . The parties advanced slowly upon each other durino the whole affair neither saying a single word . When within sixty feet of Evans , Archer raised his revolver and began firing . I heartily wish it was more theatrical , but I can only add that it was all over , ignominiously over , in much less than the proverbial fifteen minutes of the battle of San Jacinto . Mose Evans had not touched his own weapons . At the first report of the lawyer 's revolver , he sprang forward ! It was as if he was upon his enemy at one bound . Although it ruins what little romance there is in the matter , I believe Evans relied , unconsciously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to his habits , in the aim he would take . in the instant he had seized his puny assailant by arm and leg , and hurled him into the river ! I laughed aloud like an hysterical woman , - the man flying through the air , the splash in the water , was an ending so sudden ; such bathos ! " He wo n't want to see me . You help him out , " my friend said as he remounted . " Tell him the thing s over . lie never meant her death , you know . Good afternoon . " Even then , it flashed upon me ns Mose Evans rode leisurely away , and I said to myself , I suppose the self-mastery of this child of nature is what he has been learning his life long . In the woods ? In his singular home , rather . From his father 's long endurance . From witnessing , all his life , his mother 's lack of self-control . How Homer would havc loved and sung him ! Leaving my horse untied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dripping , bewildered , bemuddied wretch he was as he emerged , by my assistance ! I do not understand human nature half as well as I thought I did . I had counted upon his being utterly crestfallen . Not in the slightest ! Before he could get water and mire off his face he was laughing and talkin0 as if intoxicated . Possibly he was . Then there was the reaction . Besides , he knew that the circumstances of the case would be known by all Brown County in two days , and that such knowledge would restore him to the good opinion thereof . " Lnugh at me ? " he asked and answered in a breath ; " of course they will ! It will get into the papers and be the joke of the State . Do you suppose I care ? Not a red ! No , sir . Why , sir , the thing will help elect me next time I run for office . Nothing 1874. 3,27 // makes people like a candidate better , yes , and vote for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " II . " When I hate a man , he always sickens and dies , " my disreputable companion added in irrelevant but unceasing continuation of previous remarks , as we rode into the outskirts of Brownstown . " What I mean , " he explained , " is that I am J ) articularly cared for ; like Napoleon , I have a star . We had to enter town in our deplorable plight , and were fortunate in not reaching it until dark ! We certainly would have been a sight to see , bemuddied , as we were , from head to foot , and far beyond the ordinary allowance even of that section . I hated it as the worst part of the adventure , having to pass the night with him ; but there was no alternative , and so I dismounted with my associate at the ( loor of the tumble-down house on the edge of the town , which the man called his home , and which he invited me to enter with the well-bred courtesy of a host to his guest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , its charm . I did not see him drink anything worse than black coffee while we were there together . And , after eating supper , such as it was , xve sat the night through , drying our clothes without taking them off , at the fire which he had hastily made in the desolate fireplace . I dare say it was merely the animal spirits of the man , the most amazing , I believe , I ever knew in any one , Harry Peters excepted ; certainly he kept the same afire with the fuel of alcohol , - inferior to Harry Peters , his conversational rival , in that . Under the stimulus that night , possibly , of nothin , , stron*er than escape from his " difficulty " with Mose Evans , his tongue ran like that of one insane . I was glad to sit and listen , if merely to escape getting with him into his one bed . Yes , all night did we sit there , and you must allow my companion here the same liberty I was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he realized to me much that I had read of Aaron Burr . I wish you could see the man while you hear him . Slight in build , like his father , the eloquent divine ; not without a sinewy grace of carriage and motion ; with finely cut features and noble forehead , small but wonderful eyes ; a fallen angel , worshiped and very heartily despised by all Brown County . One night some weeks before , General Theodore Throop and myself , seated unknown to him in an adjoining room in Dick Frazier 's hotel , listened to his conversation for hours , as , drunk enough for it , he entertained a bar-room of loungers . Wit , wisdom , folly , filth , poetry by the page , deep metaphysics , anecdotes , pathos , bathos-it was wonderful ! Suddenly the General and myself entered the room ; the instant shame of the man , the intuitive gesture with which he consigned his companions to the mire beneath his heel , was equally amazing . The greasiness of his shabby suit of black pervaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman ! What perplexed me most was that a man with such memories could be so steadily and perfectly happy ! He spoke of his late antagonist at last , as we sat drying ourselves at the fire . " Mr. Anderson , look here , " ran his torrent of talk ; " Mose Evans is certainly a splendid-looking chap , as far as that goes . I do not remember his ever being before the grand jury for stealin* , gambling , or anything of the sort ; although I do remember his serving both upon grand and petit jury , if only from the fact that he has so invariably found against me in my cases , and in one or two instances more personal . I always challenge him , sir , when offered . His mother was a violent person . The entire country side had looked for it for years when she broke a blood-vessel in that dispute with me about those strayed cattle . I learned , last night , before the boys took him out and hung him for those horses , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how was I to know then whether // Butler had done as she said ? It is very curious , sir ; a client may be the hardest of cases , may know it is impossible for you to defend him , know that his lawyer does not care a drink whether the man did the murder , or whatever it was , or not , and yet that client will make believe to the last , against dead evidence and to his own lawyer , that he is innocent ! When it is a woman , I do believe , whatever it is she has done , she persuades herself through and through that she did not do whatever it was ! Yes , sir , if it was the killing of her baby , or of her old and helpless father , she thinks she had such good and sufficient cause for it that she could not have done otherwise - js an outraged martyr for being troubled about it ! I have been a lawyer for years , where human nature shows itself as it is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female clients , they have the least idea of the rights of other people , the clearest sense of their own , of any persons living . Upon the whole , you might have half the money if you gave me a male client instead , if it was not that the woman 's lawyer always has the jury , yes , sir ! ** I am obliged to allow the incoherence and lack of punctuation and purpose upon his part , if the reader is to hear Mr. Archer as I heard him that night . " I do not see , " he resumed , " how I have got off the track so . As to Mose Evans ? He astonished me as he will the whole county . I half thought , Mr. Anderson , the man an enormous fool . Look here , say , I was one day selecting a pair of boots , on credit , in New Ilampshire 's store . Miss Throop was shopping at the counter . I had merely bowed to her from the back room , - too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do angels know of what we devils really are ! Evans had retreated into that den of a place with me , when she came in , buyin* powder I remember he was ; went away , at last , leaving the package within a yard of a fire , hickory and sprirking ! The man was dazed , dared no more look full at Miss Throop than at the noonday sun ! But I noticed ; we lawyers notice ! I saw his eyes fasten , like a hawk upon a chicken , on a piece of brown paper she had unwrapped from some gloves and left lying on a bolt of calico upon the counter . Actually stood there , when she was gone , to gather up that paper in his hand , as cautiously as if it was gold and he stealing , and slipped it into his breast pocket ! " The fool , sir , walked away , leaving that package of powder under the flying sparks ! Suppose it had exploded . Why , sir , " - and I noted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference and return he ever made to himself , whatever the topic ; as well as the unceasing allusion running , from force of training , through all his thoughts to things supernatural , - " why , sir , the projectile force of that powder ! It would have blown some of us there into heaven , and onward in heaven forever and ever ; one man there in exactly the reverse direction , arid forever too . Heh ? Oh , as to Mose Evans , he is - material ! I mean for a drama , say . A sort of stuff , deep and strong and very rude , out of which Shakespeare , for instance , could make a hero . Books ? I have in Brown County a library of men , and I never weary of reading them instead . Do n't get sleepy , Anderson ; what shall we talk about next ? How will politics do ? " And with what inexhaustible spirits the fellow proceeded to rattle on upon that theme ! I heard little else all the time I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not kept it out of these pages ! " But I would rather hear more in regard to yourself , " I said at last , for I was curious about the man . " About myself ? " he replied . " Oh , as to myself . First . I plead guilty to all you , Anderson , all anybody , says against me . More . I am a great deal worse . Shysters ' I believe lawyers like myself in the great cities are styled . Let us lump it and be done . I , Odd Archer , Esq. , Mr. Anderson , stand here up to - down to , rather - anything the lowest lawyers ever do ! I want to speak fact about myself as well as about 1874. 329 // others . I am in that mood to-night . Next . I plead the extenuating circumstance of talent and temperament . From my birth I was regarded as a cherub . I am not , as you agree , Anderson , angelic in other than an infernal sense , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me be rigidly truthful , a miniature on something , proving my extreme loveliness of eyes , hair , brow , complexion then . If you were to compare child and man you would exclaim , Such a harvest from such a seed ? It is impossible ! * But , the fact shows it is possible . More . The very nature of the germ , as in all creation , is the cause of the result . Never mind about my physical beauty . That has a terrible deal to do with my after ruin , but , as is always the case , the very things one can not say , nor people print , are the chief causes of matters ! Matters , sir , perfectly explained by such things , but left otherwise wholly unexplained ! " If any ladies were here to-night , " the man continued , rising to his feet , as if from involuntary respect to the very imagination of such presence , " if I dared venture to say such things to the sex , I would remark to them no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to all this talk about women becoming lawyers , sitting on the jury and the like , I will say it to you , Anderson ; will you tell me how it would do to have them in the box , on the bench , in view of all the ugly matters necessary to be laid before them there ? I am told they are going as doctors into dissecting rooms and hospitals , but the loathsomeness of heart and soul laid bare in the court-house is a thousand times worse ! Now I am nothing , Mr. Anderson , but a blackguard lawyer , yet I can imagine a pure and beautiful girl , say my sister , or my betrothed . Do you suppose me such a villain as to be able to look her in the soft , innocent eyes , and state and develop and urge the vile facts which make up so many cases in court ? If any man , lawyer or otherwise , tried it in the presence of a lady of my acquaintance , I would smash his jaws ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the grand jury , judge , and the like , to drop my profession for a time ; that would make me drop it forever ! Yet stop a moment , sir ! As darkness ceases only by presence of pure light , this occurs to me , possibly woman 's purity must cane into such close contact with foulest darkness ! If the darkness is ever to go ! If so , woman 's purity must be intensely pure ! I do wonder , Anderson , and I never thought of it before , if woman , in virtue of being distinctively woman , is the reserve remedy for the world ! You Yankees , sir , laugh at Southern chivalry . It has gone out , sir , with the Confederacy . Five hundrcd thousand men were killed in the war . It has thrown up their value too much . Not in the eyes of the other sex alone . We men have come to rate ourselves too high . Now can it be , sir , that with a higher estimate of woman , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Heh ? But , how we have rambled in our talk ! Fact is , I m not a coward , but I m glad that thing with Evans is over . I see day is breaking . I must have a drink . I will go to Dick Frazier 's and have him send your trunk0 so that you can dress . It does n't matter about me . What a storm of curiosity and talk there will be over my fight with Evans ! You wo n't see him in town for days . I like it ! It may elect me to the bench ! That Evans , by the bye , has brain enough to go to Congress , if he knew it . For lack of education he is and will be a clodhopper all his life . What a splendid leap he made on me ! I m glad I did not hit him . I tried my best to do so , I assure you ! " III . However much of an adept I may be in my jotting down field-notes while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately afterward for our company , I have no ima0ination . I dare say it would make me no better as a business man if I had . Any value in what I say lies in simple narration of iL/lose Evans . // fact . Take , for instance , a certain rainy day I spent in the store of New Hampshire , my old postmaster , philosopher , and friend . That day forces itself upon my pen ; I can not get past except by recordin* it . I think it was some three weeks after the funeral of Mrs. Evans and the encounter between Odd Archer , Esq. , and her son . I am making Out a map from fieldnotes for our company , in the back room , but the crowd in the store increases to such an extent , and the fun becomes so uproarious around Harry Peters , that I give it up . It was for men , land was made , and I turn from the lesser to the greater , going in and making myself at home among them upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I sit . My friend the postmaster is the only silent person in the store . I call him my friend , not merely because we are partners in land ; somehow , as perfect an understanding exists from the first , between the old gentleman and myself , as between Odd Archer , Esq. , and General Throop , our basis being business , theirs mere sentiment . I observe that the postmaster is doing up coffee , the supreme luxury there next to whisky , in pound packages , against a dryer and busier day . While he does this he is evidently deep in the interior counties of New En0land - deaf to all the conversation and laughter , very often quarrels a score strong at a time. , and fast and furious , raging around the coast , so to speak , of his placid exterior . There is Harry Peters as prime promoter of the laughter . He is only a poor planter , limp , lame , weighing under ninety-five pounds , yet Shakespeare was not more entirely monarch of his adoring friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-office . Odd Archer is present , of course , and as usual , whenever these two are together in a crowd , there is sure to be strong rivalry between them ; the lawyer having plenty of talent , stores of knowledge , curve , so to speak , and trick of culture , reinforcement of alcohol , but all in vain against merest nature and genius in his clod-hopping rival . It is , on their lesser scale , Ben Jonson as beaten by Shakespeare . When I todk my soap-box Harry was just finishing some tale of fun . If it was not a recital of the ducking of the lawyer at the hands of Evans , it was something , possibly , more grotesque still , the life of that member of the bar furnishing material ample and ever renewed . The incidents were very ludicrous , whatever they were , and Harry , judging from the effect , could not have told them better to save his life ; but , amid all the shouts of laughter , the postmaster steadily puts up his pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store beside the owner thereof . No one addresses himself to my old friend , but I note a peculiar glancing at him , now and then , on the part of all . Something is in hand ih reference to him , and I therefore observe more closely , as he is e*idently unconscious of everything but coffee . And , now , Odd Archer launches into a narrative . It is of a peculiarly horrid murder which had come under his knowledge , described with wonderful power , and I forgot everything in the terror and wrath aroused in me as in all there by the narration , in which the lawyer evidently does his best . I observe , in the curdled silence which follows , a curious glancing , yet again , at the keeper of the store . Had he actually been in Brazil at the moment , gathering the coffee from the tree , he would not have been more unconscious of things , so far as the least movement of mouth or eyelid is concerned . After a disappointed pause on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his children , two little girls and their brother , in the " Bottom . " Of course those present know all about it , for it was , the winter before , the sensation of the county , hut they listen with hushed eagerness to the wonderfully perfect narration of the father , as he lives over all the anxiety and agony of the mother and himself during those four days . I find myself with moistened eyes , as well as the rest , actually exclaiming aloud with the 1874. 331 // others when the starved little ones are found ! When we recover ourselves enough to do so , I observe that all eyes are glancing again , although covertly , at the postmaster , so far as outer appearances go as wholly unconscious of them and of all their talk as before . With his little , close-cropped , white head on one side , he is putting up bags of coffee , that and only that ! I understand why Odd Archer had stepped over to Dick Frazier 's for a drink , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault upon the Bible , cool , argumentative , very able indeed at first , quickening into bitter , blasphemous , ferocious fury as he proceeds . I had heard before that of all men a minister 's son , when wicked , had the greatest power of blasphemy known , an energy of moral effect therein terrifying the weaker among his wicked associates ; because the entire belief and meaning derived from previous training is put into the oaths ! By this time I have come of myself to understand that , by plan beforehand , regular assault has been made , for the last two or three hours , upon old New Hampshire ; heavy bets pending , I afterward learn , upon moving him to do or say something , show in any way some emotion ! The frantic violence of the lawyer as he ceases shows his consciousness of defeat . The old man has paused once or twice from scoop and scales and coffee sack , even looked full in the face of the reprobate while at the white heat of his harangue , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; the pause was merely to tap his forefinger over his pursed-up lips , as , with eyes closed now and then , he was calculating profits , I suppose , his head to one side . Odd Archer ceases , exhausted , and universal laughter and scoffing sets in at the defeat of the two champions . It is " in full blast , " according to Brown County parlance , but there is instant hush thereof , and all movement , even , arrested , as Agnes Throop suddenly enters the door from the rain , and stands at the counter asking for letters . What heavenly beauty and purity and grace ! Nothing but a simply dressed young lady , with shrinking eyes , and cheeks in which the soul comes and goes , yet these men are painfully aware on the instant that they are scoundrels , boobies , louts ! Every man , as soon as he recovers himself , mana*es to slip away . In ten minutes every soul of them is gone , really kicked out of her presence , and by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my previous company , with the usual salutations ; but I curiously note that the postmaster is no more moved by the presence of this perfect jewel of her kind than he was by the men who have gone . As I pass out of the door on my way to the hotel , I notice that Miss Agnes has come to town in a buggy which waits for her at the sidewalk . Mary Martha Washington , who has driven her young mistress in , acknowled , es my good-day with severe respect , bringing to my mind her confidences to my wife long before in Charleston . " I was trained , Miss helen , to believe the Bible is God 's Word . If I know anything , , it is that it is clear agen the abolitionists . Two things I never can stand , abolitionists an ' free niggers . I m too old now , to change ! I ca n't give up my religion ! " " I was taught , Henry , as this old nunty was , " my wife took occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sin at all . But the Bible nowhere commanded ns to hold slaves ; no necessary connection between the two whatever . " " My dear Helen , " I made reply , " a century or so ago one of the , odliest ministers of New England sent a barrel of rum over to Africa and obtained a slave therefrom in exchange . No argument for the divine life of Revelation more self-evident than the way in which , slow and silent and steady , yes , and omnipotent and irresistible as God who gives it , the gospel purifies itself , age after age , from the merely human elements incrusting but wholly separable from it ; elements which are part of the gospel only as my clothin* for the nonce is part of me . No more , I should rather // say , than as the hindering vapors of our atmosphere are part of the sun . Plenty more of the human to be purged away yet from our skies , but I do not think it will endanger the sun ! " All this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to the colored woman seated in the buggy , I observe Mose Evans standing off by himself near the door of the office through which Miss Throop has entered a few moments before . I turn to shake hands and say a few words about business . To my surprise he takes my hand mechanically , but seems scarcely to recognize me , although his eyes are in mine when he speaks ; for that is a peculiarity of Mose Evans , the putting his entire self into his eyes full in yours when he addresses or listens to you . Hence I say to myself as I leave him , I wonder if the man can be drunk ? But , looking back after I have gone a little distance , I see that he has walked steadily enough to his horse tied to the rack across the street , and is in the act of mounting . Then all that old Mr. Robinson had told me flashed upon my mind ! Agnes Throop ! The absurdity , stupidity , insanity of the man ! I have to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think over what Mr. Robinson had said , I had so promptly and utterly rejected it all at the time ! " I thought I understood human nature ! " I complain to myself . " Yes , but this is the very sublimity of - of " - Iv . I hasten to speak of the next time I saw Mose Evans . I am , in fact , eager to do so . The circumstances were so remarkable . Some months had rolled by since the d ? y I had seen him hesitating , as if in a dazed condition , at the door of the postoffice . I had gone back to New York and Charleston since then . After settling up certain business there , I was on my way back again to Brown County , accompanied by Helen , my wife , who this time positively refused to be left behind . And thus it happened she was with me that day I reached Bucksnort , a particularly unpleasant town , at the hotel in which our stage stopped on its way to Brownstown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in what condition ! I recall perfectly how we came to know of it . helen and myself had arrived an hour or so before supper . XVhile seated thereat , the stage arrived from Brownstown , and the hungry passengers poured in upon us , seated at the supper table . I noticed the lawyer , Odd Archer , among the rest , and very drunk . I do not know whether he recognized me , but it would have made no difference . I suppose it was a continuance of what had been going on in the stage before , but I observed that he , in a drunken way , forced the possession of the seat next a modest-looking country girl , one of the passengers , nearly opposite Helen and myself . Even before the touch of Helen 's elbow , I fancied the animal was insulting the shrinking girl , who was too diffident to do more than draw as far away from him as possible . I hesitated to believe that the man could have degenerated so rapidly from what I had known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of any disrespect to a female even in his deepest drunken degradation . A fleshy old man who had come with them was seated at my side . As he was whispering to me , " I would not notice him . He s been drunk all along , " I observed a gross insult toward the girl upon the part of the lawyer . I grasped a tumbler of milk to hurl it , and was grasped in the same moment by my own cooler sense in the person of Helen , my wife , barely in time ! how very much better ! A whisper on my part to the negro handing me the wholly indigestible biscuits , a hasty exit of the same , the hurried appearance of the landlord , himself guilty of worse things every day . Sober during that special half hour , so as to make no mistake in taking the money for supper , the landlord saw the situation at a glance , and was filled with virtuous wrath ! One good grasp upon Qdd 1874. 333 // Archer 's collar from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side door , and hurled the limp wretch like a half-filled bag of meal out of the entrance and far into the night ! It is often so much better to have certain things done for you by others than to do them yourself ! You can remain quiet , and they can do them so much more thoroughly , too ! And but for this , I should not have known Mose Evans was in the house ; would have gone on to Brownstown , - Mose Evans to another city , too , quite another , neither Browastown nor yet Charleston ! It was from the landlord , after thanking him , supper over , for his conduct , that , in the course of conversation , I learned Mose Evans was upstairs . " Mighty sick , Colonel Anderson , I tell you ! " The colonel being instant brevet for my thanks ; and my friend wiped the honest sweat of his late exertion from his exceedingly red face , as he told me this , hearkening , with his bushy head a little on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the ejected man had disappeared through the night , as assurances that he had not been actually killed by his fall from the battlements of light . Yes , there in the corner of an upper room lay Mose Evans ! Wrecked like some huge Spanish galleon , and upon the most dismal and desert of all inhospitable islands ! Too short and too narrow , at least for him , the unpainted bedstead creaked and threatened to tumble at every turn of the writhing sufferer ; its cords so loose that the thin mattress bulged downward to the floor ; no possibility of lying in it unless coiled up like a serpent in a bushel measure . Although the sick man is consuming with fever , no one has thought to lift a window to assuage his burning , by letting in the at least milder fever of midsummer which is upon the world without ; has not cared , even , to move the bed out of the corner between two walls without a window . And there lay my poor friend with hair , beard , parched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , gridiron ; rather , a soul in hell for the pencil of IDor6 and the pen of Dante ! But , in God 's mercy , there is ever a Beatrice , too , for sufferer as for poet . I had , of course , told my wife the whole story long before , so that I had but to take her into the room and say , " Helen , dear , Mose Evans ! * for her to understand the entire affair . She had entered the western wilds with me , burning silently for some opportunity to show how heartily she could do and endure toward the making with me there of the immense fortune in lands which I had in view . I must add that , largely to her clear intuition in business , we have done , by the bye , very well indeed , ours being considerably more than the six feet by two of soil usually assigned by moralists , with the three score and ten of years , to mortals . Amazin0 , the despotism of a young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick ! In two hours Helen had revolutionized this " Bucksnort Travelers ' Rest , " as our hotel was misnamed . Such obedience bur landlord , rapidly returning to his condition of normal drunkenness , had never shown to his pale-faced and miserable wife . The two or three pert mulatto women about the hotel sufficiently explained , apart from the drink , the pallor and emaciation of the nominal mistress of the house . Wives have like experiences the world over , but I dare not say a syllable here as to the effect upon a Southern wife of a negro concubine ; yet I will record how I loathed that Helen should even superintend the labors of such helpers for the sick man ! But she did not know ; and at last we had the sick man bathed , clothed in clean linen , with hair and beard combed , upon the best bed in the coolest corner of the only decent room in the house , - our own ; and in consequence , he was soon sweetly asleep . " He looks like a dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rested at last by his bed , " Say a wounded gladiator , " she continued . " A woman might envy him those masses of beautiful hair . But , M*s e Evans . // have you not romanced a little about him ? " " Listen to the simple facts , " I said , and see if it is not nature itself , like Chevy Chace and the Vicar of Wakefield ! " and I went over again the story of his parentage , utter seclusion in the woods , amazing i0norance , termagant mother . " Ah , Henry , it is his desperate falling in love with Agnes Throop which interests you so in him , and I do n't blame you ! " said my wife . " I dare say she was to him as the first European woman was to the sava*es of America when she landed . Ever read , dear , that old story of inkle and Yarico ? The amazement of wonder and love with which the savage girl adored and clung to the god in flesh from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a land agent , I remember , too , that the god was a dastardly scoundrel , sold the girl " - " iNever mind about the rest , " Helen adds hastily . " As to Agnes Throop , you are right ; the thing is too preposterous even for romance , the man is deranged . Agnes Throop ! And such a person as this ! Insanity ! Besides , you forget there is another lover , a priory attachment , ' as Mr. Weller said . " " Yes , Mr. Archibald Clammeigh , " although I doubt if that gentleman would care to be announced to an audience , say , as the next speaker , in exactly the tones in which his name was now mentioned . And so we sat co*iparing the two men in silence . I dare say the long and singular suffering of the one lying before us helped our illusion , for such a colossus comes down with a crash when it does fall . The poor fellow was sadly reduced in flesh . Of course it was all imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face were softened by a purity and patience o'reater still . Romeos and King Lears , Cordelias and Ophelias , never had , you know , any more existence than the Ariels and the Pucks ! Or , if they did have , they have gone out forever with Shakespeare and stage-coaches . Or , is it so ? " But , you observe , " I thought aloud to Helen after a little , " that is the trouble with this poor . fellow . He has never lived in Mobile , or wintered at the Pulaski House in Savannah , to say nothing of the lesser civilization of Fifth Avenue , or Boston . The man , " and I pointed to him as if he were that far off , " actually lives in the age of - Elizabeth ? Why , Helen , he is a contemporary of Abelard . For anything he ever saw , or knew , I do not see why Mose Evans is not of the age of Achilles , even Abel . " I frankly confess here that I did garnish my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have had than I thought expedient generally and elsewhere . She liked such things , you observe , at least I supposed so : one should not be forever and everywhere merely a land agent . " It is all because you think he is so desperately in love , dear , " she now replied , " nor , even then , would he seem so much to others . We have n't been long married , you know ! " She said it , but did n't mean it , of course , my wife . " And Mr. Archibald Clainmeigh , we are under no illusion as to him , genial , generous soul of honor that he is ! " I say . " What a singular* coincidence , the conflict of two such opposites for such a woman , " I add , saddened by the moan of the sleeping man . " Everything , " I continued , after a pause , " birth can do for a man has been done for his Grace the Duke of Clammeigh ; no birth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native of the wilds . Thorough education , and no education . European travel , and never out of a cypress swamp . All that wealth and society can do for the one , and this man as ignorant of civilization even as Hercules ! " I lower my voice , under the finger of Hekn laid on my mustache , to add , " I may be romantic , being lately married and to a witch , but , think of Agnes Throop , of her Charleston betrothed , and - look at this man ! " Because , there was that in Mose Evans which deeply impressed us ! As to Mr. Clammeigh , he would have passed out of my mind like the dead , had he . not been our company 's Charleston lawyer . 1874. 885 // But it was his relation to Agnes Throop which brought him , at this sin*ular juncture , so vividly to mind . At this moment the invalid stirs , moans , murmurs , without opening his eyes . " Cologne , if you please . " " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bathes with cologne brow , hair , beard ; " the silliest thing in the world ! " " Agnes ? " And he had never even heard of it before . " " How do you know ? " " As you know it ! The mother in me , I suppose . " But here the Bucksnort doctor enters the room , bringing , an aroma of whisky and tobacco . He has heard of matters , and is a little awed by the change of thin , , s , in the scrupulously dignified stage of intoxication . From him we learn that Mose Evans has been sick three weeks , consumed by fever , would not take the physic , not the least hope now of his recovery . I could not but be struck , as the doctor spoke , with one thing which I had observed often before ; here was a regularly educated physician , and , I dare say , from the East years before , yet he had fallen into the jerky dialect of the region as completely as had iDob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear my long association out there with such people has affected even my manner of speaking . But then , you know , Paris has its peculiarity of speech , so has Edinburgh , possibly Boston . " Has he talked much in his delirium ? " I ask . The bloated Galen looks at me with curiosity , and replies , " Not one word ! Can you explain it ? Old friend , I see . It relieves nature , talking does , like weeping , for instance . Not one word ! So much the worse for him ! Very remarkable case ! The man evidently has some trouble , but has bottled himself tip , hermetically sealed himself ! I wonder what it is ? Killed somebody , I suppose ! Humph ! He 11 soon be out of the reach of the law , or Jud0e Lynch ! " I assure the doctor , as we converse , after a while , in the hall outside the room , that he is mistaken in his conjectures , as I tell Helen afterward that I will myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said he did not talk , I mean about himself . One queer , very queer insanity he had , " the doctor proceeds to inform me , and the remembrance seems to sober him a little . " He got some of the young fellows hanging round to read his Bible to him when he first lay sick . Grown man , fine-looking man like him , and I suppose ca n't read " great contempt . Simple truth obliges me to repel this last assertion . Months ago Mose Evans had acquired that useful art , and had been engaged a goodly part of every day , as well as far into the ni , , ht , in devouring , as the old postmaster told me , all the grammars , geographies , histories New Hampshire could obtain for him from the East by mail . Giving to the work the energies of manhood , as well as an intellect far beyond the average , it was incredible , old New Hampshire told me , the progress he made . The sick man had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been strong enough for the exertion , they would have howled at the suggestion of having the Bible read to them by him , or by any other man . " Preachers are scarce articles in this reolon ! " the doctor continued . " It was very kind in the young fellows to read the Bible to him . They got so ashamed of it at last , however , everybody laughed at them so , you know , that they could not stand it , cave itup ! And that poor fellow would persist in saying his prayers , sometimes kneeling in his bed when he could not get up , clasping his hands over his beard so , and saying them to himself when he could n't kneel even in his bed . The room had always been full of men smoking , playing cards , before , to keep him company , you see . Oh , they left ; could n't begin to stand it ! " " Was that his insanity ? " " Not so much that . This . He made // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he died . What for ? ' I asked after I had promised . You are a hard set about here , ' he said . I know you wo n't care for anything I can say now . ' I do believe , " the doctor added , " the man 's intention was to have in all the people about the place and give them a reo-ular sermon . Singular notion , was n't it ? Actual fact , sir ! " The only way I can explain it , " the doctor continues , opening , as he speaks , the door of the room across the hall from which we had rescued Mose Evans , " is that it was in this room , his room till you moved him , that it all took place ! " " What took place ? " " You have n't beard ? Why , this ! There had been a wonderful time of it at a camp-meeting out of town , ever so many of the boys up at the altar . Some of the men here said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular sacrament service in this room , singing , praying , preaching , tobacco for the bread , whisky for the wine , just for deviltry ! At the close of it , the make-believe parson 's revolver went off by accident , shot the next man through the heart ! lie was laughing when he fell , and the bother was , they could n't get the laugh out of his face ! A laughing corpse in his coffin ! It broke that crowd up quicker than any benediction you ever heard . It was the day your friend got here . I suppose he meant that ! Only , he was crazy from fever and his trouble , whatever it is . But wo n't you , , o down town and take a drink ? The water about here is limestone , and will be sure to derange your bowels ; come ! " To a degree wholly beyond my control , my experiences were , as you have been pained to observe , chiefly among the lower elements of the Southwest at that day . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the weaker and lesser , as well as worse , portion of the pol ) ulation there , you are greatly mistaken . No more cultivated and thoroughly excellent people in every sense , than are to be found even in the Brown Counties of the Southwest ; pure jewels , VOL . XXXIII. - NO. 197. 22 the brighter for their very setting , in many cases . I have had wide experiences , and must add that , if driven to choose between the log-cabin and the brown stone front for sterling goodness , I regard myself as safest in selecting , like Portia 's lover , the less imposing casket of the array . V. Helen agrees with me , when we talk over those days at the Bucksnort Hotel , as we often do , that it was the most remarkable thing we ever knew ! You are thoroughly informed in regard to Ignatius Loyola lying wounded to death in his tent , with his volumes of the Lives of the Saints ? Well , you know what came to him , and to the world up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sheep , Mohammed in his cave , are but the same story over again . So of the remarkable revolution in this Titan of ours , this prehistoric savage . I abhor mere rhetoric , but I would like to speak , if I could , of the soul of this child of nature , seething and surging in him as fresh and wild and forceful as did the conflicting elements of chaos when God first began to move upon it . The fact is , the awakened nature of the man had so wrought upon his body , even , that the backwoodsman was but a huge infant , exhausted as by crying - for the individual in question is too matter-offact to be at all rhetorical about ! I do believe another day , possibly hour , and Helen and myself would have been too late . But we understood him , handled him , saved him as a mother would a child ! May I be allowed to remark that we have both had , in consequence , a firmer faith than before , in a providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our little children . " The boys there at Brownstown used to say old New Hampshire was so mean he d weaken his well water before he d give a feller a drink , and it was a lie : well , I 'm as weak as that water ! " Mose Evans said to us , as his good morning , about ten days after we had 1874. 33T // taken him in hand . " Take a patent as a scarecrow , heh ? " And he was a sight to see ! Like all his comrades out West , wont to sleep on the prairie , or upon a blanket spread out on the puncheon floor of the cabin before the fire , Mose Evans used no pillow or bolster - lay perfectly flat upon his back in bed : a cause , by the bye , of his erect carriage and open chest , some of us narrow-breasted men and women would do well to remember . Very prostrate he was , the yellow beard flowing like an inundation over the blanket drawn up , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a picture in the mass of hair and beard , his emaciated face - eyes large and hollow , brow broad and white - resembled rather some medallion of a former a , e . " I am alive ! * It was gravely announced by him that morning after certain hopeful salutations and suggestions on our part . " I intend to live ! I am going to get well . I am going to live more than I ever did before . You will see . " It was not merely the child-like gravity of the statement . I am far from denying that Mose Evans was grateful to Helen and myself . I do not remember his saying so , we all took it for granted . But there was this as part of the amazing change in the man since I had last seen him . He had been simply an intelligent , kindly disposed Newfoundland dog when General Throop and myself had first met him , long before , at his cabin and elsewhere about Browustown . You would have had the idea of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook . Once or twice General Throop had rested his rifle , for the General 's hands trembled those days a good deal , upon Mose Evans ' oaken shoulder to shoot , when we were out early of mornings after wild turkeys , and he was nothing on earth but a log , a walkino ' stump , to us and to himself then , at best merely " noble material for the makin , , of a man , " as the General had often remarked to me . Then ! not now ! " Old New Hampshire often talked to me that way , " Mose Evans continued , the morning of our conversation with him , but without a particle of explanation . " Not when any of the boys were about . No . When I sat on a nail-keg by his counter , Saturday nights , every soul drunk and , , one home . He had his little bit of a Bible in an old desk of his in the back room . Boys called that room New England , - fully as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locked up and had me back there I Never laughed in his life , they say . How that old man 's tears did run down , that night ! Hailstorm ' ? Yes , he can pray some . Two good miles , if the wind lies , or is in your direction , they say . The postmaster only whispered . But it sounded to me louder than Hailstorm ! " " Do n't you think you are talking too much ? You know you are very weak . You can say all you like another time . " It is Helen 's soothing suggestion . And let me uncQver part of this photograph by adding , for what it is worth in the interest of simple truth , Mose Evans had eaten his breakfast just before ! Lest that is not understood , I will add that breakfast meant , with Mose Evans , coffee ! Coffee , without milk , and more cups than I like to say . As in every cabin in his region , Mose Evans ' old black and battered coffee-pot never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vilely inhospitable the meanest there , if they did not offer you a tin cup of coffee before you had been in the cabin or camp twenty minutes . Oriental hospitality in two senses of the word . It strikes me as a question here , whether coffee had anything to do with the death of Mose Evans ' old schoolmaster of a father ; with the terrible temper and final bursting of a blood-vesscl on the part of his mother ? I do not know . Nor do I know whether it affected Mose Evans in his feeling and talk that day . I only mention it as a part of the evidence for the jury , as a lawyer would say . Coffee , too , is one of the implements made by Infinite Love for its uses , as much so as wheat . " You get converted , Mose , and get New Hampshire 's property , ' the boys said , " our patient continued , paying // attention only by resting his hollow eyes upon my wife 's face whenever she spoke ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fut ure , and altogether over our heads . " They were mistaken ! What did I want of his money ? What did I want to buy ? Land ? It belongs to me now up and down the river so far I never even try to stop people splitting their rails off of it , making their clapboards , and the like ; squatting on it , for all I know . Stock ? I never get a chance , even with my brand , at half my colts or calves . Nothing I wanted out of his money , that I know of ! Then , I mean . " Strange how it all came , like muscadine grapes , in a hunch , " our sick man continued after some minutes of thought . " There is Mr. Parkinson . My father , too , he must have talked to me when I was a child . Pre-haps . And Hailstorm . Only there was too much thunder for the lightning . Then he always cried so at the end , washed you away like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand of Mr. Parkinson when I first knew him . He was like that fool , Alex Jones , with his doctor 's talk , every word a yard long . Green from their school , both of them . I managed to understand as he got warm , toward the close , moonshine done and day come . When he stopped preaching , began talking to me , I could understand . I do believe that parson went huntin* , with me , camping out at ni* , ht or purpose . Never mind about all that ! " I had never heard the man talk as much in all our intercourse before . It may have been his physical weakness , the transition state , the desperate emergency of the poor fellow ! " And , then " - Mose Evans got so far after a silence , only to stop . You will say I write romance , a thing I detest . Suppose you had seen the color suffusing his *ice , the light breaking in his eyes and over his entire manner as he lay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , she came . " Helen said it for him after a pause . " Agnes Throop . I have known her for years , " my wife added . " And , although Agnes is a lovely girl in some respects , I do not believe in her as some people do ! " Quietly and firmly . I suppose helen said it as a medicine . Sincerely thought it , for no woman is deluded about any other than a man . The Martha of Goethe was no more infatuated about Margaret than was Mephistopheles . " Yes , ma'am , she came , " Mose Evans said after a long pause . I can not describe tone or manner . It would have hurt Helen if it had not amused her so , the man 's utter folly , that her eyes filled with tears of pity , respect , affection , for the sick simpleton ! In Agnes , Helen felt it was her sex this Scandinavian of thousands of years ago so adored . The woman 's eyes rested a moment on me , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like that ! But then , I am of this nineteenth century . I have business that drives me like a mule from morning to midnight , - occupies my time so . This Mose Evans had nothing whatever to do , had no more idea of time than people had in earlier ages , than a Bedouin has now . And it was his first love . " Yes , she came , ma'am . " A contempt for all my wife could say or know of Agnes Throop , as he repeated the words , which was simply perfect . If there had not been a sort of grandeur as matter of course as morning in it , I declare I would have been irritated at the way in which this man ignored Helen and myself ! Had Helen and myself been but a brace of babies , he , lying upon his bed , could not have had less reference to us in all his words and manner . The man spoke , felt , certainly afterward acted , as from depths in himself with which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes as entirely over our little heads and far away as if we were weeds about his feet ! " It all came together , " he added after a while . " I was , before it allWhat was I ? I was like a bear asleep all winter in a hollow tree . Worse . Never mind , it all happened together , like spring ! Old New Hampshire . Mr. Parkinson . Perhaps my mother 's going ; I never thought of that before I never knew there was a world we are 1874. 339 // going to live in after this ! " turning his eyes upon us , with peculiar emphasis upon the 1 ; " a real , sure enough world after this , and one that s going to last forever and ever . An actual , sure enough God , a real person , mind , like you and me . Greater , of course , than us , as the sky is greater than a prairie . I never once thought of such a thing ! As to what they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose for such a thing , say , as I was , living here , dying here - never mind ! That is just the thing I ca n't talk about , for one . But , it was the finding myself out , as well as him , I look at ! It is the coming all on a sudden to know who I am ! What I may be yet , here in this world . And in that other world forever and ever ! This man , me ! " and he lifts his eyes solemnly to us , quietly pressing his hand , already lying there , upon his bosom as he speaks . " My dear Mr. Evans , " my wife endeavors . " If you talk so much you will have brain fever again . You are as weak as water ; you said so yourself . Do stop and go to sleep a little . " " Let me tell you , ma'am , " Mose Evans said , slowly , after listening with his large eyes . " Once , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I d clean forgot it ! About a year ago , a tree fell on me . At night . I had cut it down for the bear in the top . It pinned me down in between some rocks , no man with me , nor like to be . I was held down flat , could n't stir , like 1 am in this bed . My mind was that much the more quick . I thought more and brighter than for years , all in the six hours before Harry Peters happened along , going to a wedding in the Bottom . I know I am - as weak ! But if ever I had horse sense , it is to-day . Oh , well , I wo n't talk . But I have laid out on the prairie August nights , a coal or so of fire down in a hole by me , and my coffeepot Q*I that , for fear of drawing Camanches , - laid flat on the grass looking up at the skies , thinking what a tre-mendons creation*it is , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing for me , who lam and what I may yet be ! And then , yes , she came ! I had been months studying such matters , never dreamed of anything of the kind before . That Sunday at church , the day Hailstorm preached . I was sitting there ! I 'd no more idea ! She was coming in . I looked up just as a horse would do from his trough . The moment I saw her she - she proved it all ! " It is a pity , the reader may have said before this , that the Mr. Anderson who tells us this story could not make his fiction more probable . How is it possible , you say , that a man born and living all his life in a swamp , and unable to read , could use the language put in* Evans ' mouth ? Mr. Parkinson , Helen , and myself have discussed that objec-* tion , for the manuscript has been read aloud at my house of evenings , while Mr. Parkinson was East soliciting money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our statements in so many ways , to secure even verbal exactness , as to weary me to death , for one , of the whole undertaking . In the very nature of the case we did not take down the exact syllables from the lips of any of the parties of this simple narrative . Yet we have put their meaning , their intent , in words as near those they used as we can remember !
