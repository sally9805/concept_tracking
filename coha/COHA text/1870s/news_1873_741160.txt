txt They are trying their hands in England at legislating for that very troublesome person , the " inebriate . " A bill has been introduced into Parliament " For the Better Care and Management of Habitual Drunkards , " the chief objects of which seem to be to encourage the establishment of infirmaries , or hospitals for drunkards , and to provide legal means for their incarceration and . cure therein . The grand difficulty in handling this subject lies in the difference between the voluntary and involuntary systems , and on the difference , real or assumed , between a drunkard and a lunatic . At Binghamton. the experiment of curing dipsomania has succeeded very well , but there , if we understand it , the system is purely voluntary . People go there , that is to say , of their own accord , and not as patients are sent to Bloomingdale . But the bill referred to , introduced by Dr. DONALD DALRYMPLE , aims to treat drunkenness practically like insanity . It proposes to take people and shut them up , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The obvious difficulties and possible abuses of such a scheme are not unforeseen by the projectors , since they endeavor to provide against them by no fewer than a hundred clauses , with appended. schedules . It , however , seems incredible that any conceivable ingenuity should so frame a bill as to prevent great wrongs and hardships from being committed and suffered under it . Who , to begin with , is to decide , and by what tests , at what stage , or habit of excess legal interference is permissible ? A glass or two of light wine " gets into the head " of A , and a gallon of it would not affect B. There are many who go about keeping their bodies saturated with spirits , and who yet attend regularly to their affairs . In fact , those who get extremely tipsy , and commit outrages while in that condition , are very often precisely the drunkards who do not indulge as a matter of habit , and who are therefore excited to madness by occasional excess . Again , so far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others or himself , while some are made savage and abusive , by drink , others are made more than usually affectionate and considerate ; and the proverb that ascribes a special providential care for the drunkard , evidently springs from the extreme caution which so many , when intoxicated , habitually observe . In the sense , then , that it is suggested how is it possible to define the mean- ing of the words , " habitual drunkard ? " Another knotty point consists in the fact that those who are made dangerously drunk are , as a rule , people of the poorer classes . To maintain such people in the asylums proposed must cost money , and who is to pay it 1 if they themselves , or their friends , are unable to do so , are they to become a charge on the State ? To adopt such a plan would be to find a large fraction of the whole laboring population coming at intervals for this species of eleemosynary aid . All that a man too lazy to work would have to do would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk a few times , and then to get sympathizing triends  --  for whom ho could do the same good tarn another day ? to testify that he is an " habitual drunkard . " In many other ways the scheme must apparently work badly . The vindictive to feed grudges , the acquisitive and unprincipled to got the control of property , the dissatisfied husband or wife to get rid of a distasteful partner , would be among the classes likely to use the opportunities which any such legislation as that proposed by Dr. DALRYMPLE must inevitably afford . The various clauses intended to prevent abuses of the kinds enumerated , we fear would be wholly or partly inoperative in practice . There is a provision , for example , for the " periodical visitation " of the asylums , and for the licensing of them under guarded and elaborate restrictions . But the same machinery has long been applied to lunatic asylums , public and private ; and , even without the revelations of Mr. CHARLES READS , we know that monstrous wrongs were possible in spite of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to prevent all wrongs in such institutions ; but that hardly seems to constitute a sufficient reason for multiplying facilities for perpetrating them . On the whole , and whatever the general evils of legislating too much , even the most cursory examination seems to show that the particular evils of legislating in this particular direction should lead Parliament to throw out Dr. DALRYMPLE 'S bill . It is ' undeniable that there has been a great clamor in England for some such measure . The alarming increase of intemperance there , coinciding , as it does , with the great increase in the cost of the necessaries of life , thus making drunkenness an increasing source of misery and distress , naturally causes wide-spread anxiety . We imagine , however , that legislative deliberations on this measure will end in the resolve that it will be safer to bear the ills already existing , rather than to fly to others , unknown , indeed , but of whose character experience and common sense suggest so many unfavorable conjectures .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
