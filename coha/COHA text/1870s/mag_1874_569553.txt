ARTICLE II. - ULRICI 'S LOGIC . C*ompendium der Logilc von Dr. H. ULRIcI , 0 b Professor der Philosophie an der Universitdt Halle . Zweite neu bearbeitete und vermehrte Auflage . Leipzig , Weigel , 1872 . PROFESSOR ULRIcI is well known as the author of various works , prominent among which are his System der Logik , Gott und der Mensch , Gott und die Natur . We have chosen his Gompendium for notice , because it contains the germ of the author 's peculiar philosophy , and that , too , in its latest and clearest form . Before proceeding to the discussion , however , some preliminary statement is necessary . Three theories are possible concerning the relation of thought and thing : 1st , the thought is created by the thing ; 2nd , the thing is created by the thought ; 3d , thought and thing stand over against each other as equally valid and necessary factors of knowledge . The first two theories , or materialism and idealism , are alike destructive of philosophy . The consistent materialist can only view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , existing by chance , and uniting by chance in this or that accidental combination . Under such a view the logical laws and forms lose all authority , and all that is built up by their aid vanishes into an abyss of doubt and delusion . Pure idealism is no less fatal ; for the consistent idealist can not stop short of denying the existence of all but himself and his notions . Not alone the material world , but men also must fade into ideas ; and the thorough-going idealist must believe himself alone in the universe  --  a position which not even a madman would dream of maintaining . If , however , one should , for argument 's sake , assume such a position , he would do worse than expose himself to the charge of insanity - he would turn thought into chaos . The law of causation stands sponsor for the external world , and to deny one is to deny both . But to deny this law is to introduce anarchy into thought , and once more all is at sea . Out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help philosophy by assuming that subject and object are equally real and necessary factors of knowledge . But , unfortunately , its mediation between these contending views has generally consisted in dogmatically appropriating the principles of both parties , without any attempt to reconcile them ; and the inner contradiction of its teachings has been concealed by judiciously refraining from their logical development . In general , it may be said that the peace which realism has secured between materialism and idealism is such a peace as a fog might effect between hostile fleets . The hostility is there . It slumbers only because no one has vision keen enough to perceive it . Dogmatic realism has served as just such a fog-bank , in which the contradictory principles of idealism and materialism have slumbered , unconscious of their mutual hostility . By and by the sceptic comes with his confounding criticism . The mind is represented as holding with equal assurance both sides of a contradiction ; and philosophy reaches one of its periodical crises . Idealism and materialism are both fatal to philosophy , and realism , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and object as equally valid factors of knowledge , is not a philosophy , but a dogmatic acceptance of whatever principles practical needs may force upon us . The question which realism has to answer is : What are the relations of thought and thing ? and upon the answer depends the possibility of philosophy . Of all the crises through which philosophic thought has passed , none will compare in importance with that produced by the scepticism of Hume . Realism at that time was little more than sensationalism ; and the answer it gave to the question concerning the relation of thought and thing was that the thought is entirely subordinated to the thing . It would hear nothing of a priori factors of knowledge , but sought to lead all that we knew back to sensation . This is the unit from which all else is built up . The mind is passive in knowledge ; it receives but contributes nothing . It is merely a register upon which our manifold sensations record themselves ; and the socalled laws of thought are but abstractions from them . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is sensation the source of all knowledge ? then it // follows inevitably that what is not in sensation is unreal ; and all so-called knowledge which can not justify itself in the court of the senses , must be treated as blank illusion . Hence the belief in causation and the logical forms , in morality , the soul , and God , must be abandoned as the results of unthinking habit . Plainly , these beliefs are supersensual ; and sensation is the norm of knowledge . Out of doors they all must go , and science and religion must perish together . The argument was simple and convincing . The self-destructive nature of the experience-philosophy was clearly seen . In the clear demonstration of this fact lies Hume 's great and inestimable service to philosophy . The direction which speculation must take was evident . The denial of a priori factors of knowledge led to this sceptical result . To avoid it was impossible . To argue against the conclusion while admitting the premises was as hopeless as argument against the multiplication-table . Until philosophy could demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priori factors of knowledge , it must abandon all its claims . Only witless , reckless dogmatism could ignore the challenge . The problem was clearly stated ; could it be as clearly solved ? An attempt at solution could not be avoided . Haunted by a belief in the reality of knowledge , the mind will never rest content with scepticism . It matters not that the stone ever comes bounding back , Sisyphus must upheave it once more . There was nothing to do then but to return to first principles , and re-investigate the relation of thought and thing . The result was the Kantian criticism . Before we begin to philosophize , said Kant , let us inquire whether our faculties are competent to philosophy . Let reason itself be called into court , and an inventory of its powers be taken . Let us inquire after the origin and development of our knowledge . It may be that the contradictions of philosophy lie in the imperfection of its instrument . At all events , the first thing to do is to investigate the knowing faculty itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . The results of his criticism was his well known doctrine of mental forms . According to this doctrine , the raw material of knowledge is derived from experience ; the form which it assumes is determined by the mind itself . The skele // ton of knowledge is given in the nature of intelligence ; the outline is filled up by experience . Apart from these forms , sensation itself is impossible ; for sensation postulates the intuitions of space and time . Much more is the higher thought-knowledge impossible without the existence of forms of knowledge . Sensation , as such , is chaotic and meaningless . Of itself one sensation has no relation to another . They are connected in relation and judgment only by the mind within . This chaos of sensation can only become the unity of knowledge as law and order are imposed upon it by an inner activity . But this law and order are contributed by the mind , and are hence a priori factors of knowledge . This , then , is Kant 's doctrine of mental forms . Knowledge necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void ; content without form is chaos . We can know things only under certain forms which lie in the nature of the mind itself . Knowing consists in subsuming the chaos of sensation under these forms ; and not until it is so subsumed does it become a definite object of knowledge . Such was Kant 's conception ; and whatever may be thought of its value , one thing is certain : he demonstrated the helplessness of the experience-philosophy . At every step of mental development he showed the presence and working of a priori factors . Ignorant , reckless empiricism might ignore it ; but all except the willfully or hopelessly blind could not fail to see that the experience-philosophy can not ad. vance one step without the use of the very a priori principles which it is supposed to displace . The clear proof of this fact is Kant 's great service to philosophy , and also his undying glory . Unfortunately , Kant stated his doctrine in such a way as to countenance the gravest errors . The philosophers who came after him proved far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths . The critical stand-point was quickly deserted ; and the dreadful treadmill-round of a onesided idealism was begun over again . Since then German philosophy has been floundering in a dreadful bog . There has been any amount of speculation , but no principles . No one has troubled himself to inquire after the foundations of philosophy ; but every one has snatched up whatever one-sided prinem // pie happened to strike his fancy , and forthwith proceeded to develop a system . Of course , the whole world has wondered after the beast ; but the critic is compelled to declare that German philosophy since Kant has had little in common with logic , less yet in common with the facts of consciousness ; and resembles nothing so closely as the Baron Munchausen as he sailed through the air on his wig . In the work before us we have an attempt to recall philosophy to criticism . The aim is identical with that of Kant : to inquire into the possibility of philosophy in general ; to subject reason itself to an examination . With great justness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most fundamental question of philosophy . All the mental processes proceed according to the logical laws and forms . Doubt no less than belief scepticism no less than dogmatism , are subject to them . Since then these laws control all and every mental operation , since the sceptic is as subject to them as the dog . matist , it follows inevitably that the validity not alone of science and system , but even of doubt and denial , rests upon the truth of logic . The first thing , then , to do is to investigate the origin and vahdity of these laws and forms to which all our thinking , whether affirming or denying , doubting or believing , is and must be subject . Until this is done philosophy is a house built on sand , which will be sure to fall with the first gale and flood . The conclusion which the author reaches is very similar to that of Kant . In a certain sense he holds to the doctrine of mental forms . The points of agreement and difference will appear during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that the mind is active in all knowledge . The physical antecedents of sensation are simply nerve-vil ) ratiOns this is physiologically proved . But vibrations are not sensation ; by no effort of imagination can a thought be identified with a swinging molecule . These vibrations remain mechanical motions until they are attended to , and interpreted by the mind within . This also is one of the most common facts of experience . As soon as the student 's attention is concentrated upon his work , the hum of the room ceases . He does not hear the clock strike . All the sights and sounds of the // external world are unnoticed by him ; and for the reason that the attention of the mind was directed to other subjects . It is psychologically impregnable that sensation itself postulates a mental activity , as its necessary condition . Much more is this true of the higher processes of thought . In comparing , recognizing , judging , imagining , constructing , the mind is consciously the actor to whom all this activity must be referred . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this activity must be an orderly one ; otherwise knowledge could have no fixed point , and the results of to-day might be overturned by the activity of to-morrow . Now the conception of the logical laws is that they are the rules and norms which control and lead all our mental operations . If then we could discover the laws which the soul consciously , or unconsciously , obeys in all its thinking , we should have reached the source of logic ; and if we could ground them in the nature of the soul itselg we should have demonstrated their universality and necessity ; that is , we should have found , first , that they are laws , and not rules ; and , second , we should have shown why they are laws , or whence they derive their law-power . But this question is not to be answered by any a priori speculation , no matter how pretentious , but by an inductive consideration of the mind itself . No awful voices from the upper air , nor oracular utterances from the " abyssmal depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must decide this question . And since any being manifests its nature only in its activity , we can only hope to discover the nature of the mind by an examination of its activity . It may be that in this way we shall win a conception of ' the mind which shall so thoroughly express its nature , that by mere analysis we shall come upon the logical laws and forms . In this hope the author proposes the question : How do we come to consciousness ? Or , since consciousness is used by the author in a far more restricted sense than our English word , How do we come to definite , specific knowledge ? How do we win definite perceptions of things ? How , in general , does consciousness gain a definite and orderly content ? Nothing easier in the world , says the sensationalist . Here is a square thing ; there is a round one . Here is something hard ; // there something soft . Why , we see things all about us of different sizes , shapes , qualities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are surrounded by a universe full of things ; and we see and hear and touch them , and so on . That is the plain common sense of the matter . If there are logical laws and categories , and mental forms , and all that kind of stuff , concerned in the operation , I do n't know anything about them . We agree most heartily with the latter part of the statement ; but for the rest we must say that our friend has more enthusiasm than knowledge . " A universe full of things " is not given in sensation at all . Physiology proves incontestably that brain vibrations is all that the outer world directly gives us . Vibrations pouring up from skin and muscle , from eye and ear , constitute the psychological sum of sensation . But these vibrations mean nothing of themselves . They are not ideas ; they are not knowledge . They are only excitements of the organism , and of themselves can not go beyond the organism . The projection of the causes of our sensations into space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distance , of magnitude , of things external to the body , is all acquired . Psychology has established this beyond the possibility of question . " The universe full of things , " which the sensationalist thinks he sees , is altogether an acquired perception . The connections and relations of things which he fancies he gains immediately through sensation are all something superadded to the sensations . A sensation is itself and nothing more . It lies unrelated and alone . It is not until it is worked over in thought and compared and related in judgment , that it makes any approach to definite knowledge . Sensation alone is meaningless and chaotic . The fact is unquestionable . Except law and order be imposed upon it , it must remain meaningless and chaotic forever . The sensationalist is invited to explain how these whirling molecules pass into sensation , and how sensation becomes orderly and definite knowledge . His reply needs only to be translated into thought to appear supremely ridiculous . His claim that they impose law and order upon themselves , implies that these emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like and unlike , and unite and separate in endless differentiation and integration , until an orderly frame of knowl // edge is built up . In the first place , this explains nothing ; for it leaves the chasm between thought and motion unbridged ; and , in the second place , it stultifies itself by attributing to these motions the very mental qualities which they are invoked to displace . The importance of the author 's question begins no appear . Sensation is not perception , not knowledge , not thought , not system ; it is nothing but an unrelated , meaningless sensation . The problem is to win from this confused , indefinite mass , the definite and orderly content of knowledge . flow from an internal excitement of the organism do we pass to a definite knowledge of the external world , of things far away , of their various relations , &amp;c. ? How from the blind affections of the soul do we reach clear self-knowledge ? The author 's reply is that knowing is essentially a process of differentiation . To know is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished only through their differences . Remove all difference , and things are identicaL Make it impossible to establish difference among the objects of knowledge , and they remain as indefinite indeterminate chaos . The most fnndamental act of differentiation is that whereby the soul distinguishes between itself and its feelings , thoughts , activities , thereby giving the distinction of subject and object . The necessity of this distinction is admitted by both materialist and idealist . Even grant that the mind is the product of organization , still in all its thinking and knowing it is forced to distinguish between itself as knower and thinker , from the object as known and thought . Or grant with the idealist that the object is only a product of the mind 's own activity , even then the mind is compelled to distinguish between itself and its representations . Objects , again , only become obj ects as they are differenced from one another . To know a thing is to know what it is , in distinction from the other things which surround it . If we were unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , specific qualities , whereby it is distinguished from other things , its definiteness would vanish , and knowledge would become impossible . In brief , a thing is a thing only as it is distinguished from other things ; and it is distinguished only by being different ; and knowing it as a thing consists in the apprehension of it as different from other things . It is // only as we distinguish between our sensations that they acquire any definiteness or meaning . If we hear a confused noise , the mind seeks by attention to detect its import ; and whenever we fail to note peculiarities , that is differences , in the sound whereby it is given a definite meaning , we say , it is wholly undistinguishable . The same is true in vision , in taste , in feeling : all our sensations are indefinite and meaningless until we are able to distinguish them from one another , by noting the peculiar qualities or differences of each . The same is true in science . Nature is tangled , confused , meaningless , until by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Animal and vegetable life are chaos to thought , until some theory is ventured by which the differences of things appear . The chemist 's atoms are also zero to intelligence , until we are able to distinguish them into classes with definite qualities or powers . We have given here only a few hints at the nature of the argument . Whoever would see the position explained at length may examine the author 's own account , either in his Logic , or better , in his Psychology . The conclusion is , that knowledge advances only by a process of continual differentiation , that knowing is essentially differentiation , and that hence the knowing mind is in essence a differentiating activity . Out of this conception of the mind as a differentiating activity , as gaining knowledge solely by a process of differentiation , the author leads his logical theory by simple analysis . At all events , it is plain that we can not stop here . If we accompany the author thus far , we can not refuse to go farther . It is open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception of the mind and the process of knowledge ; but if one can not do this , then he is bound to admit all that analytically flows from the conception . The first deduction is the law of identity and contradiction . To know A and B as objects , they must be distinguished . But if distinguished , they must be conceived as different , and thus placed over against each other . Hence the conception , A is not B , and conversely B is not A , is a necessity of the differentiation . But to conceive A as not B , a positive content must lie in the conception of both A and B. Had they no definite content , no difference could be established . Hence to conceive A as distinguished from B , both A // Ulrici 's Logic . 467 and B must each be conceived as identical with itself . So then to differentiate A and B , that is to know A and B as objects , we must , at least tacitly , implicitly , conceive A and B as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is only to say that all our thinking and knowing is subject to the law of identity and contradiction and the law as law flows directly and necessarily from the conception of the mind as a differentiating activity . Upon this law depend the axioms of matbematics and the divisions and classifications of science . The reason why we believe that like is true of like is simply that all our thinking is and must be ruled by the law of contradiction and identity . The same law plays a most important part in the logic of Induction . The passage from the particular cases examined to the general conclusion , is entirely unwarranted and false , except as we get the idea of a kind , or a like ; and then by the law we pass to the universal conclusion . Like is true of like . Hence , if Brown , Jones , &amp;c. , are mortal , all men are mortal . This law , however , supposes objects to be given . It is another act of differentiation by which objects are furnished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also distinguishes between itself and all its objects . It distinguishes between itself as active , and its thoughts , efforts , &amp;c. , as its act . In this way the distinction of subject and object arises ; which alone makes thought possible . On this act the law of causation depends . The soul distinguishes itself as cause from its thoughts , efforts , &amp;c. , as effects . This is done involuntarily , and for the most part unconsciously , but it is done universally and necessarily , nevertheless . Whether the law of causation applies to the outer world , we shall see hereafter ; for the present this is certain : first , we know nothing of activity except as we get the idea from our personal activity ; and second , this activity we do and must distinguish as cause , from its working as effect . The distinction of cause and effect holds for the only activity which we know directly ; all other activities are , and can be , known only by assimilating them to our own . Hence if there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too comes under this law . If it does not , it is not activity , but only as it comes under this law has it any meaning for thought . // But the distinction of subject from object , and the differentiation of objects from one another , comprises the entire field of possible mental activity . For the first distinction , we have the law of causation ; for the second , the law of identity and contradiction . Hence there are two , and only two , logical laws . All others are either false or but specifications of these two ; and these two flow necessarily from the conception of the mind as a differentiating activity . They are laws because all knowledge is impossible without their application . Is this admitted ? ( and whoever denies it must show that knowledge is not obtained essentially through a process of differentiation ) then we must go farther still . The notion of difference has a weighty content . First , to differentiate two or more things implies a comparison . Things which are uncompared remain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So then the notion of the mind as a differentiating activity implies that it is also a comparing activity ; and we may say that knowledge advances by a process of differentiation , through a process of comparison . Second , the notions of both comparison and difference imply a point of comparison . Without such a point , at least implicitly given , neither likeness nor difference can be discerned . When we hear that two things are alike , we ask in what point they are alike . If they were said to be different , we must always know in what respect they are different . Until one can tell in what point , or relation , two things are alike or different , they are neither alike nor different . One compares two balls . If there is no point in mind in which he compares them , as color , form , size , quality , &amp;c. , the comparison ends in nothing . But when he compares them with reference to some given point , as form , size , &amp;c. , then the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never , deliver themselves upon our consciousness , without at least the implicit presence of mental points of comparison . This truth is valid for the whole scale of knowledge . In science it is not until we set up fixed points of comparison that likeness or difference can be determined . We say let the freezing and boiling points of water serve as fixed points of comparison , and then we are able to distinguish differences of temperature ; but without some standard , all // temperatures would be alike for thought . We are first able to determine the specific gravity of objects , after we have adopted some standard of measurement . Let hydrogen serve as a unit for gases , or water as the unit for liquids or solids , and then we can determine the relations of gases and solids ; but unless some standard is set up , all remain entirely alike to thought . We take the presence of a spinal column as a distinguishing mark in natural history ; and by means of this standard can distinguish the tangled mass of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain form of leaf or some peculiarity of development as distinguishing marks ; and then again the likenesses and differences of things deliver themselves upon knowledge . But in every ease the perception of either depends upon the presence of points of comparison . To know things as either like or unlike we must know in what they are like or unlike . Now all involuntarily and unconsciously we differentiate things in respect to space , time , quantity , quality , &amp;c . The projection of the external world is chiefly a differentiation of things in relation to space . The orderly arrangement of our internal experience is a differentiation in relation to time . The ordinary distinctions we make among things is a differentiation in respect to quantity , quality , form , &amp;c . This is done unconsciously for the most part ; but it is done necessarily . The fundamental differentiations of knowledge are differentiations with relation to space , time , quantity , quality , form , &amp;c . That is , space , time , quantity , quality , &amp;c. , serve as universal points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the logical categories ; and hence we conclude that the categories are simply the universal points of comparison , according to which the soul proceeds in that differentiation whereby it comes to knowledge . Their application , consciously or unconsciously , is the postulate of all knowledge . Whatever we know is won only as we apply them , and hence they must be viewed as being in the strictest sense a priori factors of knowledge . To this the sensationalist may object ; We see that things are differenced in space ; it is a direct perception , and needs no differentiating activity , and all that . The reply is that we see no such thing . An affected organism is all that we directly perceive ; the projection of the physical // world is altogether a mental act of differentiation according to the category of space . In the same way the arrangement of the internal experience is altogether a mental act according to the category of time . Whether things be like or unlike in themselves or not , they can never become like or unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some mental standard . In brief , it is only as the chaos of sensation is differentiated according to the categories of space , time , form , quality , quantity , &amp;c. , that it can furnish us with any object of knowledge whatever . But if this be so , then the categories lie in the nature of the mind , and are the a priori conditions of knowledge . The author 's view then may be summed up as follows : The categories are the universal points of comparison which the mind unconsciously , but necessarily , sets in gaining knowledge . They are the norms according to which it proceeds , the laws which it unconsciously obeys . They are not consciously present , but are implicitly given in the very nature of the mind itself . A given seed contains within it its laws of growth . If it develop at all , it will be along a certain line . An acorn is by its nature determined to develop into an oak . So the author conceives the mind as a nature which contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still bears within it the laws of its activity . It is determined from within and not from without These inner , constitutional determinations , when expressed in words , constitute the so-called intuitions , the laws and categories of logic . These laws , categories , and intuitions , are not originally present as ideas , or notions , but as manifestations of an inner nature , and hence of an inner necessity . The mistake of conceiving the intuitions as originally ideas , exposed them to Locke 's convincing criticism against innate ideas . Such ideas do not exist . Neither the child nor the uncultured man has any mental notion or conception of the law of causation , &amp;c . The mind brings nothing with it but its nature , or the determinations of its nature . But it does bring that ; and because the logical laws and norms are the expression of this nature , therefore they are universally , though unconsciously , followed and obeyed . It lies not in the power of an acorn to develop into a peach tree , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oak . So it lies not in the power of the mind to violate the logical laws arid forms , because those laws and forms are but the expression of that nature , conceived as a differentiating activity . Unconsciousl.y as well as consciously , involuntarily as well as voluntarily , the mind obeys and must obey the laws of thought or logic . At this point there is a marked difference between the author 's conception and that of Kant . Both are alike subjective , but Kant stated his doctrine of mental forms in such a way as to be a kind of fifth wheel to a wagon . In the first place , he does not consider the most fundamental of all questions , the origin of consciousness , at all ; and yet all the categories are really involved in every act of consciousness . If consciousness can originate without the application of his mental forms , there is really no further use for them . In the next place , he viewed them as empty forms , into which the manifold of sensation is subsumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this act of subsumption he gives us no account ; at all events , it is difficult to see how the mind could tell under what forms to subsume a given content , unless it first knew something about it . But if it can know the thing prior to the *ubsumption , the form is unnecessary to knowledge . With greater justice and better logic , the author views the categories , not as forms , but as norms according to which the mind proceeds in every act of knowledge , because these norms are but expressions of its inner nature . This conception of the categories being true , Aristotle* s view of them as being the universal predicaments of things is discredited . Originally , they have nothing to do with the thing . Fundamentally , they are the subjective determinations of thought , and not objective qualities of things . We reach the thing only through their application , and hence can not learn them from the thing . The attempt of Plotinus and the Stoics to make them ontological principles , must also be viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by no means the postulates of being . ilegel 's view , that they are the distinction which thought sets for itself is equally untenable ; because thought consists in thinking ; and thinking // postulates objects of thought , definite ideas , conceptions , &amp;c. ; and these , again , pre-suppose the pre-application of the categories . The inverted procedure of ontological speculation also becomes clear . For the categories are necessary to the construction of all notions of whatever kind ; hence the so-called notion of the absolute is a subjective creation which can not serve as a starting-point of philosophy , until it is proved to have objective validity ;  --  a proof not easily produced . A still more important result is the utter untenability of the experience-philosophy . This doctrine attempts to lead everything back to sensation . But , as we have seen , sensation itself is formless and lawless . It must be interpreted , arranged , differentiated , and integrated before it has any meaning . Hence the claim that we reach the categories by abstraction from the single thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single thing by applying the categories . Besides , even if single things were given , it is only through mental confusion that the belief arises that abstraction is sufficient to explain their origin . We can not get the category of space as an abstraction from coexistences ; for to perceive things as coexistent depends on a differentiation in accordance with this category . No more can the category of time be abstracted from sequences , for the perception of sequence implies the category . The categories of quantity and quality in general can not originate through abstraction , because to see things as different we must know in what they are different ; and hence the categories of quantity and quality must precede the abstraction . So far all has been subjective . Originally , the laws and forms of logic relate altogether to thought , and have no relation to the thing . The law of identity and contradiction is fundamentally a thought-law . The law of causation , too , is only a thought-law . The forms , or categories , are derived from the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing . They are in the strongest sense of the word forms of thought . By means of them we attain to knowledge ; by means of them we reduce the chaos of sensation to the order and unity of thought ; but it by no means follows that they hold of the thing as well as of the thought . All that can be asserted at this stage is , that if there be any external objects to know , they // can be known only as they are subjected to these laws and forms . Precisely because they are thought-laws and forms , a philosophy of human knowledge is possible ; but it may be that the same reason will make ontology forever impossible . Whatever we know can be known only under these laws and forms ; hence the thing-in-itselg to which these forms may not belong , can never come into knowledge . We have next to inquire after the relation of these subjective forms to the objective thing . Kant 's answer to this question is well known . He declared these forms to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing-in-itself . This reality can never come within the circle of knowledge , because in order to do that it must put on the mask of these mental forms , and they so change its appearance that it is itself no longer . Unfortunately , Kant made his assertion without looking before and after . In the first place , if there be no reality in the appearance , it is hard to distinguish the latter from blank illusion ; and besides , if the appearance can exist thus apart from the reality , there is no need of a thing-in-itself to lurk in the background of knowledge like a ghost which disappears the minute one sets eyes on it . In the second place , Kant asserted that the law of causation is only a mental form , and has no application to the thing-in-itself Nevertheless , in his anxiety to save the reality of the outer world , he ascribes a causal efficiency to the external thing ; a position which can not be maintained without denying his system , nor given up without denying the external world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily , this wholesale annihilation of being is rendered unnecessary by the contradictions of the philosopher . Ulrici gives another answer . Before noticing it , however , we must refer to his criterium of certainty . This consists of nothing else than a thought-necessity . All argument of whatever kind , all intuition , all perception produce certainty only as they necessitate us to conceive a fact in a certain way . If they produce in us this thought-necessity , then are we certain that the thing is as we conceive it . When one is suffering from the tooth-ache , he is certain that he has the ache , and the reason is that he can not think the ache away . It clings to him // like an accursed presence ( we write in apprehension of an attack ) ; and forces itself upon him by a necessity which he can not resist . If one has an object in his hand , he can not think it away ; the thing forces itself upon his attention , and necessitates a recognition of its presence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one has a square thing before him , he can not conceive it as round , and the reason is that he is compelled to think it as square . And thought-necessity is not only the only ground of certainty , but it must produce certainty . One may object that a necessity of thought is no proof of a necessity of the thing , but the objection is either a verbal one or a thoughtless one . When I am compelled to think a thing as so , and not otherwise , then I am certain that it is so . When I am uncertain , that means that I am not compelled to conceive it in the given way . But when a true thought-necessity is present , then all doubt is excluded , and only certainty remains . The objection is commonly both verbal and thoughtless ; as if a mathematical student should say , I , indeed , must conceive a circle as round , and must also admit the equality of the radii , &amp;c. ; but then if there were some being who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be equal , and all our doctrines about the circle and sphere would be only relatively true ; they would be true for us , but not true in themselves . True enough . Under the assumed conditions , all these dreadful consequences would surely follow . But what kind of nonsense have we here ? What sort of an argument is this to bring against the reality of our knowledge ? The terms which he has put together in his supposition are words which destroy themselves the moment they are developed into thought . What is a square circle ? Where is this marvelous being who has such miraculous powers of conception ? Let him be produced , before we believe in him . If there be some worthy who can conceive of square circles , triangular spheres , hollow solids , &amp;c , we should like to have accurate information of his whereabouts , before we turn knowledge out of doors on the warrant of this thought-chimera . The entire argument is this : If our knowledge were false , it would not be true . Therefore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is false . Whatever a thought-necessity forces upon us , // we must accept as real ; and the claim that we need not so accept it is impossible except in words . We can speak of a straight-curved line ; but only as we refrain from thinking . So we can speak of the unreality of our knowledge , but only as we refrain from thinking . Furnished with this test of certainty , we have now to examine the relation of thought , form , and thing . Do these subjective laws and forms hold also for objective existence ? Indeed , is there any objective existence ? If so much is subj cctive , is not all subjective ? Against this conclusion we have the law of causation . This law , though originally subjective , forces us to view every event , occurrence , every change in brief as an act , an effect , of an activity or cause . Wherever there is an action , an occurrence , a change of any kind , whether within or without , we are forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves upon us through the senses , of which we are conscious that we are not the cause . We can not escape them ; we can not resist them . We are obstructed , resisted , hemmed in by them . Our effort is resisted , our progress impeded , our way determined by them . There is no escape from concluding that these are real , efficient causes of their effects external to us . The law of causation stands sponsor for the external world ; and so efficiently does it instruct us in the philosophical catechism , that neither madman nor fool , to say nothing of the way-faring man , ever dreams that he is alone in the universe , or rather , that he is the universe . The stoutest idealist never dreamed , in his most exalted moments , of teaching that his fellow-men are only notions of his own . The entire flood of idealistic speculation might be launched against the most idealistic speculator , without in the least shocking his knowledge of the reality of the external world . The fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not denied the reality of things without , but have attempted to teach what this externality is . What is this external world which forces itself upon us ? What is its inmost nature ? Is it dead matter , or is it a spiritual activity ? But this is not idealism ; it admits the reality of things , and seeks to reach their inner essence , their substantial nature . But strict idealism must deny the existence of all but the philosopher , and reduce // the entire universe to notions of the lonely dreamer . But this view is rendered absolutely impossible by the law of causation . The notion can be represented only in words ; no one ever entertained or can entertain the thought , We are not only forced to admit external objects , but also to admit that these objects are differentiated from one another . For the effects produced by them are different ; and by the law of identity and contradiction , we are forced to assume that unlike effects can only spring from unlike causes . A further experience forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to form , quantity , quality , position , &amp;c . We can not assume that the triangle and the square are identical in themselves . They affect us differently , and the law of identity and contradiction necessitates the assumption of unlike causes for the unlike effects . In the same way we are forced to admit that things are differenced in respect to quality , differenced in themselves , and not merely with reference to our thought . The same can be shown with reference to the other categories . We are not only forced to assume that things are differenced in themselves , but that they are differenced according to the logical categories of space , form , quantity , quality , &amp;c . But wherever there is a real difference , we must assume the law of identity and contradiction to be valid . We can not conceive of difference at all , except in connection with this law . So then we are forced to admit the reality of external objects ; we are forced to subject them to the law of causation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive them as differenced , and differenced according to the logical categories . This then is the author 's conception of the relation of thought and thing ' Thought - laws are also thing-laws . The laws and forms which rule the internal thought , govern also the external thing . Neither , however , is derived from the other . We reach the laws of the thing only by means of the thought-laws ; but when we do reach them , they are really laws of the thing , and not subjective forms which we have imposed upon the thing . Things really have form , quality , causal efficiency , apart from any thought of ours . The thing is not subject to the thought , neither is thought subject to the thing ; but thought and thing agree . // But what does this agreement mean ? The laws and forms of mind prove to be the laws and forms of nature also . The astronomy which we study upon a piece of paper actually holds for the motions of the stars . The predictions which we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature hastens to fulfill . The connection which holds between thought is ever prophetic of relations between things . The divinations of the soul are the deeds of nature . The astronomer grows uneasy at the lawless movements of Uranus . The mind says , if nature is rational , there must be a disturbing body of a certain size in a certain quarter of the heavens . The telescope is pointed thither , and Neptune appears to vindicate the methods of the astronomer and the rationality of nature . But what does this agreement mean ? If thought-forms were not also thing-forms , a knowledge of nature would , indeed , be impossible ; because whatever we know must be known under these forms ; and if nature were intractable to them , it must remain forever without our knowledge . But why should not nature remain without our knowledge ? What necessity is there that nature should be known ? Why should it not stand over against us as an eternal x ? Instead of being subject to the laws and forms of thought , why should it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , z ? In brieg the laws of thought are the laws of nature . The forms of thought are the forms of nature . The differentiating activity of nature is one which obeys thought-laws , and proceeds according to thought-forms . This agreement of thought-forms and thing-forms , this pliability of nature to the purposes of mind , alone fits the world to be the training-school of intelligence ; and this agreement can only be viewed as a pre-established harmony ; which in turn must be viewed as the work of an activity which proceeds according to logical laws and forms , that is , as the work of a Rational Mind . Such is the author 's conclusion ; and we must confess our complete agreement with it . The importance and signification of the fact that nature can be known and interpreted at all , has never been properly estimated . Unless nature 's methods are rational they can not be known . Unless nature obeys the laws which control our thought , it can never come into knowledge . The very knowability of nature postulates absolutely this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whoever will be at the pains to clear his thought of confusion , and to put a content into his ideas , will see that the harmony of nature to the purposes of knowledge and intelligence assumes that nature is either informed with intelligence , or is the product and expression of intelligence . The author reaches the same conclusions , again , by a consideration of the moment of relativity which lies in the conception of difference . Only those things can be differenced which are related and in some sense identical . in order that two objects be absolutely differenced , one must be conceived as being and the other as not-being . But not-being is nothing , and hence with the last element of relation the object vanishes into nothingness . Only the related , then , or those things which have something in common , can be differenced . But the differences of each depend upon the other . A thing is what it is only in distinction from , and relation to , another . The properties of a thing are its differences from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only upon itself but also upon those others from which it is differenced . Hence if we consider external objects as differenced , we must consider them also as related . If we conceive them as having different properties , we must conceive those properties as existing not in themselves alone , but as postulating other objects . These , however , are in the same dilemma ; each postulates another , which , in turn , postulates a third , and so on . To apply this to the atoms into which science seeks to resolve the physical universe . Science is inclined to view all things as arising from the combination of certain ultimate elements , which are endowed with definite qualities or powers ; and from a confused conception of these elements , not a few have imagined that such a mass of atoms might have existed from eternity , and hence may be entirely independent But the belief rests really on subjective confusion , and not on objective fact . For these atoms are conceived as differentiates-as having peculiar powers . But each atom is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to another . Thus oxygen depends upon hydrogen and the other elements with which it combines for those peculiar modes of working // which we call its properties , as well as upon itself . To change the oxygen would change its properties . In brief , every atom depends for its definite properties upon the nature and properties of all the rest . Each one is the condition of the others . Hence all are conditioned and dependent ; and the atomic differences , or qualities , because of this mutual conditioning of one another , can not be viewed as unoriginated , but must be thought as established . The atoms can not be viewed as the primal source of things . This appears more clearly still , if we consider their activity . An atom absolutely alone would have no power whatever ; it is only in relation to another that it can be active . All atomic working is a relative , a conjoint working . But such a working can not be independent . In its very conception it is conditioned upon the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dependent upon the entrance of its condition . If the condition were always present the action would be eternal . Hence the commencement of any atomic working postulates the pre-entrance of its condition . But this entrance is also an action , which is impossible without the entrance of its condition . But this second entrance is in the same predicament ; and so on in indefinite regress . But this regress can not be infinite ; because in that case we should have a series of activities which is at once eternal and not eternaL Eternal because infinite ; and not eternal because the series could not begin without the previous activity of its condition . 1f then , we look upon the world as a collection of different objects ; or if with the scientist , we view it as essentially the product of differentiated atoms ; in neither case can we view this variety , this manifoldness , as independent and self-existent , but must rather view it as originated and established . The relativity which lies in the notion of difference compels us to conceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which proceeds according to mental methods ; that is , we must view this differentiation as originated and established by a Rational Mind . Hence it appears that the categories have not only a logical , but also a metaphysical value . They are in origin purely formal , but are found to have an ontological application . The author 's view includes those doctrines which we have just // denied . Aristotle was right in saying that the categories are universal predicaments of things ; for the formal , logical laws are now seen to be also ontological laws . The Stoics were right in viewing the categories as the determinations of things , because things are actually determined according to them . Plotinus was right in teaching that they are the metaphysical prius of the thing ; for a thing is a thing only as it is distinguished from others , and this distinction implies the application of the categories . ilegel was right in considering them as the universal determinations of thought . But all these committed the error of looking upon the categories as originally metaphysical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proved , or which involves insoluble contradictions . We believe that there is no possibility of either logic or metaphysics unless we hold , with the author , to the purely formal character of the thought-laws and forms . If ontology be at all possible , it will only be as we are compelled by these laws and forms to ontological assumptions . The argument thus far may be summed up as follows : We reach definite knowledge only through a process of differentiation . But this process implies laws and norms . The laws are those of identity and contradiction and of causation . The norms are the fundamental logical categories . Only through the application of these can we gain any definite idea , thought , perception . With this proof the sensational philosophy is remanded to silence or dogmatism . But these laws and norms compel us to recognize an outer world , which is also subject to thought-laws and forms ; and this is intelligible only as the work of a Rational Mind . With this proog atheism is driven out of philosophy to take irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifoldness of the external world , again , can only be viewed as originated , and hence as postulating an originator . With this proof pantheism ceases to have any rational ground , and sinks to the level of an illogical heresy . Finally , these laws and forms , being expressions of the essential nature of the mind , are necessary and universal in human thought . Hence , whatever knowledge flows from them is universally valid . // Such is the author 's doctrine of the categories in general . They are not innate ideas , for there is no such thing . For philosophic thought , they become general notions , by the same process of difference and comparison through which we gain all our general notions . But fundamentally , and in essence , they are the universal points of comparison , the norms of differentiation according to which the mind proceeds in gaining knowledge . But it does not yet appear what notions arc to be viewed as categories . The next thing is to answer this question . This point we must pass over somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . The author distinguishes four classes : primary categories , categories of simple nature ( Beschaffenheit ) , categories of relation , and categories of order . Under the first class fall the categories of Being , of Activity and Act , of Space , and of Time . These express the most fundamental norms of differentiation , whence their designation . Whether they represent external relations or not , they do express the most essential conditions of our knowledge . IRemove them , and thought lapses into indistinguishable chaos . Under the second class come the categories of quantity and quality , with their subdivisions . These are also categories , because they rule everywhere and necessarily in thought . The child and the uncultured man , no less than the philosopher , apply these norms . They are necessary , too , to give definiteness to the differentiations under the primary categories . That things should be differenced in relation to Being , Activity , Space , and Time alone , would give us no exact knowledge . It is only as the more definite differentiations , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we attain to a knowledge of definite things . These two classes of categories are the conditions of knowledge in general . Upon them rest the principles of mathematics , and all the fragmentary disconnected knowledge of common life . The last two classes , the categories of relation and of order , are essentially ca*tegories of scientific knowledge . They are indeed more or less applied in the every-day judgments of men , but they find their chief application and importance in their relations to science . e // It will scarcely be questioned by anyone that the first two classes of categories are valid for things as well as thoughts . Objects are really differenced in space and time , in quantity , quality , activity , &amp;c . We are forced to assume a manifold of external things , and to admit that these are really subject to the two logical laws , and are differenced according to the simple logical categories . These laws and categories , then , bring us face to face with an indefinite multitude of things which differ in quantity , quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manifold to the unity of scientific or systematic knowledge ? Whatever be the fact of nature , it is unquestionable that this manifold can become systematic knowledge for us only as we can reduce it to order , separate it into classes , subject it to law . If there is no system in nature , we must impose one upon it . If there be no order in nature , we must invent one . If there be no laws really controlling the activities of external things . we must imagine them . If there be no classes or kinds in fact , we can not dispense with them in theory . Until this is done , nature remains for thought a chaotic collection of individuals ; without rational connection , without order , without unity . System is a necessity , and the very essence of science . Law , order , unity are the goal towards which science unconsciously but necessarily strives . Whether this order represents anything more than a subjective necessity is a question , but it is beyond all doubt that it does really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and knowledge relapses into an intractable , unknowable confusion . Abolish the laws in whose pattern science believes the web of the universe is woven , and once more chaos comes again . What now are the norms according to which science proceeds in reducing the manifold of creation to the unity and system of knowledge ? A first necessity is the formation of general notions , or concepts , under which individuals can be united . Under such general terms as man , plant , animal , metal , mineral , we subsume the individuals of the several classes , and thereby are enabled to gain a general outlook upon the multiplicity of nature . In the same way the conception of chemical affinity enables us to unite in one thought the myriad chemical char*es // which are forever going on . The conception of gravitation makes it possible to collect the siderial movements and the greater part of terrestrial motion into one general thought . By the aid of the two notions , organic and inorganic , we distinguish all material existence into two great classes . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again ; or we invert the process and from the lower proceed to the higher and more general . Gold , silver , iron , copper , &amp;c. , we unite under the one notion , metal . Granite , feldspar , quartz , trap , &amp;c. , we unite under the more general notion of stone . Stones , metals , &amp;c. , are subsumed under the notion , mineral . In the organic world , too , the implicit aim is classification , through the formation of general notions . We distinguish species , genera , orders , classes , types ; and these notions with their subdivisions serve as guides to our investigation . Without the process thus roughly sketched all science is impossible . Not only must thing be distinguished from thing , but class must be distinguished from class , and type from type , to make systematic knowledge possible . Until this is done , we are lost in the bewildering multitude of individuals , and are as far from science as a dictionary is from a discourse . Without the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Without that of gravitation , there is no possibility of relating the multiform movements of the earth and heavens so as to make them subjects of knowledge . Without organic classifications the scientific mind is lost in utter bewilderment . Whether the notions we form correspond to any objective reality , may be questioned , but at all events we must form them . All unconsciously , but necessarily , the process of generalization , the forming of classes , &amp;c .. goes on . Before science was dreamed of , the human mind was busy comparing and generalizing ; and the work of science in this direction is only an attempt to give greater exactness and extension to this process . Hence from this subjective necessity , the author concludes that the notion in general is a logical category ; meaning thereby that it is a norm given in the nature of our thought , according to which our thinking proceeds and must proceed in those differentiations which are essential to knowledge . // Again , in nature nothing stands , but all things flow . Nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a constant activity , with its correlate of constant change . This necessitates new postulates as the condition of scientific knowledge . If nature is not to relapse into indistinguishable confusion , this activity must be an orderly one . There must be law there . Science assumes this necessarily . It never questions the existence of law , but only seeks to determine what it is . Whether there really are controlling laws in nature , whereby the multiform activities of things are governed , may be questioned ; but at all events , without such assumption science is impossible . Only as we are enabled to find in the unceasing change of things an abiding , unchangeable order , which all change obeys , are we enabled to look before and after . Without this conception , we are shut up in the present , and cut off alike from the past and the future . What has been , we can not tell ; what will be , is impossible to predict . The stream of things has no definite course , and knowledge is entirely impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no abiding order in nature , we must invent one in order to bring it within the possibility of knowledge . The mind necessarily assumes the existence of laws in nature , and with this assumption another is implicitly made . Our own activity , so far as it is rational , has an end in view . We distinguish between our activity as means and our purpose as end . When , then , borrowing our conception of activity from our own consciousness , we attempt to extend that conception over external nature , we are forced to attribute to this activity all that belongs to our own . The activities of nature obey definite laws ; they oppose and yet harmonize with each other in such a way that each supports the others , and all together effect an orderly and harmonious working . To such an activity we can not help attributing purpose ; at least , if we do , it is only by dwelling in the fog of confused ideas . Whether there be purpose in nature or not , nature never becomes intelligible to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purpose . The balance of attraction and inertia , whereby the central and tangential forces are equalized , is only intelligible as having for its end the maintenance of the planets ' orbits . The law of chemical proportions , whereby alone the constant chemical // changes are prevented from plunging nature into chaos , is only intelligible as the result of purpose . The revolution of the planets on their axes , whereby a constant inequality of heat is maintained , and terrestrial life and motion are made possible , is , again , only intelligible as we suppose it planned with reference to this end . But not to offer any more illustrations , nature becomes intelligible to us only as we view it as the result of a plan . Whether there be any plan is a question , but we must assume such a plan in order to bring it into the unity of systematic knowledge . From this necessity of our thought the author concludes that purpose in general is a logical category . We seek involuntarily to find not only what nature is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we necessarily apply the idea of purpose as a norm of differentiation . But if we must separate things into kinds and classes , and if we must view these as expressions of purpose , science is compelled to sum up all these several purposes in one great overruling purpose  --  the idea . If these subordinate purposes , activities , classes , &amp;c. , do not harmonize , then nature is at war with itself , and the possibility of the final unity of science is destroyed . This unity , however , can only consist in a thought , which ruled in the beginning in those primary determinations from which all things may have flowed , and for whose realization the whole creation exists . If the sciences are a unit , i fnature is an order and not a discord , then from the centre to the circumference of creation , from the beginning to the end , there must be a ruling thought in which al lower thoughts are taken up and united . Whatever may be possible to absolute science , human science becomes possible only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds and classes , only by subjecting them to the reign of law , and making them the expressions of a purpose ; and attains its final , highest unity , only by gathering up all these lower purposes into the harmony and unity of one all-controlling purpose , thought , idea , in which all else finds its explanation , and towards which the whole creation moves . Because of this necessity of our thought , the author makes the idea the last and highest of the logical categories ; it is the category which we must apply in our attempts to reach the highest unity of knowl // ledge . Until this is done , science remains unsatisfactory and incomplete ; when it is done , science has reached its goal , and the mind is satisfied . But here , again , we must remember that all this is purely subjective . We should completely misinterpret the author 's view if we did not keep this fact in mind . These higher categories , like the simpler ones , express originally only subj ective needs ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This inquiry does not properly belong to logic , hut to metaphysics or theories of knowledge . Logic is concerned only with the investigation of the subjective laws and forms which knowledge and thought must obey and assume . When , then , it has proved that all knowledge must be subordinate to these subjective needs , and that scientific knowledge , in particular , involuntarily and necessarily proceeds according to the categories of relation and race , its work is done . But since we have already seen that the simple categories also correspond to things , we may leave the logical field once more , and inquire whether these higher categories correspond to objective nature . Are there laws and purposes , kinds and classes in the external world ? Here again the author departs from Kant . Hitherto we have found him in complete agreement with Kant as to th e subjective origin of our mental forms , but asserting , in opposi tion to him , an objective validity for them . The same opposition appears here . Kant admitted the subjective necessity of these higher forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only subjective validity . The author , however , insists upon their objective worth ; and views the denial as resting upon confused notions instead of objective fact . No scientist would d*ny the existence of law , though many would question the presence of purpose . The laws themselves , they say , are sufficient to explain all that seems to be the outcome of a plan . Not unless we have become properly muddled in our ideas . Adopting the generally received atomic theor.y , we must say that the possibility of a law of atomic working rests altogether upon the atoms themselves . The nature of the atoms must be such that , in spite of their differ* ences , they may unite in a harmonious working . But from an // examination of the element of relativity which lies in the notion of difference , we have already seen that these atomic differences and relations can not be viewed as unoriginated . Hence the laws to which the scientist so confidently appeals must be viewed as imposed . The nature of the atoms was determined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rules again can only be viewed as selected with reference to an ulterior end . If , then , the scientist were able to lead all things back to his hypothetical atoms , he can not stop here , but must go behind them to a Power which determined them and their laws in accordance with a preexisting plan and purpose . This general proof is most strongly supported by experience . So plain do the marks of purpose appear as we observe the special activities of nature , that we are forced either to admit a purpose , or fall back on the positivistic position , that things are as they are , and there is no more to be said about it . This position , however , is tenable only in word . Its most determined supporters , as well as its author , have always been triumphantly successful in stultifying themselves . Here we can not do better than translate the author 's note : " Involuntarily the thought forces itself upon us that the attraction of the sun and the tangential force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planets may maintain their regular elliptical course around the sun ; - that the earth constantly radiates as much heat into space as it receives from the sun in order to secure that disturbance and reestablishment of the equilibrium of heat which is necessary to the maintenance of physical , chemical , and organic processes ; - that the simple elements of organic nature unite only in definite , constant proportions in order that , in spite of the continual change under the influence of light , heat , and electricity , the same classes of mineral bodies may ever be reproduced ; - that the soil holds fast to all those elements which are necessary to the nourishment of plants , giving up none of them to the filtering rain-water , but on the contrary depriving the water of all these elements , in order that plants may find their necessary nourishment , and the plant-kingdom may be preserved ,  --  that the atmosphere is composed as it is , and that this // composition , though continually disturbed by the breathing of animals , is continually restored through the life-processes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . * ** Not from walking and work , but beforehand , in the womb , the sole of the foot and the inner surface of the hand cover themselves with a thicker skin . Among all the higher animals the lungs , the eye , the ear , form in the womb or egg long before there is any contact with the air , or any affection of the auditory or optic nerve through the ether , or sound-vibrations . And everywhere these organs are formed in exact agreements not only with the circumstances of the animal , but also with the nature of the light and air ; - as , indeed , they must be , if lungs , eyes , and ears are to fulfifl their purpose . Even the eye of the fish is constructed in exact conformity to the law of refraction in water , while it*s gills correspond exactly to the denser element which for fishes supplies the place of air . The human body maintains its existence only as the blood receives and removes from every single part whatever is worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bones it deposits phosphate of lime , in the muscles nitrogen , in the salivary glands saliva , in the ears ear-wax , in the eyes a crystalline substance , in the nails and hair hornmaterial , in the nerves brain-substance , in the gall-bladder gall , in the glands of the stomach the par*creatic juice , in the intestinal canal mucus , in the kidneys urine , in the lungs carbonic acid : everything at the right time and place , in due quantity and proper proportion , exactly as the needs of the whole and the functions of each single organ demands . This process repeats itself , mutatis mutartdis , in all animals and , though in simpler form , in all plants . And in order that it may be completed , there is necessary not only a harmonious working and a constant equivalence of the great forces of inorganic nature , but also a continual disturbance of this equilibrium which , however , must never go beyond a certain limit , and must always return again to equilibrium . " ( p. 222 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether we contemplate its specific working , the conviction forces itself irresistibly upon us that the subjective category of purpose is au objective fact of nature . The conclusion can be escaped // only by taking shelter in the friendly fog of meaningless phrases , and heroically refusing to think . The question whether nature is really classified meets with a similar answer . We can , to be sure , form classes indefinitely by adopting artificial standards . In this way we could form classes which should cross and recross one another , and which would express only a subjective classification . Still we can not help thinking that there is a natural , as well as an artificial , classification of things . Kepler declares that , in the order of nature , he thinks the thoughts of God ; and Agassiz insists that a just and thorough classification is an interpretation of the Creator 's thoughts . This , indeed , is the goal towards which rational science must strive , if it is to have any more than a subjective value . Even admitting a doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have the various branches of the tree of life developed from a common stem ? they are different branches now . However kinds may have originated , they are in actual existence . A man is neither a tree nor a toad , a mouse is neither an elephant nor a whale . Whatever bridges may have originally existed between these kinds , they are plainly broken down . There is a real and essential difference now existing between the various classes in the organic kingdom . In the inorganic we find the same fact . The elements are separable into classes ; and so are their compounds . Gold is not lead ; iron is not copper ; limestone is not granite . An actual classification exists in nature . If the objector should claim that he can lead all the order of nature back to atomic combinations , and suggest the possibility of deducing even the chemical elements themselves from a common root , still he has not escaped the conclusion . For in that case this power which lies at the foundation of nature has differentiated itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would exist in the predetermination of that power . Lead all things back to a single activity , if you will ; that activity actually proceeds according to the logical category of kinds . Whatever has come out of it was in it . If you view it as free , the point is granted . If you view it as conditioned , then it owes the determinations upon which its development depends to the unconditioned behind it . In either case the // kinds and classes of nature abut on intelligence , and can only be viewed as the development of a thought . Logically we proceed from the individual to the universal , hut ontologically the idea is first  --  the old Platonic standpoint . Thus we reach once more , but in a wider and more intimate sense , our previous conclusion that the laws of thought are the laws of nature . Thought is the pattern in whose diamond plan the web of the world is woven . Thought is the pKes and the goal of things . The prius because in accordance with it nature received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole creation works towards its realization . The particu. lar purposes of nature are only to be discovered by examination , but the mind insists that there is purpose of some kind there . What it is we shall never fully discover . Of lower purposes we may learn something , but that primal thought , that final purpose moves far above our heads and is hidden from our sight . The clouds which are on the slope forbid ns to view the summit . But both subjective need and objective fact alike compel us to assume its existence . We conclude , then , that the mind brings to the study of the universe the form of knowledge in general , and nature or experience fills up the outline . Each is meaningless without the other . Form alone is void , content alone is chaos . By the mutual interaction of the two , the solid structure of knowledge is built up , and a living advance is won . Such is a general outline of the author 's theory . Having conceived the mind as a differentiating activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an activity must obey . Those principles without which differentiation in general would be impossible are the logical laws . Those norms which lead the differentiation are the logical categories . It will be seen that the author uses the word category in a more extended sense than it commonly receives . Instead of serving for the small list of predicaments of the Aristotelian or Kantian table , it stands for any norm of differentiation . The subdivision of the categories , the origin of our general notions , the polemic against the abstraction-theory , the doctrine of the judgment , the examination of the notions of Being , Substance , Chauge* we are compelled to pass over These last-meutiorted uo // tions lie at the bottom of both science and philosophy ; and misconceptions of their meanin have been the cause of nearly every error from the time of the Eleatics down to the latest theoretical abortion . A misconception of Being caused the Eleatics to deny the possibility Nearly every philosophy has felt called upon to deny the possibility of change and motion for the same reason . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know of none so satisfactory , none which so successfully steers clear of the contradictions which from the beginning have clung to these notions upon which all knowledge rests . It will be seen at once that the work is not a logic in the common sense of the word . Barbara , ( darerit , and the rest of that unfortunate family are let severely alone . The aim of the work is to examine the subjective laws and forms of knowledge and thought , and to investigate the content of those fundamental notions on which all knowledge is based . We agree most heartily with the author in this aim . The whole machinery of words is utterly useless for purposes of reasoning . Clear notions necessitate right reasoning , and confused notions will result in confusion in spite of Barbara &amp; Co . We conceive that the great want of to-day , whether in science , philosophy , or religion , is clear notions ; and the only hope of escaping from the universal Babel which raves about us lies altogether in this direction . Thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cursed from the beginning with meaningless phrases , which from long use are supposed to have some miraculous content ; and with shapes of thought , which have lurked like ghosts in the background of knowledge , to the great advantage of error , and to the intense alarm of persons of weak nerves . For the clearing out of these myths and mischiefs , we look upon the book in hand as a most valuable ally . Taken in connection with the author 's other works , we know of no other discussion in which the conditions and the limits of knowledge are drawn with so clear an eye and so steady a hand . The author is distinguished from the traditional German speculator in many important respects : 1st , in always // meaning something ; 2d , in always knowing what he means ; 3d , a clear expression of his meaning ; 4th , by a profound regard for fact as distinguished from baseless speculation . Thus far we have contented ourselves with exposition . In conclusion , we must say that this logical question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , philosophy is only dogmatism , irrational , and baseless . Let it then be settled . Let the possibility and the limit of knowledge be inquired into . The author 's position is a most sweeping one , and its truth is a matter of great interest . If , then , any one has aught to offer against the leading principle here expounded , we hope that he will not fail to urge it ; and we promise him in advance a cordial and a candid hearing .
