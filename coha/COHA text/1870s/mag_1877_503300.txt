O *TE of the earliest records of modern history in regard to the race which peopled the old England and the New refers to its beauty . Most of us have heard the story : how three young captives , brought from an almost unknown island on the verge of civilization , and indeed at the western limit of the then known world , were exposed for sale in Rome , and how Gregory the Great , not yet Pope , seeing them , was struck by their beauty and asked what they were , and being told , Angli ( English ) , replied " Non Angli , sed angeli " ( not Angles , but angels ) ; which was a tolerable pun for a future Pope and saint . This was twelve hundred years ago ; and since that time the English race has enjoyed the reputation ( subject to some carping criticism , due to the self-love of other peoples ) of being the handsomest in the world . It is well deserved ; indeed , if it were not , it would long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impression made upon Gregory was greatly due to the fair complexion , blue eyes , and golden brown hair of the English captives , which , indeed , are mentioned in the story . For southern Europe is peopled with dark-skinned , dark-haired races ; and the superior beauty of the blonde type was recocrnized by the painters , who always , from the earliest days , represented angels as of that type . The Devil was painted black so much as a matter of course that his pictured appearance gave rise to a well-known proverb ; ordinary mortals were represented as more or less dark ; celestial people were white and golden-haired whence the epithet " divinely fair . " When therefore the good Gregory saw the fair , blue-eyed English youths , his comparison was at once suggested , and his pun was almost made to his hand . And I am inclined to believe that it is of much later origin , although he ought to have made it ; just as Sidney Smith ought to have said to Landseer , when he asked the Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant a dog that he should do the thing ? " and as the innkeeper ought to have said to Mr. Seward that he was not Governor of New York , but " Thurlow Weed , by thunder ? " but did not . In each of these cases , however , and in all such , a significant fact is at the bottom of the story , which otherwise would have no reason for its being . It is hardly true , however , that other races do not produce individuals approaching as nearly to an ideal standard of beauty as any that are seen among the English . These are found , as we all know , among the various Latin races , the Celts and the Sclaves , and even , as Mr. Julian Hawthorne himself would hardly venture to deny , among the Teutons , the very Saxons themselves . Who has not seen French women and French men , Italians , Spaniards ; Russians , Poles , Irish , and even Germans of both sexes , distinguished by striking and captivating personal beauty both of face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race appears to be in a marked degree above that of all others . Among a thousand men and women of that race there will not only be found more " beauties " than among the same number of other races , but the majority will be handsomer , " finer , ** more symmetrically formed , better featured , with clearer skins , and a more dignified bearing and presence than the majority of any other European race with which they may be compared . A notion was for some time in vogue that this English distinction did not obtain in America , but that the race had degenerated here . It was a mere notion , having its origin in a prejudiced perversion of isolated facts ; // qwq I learned from the remarks of two English friends to me in this country . Some years ago I took one , a gentleman who had travelled a good deal , and who held an important position in the Queen 's household  --  and a very outspoken man he was  --  to a " private view , " at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just enough people to fill the rooms pleasantly . As we sat together after a tour , looking at the company , I asked him to tell me the difference between the people he saw there and those he would see on a like occasion at the Royal Academy . He sat looking around him in silence for so long a time that I thought he was going to pass my question unnoticed , when he - said , " I can see no difference ; none at all ; except that there would not be quite so many pretty women there , and that there would be more stout old people . " The other , a lady , who also did not hesitate in her criticisms , remarked that the chief difference in appearance between people of the same condition here and in England was that here she " did n't see any fat old men . " S/ic said nothing about fat old women ; not , however , that she herself was either fat or old . There is this difference among old people ; although even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a certain color of truth to the notion I have referred to . English men and women do not always grow stout and red-faced as they grow old ; but after they have passed middle age more of them do tend to rubicundity and to protuberant rotundity of figure than people of the same age do in " America . " The cause , I am quite sure , is simplybeer . Both the color and the rotundity come to a large proportion of the Americans who live in England and drink English beer , in English allowance ; which , it need hardly be said , could not be the case if there had been any essential change in the type of the race . But among men under forty and women under thirty , the difference either in complexion or figure is almost inappreciable . As to the women , there are at least as many in England who are spare and angular of figure as here , and of those who have not passed thirty I think rather more . The London " Spectator " said some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , that " scragginess was more common in England among women than stoutness " ; and it is remarkable that the French caricatures of Englishwomen always represent them as thin , bony , and sharp-featured . In this of course there is a little malice ; but it shows the impression left upon the French people by their near neighbors . I can not do better here than to offer my readers , in the following passage , a share in one of my letters written home ; it has at least the advantage of recording on the spot impressions received by me after careful examination under the most favorable circumstances . I was writing about the beauty of the parks : " It is amazing to see the great space of this little island that these English folk have reserved for air , and health , and beauty ; and it is for all , the poorest and meanest as well as the richest and noblest ; there are no privileged classes in this . As to the effect upon their health , I suppose it must be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who is very strong upon the subject of degeneracy , which I have always doubted will laugh and say that it was a foregone conclusion with me , but to set aside my inference he will be obliged to take the position that there is nothing so misleading as facts , except figures . I have now seen many hundreds of thousands of Englishmen and Englishwomen of all classes . I have placed myself in pcsitions to examine them closely . At the great Birmingham musical festival my seat gave me full view of the house , chorus and all . The vast hall was filled with peop1c of the middle and upper middle // classes , and at one end with members of the highest aristocracy , who occupied seats roped off from the rest , and called the President 's seats - the President being the Marquis of Hertford . At the end of the performance , both evening and morning , I hastened to a place where a great part of the audience would pass close before me . At Westminster Abbey I stood again and again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; I have done the same in swarming railway stations ; I have walked through country villages and cathedral towns ; I know the human physiognomy of all quarters of London pretty well ; I have seen the Guards and the heavy dragoons , and I say without any hesitation that thus far I find that the men and the women are generally smaller and less robust than ours , and above all that the women are on the whole sparer and less blooming than ours . The men are ruddier on the while ; that is , there are more ruddy men here ; but the number of men without color in their cheeks seems to be nearly the same as with us . The apparent inconsistency of what I have said is due to the fact that the ruddy men and women here are generally so very red that they produce a great impression of redness , an impression that lasts and remains salient in the memory . A delicately graduated and healthy bloom is not very common . And so the fat women are so very fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . But the little London gent , ' with whom Leech has made us so familiar , you meet everywhere in the great city . Sunday before last , loitering in the cloisters of Westminster , I stopped to look at a tablet in the wall . There were three of these men before me , and the number soon increased to seven . I looked over the hats-round felt hats-of the whole seven without raising my chin . I remember that like Rosalind I am more than common tall , ' but I never did anything like that at home . At the Horse Guards they put their finest men as sentinels , mounted , on each side of the gate . Well , they are fine fellows , and would be very uncomfortable chaps to meet , except in a friendly way ; a detachment of them riding up St. James 's street the other morning , with their curiasses like mirrors , and the coats of their big black horses almost as bright , was a spectacle which it seemed to me could not be surpassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter business in a fight ; but Maine , or Vermont , or Connecticut , or Kentucky can turn out whole regiments of bigger and stronger men . Colonel NE- , whom I met in Canada , said the same to me when he thought he was talking to an Englishman . I wonder that he ever forgave me the things he said to me during his brief self-deception ; for they were true . But* he was a good fellow and bore no malice . Nevertheless , you sometimes meet here a very 1*ne man , or a big , blooming beauty , and in either case the impression is stronger and more memorable than in a like case it is apt to be with us ; chiefly , I think , because of their dress and set up , ' which in such cases-as in that of the Guards and Dragoons-is apt to be very pronounced . " I will add here , in passing , that this English " set up , " particularly in the case of almost all Englishmen of any pretensions , is distinctive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of superior good looks and strength on their side . It appears in a marked degree in all military persons , rank and file as well as officers , and in the police force , the men of which are on the whole inferior in stature and bulk to ours-leaving the big Broadway squad , most of them Yankees , out of the question  --  and yet it is far superior in appearance to ours , owing to the " set up " of the men , and the way in which they car1*y themselves . I observed that although the upper classes contained a fair proportion , although no notable excess , of large and well-formed men and wo // men , the burly men and the big-bodied , heavy-limbed women were generally of the lower and the lower middle class . This made me wonder where all the pretty housemaids and shop girls came from ; for the prettiest faces , the most delicately blooming complexions , and the finest figures that I saw in England were among them . In a letter written from the Rose Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the following passage , which is to the purpose : " I ate my bacon and eggs this morning in the coffee room , where at another table were three queer Englishwomen , yet nice looking-apparently a mother and two daughters . The elder daughter was , I will not say a lathy girl , but very slim not only in the waist , but above and below it . The mother and the younger were plump and rosy , absurdly alike , and with that cocked-up nose which is one of the very few distinctive peculiarities of figure that you see here , but even this very rarely ; and their black hair was curled in tight curls all over their heads . I was struck by this , because curling hair is comparatively rare here , and I had expected to find it common . It was cut just like a man 's , and plainly so because it would have been impossible to dress it if it were allowed to grow long in woman fashion . They were very jolly and pleasant , chaffing each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet laughter . They looked just like boys masquerading in women 's clothes ; for the eldest was quite young looking and may have been and elder sister . The youngest , who was some seventeen or eighteen years old , looked very fair and blooming across the room , but when I came close to her , which I had an opportunity of doing , I found that her color , both white and red , was coarse , which is very often the case here when there is color . In the mother , or eldest sister , this coarseness was apparent even at a distance . But see , Lady and her daughters , although pretty and elegant , had no tinge of color in their checks , and they were all as thin as rails , and the girls ' hair , as well as their mother 's , was as straight as fiddle strings . I came here expecting to see golden curls in plentiful crops , or at least not uncommonly . But it seems to me that I have n't seen a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have seen them  --  the children-by tens of thousands , and examined them closely , making memorandums of my observation . Nor have the ladies of this family ( I am now at ) , Lady and Mrs. any more bloom than this paper , and they are both as thin as Lady and her daughters ; Mrs. painfully so . The men , belonging of course to another family , are stout , well-built fellows enough , but the two other guests are as lean as greyhounds . I went to a little dinner party the other evening , and the carriage sent to the station for me ( for they think nothing here of asking yo* fifteen or twenty miles to dinner even when you are not expected to stay over night ) took also a Major General Sir - I was told that he would join me , and I expected to see a portly , ruddy man of inches , with sweeping whiskers and moustache . I found a short , slender , meek-looking , palefaced man ; but his bearing was very military ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We entered the drawing-room together of course ; but notwithstanding his rank , he waved me in before him , and my plain Mistership was announced before his titles . I have seen no men here at all equal in face or figure to General Hooker , General Hancock , General Augur , or General Terry , to say nothing of General Scott , who was something oi*t of the common even with us . And Buruside , and McDowell , and Grant , and McClellan are all stouter men than you are apt to find here . The biggest men that I have seen were from the north , Yorkshire and Northumberland . Those of the south , particularly in Kent , are the shortest ; al // though , as a Kent man said to me , they are generally stocky.

Early as it still was , the fl3or was covered with them-large blocks of the benches were occupied , and the galleries were crowded . All these ladies were in evening toilets , the peeresses wearing coronets of diamonds-most of them being fairly ablaze with diamonds on head and neck . If the daylight was not very favorable to the shoulders or complexions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their costumes and the glitter of their precious stones served to divert attention from the defects of nature or the ravages of time . . . . Not many of these ladies in the House were very pretty , although here and there was a face such as makes one stop short and hold one 's breath , and wonder at the divine perfection of nature 's handiwork when she is at her best . . . . As for the old baldheaded gentlemen , some of them very short and stumpy , they looked painfully like a collection of senators ' in some opera bouffe . One of them in particular , with four ermine bars on his cloak , denoting his high rank , was exactly like the funny-looking dummy Englishman which the French delight to exhibit in their farces . He had very little hair left to boast of , and that little was very red , and his face was round and red also , and he was altogether so comic a little man that one could not look at him without a smile .

' Then I knewthat he was the Marquis of Winchester-fourteenth of that ilkJohn Paulet by name , and the Premier Marquis of England . So much for appearances . " Mr. Jennings , it should be remembered , is an Englishman ; but he lived eight or ten years in New York ; and I may be pardoned for saying that he carried away a constant reminder of " American " beauty , and a standard of comparisouwbich would be likely to make him fastidious . hundred pounds , and yet has not the least appearance of portliness , rather the contrary . He is the only man I ever met whose friendly grip was rather more than I liked to bear . I spoke to his wife about his strength and his figure , and she told me that when he went to get his life insured here the surgeons said that they very rarely saw such a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and never any finer or healthier . That would be impossible . And as he is so was his father . Were they exceptions ? Only of a sort that constantly occur among real Yankees " Americans " whose families have been in the country for generations , and who are the only proper eEamples of the influence of the climate and the social conditions of the country . I have , perhaps , said too much upon this subject of the comparative physical condition of the race in the two countries ; but I have been led to do so because of the very great inconsistency I found between the facts and the common notion as to stout Englishmen and lean " Americans , " blooming , buxom Znglishwomen and pale , slender " American " women  --  a notion which one writer has repeated , parrotlike , after the other , until even we ourselves have accepted it without question . Like many other notions which no one disputes , it is false . But the world has gone on accepting it and assuming it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that if in a room full of English people only one man were found ruddy and buvly , and only one woman blooming and well rounded ( and this or something very like it I have seen more than once ) , they would be picked out and spoken of as English-looking , to the disregard of all the others . The exceptions would be taken as examples of the rule ; and this even by the English themselves , so swayed are we by tradition and authority , even in such an everyday matter . Nay , even I myself , skeptical and carping , was thus misled . The steamer , going out , was fillel // chiefly with English people . Two of my fellow passengers I selected in my mind as notably and typically English , not only in person , but in bearing . They proved to be , one a Massachusetts Yankee and the other a Western man ; but both had from association contracted English habits of dress and of manner . Two Englishwomen , however , attracted my particular attention . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw outside of a caravan . She was a fearful manifestation of the enorm*us development of solid flesh which the British fair sometimes attain . As she stood by her husband she was the taller from the ear upward . She weighed about twenty stone . I think that a plumb line dropped from the front of her corsage would have reached the deck without touching her skirts . Her tread was hippopotamic . And yet she showcd traces of beauty , and not improbably had been a fine fair girl ; and even at the present time she managed to effect a very palpable waist . I mused wonderingly upon the process by which she did this ; but still more upon that sad gradual enormification by which she passed from a tall blooming beauty into her present tremendous proportions . The other was exactly the reverse . She could hardly be called ill looking in the face , but her pale , blank , unfeatured countenance reminded one instantly of a sheep . She was a washed-out , and although young , a faded creature , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she was a perfect English type , and so like some of John Leech 's women that I could not look at her without internal laughter . Her husbandfor even such women by some mysterious process known to themselves will get husbands -- -was like unto her in face , in feature , and in expression ; and yet he was so strikingly , so aggressively British in look and in manner that I heard some Yankees on board say that they would like to kick him . And I somewhat shared their prejudice ; of which before we landed I learned to be ashamed ; for I found him a very intelligent , well-informed , pleasant man , reserved in his manners , and although firm in his opinions , which were strongly British , very respectful of other men 's , and very careful of giving offence . His union of firmness and courtesy seemed to me worthy of admiration ; and if he did wish to kick any of the Yankees on board , for which in one or two cases I could have forgiven him , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence . Another prevalent notion , which is reciprocal between the people of the two countries , is mistaken according to my observation . It is generally believed , or at least very often said in " America , " that the men in England are very much handsomer than the women ; and conversely it is commonly believed in England , or said , that the women in " America " are handsomer than the men . An absurd and truly preposterous notion , as will be seen upon a moment 's reflection . For the women in both countries are the mothers of both the men and the women ; and the men are the fathers of both the men and the women ; and as some of the women are of their fathers types and some of the men of their mothers ' , the imputed difference ofthe two in personal beauty could not be brought about . It is physiologically impossible that the women of a race should be handsomer than the men , and vice versa . It is nevertheless true that the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the women , and that the women in " America " are generally much more attractive than the men . The cause of this is a fact very distinctive of the social surface of the two countries . I have spoken of the " set up " and the bearing of the men in England . It is very remarkable , and is far superior to anything of the kind that is found even among the most cultivated people in this country , except in comparatively rare individual cases . But in England // it is common ; it is the rule . There , from the middle classes up , a slovenly man is a rare exception . There men are almost universally neat and tidy , and they carry themselves with a conscious self-respect . They do not slouch . They do not go about , even in the morning , with coats unbuttoned , skirts flying , and their hands in their overcoat pockets . They dress soberly , quietly , with manly simplicity , but almost always in good taste , and with notable neatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious manhood . Moreover , in England the man is still recognized as the superior . England has been called the purgatory of horses and the paradise of women . But that saying came from the continent of Europe , where women , except in the very highest and most cultivated classes , are not treated with that tenderness and consideration for their weakness and their womanly functions which I am inclined to think is somewhat peculiar to the English race . I should call England the paradise of men ; for there the world is made for them ; and women are happy in making it so . An Englishman who is the head of a family is not only master of his house , but of the whole household . His will is recognized as the law of that household . No one thinks of disputing it . It is not deemed unreasonable that in the house which he provides and keeps up his comfort and his convenience should be first considered , or that , as he is responsible for his household both to the law and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this very reasonwives there have the household affairs more absolutely in their hands than they have here . A man whose absolute authority is acknowledged , prac tically as well as theoretically , is very ready to make concessions and to rid himself of what at any time he may assume . Real monarchs , like the Czars or like the Tudors , are careless of the protection of royal etiquette . The consciousness of this acknowledged or rather unquestioned superiority shows itself in the men 's faces , and in their bearing , simple and unpretending as their manner is . Besides all this , men in England ( I am leaving out of consideration the lower classes ) show the effect of cultivation , of breeding , of discipline . Even in the middle classes they are well informed , and , what is of more importance to the present question , they have been taught to behave themselves respectfully to others . They do so behave ; they feel that they ought to do so and that they must . There are two gods worshipped in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god he is , when he is not made a Juggernaut . The result of all this is a very different man in appearance from him who generally pervades " America . " The latter may be , and generally is , as handsome physically as the former ; he may be , and generally is , as good morally ; but the one generally shows for all that he is and perhaps for more , and the other does not , and frequently does for less . And yet again ; among such men in England another sort who , for example , say " had n't oughler , " and " have came , " and who spit upon the floor , are not generally found mingling . They are kept in social pens by themselves . And thus in judging of English society they are left out . A comparative estimate of Englishwomen is too serious and far too complicated a subject to be treated except in an article by itself . RIcnAnn Gu*T WHITE .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
