txt It is difficult to discuss calmly the frightful disaster which happened in Brooklyn on Tuesday night . No such awful sacrifice of human life has ever been known in this country  --  shipwreck and the casualties of war alone being excepted . It is likely that the loss of life with which we became familiar during the rebellion , has hardened us somewhat to the horrors of slaughter by rail , fire , wreck , and explosion . When the Richmond Theatre was burned in 1811 , and sixty-one persons perished , the matter was of such momentous interest that special religious services in reference to the event were held . in various parts of the Union , and a monument was erected to fix forever in the memory of man that pathetic tragedy . The destruction of the Pemberton Mills at Lawrence , Mass. , involved the slaughter of about one hundred and twenty persons . This sent a thrill of horror throughout the country . Later , in the burning of the French Catholic Church at Holyoke , Mass. , about the same number were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these events , to be sure , compared with the awful tragedy in the Church of Santiago de Chili , South America , in 1863 , when over two thousand people perished , But that was in a foreign country , and in the midst of our own civil strife , and it made a comparatively fleeting impression on the minds of the people of the United States . Now we are brought face to face with a calamity in one of our principal cities , by which more than three hundred persons have suffered a terrible death . The sacrifice of their lives seems so causeless and inexcusable , it is no wonder that a feeling of indignation flashes through the cloud that hangs over the two cities of Brooklyn and New-York . It is natural that men should ask , Why should these have been condemned to so horrible a fate The fire in the Brooklyn Theatre caught from an imperfectly-guarded light behind the scenes . The loss of life which ensued was caused by the inadequacy of the means of exit . It may be added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . if there had been pails of water , fire-extinguishers , or other means at hand . According to the testimony of the master machinist of the theatre , there were no such means of checking a fire . There is sure to be an attempt to show that the lights behind the scenes were securely protected . If they had been , there would have been no fire . It proves nothing that only carelessness could have set the theatre on fire . It is carelessness , rather than malicious design , that the public demand to be protected from . By some means an inflammable piece of scenery was placed against a gas - light in the rear of the stage . From the flame so kindled spread the conflagration which laid the Brooklyn Theatre in ashes . As for the means of exit , it is urged that they were ample . Compared with most of the theatres in this City , it is likely that the exits of the Brooklyn building were wide and numerous . This is certainly true of the lower part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . The loss of life , however , was in the upper part of the theatre . There were about two hundred and fifty people on the first floor ; three hundred and fifty on the second , and four hundred on the third Or gallery floor . The Treasurer of the theatre testifies that the gallery stairs were " unusually wide , " and that nothing but a panic could have prevented the safe escape of the people in the upper part of the house . Panic in an audience , in case of an alarm of fire , is inevitable . Whether the gallery stairs fell , in this instance , or whether they were choked by a terrorstricken crowd , may never be known . It is clear that insufficient provision for the escape of the people in the upper part of the house was the cause of their destruction , just as it is clear that inadequate protection against accident behind the scenes occasioned the kindling of the fire . It is panic in one case , and carelessness in the other , that must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects and proprietors of places of public resort will complain that such commodious means of exit as those which the lesson of this calamity seems to demand , are well-nigh impracticable . To give so much room to stair-cases and outer openings , would take away too much from the seating capacity of the house . They have built on this economical plan . In this City , several theatres empty all their sitlIngs into one main artery . Where the building is in the middle of a block , it is like an inflammable box lined with tinder , and with one narrow opening to safety . There are few theatres in this country which do not nearly answer to this description . It is a disgrace to civilization that buildings of this sort should be permitted to open their doors to the public . Either the laws relating to the safety of public buildings are not emphatic enough , or they are not enforced . It is high time that this matter were rigidly inquired into and theatrical death-traps closed or compelled to adopt means to prevent a recurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their theatres are absolutely safe , they may hope for a return of public confidence . For the present , many of the places of amusement in this City will remain under a popular ban of suspicion .
