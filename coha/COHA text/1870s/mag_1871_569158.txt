ARTICLE II . - CHRISTIANITY IN ITS PROGRESSIVE RELATION 5* NEANDER begins his " History of the Christian Religion and Church " with these words : " It shall be our purpose to trace , from the small mustard grain , through the course of the past centuries lying open to our inspection , the growth of that mighty tree , which is destined to overshadow the earth , and under the branches of which all its people are to find a safe habitation . The history will show how a little leaven , cast into the mass of humanity , has been gradually penetrating it . Looking back on the period of eighteen centuries , we would survey a process of development in which we ourselves are included ; a process moving steadily onward , though not in a direct line , but through various windings , yet in the end furthered by whatever has attempted to arrest its course ; a process having its issue in eternity , but constantly following the same laws , so that in the past , as it unfolds itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future which is coming to meet us . " In these brief sentences , the historian not only strikes the key-note of his own matchless work , but also tersely expresses the true divine philosophy of Christianity . They are a simple yet profound interpretation and unfolding of Christ 's own words : " The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ; which is indeed the least of all seeds ; but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof Another parable spake he unto them ; the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . " As to the meaning of these parables there can be no question . They set forth , as plainly as language can , the fact that Christianity contains within itself and in its relation to the world , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept these declarations of Christ as a clear expression of the philosophy of his religion , we should compare them with the claim which he made with equal explicitness , that Christianity , as it proceeded from him , is essentially complete , and depends for its development as a heavenly kingdom in the world upon no power without itself . This indeed is implied in the very parables which assert so pointedly the progressive principle . The vitality of the mustard grain springs wholly from within . Leaven by its very nature is expansive . In this sense Christ declared that his kingdom was not of this world . It was not framed after the fashion of worldly kingdoms ; it did not draw its forces from worldly organizations . Its relation to the powers of the world was like leaven , attachmo-itself closely to them and moulding them , but developing from within , and by a law of its own . There is , therefore , no contradiction in the statement that Christianity is complete and yet progressive . Whatever incompleteness may be exhibited , belongs not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , as seen in its history , grow out of the laws under which it works , and the ends it proposes to accomplish . Our present design is to consider Christianity in its progressive relations ; but for the sake of clearness we will first point out those essential elements which are in themselves complete . There are two such elements . First , Christianity is essentially complete as a redemptive system . The salvation which Christ brought into the world was made completely available for all mankind by Christ himself . No new saving quality has since been added . No new Saviour has since appeared . And this for the reason that Christ and his salvation was all sufficient . Such was his own emphatic and constantly reYterated testimony . " The Son of Man is come to save that which is lost . " " He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life . " Nowhere in the Gospels is there any intimation that salvation was ever to flow from any other source than Christ himself He was to be a Saviour for all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only begotten Son . " " Come unto me all ye that labor . " " I am the living bread which came down from heaven ; if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever . " Christ also explained how // he became such a Saviour . " The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . " " And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me . " " As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life . " These passages indicate both the nature of the redemptive system which Christ inaugurated , and the fact that this system , as a redeeming and regenerating power , is complete . It is a system which rests on an atonement made by Christ , and that atonement was " finished " when he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a revelation of supernatural truth . This revelation centers in Christ who is a supernatural person , and who , as such , declared himself to be " the truth . " All previous communications from God by his prophets had been only foreshadowings of the Christian revelation . There was this peculiar in Christ as a teacher : he taught not merely by the words he spoke , but also , in virtue of what he was , by the whole record of his earthly history . Every event in his human life , from the Incarnation to the Ascension , was a supernatural revelation , a manifestation of God in the flesh . Such a revelation , from the very conditions under which it was made , must have been essentially completed when Christ left the world . Nothing could afterwards be added to that cycle of supernatural facts which Paul once expressed , as it would seem , in the form of an early creed : " God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . " Christ was greater than his discourses . No words , even from the lips of him who spake as never man spake , could adequately express the mysteries of Christ 's birth , nature , sufferings , death , resurrection , ascension . But these facts contained the essence of the Gospel ; and it was needful that they should be delivered in such forms of divine authority as to become a basis of faith . Hence the office of the Holy Ghost . " He shall receive of mine , " said Christ , " and shall show it unto you . " This is the limit of his mission . He delivers no new supernatural truth . He only testifies of Christ . " For he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak . He shall // glorify me . " The Apostles nowhere claim to have received any communications from the Spirit which enlarged or superceded the revelation made by the Lord himself . They preached ony " Jesus and the resurrection . " Starting now from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation and as a special divine communication of truth , I proceed to consider its progressive relations and aspects . Here , first of all , we meet the fact that Christianity became a historical religion . Christianity is not a power acting separately from and above the events of history ; it has even become so nnited with all historical movements that it is impossible to distinguish the supernatural from the natural . And this accords with Christ 's own declaration . The kingdom of heaven , he said , was to work like leaven in the world , until the whole should be leavened . But this could be only by the subjection of Christianity to historic conditions and laws of progress . That the Saviour might become " the power of God unto salvation** in humanity , there was a necessity , as it seems , that he should become human himself and thus put his life into historical relations with mankind . By the incarnation the supernatural and the natural were united in Christ , and the union has contiriued in the Christian religion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to separate Christianity from the world 's history . Let it not be thought that we are here yielding any ground which may be used in defence of a naturalistic religion . It is not in the interest of a true supernaturalism to draw a line of division between Christianity and history , as if all historical events outside of the specific circle of the Christian Church were profane . The sovereignty of God extends over the natural as well as the supernatural . We see his hand less directly perhaps , but certainly no less conclusively , in the rise and fall of empires than in the outpouring of his Holy Spirit . All forces in the world , evil as well as good , move ever within the limits imposed by the divine order , and strive impotently against the Almighty will . " Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee ; the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain . " // And from the very fact that Christianity has entered so closely into union with history , we gather where we are to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running closely along the lines of events which are most significant in their historical relations . More and more is it becoming recognized by philosophic historians that the so called law of progress in the world rests upon a supernatural basis , and that its action is largely aided by the regenerating and elevating influences of Christianity . So clear indeed is the principle of historical unity , and so decisive moreover grows the evidence that Christianity alone gives the clue to this unity , that even those recent discoveries in historic method which were hailed at first by infidels as giving the death blow to the supernatural , have been found to be new buttresses of supernaturalism itself and " God in history " has become the last philosophic watchword . Christ 's own philosophy of history is at length accepted as true and supreme . Christianity is seen to be the great leavening power in the world , gradually moulding and transforming by its own inherent virtue human governments , institutions , societies , en stoms , beliefs . And from this standpoint we can see what the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its end is to be . The leaven can not stop working till the whole lump is leavened . Christianity has come into the world as an organic and vital force , and it must work on till every element of history , every institution and law of civil , social , and private life shall be sanctified under its power . The Millennium or Golden Age of Christianized humanity is something more than a rapsody of Hebrew poets ; it marks the terminus whither all historic currents and forces are steadily converging . From this more general survey , let us turn to some specific phases of the progressive principle in Christianity . I begin with what immediately strikes the attention , the fact that Christianity , as a regenerating power , works progressively . The Holy Spirit in his converting and sanctifying influence acts under progressive conditions . This is true of his action in every individual soul Divine grace at the outset of the Christian life is like a grain of mustard seed , the least of all seeds ; but it contains within itself a principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . And in this the individual is a type of the whole Christian body . The Pentecostal outpouring was a beginning of the process by which the Church is to be spread over the whole earth . The Spirit is given only by measure , and under limitations . God might have flooded the world with one mighty rain of grace . But this was not to be the method . Christianity was to be a gentle progressive movement , acting along the lines of the general movement of history , and gradually pervading and controlling it . Upon this plan the dispensation of the Spirit is conducted . Men are not converted by supernatural influences merely . These always work in connection with human instrumentalities . Therefore the Apostle asks : " How shall men believe in him of whom they have not heard ? And how shall they hear without a preacher ? And how shall they preach except they be sent ? " Here is the explanation of the fact that Christianity has been moving so slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gracious dispensations have continually waited for the coincidence and cooperation of natural agencies . Every reformation and revival has had its historical preparation , and has come at length in the fullness of time . This is well illustrated in the new chapter which our age is adding to the history of Christian missions . How clearly do we see in this case a series of providential preparations meeting a line of spiritual influences , so that when heathen nations were made ready to receive the Gospel , a fresh development of the missionary spirit inspired Christian nations to send it ? God , in the spread of his kingdom does not ignore the laws of history , which are the laws of his own providence , any more than he ignores the natural laws of character in the gracious work of conversion and sanctification . As the growth of personal holiness is gradual , the supernatural grace develop . ing itself in conjunction with the free action of all the principles and sentiments of human nature , so the Church advances from epoch to epoch with a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural forces at its command . // From this it results that every advance made by Christianity beoomes a new source of power . " Viresque acquirit eundo . " The more thoroughly human societies and institutions are leavened with Christian elements , the more pervasive and influential will these elements be . We can not therefore measure the future progress of the Church by the standard of the past . When the historical preparation shall be complete , inspired prophecy will receive a fulfillment far beyond all present experience : " And it shall come to pass in the last days , saith God , I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh . " Again , Christianity equally exhibits the principle of progress in its outward embodiment and form . Christ himself gave no specific directions to his disciples concerning the establishment of his visible Church ; and throughout the records of the Apos. tolic age , there are no indications of fixed and artificial organ . ization . The customs and forms of the Christian community took shape freely according to its growing wants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Apostles the warrant for our Congregational polity . Nothing can be clearer than that the first Churches were formed and conducted on the democratic or Congregational principle . It is equally clear that but two orders of Church officers were known to the Apostolic Christians . But we do not therefore claim for Congregationalism a special divine or inspired authorization . Our claim for Congregationalism is that it agrees fully with the spirit of Christianity , which is a spirit of brotherhood , of selfgovernment and of liberty . But we do not insist that Congre. gationalism is the one divinely appointed form of the Christian Church through all vicissitudes of condition and for all ages . And we do not for this sufficient reason , that the form of the Church is subordinate to and conditioned upon its inner life and needs . As these suffer change , its form may change , and must even . We have only to recur here again to Christ 's own declaration : " The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , it follows that its outward methods and institutions must be subject to change and progress . We see therefore why Christ did not promulgate an ecclesiastical code . To have done so would have been like // prescribing for an infant in its cradle the exact shape and measurement of the garments it should wear in youth or manhood . Christ 's work was to introduce Christianity as a spiritual force into the world . Its form would of itself follow the law and necessities of its being . For the same reason we are not to look upon the actual forms of organization and ecclesiastical procedure in the Apostolic age as binding upon subsequent generations beyond this , that they offer an inspired model of the principles and spirit which should characterize all ecclesiastical methods always . There is nothing in the Apostolic writings that indicates any intention on the part of the Apostles to impose a yoke on the future church . Everything at that time pertaining to the form of Christianity was incipient and subordinate . The absorbing thought and object of the Apostles was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth . Individual churches were formed as a matter of Christian expediency and helpfulness . Deacons w6re appointed that the Apostles might give themselves entirely to the ministry of the word . Elders were ordained in churches which the Apostles had established , that they might carry the Gospel elsewhere . All things ecclesiastical had direct reference to some present emergency . Perhaps , had the Apostle Paul lived a hundred years longer , he might have seen good reason in the development of the Church for the appointment of a third order of Church officers ; but in the condition of Christianity while he lived he saw no such need . That the Episcopal system so quickly grew up out of the simpler forms of the Apostolic age is in itself no argument against the Congregationalism of that age , nor , on the other hand , is it a proof that Christianity was passing into a period of degeneracy . In the second century the Church was entering the era of persecution . The tendency everywhere was towards unity for mutual encouragement and defence . A stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have been wisely adapted to meet the exigences of that trying time . Certainly we would not sit in judgment on the conduct of such men as Polycarp , and Justin Martyr , and Irent**us . Episcopacy might have been wise in the second century , and yet // may not be in the nineteenth century . It may be added that the Papacy in which Episcopacy culminated was not an unmixed evil , especially in its earlier life . The spiritual authority wielded by a St. Leo and a St. Gregory became God 's instrument for turning back the tides of northern barbarism , and sowing the seeds of a brighter future . But the history of the Papacy in the sequel shows that , as it was developed out of corruptions in the Church , so it was itself essentially corrupt . Its claim of absolute spiritual and secular dominion was not of Christian origin , but sprang out of the ashes of the old Roman Empire . As an ecclesiastical system , Roman Catholicism belongs to the past . The Christian spirit of the age is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Church tending as a form which shall exhibit its completeness of development ? we can only answer that Christ constructed no model of it , and his Apostles did not profess to be wise above their Master . Church unity , as represented in the New Testament , is a unity of the spirit , not one of outward organization . It may be that unity of form can never be made the true symbol of Christian perfection . Christianity tends to complexity as well as simplicity . " There are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit , and there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord , and there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all . " The goal toward which humanity struggles more and more earnestly , as the leaven of the heavenly kingdom works on within , is complete redemption from every yoke of bondage , and complete attainment of the liberty wherewith Christ makes free . There is yet another important aspect of Christianity to be considered , as illustrating its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as containing a completed supernatural revelation . But we must distinguish the revelation itself from our partial and progressive apprehension of it . The Gospel , as a body of trath , is like leaven . Christ illustrated in himself his own simile . He came into the world unrecognized . Even his disciples but half under . stood him while he remained with them . His teachings also were as mysterious as the teacher . When Christ left the world Christianity was as a grain of mustard seed . It had been // lodged in the minds of a few men ; but it still needed'to be developed to human apprehension and faith . This was to be the work of the Holy Spirit The remarkable progress exhibited by the disciples in Christian discernment and knowledge , was the direct result of the Spirit 's outpouring . Christ 's promise to them was thus fulfilled : " When he , the Spirit of truth , shall come , he will guide you into all truth . " But the dispensation of the Spirit did not close with the Apostolic age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian knowledge was to go on under his illuminating influence , until Christianity itself should reach its limit of progress in the coming of the day of the Lord . Thus the history of Christianity includes a history of doctrine . Theology has had a growth . Our present doctrinal systems have a record like that of the earth 's surface , as interpreted by geological science . We may see in them the distinct strata of fresh deposits in different ages , and may mark the revolutions and upheavals by which crude or erroneous speculations were shaken off , and a new plane of knowledge was reached . We have indeed the same Scriptures that the Fathers had ; but we read these Scriptures under a much clearer light than they did . We have entered into their labors . But while we appreciate the vantage ground on which we stand , let us rightly read the lesson of it . No present limit can be fixed to the progress of Christian doctrine . This becomes plain when we consider the nature of revealed truth . It is truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mankind . This truth , in itself and in all its relations to God and to man , can not be perfectly apprehended by any finite intellect . The Apostle Paul gives expression to his sense of the boundless and exhaustless compass of Christianity in that remarkable prayer for his Ephesian readers , that they " may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height , and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge . " The Gospel for all purposes of personal salvation is so simple that a little child can understand it ; but as a system of truth to be opened to human knowledge , it is a fathomless mystery . We move along the line of its revealed facts , we scan // them on one side and another , we investigate their mutual bearings , we seek to range them in consistent order and relation , but we never reach the full solution of the mighty problem . At last we find ourselves compelled to accept the position of simple faith and to exclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out ! " In the study of such a revelation there can not be a limit . No theologian has so deeply explored the Gospel , or any part of it , as that further exploration is useless . Augustine , profound as was his Christian experience and insight , left something to be unfolded by others concerning sin and predestination . Centuries after we see Calvin advancing from Augustine 's positions to theological inquiries and results which the African Father had not expressed , and perhaps had not anticipated . While again in more recent times , Edwards and his successors boldly canvas the positions of Calvin , and add an appendix of improvements to Calvinistic theology . This is but a single illustration of the general fact that theology is in its very nature a progressive science . In this respect theology is like other sciences . No one of the natural sciences claims completeness . Progress indeed is a necessary incident of all true science . The prime benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general principles and to orderly arrangement , truth itself is held more clearly and becomes more easily a clue to fresh dis*-coveries . This is the noble function of theology in the development of Christian doctrine . The theologian is the enlightened teacher of his own age . His true greatness consists not in framing a perfect theological system , which is impossible , but in feeling most profoundly and sympathetically the spiritual wants of his time , and moulding the truth in forms best fitted to meet those wants . With the progress of Christianity there is a corresponding progress of the Christian consciousness ; and hence arise new intellectual activities and aspirations . The old forms of truth are no longer able to satisfy . Christianity itself is ever new . But human systems grow old and inadequate . Each age demands that the new wine be put into new bottles , that both be preserved . // Just here also we may easily recognize the true principle of progress in Christian doctrine . The vital theology for the age must find its starting point and source of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any theological name however revered , but in the Holy Scriptures . Christ said , " I am the truth . " Here all theology begins . The centuries , with whatever of knowledge they have gathered , have not separated us from the Divine fountain , which springs up unto everlasting life . The Christian thinkers of the past have only helped us to see more clearly what that fountain is , and where it is , and how we may drink of it . This has been the apology which all right minded theologians have made in their own behalf . They have allowed the imperfection of all human investigations and creeds , and have avowed allegiance only to Christ and his Gospel . Says John Calvin , in that brave address with which he dedicated to the King of France the " institutes of the Christian Religion " : " While there is much that is admirable and wise in the writings of the Fathers , still , in studying them , we bave endeavored to remember that all things are ours , to serve , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only , and must obey him in all things without exception . He who does not draw this distinction will not have any fixed principles in religion ; for those holy men were ignorant of many things , are often opposed to each other , and are sometimes at variance with themselves . " So Luther built the Protestant Reformation on the sure foundation of the Word of God , not regarding the traditions of men . " I think , consider , and search all the Holy Scriptures , " he replied to Melancthon , " and by this means I continually become more and more convinced of the truth of our doctrines . " We , in this age of free thought , are only too ready to echo every such protest against dogmatic authority . But while with Calvin we assert that " all human writings are ours to serve , not lord it over us , " we should not fail to acknowledge the debt we owe the past . That we in our day are so enlightened in the principles of Scripture interpretation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at times disturbed the Church , that the main facts of the Gospel are so firmly fixed in Christian apprehension , is largely due to the labors of former gener // ations . All Christian experience is our inheritance , and pours its treasures at our feet . As we read the history of the great doctrinal conflicts through which Christianity struggled onward step by step , we become interested spectators of battles more decisive for human weal than Marathon or Salamis . They are epochs of real and lasting progress . The Church has never permanently lost any ground it has once gained . The victories of truth are immortaL If I have carried you along with me thus far , there has been awakened in your minds , I am sure , a conviction that there are peculiar advantages to be derived from the study of Christianity as a historical religion . Let me now specify some of these advantages . First , we come to a better understanding of the nature of Christianity . Christ 's sayings concerning the kingdom of God find their best commentary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain of mustard seed slowly becoming a great tree . Studying its growth , we gain an insight into the principles of its action . Its leavening agency appears . We observe the supernatural uniting itself with the natural , the pure Divine element regenerating and sanctifying the corrupt human elements . Hence we gather the law of its progress . The prophecies of Scripture are set in a new light . We apprehend how " one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day . " To understand the relation which Christianity sustains to the world in the present age , and what those forces are by which the heavenly kingdom is to be finally established in the whole earth , it is needful that we be made familiar with the history of the Church . Only as we have clearly interpreted the methods of its progress in previous generations , can we intelligently watch its present movements , or wisely counsel and labor for its success . There is much always in the external aspect of the Church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view the Divine plan . He sees the world full of incompatible and hostile elements ; he sees the Church itself both in its form and in its discipleship , imperfect . Nowhere does he find a complete fulfillihent of the inspired prophetic pictures of the glory of Zion . But if he will take a review of the past in connec // tion with this survey of the present , he will find ground for hopefulness instead of despondency . There has been steady progress on the whole in the history of the Church . The Christian spirit has entered more and more deeply into government , society , and literature . Old wrongs and abuses are gradually , dying . The average condition of the people in Christian countries is greatly improved . There is more of general intelligence , true liberty , and enlightened piety in the world to-day than has been in any previous period . The Gospel is making conquests more rapidly now than ever before . Certainly the results of the comparison can but be encouraging and stimulating to the Christian student . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enthusiastic and dreamy in his former views ; but he will have a more intelligent sympathy with all practical measures for advancing the cause of Christ , and he will do his own Christian duty the *more devotedly and efficiently that he is freed from all ignorant expectations and fears . In the second place , an acquaintance with the history of Christianity saves us from tendencies to false speculation . Every man who thinks for himself has to go through an experience in the apprehension of the Gospel analogous to that through which the Church has passed . We are so constituted intellectually that we can not accept truth merely on trust or by tradition . If it is to be vital , it must become as leaven in our minds . This process by which we reach an intelligent conviction - in spiritual things is sometimes painful and even perilous . The twilight condition of knowledge is always beset with peculiar difficulties . We are then liable to mistake the shadows cast from our own crude thoughts and fancies for real forms of truth . Moreover a conceit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be easily taken with the suggestions of our own minds . Against these speculative dangers the study of Church history furnishes a wholesome antidote . We discover that aspects of Christian doctrine which are stumbling stones in our path have been such again and again in the progress of theology , and that explanations and theories which seem to us so happily original have been again and again exploded and consigned to // the limbo of theological vanities . The course of the Christian Church is strewn with the wrecks of misguided human opinions , and history has preserved them for our instruction . We take no position here against a true independence of thought . Historical studies , we insist , have no tendency to fetter the mind . They rather free it from the impediments of its own ignorance and contraction , widening its horizon and guarding it against the false lights that allure it towards error . The difficulty with us in our apprehensions of truth is that we are compelled to accept those views which are discernable from our own standpoint . Divine revelation is many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single inquirer . The moral system is like the system of nature . When the astronomer points his glass to the heavens , his observations are necessarily shaped by the fact that he occupies a point on this earth . The heavenly bodies assume to him a fixed relationship of size and position ; they range themselves in constellations , some shining forth as stars ' of the first magnitude , others retiring into the dim depths of the nebula . But suppose our astronomer to be carried to the opposite pole of the universe . How changed the view ! What new constellations fill the sky ! What fading of bright suns ! What resolutions of misty nebul* into perfect orbs ! Yet the universe has not moved a hair 's breadth from its Divinely laid foundations . The change of aspect results simply from a change of position of the looker on . What we have supposed the astronomer might do is actually within the power of the Christian student . Historical studies open to him the whole field of religious thought He goes from point to point whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholds the everlasting trutb from the standpoint of the Nicene Creed , with Augustine from that of man 's fall and depravity , with Anselm from that of righteous law and satisfaction , with Luther from that of justification by faith alone , with Calvin from that of God 's sovereign decrees , with Edwards from that of universal benevolence . From such researches he returns , with a new reach and clearness of vision , to the point whence he must study for himself the Holy Scriptures . Acquaintance with the history of Christian doctrine does for the theologian , what travel and acquaintance with the // world does for social culture ; it lifts him out of religious provincialism , guards him against one-sidedness of apprehension , enables him to catch more perfectly the right proportions of truth , and , last but not least , instructs him in lessons of charity . Ecclesiastical studies are also beneficial in yet another direction ; they bring us into contact with the holy men who have lived before us . Christian biography is perhaps the most instructive portion of Church history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of Christ 's disciples from age to age , and trace the power of the Gospel to sanctify the soul . In all the vicissitudes of the Church the saving light of the Cross has never failed to shine upon the world through its faithful confessors . It was the new beauty of holiness exhibited in Christian character and life that turned the attention of pagans to Christianity in the early centuries , and won so many of them to acceptance of the persecuted religion . Tertullian testifies of this with a natural exultation . Writing to a Roman official in a season of severe persecution , he exclaims : " This community will be undying ; for be assured that just in the time of its seeming overthrow it is built up into greater power . For all who witness the noble patience of its martyrs , as struck with misgivings , are inflamed with desire to examine into the matter in question ; and as soon as they come to know the truth , they straightway enrol themselves its disciples . " Plainly a new type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christians have always more or less consistently illustrated it . In these records of Christian biography we find a corrective for the discouraging impressions we may have received from other portions of Church history . It is true that the progress of Christianity has been marked by much in practice and opinion that is inconsistent with its real spirit . Christians could become so earnest in their theological differences as to anathematise each other over the iota of a creed . The Church which had been so unjustly persecuted could forget the lessons of its own history , and become a persecutor in turn . So difficult is it for human nature , even when enlightened and sanctified by the Gospel , to free itself from corrupt tendencies . But Christendom never strayed so far from truth and grace as to be given over by the Spirit of God . In the gloomiest times , as judged // by the outward appearance , the religion of Christ was still working with regenerating efficacy . It was a working mostly hidden beneath the surface of events ; but many sketches have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may flourish in the midst of surrounding corruptions . The Dark Ages have given us some of the most beautiful pictures of saintly character to be found in all history . I need , only refer to Louis of France , Bernard of Clairvaux , and Anseim of Canterbury . The very trials of the Church have served to purify it . Persecutions and conflicts developed Christian heroism , sacrifice , and trust in God . Had there been no wrestlings of truth with error , no lofty souls would have arisen like Cyp. rian , and Augustine , and Luther . Such chapters of Christian experience afford lessons most profitable always , and especially needed by our times . The religion of the day , with all its intellectual enlightenment and enlarged philanthropy , lacks simplicity of faith and strenuousness of self deniaL An air oP effeminacy has gathered about our piety which might well receive a tonic of Christian vigor and consecration and ' unworldliness from fellowship with those ancient saints and martyrs . Biographical studies moreover throw a new light upon Christianity itself . The hiding of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creeds , but in personal living and experience . " The proper material of ecclesiastical history is , after all , " as Dr. Stanley has said , " not institutions and opinions , but events and persons . " The true Church has always consisted of those who were joined to Christ by faith , and the story of their lives is the most precious legacy of the past . Being dead , they yet speak . As a great cloud of witnesses they encompass us . Their voices reach us from the distance , and cheer us on . Their example inspires . As we commune with them , we feel that , though ages may have separated us in our earthly condition , we are one in Jesus Christ . This is the best lesson of Church history ,  --  the unity , in experience and life , of all Christian souls . As we come into full sympathy with that unity , we are raised above our own age and its special features , and get a view of the one broad current of Christian progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential and eternaL Our energies are concentrated upon // those methods of usefulness which are most clearly related to the vital interests of the times and of the world . History is indeed the great school of practical wisdom . No man is so fully alive to the real wants and tendencies of his own generation as he who has studied to some good purpose the history of mankind . It is the growing appreciation of this fact that has given such an impetus of late to historical methods of education . The introduction of ecclesiastical history , as an independent department , into our theological schools , is of quite recent date . The charge which has just been made against them by that respectable and able journal , The Yation , that they do not afford a practical preparation for the ministry , might a few years ago have had some color of reason . As it is , we give to the author of " Ecce Homo , " who furnished The Nation the text for its accusation , the opportunity of answering it After stating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to suggest as a remedy that " a considerable knowledge of tuodern history and particularly of the influence of the Church upon society in all ages be demanded of candidates for ordination . " Certainly the suggestion , as addressed to the English people , is pertinent and wise . No theological education is complete without a thorough course of historical studies . But while we cordially welcome every advance in this direction , we must take issue with the assertion that those departments of instruction in our theological seminaries which have so long formed the trivium of a ministerial education are unpractical or antiquated . We dissent most earnestly from the slight which Prof. Seeley himself puts upon the study of the Bible in the original tongues . If the Holy Scriptures are the great fountain of Christian truth , surely the Christian minister should be acquainted , as far as possible , with the languages through which that fountain flows . Only by such acquaintance can he make the best use of the commentaries to which Prof. Seeley commends him . We do not expect of course that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard it as important that our clergy generally should be sufficiently versed in the Bible languages , especially in New Testament Greek , to be able to form an independent judgment on the interpretations of others . // As to theology , the only way in which the charge of antiquarianism could be fairly brought against it would be by criticism of its method . If it lingers behind the wants of the age , only interpreting the theologies of the past , it may well be called antiquated . But such a charge would be at present a complete anachronism . The whole tendency of doctrinal teaching is toward a theology which is Biblical and popular rather than philosophical . Such teaching is clearly fundamental , and can not be dispensed with . The department of sacred rhetoric Prof. Seeley himself sees to be essential , and he includes it in his proposed method of ministerial culture . He well says that " the principal tool of the n*inistry is speech , and unless they study the art of speech carefully and methodically , they must expect to fail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present system of theological training is in the main groundless . We have referred to it , not so much for the sake of answering it , as thereby to set forth more clearly the relation of Church history to the other departments . It can not be made a substitute for any of them , but is rather a most important auxiliary and supplement of them all . It certainly might easily happen that a candidate for the ministry might be thoroughly trained in exegetical studies , in dogmatic theology , in the principles and practice of public address , and yet be wanting in acquaintance and sympathy with the Church as a living , regenerating power in the world , and so enter his ministerial work with6ut a practical insight and wisdom . To be a truly successful preacher , a man must understand the laws and workings of human nature ; he must be able to preach the Gospel in forms adapted to the spiritual necessities of his hearers ; he must unfold Christian ethics on the side of the prevalent temptations and sins of the age ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social and political affairs . Such knowledge is the ripe fruit of personal experience ; but the way to it is opened and made easy by the teachings and examples of history . He who has studied Christianity in its historical aspects , has in his hand the keys for solving the new questions of the hour . Most problems of practical religion are more than half settled when their historical antecedents have // been brought to view . For there is a law of reason , a philosophy of life , in history , which puts the past into closest connection with the present and future . He that has read that law understandingly will be the wisest in discerning its practical applications , and will see most clearly the relation of special cases to general principles . History , then , we repeat , is the highest school of practical wisdom . Here I thank Prof. Seeley for his timely utterances , and gladly borrow from them , in closing , a sentence which seems fitly keyed to those words of Neander with which II began : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he is a part , and which throw light upon the great process of which his own life is a moment ; the course along which the human race travels can be partially traced , and still more satisfactorily can the evolution of particular nations during limited periods be followed . Studies like this leave something more behind them than a refinement imparted to the mind , or even than faculties trained for future use : they furnish a theory of human affairs , a theory which is applicable to the phenomena with which life has to deal , and which serves the purpose of a chart or compass . Such a study , teaching each man his place in the republic of man , the post at which he is stationed , the function with which he is invested , the work that is required of him-such a study is History .
