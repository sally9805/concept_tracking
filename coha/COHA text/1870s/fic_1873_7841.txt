Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : To the Portsmouth Boys from To the Portsmouth Boys 1873 Come rally , boys ! Awake , Awake ! Hear , old affection on you calling , Your childhood 's home appeal doth make , On willing ears may it be falling ! She calls you from your busy care , To meet her in her pleasant places , Her old regard again to share , And smiles from old familiar faces . Each rock and haunt , remembered well , Will send its hundreds forth to meet you ; Joy 's loudest note will widely swell , And ardent hearts expand to greet you . And bell and gun and flame and tongue Will blend their notes in peal sonorous , Familiar as of old they rung , And Welcome ! Welcome ! be the chorus . Crowd not the generous impulse back That prompts the thought in which you gather ; T were well to leave life 's dusty track , And turn in filial duty hither  --  To once again in union join . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at the well-remembered shrine Kindle anew the heart 's true feeling . B. P. S.
