ARTICLE IV . - THE FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND : AND THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH ORDER , THE INHERITANCE OF THEIR SONS . PROBABLY there are no persons in the world more enthusiastically convinced of the divine excellence of their Church order , than those Congregationalists who have searched it to the bottom . To them it seems a system purely Christianthoroughly Catholic , in the unspoiled sense of this long abused word . They see that it allows any philosophy of theology that is not inconsistent , upon the whole , with the maintenance of vital faith . It permits churches to manage their affairs according to their own judgment ; to have such officers as they wish , under such names as they prefer ; and to use any methods of work and any forms of worship that do not interfere with cooperation , while at the same time facilitating , in the highest degree , the union of different churches in support of any common interest . It tolerates any divergencies which are not schism ; and schism is its specific abhorrence . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal activity , favors a mutual good feeling , makes disputes short , concentrates attention on the great spiritual ends , conserves liberty , cherishes the truest loyalty to leaders , establishes the deepest unity , and promotes the broadest enterprise  --  a system on which the whole world can be one Christendom ; and the only system on which this is possible . Endowed , then , with such qualities , we should expect to see its superiority demonstrated in its fruits . This we do ; but not in the way that might at first be supposed . Having almost the earliest start , upon this Continent , we naturally look to see its churches foremost in numbers and in membership . But what is the fact ? The Congregational Churches fall behind the Presbyterian , the Baptist , and the Methodist ; and some other denominations nearly or quite equal them . It would seem , then , to be very clear , either that we after all mistake in regarding this system // as the true one ; or else , that it has not been vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congregational Churches were organized in Northern New Jersey . Why did they not stay there ? Because , in the days when this question was decided , their thoughts were upon other matters than church order ; and the Presbyterianism around them was administered in so Congregational a spirit as not to remind them of the difference . Again , these churches were numerous in Central and Western New York . Why did they not hold all that region ? For the same reason : owing to similar causes , they were without solicitudes upon the subject . A Congregational migration has been pouring into all the Western States and also into New York City and into other cities . Why has not that migration everywhere flowed into Congregational Churches ? Still again  --  the same reply . The true answer to the question , why has not Congregationalism , proper , occupied all the land ? may be given in four words : It did not try . Another form of the same order , the Baptists , tried and succeeded . Though burdened with a schismatic rule , exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * and since Congregationalists began to give attention to the matter , their growth , also , has been rapid . * We hail the progress of this earnest brotherhood ; for we are sure that it will not always remain a schism , but will yet stretch forth to us all that warm right hand , which from the first , has in most things been so true to the Lord . It is doing a great work for christ ; and so , for all who are Christ 's . Yet we can not forget that the Baptist denomination from the very first had a point to carry which gave to their movement an aggressive character-even towards their brethren . From the first , it was a " sect , " in the specific meaning of that term , conscious of separation from the general Christendom , and of an opposition so serious as to forbid that communion in the Lord'j Supper which is the outward sign and seal of fellowship . On the other hand , the only point which our Separatist fathers sought to carry was catholicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , and its inalienable inheritance . It was from schism that they separated . It was against a tyrannous sectarianism that they rebelled . The spirit of the Church-order which they founded is to-day the Spirit of Christ 's Catholic Church ; and thus , necessarily , in the farthest possible remove from the Roman Church ,  - -  that most sectarian of the " sects  --  and broadly distinguished from all those that have added their own theories of ordination or of baptism , to the foundations laid by Christ . // But now comes another question : What was the reason that Congregationalists did not try ? No other denomination , if we except the Friends , has been so indifferent . And the answer is also easy . Perhaps it would be clearest if given in two parts . Dividing our reply , we call attention , then , ftrst* to the fact , That for more than a hundred years , many of the most prominent men in the congregational ministry , too/c little interest in ( ongregationalisrn or in the Doctrine of the Church . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , there was Dr. Leonard Woods , for a generation the leading teacher in our most important Theological Seminary . Dr. Woods was , really , not a Con gregationalist ; did not teach the system , and never understood it . And Dr. Beecher ? Dr. Beecher was all absorbed in a new theology and in zealous preaching ; and did not pay attention enough to the matter , to perceive , that by shutting up Congregationalism to New England , as he proposed , he would have stifled it to death . And Dr. Absalom Peters ? Dr. Peters was working out a noble idea , and with admirable sagacity and power-nothing less than the healing of all divisions among the denominations holding the Calvinistic theology ; and fusing the Congregationalists , and the Presbyterians of both the Scotch and Dutch schools , into one co√∂perative brotherhood . And he almost succeeded . It required an opposition of a character which must be designated as remarkable to defeat this Christian endeavor , in which all the Congregational churches warmly sympathized . But that triumph of sectarianism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , 1837 , broke in upon their dream of union , like the sound of a trumpet . Very reluctant , however , were they to give it up . It was rooted in their fundamental conceptions ; it was a part of their very idea of the church and of the duty of individual Christians . Not till nearly half a generation had passed were they ready to accept the conclusion forced upon them , that they must in some measure , at least , work alone , and not till an additional ten years had passed were they separate . And even then they clung to codperation in foreign missions . Going farther back , however , we find little interest in the doctrine of the church , among either Presbyterians or Congre // gationalists , when , in 1802 , the " Plan of Union " between them was agreed upon . Fifty years earlier , none of the great preachers , on either side , eared much about it . The subject hardly had a place in the public attention . Edwards , apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining there might be some advantages in the Presbyterian way . We might extend our review still farther back , with no different result . The truth is , that through all these later generations , a large share of the Congregational leaders ( in company with those of the Presbyterian denominations ) gave little thought to this doctrine . The strength of the Congregational system of church order lay , during this period , not in the ministry , but in the churches . The brotherhood stood for their principles like a rock . If , now , we go on to ask , further : Why was that important doctrine so much neglected , then ? the answer is , that other issues , of a theological and practical nature , were more pressing . The air was full of them . Within this period came the Arminian controversy , the " Great Awakening , " the French war , the Revolution , the " Last war " with England , the Unitarian division , and also the organization of all the great benevolent societies . The Methodists alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , in full flame of zeal for their particular church order ; and this because they were in the fire of their youthful enthusiasm under their great founder ; and also because their peculiar method was so inwrought in all their work , that if warm in the one they must needs be in the other . Moreover , their system is so shaped as to cherish a sectarian zeal . But if we further inquire : How happened it , in the state of things described , when neither Presbyterians nor Congregationalists were much wedded to their particular systems , that Presbyterians won over Congregationalists to a silent and gradual absorption ? - this could easily be explained in detail ; but , briefly , the reason was , that the Presbyterian system was at that time further along in its development than the Congregational ; which had not yet provided its Associations and Conferences . This checked development of Congregationalism is the second part of our answer to the question , " Why did they not try ? " It accounts for the little interest felt in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The system seemed to require no study . Its principles appeared so obvious , the whole of such extreme simplicity , that in the absence of any outward stress directing attention to it , it was easily passed over , amid the warring elements of those times . The people valued it ; but ministers cared less about it . And , to all that must be added the very important fact , that the indifference of Presbyterians themselves allowed their system to be administered in a Congregational spirit ,  --  we might almost say , upon Congregational principles ; so that Congregationalists had hardly any occasion to be made sensible of anything alien to their own ways . The absorption in almost every case commenced with allowing the minister to become connected with the presbytery-which seemed natural enough , when there was no Association for him ; and up to the present hour there remain important churches upon the General Assembly 's list-if our information is correct-which retain their original Congregational self-government . Others have been , very slowly , worked over . But now another question presses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that seem to indicate an essential weakness in it ? By no means . The noblest trees have a tardy growth ; the animals that are the slowest to mature have the longest lives ; and the systems of human society which unfold by slow degrees , under the shapings of Divine Providence , they are most divine . Other systems " have their day and cease to be ; " this , in its essential principles , is immortal  --  the abiding order of the Church , whether militant or triumphant . Unquestionably the tardy development indicates a peculiarity , but not an inferiority . This revived Apostolic Church-order was not a contrivance ; it was a Divine growth , born unexpectedly , born of the Spirit , whose goings are unseen ; nurtured in sorrow ; moifided under spiritual pressure , the daily necessities of conscience , through successive generations . The very sincerity of this movement - an unconsciousness of any object except the one of serving God and saving men-kept the early leaders from creating any forms , not then obviously needed . They did not theorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were following the // Apostles . They were full of thoughts of God . Furthermore , they realized the capacity of the apostolic system , for doing anything that ought to be done ; and they expected their successors to meet rising needs , as they themselves had met those of their own times . They had no premature anxieties , and no ambitions . It was this inherited singleness of aim , that led a later generation , here in America , to seek the unity of the Calvinistic denominations , and made them blind to any possible loss to their own , in a zeal for the kingdom of God . They sought that kingdoin first of all things . They made great sacrifices for it . And though their attempt at union failed , we may confidently expect their descendants to see of that travail of their souls and be satisfied . Causes of this slowness in the unfolding of Congregational modes of action , and of the long pause in their development , lie far back , in the very beginnings . They become clear when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iRomanism , or even of Methodism . The Church of Rome spent its infancy encompassed by fierce enemies . Its circumstances compelled it to struggle for life ; and identified its success with that of Christianity itself . Failure seemed nothing less than an overturn of the kingdom of Heaven on earth . It was thus led to avail itself of every possible instrument , and to nourish all its forces with the utmost care . And now , it behooves us to mark this : That first impulse it has never lost . Like the essential characteristic of an animal species , the trait has clung to that Church through all its generations , and is as strong to-day as even ' . The one thought of Rome is , " I must conquer ! The kingdom of God on earth stands or falls with me . " So it welcomes any helper who will work in obedience to its central authority . A man may be half crazed , still Rome finds him something to do , if his enthusiasm will but submit to the control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the centuries , an array of societies , institutions , and systems of potent routine , of unparalleled completeness and effectiveness . Tf* only , Rome had said , " Christ must conquer , " it had indeed proved itself the final monarchy , the earthly City of God . If csnly it were the pure // truth for which it were contending , its power would be resistless . Even for error it wages a formidable battle . So great is the efficiency of an organization , which as mere organization , is the most perfect human power that time has known . What strength this completeness of development and discipline gives ! What courage it lends to every private soldier ! What enthusiasm it kindles in all its captains ! And look at Methodism . Its generative impulse was for a work of aggression in behalf of the kingdom of God  --  a work of mercy for sinners-truly Christ 's purpose of salvation ; and its beginning was an attack . But this was made under the control of one man ; and hewith all his great gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir , in full , of the peculiar apostolic spirit . Unlike the apostles ( happily , not one , but twelve ) , who invited the brotherhood to a share of power , in an exercise of gifts for ruling and teaching , as well as exhortation , and who led them along by the discipline of practice , to self-government , united by brotherly love , and not under " lords of God 's heritage , * ' John Wesley made himself a lord . He held fast the reins . He was the creative , organizing , controlling autocrat of his new " method . " And he handed down a true and proper " dominion to successors . Thus he built up a vast system of govern . ment-an army , enthusiastic , tireless , united , yet lacking the sweet spirit of the apostolic liberty , with whatsoever that enfolds , and develops . Like other armies , this has been hasty in its methods , and rude in much of its work ; striking vigorously for raw and massive results ; preparing the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other denomi. nations , Methodism has worn an aspect somewhat domineering and partizan . In proportion as it gets a better ideal , it becomes another thing . The completeness of its organization is due to the very peculiar circumstances of its origin . Bat now turn to CongregationaWs ? n . In what manner did the ancient order of Christ 's church come to be restored to England ? It was pressed out of the English conscience under the tyranny of the bishops and the Queen . These most unapostolic lords of the church persisted in retaining vestments , ceremonies and liturgical phrases , which were really symbols of the // papacy ; and which , we now see , have kept alive the essential ideas of the papacy , and threaten to restore its power . There were men who could not worship God with such symbols . They met apart . For this , some of them were imprisoned and hung . The survivors all the more earnestly studied the Scripture , to see whether Christ forbade such worship as theirs , and whether it was true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was this earnest study of the New Testament , with their peril and conscious weakness , which set these men back into the very attitude of the apostles , and put them in possession of their beautiful secret , the true conception of the kingdom of heaven on earth , so that they realized it as almost none had realized it since the beloved disciple died . What then was the generative impulse of their new movement ? lilt was a simple following of Christ , a yearning after a pure worship , and liberty to serve Qod according to God 's command-this yearning leading them to a united study of Scrip . ture , to prayer , and to a courageous obedience to their conscience , thus instructed , a calm resistance of tyranny and a resolution to take and to keep the liberty that belonged to them as the sons of God ; and also into a sacred covenant with one another , and a brotherly loyalty to chosen and trusted leaders . It was a spirit of consecration , and a resolve , come what may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another and to all men , in the divine work . In this spirit , they worshiped in suburban gardens and secret chambers at London , and in the solitary places of the North Country . In this spirit they fled to Holland , and afterwards to these shores . They had no call , like Wesley , to a broad , sudden aggression . They were not ambitious of constructing a new church order . But they sought the kingdom of God and its righteousness ; and when they laid the foundations of New England , they believed that they were aying foundations of His kingdom on this continent . This was their distinct purpose ; and the purpose is our inheritance . Now it will be observed , that the primal impulse in the case of the Separatists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was specifically different from that under which Wesleyanism started into being , and widely contrasted with that which gave // shape to the policy of the Roman papacy . In the case of our fathers , there was no suggestion or demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military array . The whole make-up of the impulses and the circumstances , the entire historic condition , under which Congregationalisin was re-born into the world , must have been different , in order to have allowed the creation at that time , of a system thus completed in details . On the other hand , it is difficult to conceive of a more perfect reproduction , in so late an age , of the very spirit and impulse of the apostles . They differed in this , that while the apostles were scattered abroad , as pilgrims and sojourners , in order to preach the gospel to all nations during their own lifetime , these later pilgrims united in one community , in hopes of preaching it in its apostolic purity , through their natural and their spiritual children , to all future times , and over the whole earth . In other respects , the parallel appears singularly exact . And the result is , a restoration of the apostolic ways , in theory as perfect as can well be imagined . Would that the practice did not lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to attempt to show , how the peculiarities of that age did not call for the full developiuent , then , of this restored idea of the Church either in England or in the Plymouth colony . The leaders of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay received it at second band , of Plymouth . But the chief men of this colony had not gone through with the same baptism of persecution , had been more strongly influenced by ideas of their country and age , retaining certain habits of mind , prejudices , and notions about rank and government , which were in the way of its fullest development . The idea was received ; but not so thoroughly as to possess their minds with all that it involved . And , then , the times did not require a complete and minute development in forms of organization . Attention was engrossed by the exigencies of a new country , its toils and wars ; still other interests kept crowding in ; and so it has come about , that even at this present hour , Congregationalism remains an illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . " But , early in this century , it found a way to send missionaries to the heathen . It has since learned , in part-though only // in part-how to found churches at home ; as well as , how to carry on a wide and varied Christian work . Its long needed array of agencies and methods is greatly enlarged , and now requires but a few simple additions , which ought to be easily made , to put it on an equality with any on earth . It remains for the generation just coming into power , to survey the whole round of church functions , to see what is still wanting , and to supply it . The delays which at first strike one with a feeling of disappointment-putting us , apparently , so far behind our neighbors - will probably be recognized , at last , as a benefit . Man must not try to manufacture history . It can only be born of the times and in its time . We must not be impatient with the Divine Providence . The morning does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hasten . But it grows upon the world with an advance which , however slow it may seem , is irresistible and sure . And it is also punctual . We envy none of the triumphs of any other Christians , whatever their name ; but count all their joy and honor as our own . We greet them with both hands . We bless them with full hearts . But now , our time has come . At last , we , Congregationalists , find the world open before us  --  and our hands are free . At the same time , the body of our churches and our ministers are kindling with some return of the fathers ' enthusiasm , and with a sense of encompassing difficulties and dangers that demand every form of instrumentality and all possible zeal . It has now become a necessity , that we go on and develop our system to its utmost . And it is in the highest degree important , that we do this in strictest logical harmony with our principles . In the first place , these principles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does not adhere to its principles builds confusion and overthrow unto the walls of its institutions . We need to review the work already done ; and see whether all of it is in harmony with the apostolic ideas , the law of Christ ; and then to see what is wanting , in order to meet visible exigencies , and in what way this want can be legitimately supplied . The Congregational fathers having ascertained the true principles of Apostolic church order , builded in accordance with // those principles-so far as their humble beginnings required . We now find , in many departments , something lacking to completeness , and , First . In the matter of terms of commurdon . " On this rock , " said our Lord , to wit : on faith , publicly confessed , in Christ the Son of God , ' " will I fonnd my church . " This is the law . It is our law ; and Congregationalists have aimed so to shape the conditions of communion as , on the whole , to come as near as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none who are not . The intention has been most Christian and most Catholic . But , to some extent , they have erred in carrying it out . As a matter of fact , an impression has often been made that they add other conditions to the one laid down by our Lord , and put into the church 's foundations corner-stones of their own device . This impression , wherever it is found , is an obstacle to Christian success . To remove it , however , we do not need to eviscerate our confessions . None of them have too much of the substance of the Gospel . We need , rather , to make them more symmetrical and complete , and more true to the spirit of the Gospel . And in the administration of our churches , likewise , we are not called upon to be lax , but to be more careful than ever in recognizing all the signs of a truly Christian character , and in honoring its purity and gentleness . In a word , we are to take more pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. * A Christian character is often found in connection with an imperfect theology . &amp;condly . The brotherhood of believers is a principle of the Apostolic order ; not merely in the shape in which it is held by all other Christians , but also as a principle of church order-defining the relation of members . In this sense it is more than * The frequent alteration of phraseology in a church 's confession , is undesirable . The unhappy impression of which we speak must almost always be made , when articles calling attention to nice metaphysical distinctions- however correct these discriminations may be-are read without explanation . There may often be a reluctance to modify this carefully chosen language . In such cases the difficulty may be avoided , by remanding such a Confession to its proper use , as a standard and an instrument of instruction ; and the substitution , in the formula of admission to the church , of something better suited to that occasion  --  a statement less metaphysical , but more devotional. // the democratic idea of equality-an equality of position and original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our churches , strictly speaking , are not mere democracies ; they are brotherhoods . That is to say , it is not according to Congregational church-law , that a portion of the church , be it a majority or a minority , should insist upon their own way in the face of another portion dissenting , when the circumstances do not compel immediate decision . The law of Christ requires consent-when this is not impossible . We must act as real brethren act . The law of our polity is the Christian law of brotherly love ; and is transgressed whenever that is broken . No tyranny of the majority or of the minority is any more at harmony with it than is the despotism of a single will . That charity which is essential to the health of all churches is essential to the order of ours . Now , although there is probably as much of the Christian love in churches of the Congregational name as in any others , and possibly more than in such as are imbued with a stronger esprit de corps-which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our principle . In the first place , the principle is not duly apprehended as a part of our constitutional law . Brethren often satisfy themselves with a formal correctness of procedure , after the manner of other denominations and of the secular courts ; so that , even with us , forms that were designed to guard against injustice sometimes become its instruments . And , again , majorities , having in accordance with the letter of the law the power to decide , sometimes act in the spirit of that dominion which Christ forbade . What seems more strange , there has grown up a tyrann y of the minority , whereby a few , by virtue of mere selfwill , govern . All this illustrates the truth that constitutional forms can not supply the lack of Christian character . Liberty is found only where the Spirit of the Lord is ; and only where His Spirit is bestowed in such measure as to overcome the natural desire of men to rule , i. e. , to make tools of one another . Our churches need that larger measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve one another . In fact , the real trouble is that we are not sufficiently bent upon making our // churches such brotherhoods as we know they ought to be . We too often allow members to remain unacquainted ; take scant pains to secure to new comers the welcome for which the heart of the stranger pines ; and indolently consent that they who happen to be opposites by temperament or association , should be opposite in feeling . As a body of churches we have taken no suitable means to keep all the members alive to their fraternal tie . We fail to carry out satisfactorily our most fundamental principle . A few of the churches hold " Fellowship Meetings , " taking the place of the weekly prayer meeting after each communion ; and it is a question whether even a measure so slight as this , properly followed up in the pulpit and elsewhere , might not be very effective . The truth is , there is an educative power in institutions , even in one so simple as this , or as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to important interests ; they are reminders of forgotten duties ; they open up opportunities for new beginnings . A little institution may be a great power . The Lord 's Supper upholds Christendom . It is undeniable that we inherit from our English ancestry a certain pride that has often been a hindrance in our work . Congregational churches retain more of this than they are conscious of ; and are credited with more than they have . Of late years , moreover , society in New England and elsewhere has been undergoing a serious alteration . A class of operatives and laborers has been forming ; families have been removed from their ancient homes ; multitudes have acquired habits of change ; the greed of money has been growing stronger and has been spreading ; churchmanship , in various denominations , has supplanted the feeling of unity which prevailed previous to the multiplication of denominations ; while a spirit of doubt , with frequently a bitter denial of the truths which alone warm and unite , has sifted subtle-working and chilling repellancies all abroad . So , in ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suffered check ; while , always , that strong demon , Caste , we must remember , lies wakeful in every heart . Were an angel from heaven to bring us a command of God , he could not make our duty plainer than it is . Unless we set // ourselves against these hostile influences we must lose ground . Whether we now clearly see the way or not , we must find a way to make our churches truly households . And this is demanded , even , by the needs of our neglecting populations . There are multitudes whom our churches are not reaching ; who must be reached , if at all , not in the large way , by a popular eloquence , but through personal intercourse ; and this warm and direct intercourse can not be had , except by developing into a higher activity the spirit , and also the usages , of a genuine household affection within the church itself ; so that it shall work outside also . And the people are fond of warm churches , and are drawn towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a genial spring-time , is able to soften even the frozen clods , and stirs to life long-buried and invisible seeds . Thirdly . It is a scriptural principle recognized by Congregationalists , that every believer has received a g*fi of the Holy Ghost ; and that gifts of teaching and exhortation are distributed , not to a clergy exclusively , but to many others also . It follows that every believer is bound to exercise his gift , and that the churches ought to incite him to faithfulness , and , often , to provide him a way . This has not been done satisfactorily . Ideas inherited through the Anglican Church from the Roman survived in the minds of our fathers , partly as principles and partly as impressions or habits , and led the Puritan ministry into assumptions respecting the clerical function , which were really inconsistent with their own principles , and resulted in their keeping too large a share of the church work in their own hands . Although " prophesying " was a recognized privilege of the laity , and was sometimes much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working force of the church membership , and to keep this in constant activity , is of recent origin . It is a curious and very significant fact , that no one of the great Confessions of Faith so much as recognizes this as a duty or an ideal . No definition of the church , no enumeration of the functions of the church , not one of public authority even among us Congregationalists , up to the present hour , so much as names the conversion of souls , or the carrying of the gospel message , as among the functions of the church . All this is left to the clergy as a distinct body . // And yet the idea is fundamental to that conception of the church , which we hold and which is laid down in all our standards . Let us be thankful that now , at last , after so long a time , there are some who have come to see this clearly , and to feel it , in its really grand significance ; and who well understand , that unless this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discipled . The members of Christ 's church must be active members of a body that is alive-apostles knowing themselves sent of God to persons within their reach . Their gifts are for use . They are used , but not in satisfactory manner or measure . There are hundreds of " out-districts " in our oldest States , nearly every one of which could be furnished , from our churches alone , with a useful " lay-helper , " specifically trained in some good degree for this work . The practicability of this measure has been proved to all who lift up their eyes ; its necessity needs no proof . The General Association of Massachusetts voted that the Home Missionary Society stand ready to promote such efforts ; and the society itself has voted to stand ready ; and it stands . Of course , everybody comprehends the need of some special stimulus and suggestion , from one quarter or another , when any new usage or a further development is desired on the part of any body of churches . In this particular instance , the stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The churches are not carrying out their principles . But where we do employ lay-helpers we do not get all the good of them that we should , owing to another failure to apply our principles . For Congregationalists believe in the local church , as an institution of the greatest value ; that every be . liever needs to be in its communion , its fellowship of love , of worship , and also of work . Fellowship in work is a Congregational principle . Or , in other words , Fourthly . It is a principle of the Apostolic Church Order , that every church is a working society. * We have acknowledged * A church is clearly a " w*orking society " when its members are haldtually associctted in its work . A good occasion for promoting such association is found in the CHURCH FELLOWSHIP MEETING-held after each communion . This can be made the occasion for such reports , informal statements , public discussions , and personal talks as shall very effectually serve the desired end . Some have set apart one of the regular prayer meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or home concert . // the principle , but we ought not to be satisfied with our pres. ent development of it . For example : There are churches wjhich sustain a most useful class of lay-helpers- " City Missionaries , " who are doing a blessed and beautiful work . But do all the churches which employ these devoted laborers keep their members familiar with the interesting details of this work ? Are the church members really associated in it ? If not , then they lose a stimulus which they need ; and the missionaries lose a sense of the sympathy and cordial interest of their brethren which they ought to receive ; and the cause of Christ continues to lack certain active helpers among the members of these churches who might easily be rallied around these missionaries . Our churches are not working on their own principles . There is a checked development . The same remark applies to the relation of the churches with the Young Men 's Christian Associations . Unless each church is receiving reports from its young men who are connected with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all their work as to feel it to be a part of its own , and to share in the blessing of the doing of it , then the churches suffer loss . As a matter of fact some of the most active members belong more to the association than to the church . This is certainly a hurtful mistake . Many are the churches and ministers who acutely feel it . And it seems strange that they do not apply their principles to its cure . Fifthly . The Parish principle ,  --  asserting church responsibility for communities , and declaring that every church is bound to ascertain artd fix its own field and work ,  --  is another fundamental maxim of our church order , as it is a dictate of common sense . In former times , this principle was honored ; every church had its definite responsibility , and every family in all our colonies knew itself to be in the parish of some church , which owned its duty to do for that household all that it could . Our fathers would not have respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain outside of all religious care . Ought we to allow it ? Let us see . Your church is bound to do-what ? To proclaim the gospel . But to whom ? To every soul properly // within its reach , so far as it possibly can ; nor to proclaim it merely , but to bestow spiritual nurture upon every individual who does not reject it ; to train individual children and young people ; to comfort individual sick people , poor people , bereaved people ; to receive individual strangers with warm welcome ; to pick up individual waifs and outcasts-orphans , young criminals , and those in danger of becoming criminals ; looking after the solitary and the aged ; doing good in endless details and particulars , as it has opportunity . But if it is to render such blessed service to all these individuals , it must know them . And if it would be sure that it has overlooked none , it must know all properly within its care ; in other words , it must have a definite parish . The churches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian charities within their several communities . They cover the land . They are within reach of the people . They are the only institutions that are omnipresent , or that can be made so . They , and they only , are competent to grapple with wide-spread wants or iniquities . This is their proper business . And they need this business ; need it to keep themselves in good condition and repute . If they leave it undone , or even allow agencies not identified with themselves to do it , they lose health , forfeit affection , misrepresent the Gospel , dishonor and defeat Christianity , and earn people 's hatred and contempt . It is a joy to think how much of such work is really done ; but mortifying to recall the lack of business system , the careless and incomplete way in which it is carried on , and how large a part is left undone . " Children 's Aid " societies would find little to do  --  or else ten times as much to do-if the churches were working on an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as individual churches do not know where their responsibility begins and ends . There is another consideration . The work of Christian churches is , very largely , a work by ind*v*duals on individuals ; not only these works of mercy but its spiritual labor also . The church is strong through the personal testimony given in the lives of its members . The church grows by the distinct conversion of soul after soul . Neglecters are to be won over , // man after man , woman after woman , child after child ; won by individual neighborly kindness and individual patient affection . Happily , God has not made golden-mouthed orators enough to charm the multitudes by eloquence and by wit , into penitence . In His mercy he has left the privilege of the precious work of Christ open to alL And , moreover , He has imposed this work as a necessity . He is showing us that the world is not going to be won over by selected members of Christ 's body , while the rest are idle ; but all must work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the supernatural facts which they profess , looking toward supernatural ends , animated by aims that reach beyond the earth ; they must be obviously loving in the way in which Christ loves  --  the sufferers because they suffer , the sinners because they are sinful ; this love must be obvious in deeds , or the world is going more and more to disbelieve in Christianity and to bate and despise theology and the church . Granted that such life is lived and such love proved to-day ; we ough*t not to rest content with the present measure of it . The very principles of Apostolic Church order bind us to adopt better ways of securing a general testimony for Christ , in a wide-spread activity , both in spiritual labors and in works of mercy . But these principles can not be developed , these better ways can not be realized without a conscientious definition of its own work by every church . The definition can always be made by a registration of families if not otherwise . And it is needed as much by the ministers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now room to specify . When the churches have defined their parishes , and when stated church-meetings have become occasions for earnest review and prayer in behalf of their entire work in these parishes , then they will be more worthy of being called " working societies " than they now are . Sixthly . So feeble has been the impulse of the churches to look after their own business , that even the Christian education of their children has been slipping out of their hands and has become , in a sense , a separate interest ; sometimes consciously separate , and looking on the sanctuary services with as much of criticism as of sympathy . In some cases children are , in // 527 effect , educated to stay away from the public worship ; while , very often , the Sunday school instruction substituted for it has been unintelligent and pointless , and some of the exercises-the singing , more frequently than anything else-calculated to do more hurt than good . Now the system of church order , which we inherit from the Apostles , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance , but in its first principles . For we do not , like the iRomanists , seek to enslave souls in unquestioning submission to a pope , nor yet to subdue them by mere force of feeling ; but we aim to make them free through the truth . This is the Congregational way . We are not worthily carrying out our principles in this great matter of the Christian education , in our homes , our Sunday schools , or , We remark once more , even in our pu*pits . Is it not a fact that many congregations demand entertainment-in short , that the pulpit be a platform ? But congregations , if they will but consent , may receive entertainment , and with it the noblest benefits , from an opening up of the broad fields of the truth with its manifold connections of doctrine . Our Sunday schools have ordinarily studied the Bible microscopically . And this is one good way . Doubtless much benefit has been derived from it , even when the passages chosen have been disconnected , treated in an artificial manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contain . It may often be impossible to avoid these faults . But if so , then all the more should congregations demand of their ministers an exposition of the Scriptures , not in single texts and paragraphs alone , but in its masses , also  --  the preaching of whole epistles , at one time , whole biographies , entire books of the Old Testament . And the people should see to it that their ministers do not fail to marshall the doctrines in luminous array , so that men shall 1e compelled to realize the Christian truth as an accordant body of thought , profoundly rational , and full of nourishment and inspiration . They should require of their pastors that truth which is the revelation from God ; and this revelation as it has been worked out of the Bible through the long study and meditation of the Christian church , while she has found the word sweeter than honey to her taste  --  the views which have // stood the test of time , have answered the needs of successive generation*i and of races most unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such is the preaching that our parishes ought to exact , and not theological fancies that may chime with a passing mood , some graceful sentiment , some spicy paradox , a literary dissertation , a saucy attack , or illustrations that displace thought and conscience . In a word , the churches should require of the pulpit , and even of the Sunday school , such instruction as tends to edify to the stature of complete men in Christ Jesus . Our very church order demands this ; for the weightiest questions respecting the conduct of life and the discipline of the church , must sometimes be decided by vote of the members . Yet many churches are not requiring such preaching . They do not demand theology . And what is theology ? Theology is clear and comprehensive ideas on divine things  --  the truths exhibited in a rational and edifying consistency . That so many congregations are not exacting this of their religious teachers , is a symptom of debility . So far as this habit prevails among Congregationalists , they fail to honor their principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the particulars in which we fail to develop the Apostolic church principles satisfactorily in the local administration of our churches . It is not affirmed that in these respects we fall below the standard of other denominations . We fall below our own . It is not every denomination that has an opportunity for so large a failure . And in this fact there is no small encouragement for us . We have but to carry out our principles in order to secure a nobler efficiency than the world has seen . We are building on divine foundations , on the heavenly plan . The logical development of the system which we have received results in the heavenly society . Then let us set at work afresh with the unbounded enthusiasm which this thought justly gives . We have been ordering our campaign , even in its discipline and drill , upon the instructions of the Great Captain . Then let us perfect this discipline ; and let us , in all things , push forward upon these very lines upon which we have set out . We have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And // the local church is the foundation of everything . Ocir hopes , humanly speaking , are built on that . Any improvement that is to be general and lasting must have its roots and support there . Let the churches be roused , instructed , trained in such a manner as to develop their forces well , and everything else that we pray for will be likely to follow . The effort to do this involves great labor on the part of pastors , and an enthusiasm that many wateis can not quench ; but it is worth all . Space is left us , now , not to discuss , but only to enumerate , other respects in which our principles are capable of fuller development Let us consider some of these connected with the communion of churches ; and I. The provisions for th' seasonable formation of new churches . This is an act of church communion . It is not a matter which concerns alone the church or churches out of whose territory the new parish is carved , but others also . And the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is very often the slowest to see , and especially to seize the new opportunity . A communion of churches which should leave this matter to such agents alone , must expect to fall behind all others . Seeing this , the General Association of Massachusetts requested the Home Missionary Society in that State to assume the responsibility of the seasonable formation of new churches . The society has consented , and has done as much , perhaps , as under the circumstances could be expected . But public attention is not yet sufficiently awakened , nor have the arrangements which are requisite to the necessary promptitude , been made throughout that State . In the rural districts of the west , churches are formed as rapidly , perhaps , as ministers can be found for them ; but in most large towns there is need of a better system . But in both east and west , we want a definite and recognized way of planting a church-seed . It has been our habit to wait until a church could be regularly organized with good prospects of permanence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as twelve Christian men and women -- or , often , half as many-can be induced to arrange in a simple manner for a prayer meeting , and for promoting Christian // interests . Such a little company , organized by a neighboring pastor and faithfully tended by him , would often , by natural growth , become a church ; and whether it does or not , would at any rate promote fellowship and activity . And we may ask , indeed , what right have a number of Christian families , living in a community without a church , to keep aloof from one another ? How can they escape the duty of actively loving and serving one another , and of agreeing together to do all they can for the kingdom of heaven there ; giving effect to this agreement by fixing upon particular efforts in which they will unite ? And how can a neighboring pastor excuse himself from seeing this state of things , when it exists ; and , seeing it , how can he forgive himself , if he does not try to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the proper objects of real Christian neighbors ? If he should neglect it , then surely it is both the privilege and the duty of some one else to take up this service which he refuses ; and it is but an act of brotherly communion on the part of the neighboring churches , or better , of the whole body of the churches , to have an understanding with regard to the way in which this shall be done . So , at any rate , judged the General Association of Massachusetts ; and it not only invited the Home Missionary Society to accept this responsibility , but also advised the organization of just such little companies , under the name of " The Christian Neighbors. " * Each , of course , needs to be under the watch and care of some pastor . But votes do not execute themselves . The interest of the churches needs to be aroused . We should provide for the actual application of our principles . And this , II . In furnishing an adequate provision for encouraging and spiritually reinforcing churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something in this way ; and a few of them a good deal . Our Home Missionary secretaries in the several States have doubtless counted this personal service among the privileges of their office . But what is one man for so large a territory - and a man burdened with so many other duties . In Massachusetts , even the Methodists have four * Minutes 18*3 , p. 10. // presiding elders ; and these , with other permanent arrangements of theirs , ought to make that denomination more effective than we are in this kind of work . Bat our principles suggest an easy remedy for this defect . The trouble is , they are not energetically applied . We give money , but not always that something else which is necessary to make the gift effectual . The work is only half done . IlL There are regions where all the Congregational churches are weak , and the entire local christendom is feeble , while indifferentism abounds . But we have , as yet , found no way of reinvigorating these neighborhoods of churches . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There are ways in which by God 's blessing , this might sometimes be done , methods flowing naturally and beautifully from our principles . But too often the principles have not been applied to cases of this kind . IV . Within the limits of all our States there are communitz*es found upon the borders of townships and elsewhere , which have been poisoned by vulgar forms of misbelief and irreligion . For many years neighboring pastors , poorly sup . ported and overburdened with work , have looked athwart these regions in sadness . Conferences have noted them ; and courts of justice , in some instances , have become very well acquainted with them . Bat when you ask , what has been done ? the answer is-not much of anything . As though heathen in China could be reached , but our neighbors , no more heathenish , were too far away . Is it only at home that we lack inventiveness ? The truth is , we exercise it in some directions but not in others . This sometimes results from lack of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , and sometimes , from a similar lack on the part of Conferences . For it is too frequently the case that V. The Conferences are not vigorously at work . Some of them hardly seem conscious of having much to do . Their meetings are pleasant gatherings of happy brethren , with wives and neighbors , in which many things are well said and many done well . And they are very useful . They may compare well , for aught we know , with similar meetings in other denominations . But they come short in their true work . In many instances , // one is hardly made to feel , upon visiting them , that very serious matters are on hand , but the atmosphere is one of relaxation and enjoyment . Now every one of our Conferences has before it practical problems of the gravest kind . If they met charged with this feeling , their atmosphere would be tonic and electric ; and the youth and enterprise of our churches , now so often absent , would lend new life to their discussions and devotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop Congregational principles and to attend to their proper business , look at the Sunday school interest . The Sunday schools of a Conference form a most important department of the work of its churches . If there is any great matter which demands the earnest attention of these churches when met to confer on their dearest interests and their whole work , surely this is one . But this is not ordinarily identified with the churches . In many Conferences it does not statedly come up , except in allusions of extremest brevity ; but the " Sunday school men , " as they are called , have too often been left to form a separate clique , distinct from the churches , holding meetings by themselves and having circuits of their own , as though belonging to some other planetary system . And if the question of Sunday schools should happen to be brought up , it would , very likely , be with the idea of having an interesting time , but not at all with an intention or a hope of uniting upon any measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , or so important as the training of competent teachers . Another example is found in our treatment of intemperance . What have our Conferences done ? They have had speeches made , and have passed resolutions containing strong adjectives ; but when have the churches united upon a plan for the prevention of intemperance and the alleviation of its evils ? And yet this is their business , and theirs alone . No possible societies could do this work as the churches can . And now , after two generations , nearly , of public agitation , the churches are still neglecting it . If another illustration were needed , we could point to the very general omission to do anything for those families , within which // what is called the criminal class grows up . Such families are the natural wards of the churches ; but they are often regarded too much as the Jews viewed the Samaritans ; and , as a rule , they do not receive the particular , the sympathetic , the sagacious attention which they need , and which the churches themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for their own good , to give . For lack of the Christian humility and sincerity which such a service includes , our most Christian society is infested with moral diseases from which it might be free . It is but too manifest that our churches are only beginning to get at the work open to them through their Conferences . Here again , the development is incomplete . VT . In a similar sense , this remark applies to the State As . sociations ; and there is room for similar improvement , VII . When we ascend to still wider relations , we continue to find incompleteness . For an illustration , turn to the New Hampshire hills , and to both the shores and the inlands of Maine . Do you happen to have been made acquainted , through regular channels of information and cooperation , with the religious condition of these regions ? Do you know-you , who intend to keep yourselves well informed respecting such matters-whether the Congregational churches in those States are able to do the work there which cries out to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? The truth is , communities in those States are in sorest need of what they have no prospect of receiving ; facts of melancholy interest meet you on the right hand and on the left ; and from no quarter do we hear of measures which even propose endeavors adequate to the exigency . Would it astonish us excessively if , once in a while , we were to catch a whisper , coming up from the neighborhood of some discouraged church : " Let somebody else be at the trouble of preaching the gospel to these poor . This little bishopric of ours , let another take ! ** And would it be true to say , that such is the Congregational view of the apostolic way ? I suppose not ; but that we count it a great privilege to carry the gospel to the sheep scattered on the mountains . Whatever flocks we have in such places we mean to tend . If , owing to changes in these communities , we can not // do it in one way , we are willing to adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarity of the apostolic system , that it is not tied up to particular ways , but is permitted to adopt any methods which the cause of Christ demands ; that we never need to ask others to step in , because , whatever they can do , we can do ; for all forms are ours when they are necessary . If a work is costly , why is it not as much our privilege to stand that cost , as anybody 's ? It is not customary in armies , for a regiment , so soon as its position begins to be a little uncomfortable , to invite another to take it-confining itself to places where soldiering is easy . Nor is it customary with our churches . The hardest post is the post of honor , everywhere . And yet we have reason to complain of ourselves , that we do not more consistently honor this principle ; and that we do not more effectually strengthen the cause of Christ in regions where it is weak . But , finally , I have only to speak the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly incomplete , not yet clearly in harmony with our principles , not yet an assured success . If this be really a Congregational " Council , " and if it has been agreed that our national consultations , which must be had somehow , may best be had under this well known form , then why has it not the safeguards peculiar to the Council ? - distinguishing it from all other bodies and its sole trait -- in a strict limitation to topics definitely laid before it in letters missive ? If it be not a Council , why confound history by saying that it is ? And , indeed , seeing that what we need is , the freest fraternal Conference that can possibly be had , bringing all parts of the land together , why can we not content ourselves with a National Conference of Free ( i. e. self-governing ) Churches , copied after the most successful , which is also the most strictly logical , form of our State Conferences , the Conference of Maine ? There is no other similar outgrowth of our principles more natural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council seems in some danger of proving an example , not of imperfect , but of wrong development . We build an element of confusion into our walls , if in connection with this illogical and improper name we allow the idea which it expresses to shape the tone and action of this assembly . // Congregationalists do not want , and we believe they will not tolerate , a general corrective body , sitting to inspect the churches and the benevolent societies . What we do need is , an occasion which shall adequately bring to view the work which these churches and these societies have been doingbring it to view in such a way that we shall see and feel it all , shall unitedly study it , shall join our prayers and counsel in behalf of it , shall agree upon some measures for its furtherance , and go back to our homes wiser and stronger for all that we have thus seen and done , gladdened with the light of each others ' faces , warmer than ever in our mutual love , lifted into a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent but harmonious action . Congregationalists have often been told that their bond of union is " but a rope of sand . " Men have been so long accustomed to an authority which rules by force , that many find it difficult to conceive of a society held together by anything else . Seeing no dominion , they see nothing . So a barbarian easily appreciates the bond which holds slaves in a coffie , but when you speak of that which keeps the stars in their courses , he can not comprehend you . The force on which we rely , and which rules our whole church organism , is nothing else than that which is appointed for Christ 's universal household , of which the church on earth is a part . It is nothing else than the love which is LThristian character-in reality the sole bond of society that can be trusted , and the concealed strength of those cumbrous forms of strength with which the majority of denominations load themselves , and under which the church of Christ has staggered from the early centuries until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the church was too weak to retain her hold on so high a privilege ; was tempted and fell under bondage . From that bondage , however , after long and bloody trials , she has been redeemed ; and the heavenly liberty has come back to her . It has come to stay . And now can not we see what the result will be , if , clinging with a perfect love to our principles , we steadfastly press this apostolic system to its own beautiful completeness ? Let the // local churches , true to their most Christian terms of communion , everywhere make themselves real spiritual households , organize themselves for their work , filling their parishes with deeds of mercy , delighting in their Sunday schools as gardens of God , and sending their lay-helpers into all out-districts ; let the Conferences , with the Home Missionary Society to assist , fill each its distinct region with unfailing watchfulness and help , organizing ch urches seasonably , comforting discouraged churches , and , on the right hand and on the left , addressing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and National Associations fulfill their appropriate functions , the benevolent societies holding their meetings in connection with these bodies ( so kept in closest union with the churches ) , and have we not a system by which any kind of Christian work can be done , a system as varied and as flexible as the IRomish , and as much better than that as apostolic liberty is better than servitude ? And if the churches in any of our States should succeed in giving a peculiarly complete illustration of the apostolic principles , is not the example likely to be followed throughout the land , and in missionary stations round the world ? And may not some of us live to see a brotherhood of churches , apostolic in order and in spirit , liberal and powerful , encompassing the earth ? Let us believe that the time is coming when Christians of all denominations shall be in the habit of meeting together and shall work in harmonious codperation . When they do , from the necessity of the case , their doing it must be on the apostolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England fathers .
