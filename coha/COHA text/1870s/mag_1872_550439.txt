74 JEFFERSON GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA . COLLEGE friends find themselves strano*ely confronted , sometimes , in after life ; rivals , perhaps , for prizes more important than a high place in a commencement programme . In January , 1779 , the Virginia Legislature had to choose a governor to succeed Patrick Henry , whose third term would expire on the 1st of June . The favorite candidates were no other than John Page and Thomas Jefferson , fellow - students at William and Mary , who had exchanged love-confidences , and gone with thumping hearts together to meet their sweethearts at the balls in the Raleigh Tavern at Williamsburg ; and not so very long before either . In 1779 , they were still young men , - thirty-six , both ; Page being fifteen days the elder . The gilding was still bright on some parts of the state coach which Lord Botecourt had brought over from England about the time of their entering public life ; and " the palace " had not yet been defaced by vandal hands . Timothy Pickering of Massachusetts saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outhouse near the palace ; " a clumsy machine , " he thought it ; " as heavy as two common wagons " ; " gilded in every part , even the edges of the tires of the wheels , and the arms of Virginia painted on every side . " On the day , ten years beTore , when these two young friends had smiled derision at this historic coach , as it bore the new goveri** to ) the Capitol , who were less **K ; than they to be candidates for the right to ride in it ? Things had changed , indeed , in Virginia , since young Jefferson had put his fiddle under his arm , and gone to the palace to take his part in one of Governor Fauquier 's weekly concerts . Page 's strong point was , that , though born a member of the plantation aristocracy , possessing a great estate , inhabiting the largest house ever built in Virginia , and enjoying the honor most coveted by his class , a seat at the viceregal Council board , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sided with his country . The contest was a warm one between the friends of the candidates ; but between the candidates themselves there was no contest . It was part of the recognized etiquette of politics then , which both of these gentlemen observed , that the candidates for a responsible executive post should take no part , either by word or deed , in the canvass . Jefferson was elected by a majority of a very few votes . His old friend wrote him a letter of apology and congratulation , and Jefferson replied with the tact which good-nature inspires . " It had given me much pain , " he said , " that the zeal of our respective friends should ever have placed us in the situation of competitors . I was comforted , however , with the reflection that it was their competition , not ours , and that the difference of the numbers which decided between us was too insignificant to give you a pain or me a pleasure , had our dispositions toward each other been such as to admit those sensations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the pleasure of congratulating his friend Page on his election to the governorship of their native State . The governor elect took the lead in one important administrative act before he was sworn in . The war was gasping for money ; for the legal-tender notes were rushing down the sharp decline that led from par to zero ; and , as yet , the French troops had not begun to scatter coin about the country , nor Dr. Franklin to coax more millions from the French treasury than were needed to freight a few ships with military stores . One of Jefferson 's friends in the House , who had rented four thousand acres of good lan*d before // the war to tenants at six pounds a year per hundred acres , and received his rents in 1778 in the legal-tender currency , had not money enough from that estate to buy twenty barrels of corn . Governor Jefferson 's magnificent salary of four thousand five hundred pounds a year was not enough , when he began to receive it , to supply the inmates of the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would hardly buy the governor a new saddle . This was the period when members of Congress - the ruling power of the United States - had to borrow little sums from their landladies in order not to be quite penniless . Elbridge Gerry , member from Massachusetts , a man of good estate in Marblehead , was behind with his board , in 1779 , a hundred and forty-seven dollars , besides being obliged to borrow twentyseven from his landlady , and going in debt sixteen to his tailor and shoemaker . At the head of the Finance Committee , which had to deal with millions , he had not sixpence in his personal pocket with which to buy a pair of shoestrings . Hard money alone , as it was thought , could restore the currency . Jefferson 's Italian neighbor , Philip Mazzei , who had once been in office under the Duke of Tuscany , told him that the Duke , like his Highness of Hesse-Cassel , was a great hoarder of money , and , only three years before , had had " ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which , Mazzei thought , he could borrow for the United States , if he could be sent over properly authorized . Jefferson wrote to John Adams on the subject , stating the facts , and commending Mazzei as " a native of that duchy , well connected there , conversant in courts , of great understanding , and equal zeal in our cause . " Nothing came of this suggestion , so far as is known , and those ten million crowns remained in the Duke 's strong box , though the struggling States needed them so much , needed them more and more . Doubtless the two neighbors talked over those precious crowns of-75 ten enough as they sat by Jefferson 's fireside on Monticello , or strolled about in Mazzei 's young vineyards . Indeed , whenever , in this impecunious world , there is known to be a large lump of money " lying dead " anywhere , there are sure to be individuals scheming for its resurrection . Besides , was not the Duke of Tuscany , though an Austrian prince , a brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic for Franklin and the noble insurgents ? And had not Philip Mazzei sent his Duke an Italian translation of the Declaration of Independence ? How plausible , on the breezy heights of Albemarle , seemed the scheme of getting some ' of those dead crowns from Tuscany , and giving them life in Virginia ! Philip Mazzei , who had all an Italian 's ardor for the American cause , offered to go himself without compensation to his native land , and negotiate the loan ; and soon after the election of Jefferson to the governorship , he sailed , commissioned by Governor Henry and his Council , to borrow from his prince a sum not to exceed nine hundred thousand pounds sterling , and to buy with part of it a quantity of supplies for Virginia 's quota of troops . Not to exceed ! It is always prudent to limit strictly the powers of an agent . Mazzei might , in his excessive zeal , carry off the whole ten million crowns ! It was a costly mission to poor Maxzei . His misfortunes began before he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Baron Riedesel , who moved in , with his Amazon of a wife and his large military family , before the Italians could move out . It was a tight squeeze , as the Baroness recorded ; and Mazzei , it seems , had no notion of the amount of sustenance required by so many Hessian warriors and a baroness who rode astride . " We looked impatiently forward , " wrote the lady , " to the time of his departure , and that of his wife and daughter , on account of the smallness of the house and the scarcity of provisions . " She took the liberty of remarking one day , Y*efferson Governor of Virginia . // that a calf 's head and tripe was not enough for twenty persons ' dinner but the frugal Italian replied that " we could make a very good soup of it . " He did , however , add to the repast " two cabbages and some stale ham , " and this , says the Baroness , " was all we could obtain from him . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had made their way across the sea , the Hessians ' horses had trampled their vineyards , planted with so much care , and watched by Jefferson and by all intelligent Virginia with so much interest , into irremediable ruin . In Paris , face to face with practical Dr. Franklin , the project of extracting nine hundred thousand pounds sterling from the coffers of an Austrian duke addicted to hoarding , at an interest of five per cent , for a Province four thousand miles off , whose independence the duke had not acknowledged and would not acknowledge , did not wear so feasible an aspect as it had on Jefferson 's piazza , overlooking the rich garden of Virginia . If the Duke of Tuscany was brother to a romantic queen of France , he was also brother to an emperor of Austria , who reminded Paris patriots that he was a king by trade . Tuscany ! The very name was enough to put even the placid Franklin out of temper ; for he had had an eye himself upon those Tuscan crowns , knew they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Izzard of South Carolina for drawing twenty-five hundred pounds sterling per annum , in his character of Tuscan minister , though *inable to do so much as to get permission te enter Tuscany . Franklin was barely civil to the sanguine and generous Italian . At their first interview , the moment he learned Mazzei 's errand , he dashed cold water upon the scheme . " So many people , " he said , " have come to Europe on that kind of business , that they have ruined our credit , and made the money-men shy of us. " * Mazzei argued in vain . As * Lossing 's American Historical Record , Vol. 1 . * ) . 33. often as he went out to Passy and broached the subject , Franklin " never failed , " as Mazzei reported to Governor Jefferson , " giving some mark of disapprobation and displeasure . " And well he might , since he had already offered six per cent Thr the very crowns which Virginia hoped to get for five . The Duke of Tuscany kept his money Mazzei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to seek in vain compensation for his losses ; and the governor passed his two terms in torture , with hostile fleets ravaging the shores , and hostile armies menacing the interior , while every effort to defend the State was " cramped for want of money. ** In sending Mazzei upon this mission to a reigning prince , Virginia performed the act of a sovereign State . In the same spirit , and , evidently , without a thought of impropriety , the Legislature , on the second day of Jefferson 's governorship , June 2 , 1779 , formally ratified the treaty with France . Such acts as these throw a valuable light upon the subsequent State Rights controversy . This ratification seems to me so remarkable , that I will copy the resolutions by which it was authorized : - " Resolved , NEMINE cONTRADICENTE , That it is the opinion of this Assembly that the treaties of alliance and commerce between his Most Christian Majesty of France on the one part , and the Congress of the United States of America , on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ratified and confirmed , and the same are accordingly hereby ratified , confirmed , and declared binding on this Commonwealth . " Resolved ; That the governor be desired to notify to the minister of his Most Christian Majesty , resident at Philadelphia , the above ratification , under the seal of the Commonwealth . " On the 1st of June , then , .1779 , Mr. Jefferson became his Excellency , the second republican governor of Virginia . In his public life hitherto , all had been plain sailing , for wind and tide had // been strongly in his favor , and the services which he had been called upon to render were such as his character and habits had fitted him to perform . How different the task which confronted him now ! Not more difficult nor nobler , but far more difficult to him . And from the time of his election in January , to the day when he was sworn in , the situation had been growing , every week , more complicated and menacing . If , in January , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st of June he shrunk dismayed from the responsibility which that honor brought with it . The French alliance , he now knew , was working ill in two ways ,  --  in relaxing the vigor of the States , and rendering the foe more unanimous and more savage . The three British commissioners had announced to all the world that the nature of the contest was changed by the alliance with France . Britain was , thenceforth , going to use all the means for subduing rebellious Colonies which " God and Nature had placed in her hands . " Since America mz*ght erelong become an accession to France , the common law of self-preservation ( said the commissioners ) " will direct Great Britain to render that accession of as little avail to her as possible . " The Colonies were to be subdued by being destroyed . America was to be laid waste . This declaration , published in October , 1773 , was acted upon at once by Henry Hamilton , commandant of Detroit , who marched into the Western wilderness to rouse the Indians to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mississippi , and embraced all the territory which we now call Virginia , XVest Virginia , and Kentucky , besides a great part of what is now Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois . I need not remind the reader that that rich and well*vatered region swarmed with Indians , among the best and bravest of their race . Taking post at Vincennes on the Wabash , a hundred miles from its junction with the Ohio , Colonel Hamil 77 ton spent the winter in " talking " with chiefs , gathering supplies , and preparing for a desolating swoop over Kentucky into the settlements of Virginia . An Indian war , therefore , was among the difficulties preparing for the governor elect while he was receiving the congratulations of his friends . He knew it not , however . It was a good " express " who could keep either his despatches or his scalp while making his way from the Wabash to the James in 1779 . British commanders at the South executed the threats of the commissioners not less . They , too , were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to conquer . The war was now to be transferred to the South , too thinly settled to resist , it was thought , yet offering an inviting field for spoliation . Americans as they wander about the dusty interior of St. Paul 's cathedral in London remark with surprise that the most showy monument there commemorates a soldier associated in their minds with defeat , - the great defeated Cornwallis . He certainly behaved at the South . more in the style of a bandit than a soldier ; not disdaining petty larceny , it appears , when he saw a precious object that could be conveniently pocketed and carried off . His system being to wreak the king 's vengeance , rather than promote his country 's interest , his orders were to imprison and de*poil every man who would not take arms in his service , and to hang every man who , after being thus impressed , made his escape and joined his brethren in arms on the other side . Governor Jefferson , therefore , from the watch-tower of his high office , had sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower of the men of Virginia were , of course , in the army under Washington . They must be looked to and their numbers kept up . But that new enemy in the Carolinas , able , enterprising , relentless , must be opposed with all the force which Virginia could spare ; since to defeat Cornwallis in North Carolina w. * the Yefferson Governor of Virginic*. // only way to keep him out of Virginia : it was self-d*'fence . The Indians were a third object of attention . The thousand British and German prisoners in Albemarle occasioned constant solicitude ; and the more , as the war drew nearer the borders of the State , and as the men of the State were drawn away to serve in distant camps . On the side of the ocean there was always a wide and an open door to danger . Nothing but a fleet will ever be able to shut out a fleet from Chesapeake Bay ; and what was Virginia 's navy then ? Four little cruisers , carrying in all sixty-two guns . And as to Hampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men think that even now , in this year 1872 , after fifty-seven years ' work upon Fortress Monroe and the Ripraps , there is nothing there which could stop a good iron-clad . Certainly , there was nothing in 1779 that could stop a wooden frigate . Three weeks before Jefferson 's inauguration , a fleet of a dozen vessels , with two thousand troops on board , had run in without firing or receivin ga shot , and landed troops without the least molestation . These troops carried out their part of the new programme . They spent several days in ravaging , burning , plundering , murdering , while the militia fled helpless ; for in Virginia , in 1779 , there was only one musket left to every four or five men , and the unarmed militia of the region could not even limit the area of spoliation . When at last Governor Henry had got together an armed force of some magnitude , the bold marauders ceased destroying turpentine , tobacco , and pork , ceased despoiling farmhouses and burning villages , and went at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smoke of their burnings had not ceased to ascend to heaven when Jefferson took the oath . What had been done once , he well knew , could be done again . That was the situation : front door open to hostile fleets ; back door , to hostile Indians , General Washington wanting all that Virginia had of men , money , arms , and food ; a powerful foe at the South , anxious to get over the border ; one gun to four or five men , and a most plentiful lack of all other warlike material , which can only be got with money . This was the task which had fallen to the lot of a lawyer of thirty-six , with a talent for music , a taste for art , a love of science , literature , and gardening . But mind is mind , intelligence is intelligence . I would not choose Mr. Emerson or Mr. Darwin to command an expedition or govern a country ; but if , in the course of events , it fairly fell to their part to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their acquitting themselves respectably . Moreover , the individual at the head of a free republic does really have at command , and may utilize , its whole intelligence , as we saw Mr. Lincoln do during the late war . Jefferson had to aid him a Council and Assembly which contained the best sense which Virginia could spare from the field . The gloom which hung over the State in consequence of the late unchecked and unpunished ravages of the enemy near the sea was dispelled , before the new governor had been many days in office , by most cheering news from the opposite quarter . Virginia had in the field , at that time , two eminent heroes : one so known to all mankind , that he need not be named ; the other , now almost fallen out of memory : one , at the head of the armies of America ; the other in the far West , twelve hundred miles from the capital of Virginia , with a band of a hundred and fifty kindred spirits , holding back , by the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his native State . George Rogers Clarke was the name of this other hero . He was a native of Jefferson 's own county of Albemarle ; " our Colonel Clarke , " he calls him ; a neighbor of the governor ; not twenty-six years old when Governor Henry sent him into the wilderness , in the spring of 1778 , to protect the border This hero is not as famous as Leonides or Hannibal 178 August , // only because he has not had such historians as they . But he defended the western homes of Virginia precisely as Hannibal would have done . By way of giving the Indians something to do in their own country , he floated and marched to the post of Kaskaskias on the Mississippi , took it , held it as a base struck for other posts near by ; terrified some tribes ; seduced others ; broke the spell of British influence became lord paramount in the land of the Illinois ; showing himself a most sWift , alert , tough , untiring , closely calculating commander . No order from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pen , " he wrote to the governor in April , 1779 , " have I receiv*d from you for near twelve months . " In the midst of his success , when he had held the Indians quiet for nine months , Colonel Hamilton interposed , marching from Detroit , and taking post at Vincennes on the Wabash , right between Clarke and Virginia . Instantly , the whole aspect of things was changed ; for Hamilton was a man of energy and skill , long familiar with Indians , unscrupulous , willing to let his Indians wage war in the Indian manner . XVhole tribes fell off from Clarke , and joined Hamilton , who had guineas , wampum , weapons , red cloth , and all that an Indian prizes . War parties streaked the prairies and glided through the woods . The Indians of the whole Western wilderness , from the Alle*hanies to the Great River , were agitated or astir . Clarke prepared to sell his post as dearly as he could ; for , as he said , he had not men enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aid . But while he was in the rush of preparation , calling in his outposts , burning superfluous or obstructive houses , making all tight and snug for a desperate fight , came news that Hamilton had sent out so many parties from Vincennes , that he had but eighty men left to defend the post . His resolution was taken ; for , really , he had but one chance . Let him wait at Kaskaskias till the spring opened , and he would 79 have Hamilton , British troops , and thousands of Indians upon him , against whom his little band could fight only to be at last tortured and burnt alive . The distance from Kaskaskias to Vincennes was a hundred and fifty miles ; Clarke 's force , about one hundred and fifty men . Sending a barge round by river with the artillery and stores , he struck across the country with a hundred and thirty soldiers , joined on the way by a few young men of the country . It was in the midst of the great February thaw , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies soft , the woods soaked and dripping . On the eleventh day they were within nine miles of Vincennes but those nine miles were covered with the waters of the overflowing Wabash . It took the band five days to accomplish the distance , " having to wade often , " says the heroic leader ; and , the last six miles , " up to our breasts in water . " They must have perished , he added , if the weather had not been warm . Reaching dry land an hour after dark , they saw the place before them ; when , all chilled and wet as they were , they began the attack ; and , after an eighteen hours ' fight , took the post and all its garrison without the loss of a man . It was Clarke 's audacity , fortitude , and skill that won this victory , which in its consequences was one of the most important of the war ; for , besides relieving the whole frontier of apprehension from the Indians , it confirmed Virginia 's claim to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final negotiations . The victors were bountifully rewarded . A few days after , they made an easy capture of forty men and ten thousand pounds ' worth of goods , floating down the river to reinforce Colonel Hamilton . In short , George Rogers Clarke was lord of the West , vice Henry Hamilton , deposed , and sent as a prisoner of war , with his chief officers , to the governor of Virginia . " But what crowned the general joy , " wrote Clarke to the governor , " was the arrival of William Morris , my express to you1 Yefferson Goverilor of Virgznuz. // with your letters , which gave general satisfaction . The soldiery , being made sensible of the gratitude of their country for their services , were so much elated that they would have attempted the reduction of Detroit , had I ordered them . " XVilliam Morris was despatched with tidings of this new triumph ; but , as he was killed on the way , it was not until the beginning of June , a hundred days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colonel Clarke , though it relieved the governor* s mind from an ever-present dread , devolved upon him a painful duty . Hamilton and two of his officers reached 1Nil* liamsburg , prisoners , charged with have ing incited the Indians to scalp , massacre , torture , and burn ; Hamilton himself having confined in a dungeon without fire , and loaded with chains , and cruelly tormented , an American citizen . For forty years Congress and the people had seen , with a sorrowing and indignant amazement , the cruelty with which English commanders had uniformly treated American prisoners of war , and they had sought to avenge the wrong by heaping coals of fire upon their heads , - treating English and Hessian prisoners with an extravagance of generosity . In their unique manifesto of October 30 , i778 , the Congress of the United States had declared to the world that , " considering themselves bound to love their enemies , " they had " studied to spare those who were in arms against them , and to lighten the chains of captivity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been courted and petted , rather than abused . Jefferson and his neighbors had personally striven to render the stay of the Burgoyne prisoners in Albemarle , not endurable merely , but delightful . I can perfectly understand the feelings of the Virginians on this occasion ; because , during the late war , while Union prisoners were dying in anguish at Andersonville , unsheltered , and not permitted to shelter themselves from the blasting Georgia sun and rain , I saw , near Fortress Monroe , Confeder ate prisoners in an exquisite seaside hospital , nourished , while their wounds were healing , upon a diet of alternate broiled chicken and lamb-chop , with a glass of delicate hock ( whenever ordered by the physicians ) at eleven and four ; and as well treated , in all essential particulars , as Queen Victoria could be if she lay sick in Windsor Castle . Having seen this sight in September , 1364 , I can understand how it was that the governor of Virginia and his Council , in June , 1799 , came to the conclusion to discontinue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliation . The Council , in fact , " resolved to advise the governor " that the three prisoners from Vincennes " be put in irons , confined in the dungeons of the public jail , debarred the use of pen , ink , and paper , and excluded all converse , except with their keeper . " Each variety of human being has its own besetting foible . As a man of great executive force is apt to be cruelly reckless of others ' woe , so a person of scholarly habits and philanthropic character is generally too reluctant to be the instrument of inflicting pain , even when justice , necessity , and mercy all unite to demand it at his hands . I observe , therefore , with pleasure , in the voluminous correspondence relating to this affair , that Governor Jefferson rose superior to the natural and usual infirmity of men of his temperament , and went heart and hand with his legal advisers . He put those men in irons , and immured them in a dungeon . In those days , too ( Howard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dungeon . It was rotten straw , foul air , darkness , underground chill , and everything that was most dismal and repulsive . A hundred years ago , the Christian religion was just struggling into existence . it had not yet acquired force enough to purify the public jails of remote Virginia . But Jefferson , philanthropist as he was , and , indeed , because he was a philanthropist , adhered firmly to the system of retaliation ; perceiving , as he told General Washington , that retaliation in this in-8o // stance was only a more far-reaching kind of mercy . General Phillips , that " proudest man of the proudest nation on earth , " prisoner of war in a pleasant mansion near Monticello , sent a vigorous , though moderate and respectful remonstrance to Governor Jefferson . His chief point was , that Hamilton having capitulated , it was a breach of faith on the part of Virginia to treat him otherwise than as a prisoner of war . The governor ransacked authorities , but found nothing to justify this view . It occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet embodied in law , might have established the principle ; and he therefore , with the consent of his Council , referred the matter to the decision of General Washington . " I have the highest idea , " he wrote to tli . General , " of those contracts which take place between nation and nation at war , and would be the last on earth to do anything in violation of them " ; and " my own anxiety under a charge of violation of national faith by the executive of this Commonwealth will , I hope , apologize for my adding this to the many troubles with which I know you to be burdened . " The Commander-inChief , after much reflection and consultation with military men , thought it best , upon the whole , that Hamilton and his companions should have the benefit of the doubt . Their shackles were , therefore , taken off , and they were finally admitted to parole . Not the less were the governor and Council resolved to adhere to the system of retaliation . A prison-ship , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , was actually got ready , and the exchange of prisoners was stopped between V*ginia and New York . " Humane conduct on our part , " wrote the governor , " was found to produce no effect ; the contrary was therefore to be tried . If it produces a proper lenity to our citizens in captivity , it will have the effect we meant ; if it does not , we shall return a severity as terrible as universal . . . . . Iron , " he added , " will be retaliated by iron , but a great multiplication on distinguished objects ; prison-ships by . prison-ships , and like for like in general . " But , happily , Governor Jefferson , in November , 1779 , received notification from head-quarters that the British generals , under the new commander , Sir Henry Clinton , had changed their system , and were treating prisoners of war with an approach to humanity . Virginians might be pardoned for thinking that the just , spirited , and firm conduct of their governor and Council had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor had trouble enough with the thousands of Burgoyne prisoners near his own home . Their thriving gardens , attractive as they might be to a visitor , could not retain them when there was a chance to escape ; and whenever there was a British force operating in or near Virginia , no one could say , of a squad of soldiers on the tramp , whether they were deserters from that force , or prisoners escaped from Albemarle . " Four hundred desertions in the last fortnight , " wrote Colonel Bland in July , 779 ; and he had reason to believe , " with the connivance of some of the officers . " This news was not calculated to soothe the mind of the new governor . But the grand object of Mr. Jefferson 's solicitude , during the first summer of his administration , was to enable the gallant Colonel Clarke to make the most of his commanding position in the far West . The burning desire of that hero 's heart was to capture Detrdit , the seat of the enemy 's power in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " an uneasy thorn in our side . " A great host of friendly Indians were assembled at Vincennes , and all was ready for the expedition , except the more costly supplies , and the re iment or two of white troops needful for the onset . It lay heavy on the governor 's mind , durin , , the whole period of his service , that he could never quite spare them . Several times he thought he had both men and money enough . But , just as the troops were ready to march , an exigency would 1872. i8i // occur so dire , so pressing , that he was compelled to order them elsewhere ; thus Detroit remained in the hands of the enemy ; remained a very uneasy thorn in the side of Washington , the United States , the Federal l ) arty , until John Jay extracted it by treaty in 1794 . Governor Jefferson , unable to get Detroit , resolved to secure what Colonel Clarke had already conquered . A wild delusion prevailed just then that peace was at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each belligerent would retain what he actually held at the moment of treating , the governor ordered Colonel Clarke to build certain forts in the Western country , particularly one on the Mississippi , at the southern boundary of Virginia , which would make good Virginia 's ancient claim to extend westward as far as the Great River . Colonel Clarke , who was a surveyor by profession , - resembling in this as in other respects Jefferson 's own father , - built the fort , and named it Fort Jefferson . This year , 1779 , the last of Williamsburg 's serving as the capital of Virginia , was the last of Jefferson 's residence near William and Mary College , in which he had been educated . Being now elected a college visitor , he endeavored , amid the bustle and anxieties of the war , to lop off some of the dead branches that hindered , as he thought , its useful operation . He caused the Grammar School to be abolished , and the two professorships of divinity and Hebrew to be suppressed . In place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in chemistry , natural history , anatomy , medicine , law , modern languages , the fine arts , natural justice , and the laws of nations . In the spring of 1780 , Richmond , a village then of nine hundred white inhabitants , peculiarly defenceless and unprovided , became the capital of Virginia ; the government finding shelter - and little more than shelter - in extemporized wooden structures . The dream of peace was rudely dispelled . About the time of this removal to Richmond , April i , i78o , the stern and bitter trial of Virginia and her governor began . By the time he had arranged his new pigeon-holes at Richmond , came a private letter from Madison , then in Congress4 which must have appalled timid minds . The army under Washington , Mr. Madison said , was on the velge of dissolution , being short of bread and nearly out of meat ; the treasury empty and the public credit gone ; the currency nearly worthless , and no visible means of restorin* it ; the States pulling one way and Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , the period of profoundest gloom ,  --  the black hour before the dawn . It was the time when Thomas Paine , whose pen during the Revolution was equal to a thousand men in the field , drew the year 's salary due him as clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly and began with it a private subscription in aid of the gasping cause , which had an effect rivalling in importance a new number of " The Crisis . " The sum was but five hundred paper dollars , it is true ; but it was all he had , and it kindled the patriotism of men who had more . By the time Governor Jefferson had docketed Mr. Madison 's letter , in the first week of April , 1780 , arrived news that a British fleet and army were investing Charleston ; news followed , six weeks aster , by intelligence that the city was taken , South Carolina helpless , and a British army free to move northward , over North Carolina , into Virginia , unless a half-armed militia could stop it . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half the next , was a period of the most rending anxiety , and of exertion the most intense and constant . With four thousand five hundred Virginians already in the army , we see him stimulating the recruiting system in each county , writing letters , public and private , to county members and magnates , urging them to utilize the dying currency , and get out the last man with the last dollar , while it still had a semblance of value . He arranged , early in the campaign , // three lines of express-riders , - one to General Washington , one to Hampton Roads , one to the head-quarters of the Army of the South , - so that , at a crisis , he hoped to be able to get and send news at the rate of one hundred and twenty miles in a day and night . Still further to guard against surprise , he despatched General Nelson on a tour of the eastern counties , requesting him to get the county lieutenants together and concert a plan of action in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , it was an agonizing question , to which quarter Virginia should send her levies . Three letters from the Committee of Congress at head-quarters lay upon his desk at once , all asking for men and means ; but early in July , General Gates arrived at Richmond , on his way to take the command in the South ; and , for the next six weeks , every man , horse , wagon , gun , bayonet , axe , cartridge-box , shoe , belt , saddle , blanket , tent , and coin , which Governor Jefferson could beg , buy , borrow , or get made was hurried away to General Gates 's head-quarters in North Carolina . Some Virginians saw with dismay the governor pouring into General Gates 's camp the whole of Virginia 's means of defence . His answer then and ever after was , that Virginia*s single chance of escaping devastation by Cornwallis 's army lay in strengthening Gates . If Gates and his army did not stop and hurl back upon Charleston the British forces , nothing could keep them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia became a manufacturing State . " Our smiths , " wrote the governor , August 4th , " are making five hundred axes and some tomahawks for General Gates , " - turning out twenty a day , - " and we are endeavoring to get bayonet-belts made " ; though leather was so scarce that people stole the flaps of cartouch - boxes from the wagons to mend their shoes with . The governor sent messengers all over the State to pick up little lots of material , such as duck and leather . And , when he had accumulated supplies , he was at his wit 's end for wagons in which to transport them . Nearly a quarter of a century had elapsed since Braddock had found wagons so scarce in Virginia and Maryland ; and Governor Jefferson , since he had no money in his treasury to hire or buy them , found them scarcer still . In this extremity he was obliged to impress wagons , not sparing his own . His principle was , to leave on every farm the horses and vehicles absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest for the public service . This he did upon his own farms in Albemarle . It is interesting to note that , in the crisis of the , campaign , the governor was sending about to try and find , for the use of General Gates , a copy of the old map of Virginia , made when he was a child , by Professor Fry and his own father . The ladies , this summer , were contributing the costly trifles of their jewel drawers to the cause , besides huge packets of the paper money of the period . Doubtless , a hard-pressed treasurer valued Mrs. Sarah Cary 's gold watch-chain , which " cost ? 7 sterling , " or Mrs. Ambler 's " five gold rings , " or Mrs. Griffin 's " ten half-joes , " or Mrs. Ramsay 's collection of " one half-joe , three guineas , three pistareens , one bit , " more highly than the same lady 's sounding collection of four bundles of paper money , containing in all seventyfive thousand five hundred and eighteen dollars and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised . It would buy one or two blankets , or half a dozen pairs of tolerable marching shoes . These efforts were in vain . In the midst of the governor 's endeavors , while he was in the very act of hurrying away reinforcements and stores toward the scene of action , occurred ( August i6 , 1780 ) the disastrous defeat of Gates at Camden , one hundred and ten miles from the capital of Virginia . It was a woful stroke . In an hour - such a destroyer is war - all that Virginia and the whole Confederacy // could accumulate of men , horses , and material , in two months of intensest exertion , was scattered and gone . Those wagons so painfully got together , to the number of one hundred and thirty , *ver* all lost ; one of Jefferson 's among the rest . In this sad extremity , the governor 's first thought was to gather precise and full information of the cause and extent of the disaster , and transmit the same to General Washington ; his second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any money in the treasury , or hope of any till October , " ) and do whatever else was possible to enable General Gates to make a new stand . For the lost wagons he tried to substitute barges in which to float provisions down the streams toward General Gates 's camp ; but he was obliged to become personally responsible for the cost of their construction . It marks the confusion of the time , that , when a month had elapsed after the Camden defeat , he was still ignorant of the fate of his own wagoner and horses . A wagonmaster from the fatal field told him that a br*ade quartermaster , at the moment of panic , cut one of his best horses from the harness and rode away on him ; and that his negro wagoner , Phill , lame in one arm and leg , was seen loosening another horse for the same laudable purpose of saving himself for further service . As the public money was carried in the governor 's wagon , it is to l ) e presumed he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about fifteen miles from the Virginia line and yet several months passed before a soldier of the victorious army trod Virginia soil . The enterprising and resolute yeomanry of North C*#olina held them in check , and even compelled a retreat into South Carolina . It was from another quarter that Virginia was menaced next . It was the 22d of October , 178o . Amid the universal horror and consternation caused by Arnold 's defection , the governor of Virginia was still sending forward from every coun ty all the men it could spare to General Gates , except a force which he still hoped to reserve for Colonel Clarke 's project against Detroit . Droves of cattle were on the southern road ; the smiths were still working on the axes , producing twenty a day ; agents were out buying the newly harvested corn on the credit of the State ; men were ranging the western counties for a hundred more wagons , - all for the new army forming under Gates in North Carolina , - when news came that a British fleet of sixty vessels had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson 's three lines of express riders stood him in good stead now ; for against such a force - a dozen armed vessels and three thousand regular troops of all arms - there was nothing in Virginia that could stand an hour and he could do little more than send the information to Washington and Gates . Such militia as were left and had arms were instantly diverted to this new danger ; but they could do nothing but make a show of resistance . To General Gates the governor could now only forward an idea : " Would it not be worth while to send out a swift boat from some of the inlets of North Carolina to notify the French Admiral that his enemies are in a net , if he has leisure to close the mouth of it ? " " His enemies ! " Mr. Jefferson soon learned whose enemies these newcomers were , and what they had come to Virginia for . When they had been a week at Portsmouth , doing nothing particular , a suspicious character was arrested on the road leading southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen to put something into his mouth . Tobacco , perhaps ? But the Virginia militia-men , experienced tobacco-chewers , did not recognize the correct swing of the arm in the motion made by this unknown ; and , taking the Nberty to examine his mouth , they extracted therefrom a remarkable quid , a neat little roll of the size of a goose-quill , covered with goldbeater 's - skin and // i*icely tied at each end . It proved to be a letter from General Leslie , the commander of the expedition , to Lord Cornwallis : " My Lord , I have been here near a week , establishing a post ; I wrote to you to Charleston and by another messenger by land . I can not hear for a certainty where you are . I wait your orders . The bearer is to be handsomely rewarded , if he brings me any note or mark from your lordship . A. L. " This great armament , then , had come to co-operate with Cornwallis in the subjection of Virginia . The design was frustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying and detaining Cornwallis . Leslie waited a month ; at the expiration of which he put to sea again with all his ships and all his men . During his stay , the British prisoners in Albemarle escaped in such numbers , that the governor deemed it best to march them into Maryland . And none too soon If they had remained in AlbemarIe through the winter , every man of them would have gone to swell the British Army when it made its last stand at Yorktown ; for Cornwallis , in the spring , could have struck the camp which they had made so inviting with gardens and shrubbery . To the last week of their stay , the agreeable relations between some of the officers and Governor Jefferson continued . To a young German lieutenant of scientific tastes , who had poured forth fervent thanksgivings for Mr. Jefferson 's kindness , the governor sent an amiable reply , making light of the services he had been able to render , and suggesting to his young friend to resume philosophy when the war should be over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the happiness , and not on the calamities , of human nature . " Really , these were fortunate prisoners . The officers had bought for their pleasure such a large number of the superior Virginia horses , that , upon their going away , it became a serious &gt;n*uestion whether they ought to be allowed to take the animals out of a 185 State so terribly in want of them ; and Governor Jefferson referred this point also to General Washington 's decision . The month of December , 1780 , was a breathing time to the Virginians . The governor employed it chiefly in pushing measures in aid of Colonel Clarke 's design against Detroit . The British were again powerful in the far West . Certain news came , that , in the spring , two thousand Indians and English would ravage the frontiers , unless employment could b* found for them nearer home ; and it was only too probable that the scene of the next regular campaign would be Virginia . Clarke was himself in Richmond for the purpose of urging and organizing the expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close , the final answer of General Washington to the governor 's strong recommendation of the scheme . The General 's consent and warm approval were given in due time ; but before his lett'er reached Richmond , events again interposed their irresistible fiat . On Sunday , the last day of the year 1780 , at eight in the morning , Jefferson received intelligence that a fleet of twenty-seven sail had entered Chesapeake Bay the day before . The messenger must have ridden hard , the distance in a straight line between Richmond and Old Point Comfort being not less than a. hundred and twenty miles ; and he had not waited long enough to learn what flag the vessels bore , nor whether they were bound up the bay or into the James . All the rulers of Virginia were in Richmond at the moment , for the Legislature was in session , within two days of its adjournment . General Nelson of the State militia and the heroic Clarke were there ; and Baron Steuben , who had recently come to assist in the defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier nor civilian could assist an anxious governor in determining the character of the new arrival . Could it be Leslie back again ? Might it not be the long-wished-for French fleet ? Was it that mysterious 2/effcrson Governor of Virginia . // expedition fitting out lately in New York , destined , as it was given out , for some Southern port , of which General Washington , three weeks before , had sent his usual circular of notification to the governors of States ? No one could tell . And if the fleet should prove to be hostile , would the commanding general be content with merely ravaging the shores of the lower country , like his two predecessors , or push for regions which no enemy had yet despoiled ? Which river would he ascend , the York , the James , the Potomac , the Patapsco ? What town would he first plunder , Alexandria , Baltimore , Williamsburg , Petersburg , or Rich-mond ? Amid all this doubt , the governor could only despatch General Nelson , with full powers , to the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties in case it were necessary to call out the militia . Richmond has known some anxious Sundays since , but , perhaps , few more distressing than this ; for the whole day passed without bringing further intelligence . Monday came and went ; but not a messenger from the lower country arrived . On Tuesday morning , at ten , the suspense was at an end . Word came that the fleet was British , not French , and that it had entered the James , not gone up Chesapeake Bay . Instantly the governor sighed orders , calling out half the militia of the region menaced , and a third of the militia of the counties adjacent to it , - four thousand seven hundred men in all , - and entrusted the orders to the county members just departing for their homes . That done , he directed the removal of public property to Westham , a village just above the rapids which close the navigation of the James at Richmond . The next evening at eight , Wednesday , January 3d , the governor learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor near Jamestown , the point where the river is only seven miles from Williamsburg . Then all thought the enemy 's first object must be the ancient capital . But it was not . On Thursday morning , two hours before the dawn , came intelligence that the fleet , favored by wind and tide , had swept on up the broad James to a landing below where the Appomattox enters it . There was still , therefore , some doubt whether Richmond or Petersburg was to he visited ; but the governor , who had now learned that " the parricide Arnold " was the commander of the expedition , called out all the militia of that part of the State . At five that afternoon all doubt was dispelled by a despatch which informed the governor that the foe had landed troops at Westover , twenty-five miles distant . In this emergency , Governor Jefferson found himself alone . Not a member of the Council or of the Assembly remained in Richmond to aid him , for all had gone to place their families in safety , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family - wife and three children , the youngest two months old - to the house of a relative at Tuckahoe , thirteen miles above the town . There were two hundred militia of the neighborhood near at hand ; and stronger parties were gathering at various points under Steuben , Clarke , Nelson , and others ; but nowhere in Virginia was there yet an armed body capable of holding in check a regiment of regular troops led by an Arnold . The governor mounted his horse , and took command of the situation . His first orders were to stop transporting stores to Westham , and simply get everything across the river , or into the river , anywhere so that Arnold could not easily reach it . Some hours he spent in superintending and urging on this work , first at Richmond , later at XVestham , reaching Tuckahoe , where his family were , at one in the morning . There he remained long enough to assist them across the river , and see them safely on their way to a securer refuge , eight miles above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point opposite Westham , where at daylight he resumed his superintendi 36 August , // ence of the transfer of the public property . At full speed , on the same tired , unfed horse , he continued his ride toward Manchester , then a small village , opposite Richmond . Before he reached it , his horse sank under him exhausted , and he was obliged to leave the animal dying in the road . With saddle and bridle on his own back , he hurried on to the next farm - house for another horse . He could only borrow there a colt not yet broken , upon which he continued his journey ; until , coming in sight of Richmond , he discovered the foe already in possession . After doing the little that was possible for the security of the public stores at Manchester , he rode away to the headquarters of Baron Steuben , a few miles off , for consultation with the only educated soldier within his reach . In war , everything , even the elements , seem sometimes to favor audacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , so promptly had the governor acted , and so well was he seconded by the county militia and their officers , that Arnold only escaped with his nine hundred men through a timely change in the wind which bore him down the river with the extraordinary swiftness of his ascent . In five days from the first summons , twenty-five hundred militia were on the traitor 's path , and hundreds more cominb in every hour ; but the breeze wafted him away from them down the James , with the loss of thirty of his men , laid lowby a whiff of musketry from a party of militia under Colonel Clarke . During the brief stay of the enemy near Richmond , they burned a cannon foundry , several of the public shanties , a few private houses , and a prodigious quantity of tobacco , besides throwing into the canal five tons of powder and spoiling three hundred muskets . After three days ' absence from the capital , the governor returned , and affairs began to resume their usual train . For eighty-four hours his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the James , where he entrenched himself in the camp abandoned a few weeks before by Leslie . A passionate desire pervaded the continent to have this traitor brought to justice ; or , as Jefferson expressed it , " to drag him from those under whose wing he is now sheltered . " When the governor learned the details of Arnold 's retreat , he felt that a small band of cool , resolute men could have seized and carried him off , and he now proposed the scheme to an officer of militia . The men to aid him were drawn from the regiments of Western Virginia , in whom the governor had " peculiar confidence . " The band , he recommended , should be few in number , the smaller the better , and he left it to the discretion of the chief whether*they should enter Arnold 's camp as friends , or lie in wait for him without . " I will undertake , " he wrote , " if they are successful in bringing him off alive , that they shall receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men formed for such an enterprise , it must be a great incitement to know that their names will be recorded with glory in history with those of Van Wart , Paulding , and Williams . " Arnold grew wary , however , and could not be caught . From this time civil government in Virginia was , in effect , almost suspended . The war was to be fought out upon Virginia soil and in Virginia waters ; and it is an old saying , that in th , e presence of contending armies , laws are silent . Arnold , Phillips , Cornwallis , Tarlton , Rochambeau , Greene , Steuben , Lafayette , Nelson , Washington , are the names that figure in the history of Virginia during the next nine months . Arnold , reinforced and superseded by Phillips , ravaged one portion of the State , except when checked by Steuben and Lafayette . Cornwallis and Tarlton , long retarded and eluded by Greene , swept over the border at last . Indians threatened the western counties ; and fleets arrived , departed , contended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood , resources , credit , ability , was enlisted in // the cause ; and so *nany men were in service during the planting season , that the governor feared there would not be food enough raised for the year 's necessities . Jefferson , in the midst of this agonizing chaos , did whatever was possible to supply and reinforce Greene , Steuben , Lafayette ; the burden of his cry to Washington , to Congress , being always " the fatal want of arms . " The need of arms became at length so pressing , that , after " knocking at the door of Congress " by letter for many months , he requested Harrison , Speaker of the Assembly , to go to Philadelphia , and beg Congress , in person , if they could not assign to Virginia a proper supply of arms , to at least repay Virginia the arms she had lent for the protection of the Carolinas . Power little short of absolute was conferred upon the governor by the Legislature at one of its hurried spring sessions . He was authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress all wagons , horses , food , clothing , accoutrements , negroes ; to arrest the disaffected and banish the disloyal . He was empowered , also , to emit the magnificent sum of fifteen millions of dollars , in addition to the hundred and twenty millions previously issued in the same month , - the whole amount being worth then about twentyseven thousand golden guineas . But all this availed little . Virginia wanted muskets , - wanted them , not merely for the great operations of the war , but for daily and nightly and hourly defence against predatory bands . Governor Jefferson could not furnish them . Four times in the spring of iy8i the Legislature of Virginia were obliged to adjourn in haste , and fly before the coming or the menace of an enemy . First , in January , when Arnold plundered the capital . Next , in March , when every act was hurried through from fear of another interruption . Then , in May , when an attack seemed so imminent that the few members who had come together gave up trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlottesville , under the shadow of Monticello , little thinking that the storm of war was about to sweep over Albemarle also . The day appointed for the assembling of the Legislature at Charlottesville was May 24th . The governor s second term of service would expire on the 1st of June ; but , amid the hurry and alarm of the time , the Assembly had as yet found no opportunity to attend to an election . There was no quorum till the 28th , when a Speaker was chosen ; but even then , such was the emergency , the House could not enter into the election of a governor . Cornwallis , with all his army , was five days ' march distant , and the State seemed to lie at his mercy . Not a boat could cross the bay or descend the James without risk of capture by the enemy 's smaller craft . The civil government seemed a nullity at such a moment , and the governor , as the last hours of his term were gliding away , could only serve his State by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that what Virginia needed then was a general , able , strong in the confidence of the people , acquainted with the State , one who could place himself in the centre of the crisis , rally around him every element of force Virginia possessed , and direct it upon the foe . He thought , moreover , that the seven thousand men of Cornwallis must be the enemy 's principal force ; and , under this impression , he wrote to General Washington on the 28th of May , while a small quorum of the Legislature were choosing their Speaker within sight of his house " Were it possible for this circumstance to justify in your Excellency a determination to lend us your personal aid , it is evident from the universal voice that the presence of their beloved countryman , whose talents have so long been successfully employed in establishing the freedom of kindred States , to whose person they have still flattered themselves they retained some right , and have ever looked upon as their dernier resort in distress , that your appearance among them , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would render them equal to whatever is not impossible . " The time had not yet come for Washingt on 's appearance on this scene , though that time was not distant . The month of May expired . Jefferson was out of office , and Virginia had nogovernor . The Speaker of the House , the President of the Council , and several members of both bodies , were his guests at Monticello , riding over from Charlottesville every afternoon after the business of the day was at an end . Just before sunrise , June 4 , 1781 , while as yet the inhabitants of Monticello slept , except , perhaps , the earlywaking master of the mansion , a horseman rode at full speed up the mountain , and sprang from his fQanT*ino* steed at the door of the house . He was a gentleman of the neighborhood , named J ouitte , well known to Jefferson . He had been spending the evening before at a tavern in Louisa , twenty miles away , the county town of the next county eastward from Albemarle . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty in number , had galloped into the town , had come to a halt , dismounted , and proceeded to refresh man and beast with food and rest . Jouitte guessed that the object of such a band , so far from the actual seat of war , commanded , too , by the famous Tarlton , could be no other than the surprise of the governor and Legislature of Virginia . He had had his horse saddled ; and , while Tarlton and his men were enjoying their three hours ' halt at Louisa , he had struck into an old disused road , a short cut , and ridden with all speed toward Charlottesville to give the alarm ; making a slight detour on his way to warn Mr. Jefferson and his friends at Monticello . He delivered his message there , and rode on to notify the rest of the members in the village . The family , we are told , breakfasted as usual ; after which the guests rode away to Charlottesville , and the inmates of the house prepared for a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , in which Jefferson placed his most valued papers . He sent his best horse to be shod at a shop on the river 's bank , a mile off . The two most trusted of the household servants gathered the plate and other things of value , and hid them under the floor of the front portico . All these things were done with a certain deliberation , because the family naturally concluded that Tarlton would first strike Charlottesville , which lay in plain sight from Monticello , and thus give them ample notice of his approach . But Tarlton , as he went thundering on towards the village , detached a troop to seize the governor and hold Monticello as a lookout during his stay in the vicinity ; and , hence , when Jefferson had been employed something less than two hours in sorting and packing his papers , an officer of militia came in breathless , to say that British cavalry were coining up the mountain . Jefferson had two law pupils at the time , James Monroe , and another whose name is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during these weeks of stress and ravage . To the other Jefferson confided his family , directing him to take them to a friend 's house some miles distant . He sent to the blacksmith 's for his horse , ordering the servant to bring the animal to a spot between his own mountain and the next , which he could quickly reach by a by-road through the woods . Still he lingered a few minutes among his papers , wishing to give his servant time to get the horse to the designated place . He left his house at length , - telescope in hand , light sword of the period at his side , - and walked down through the forest to the valley between the two mountains , where he found his horse . Before mounting , he paused to listen . No sound was audible , except the musical din of a peaceful June morning in the primeval woods . No clang of accoutrements , nor tramp of armed men , nor distant thunder of a troop of horse . He went a little way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of his telescope , he could clearly see Charlottesville ; but there was no unusual stir in the streets . A false alarm , perhaps ; and , so surmising , he resolved to go back to his house and finish the sorting of his papers , the accumulated treasure of the years that had passed since the burning of the house in which he was born . He had gone some distance toward his home , when he discovered that his sword had slipped from its scabbard , as he guessed , when he had stooped to get a rest for his spyglass . He went back for it . Before leaving the rock , he took another peep through his glass at the village ; when , behold , it was all alive and swarming with troopers ! Then , for the first time , he mounted his horse , and took the road to follow his family , whom he rejoined before nvTht . The dropping of his sword was a lucky event . If he had gone back to the house , he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered just five minutes after he left it . The two friendly slaves who were hiding the family treasures - one in the cavity receiving , and the other on the portico handing down - were almost caught in the act of stowing away the last article . They heard the sound of hoofs just in time for the one above to slam down the plank , shutting up the other in a dark , hot ; and narrow hole , during the whole eighteen hours ' stay of the troop . It proved to be a superfluous exertion of fortitude . Tarlton had given orders that nothing in the house should be injured or removed , and these orders were obeyed ; except that some of the thirsty soldiers , after their thirty hours ' gallop , helped themselves on the sly to some wine in the cellar . The fidelity of these two slaves , Martin and Caesar , during this time of trial , was always remembered by the family with gratitude and pride . Martin , after shutting down the faithful Caesar with the treasures , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the captain of the troopers with dignified politeness . He conducted the officer over the house . When they reached the library , where Jefferson had , five minutes before , been at work among his papers , this captain- McCleod by name , gentleman by nature - locked the door , and then , handing the key to Martirr , said , in substance , " If any of the soldiers ask you for the key of this room , tell them / have it . " One of the soldiers , to test Martin 's mettle , put a pistol to his breast and threatened to fire unless he told which way his master had gone . " Fire away , then , " replied the slave . C*sar , on his part , cramped and tortured as he was in his black hole , made no movement , uttered no sound , during the whole eighteen hours , - all the rest of that day and all the night following . Down the James , a hundred miles or more , Jefferson possessed a plantation named Elk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables , herds of cattle , and growing crops . For ten days Cornwallis lived in this house , which had an elevated site , commanding a view of the whole estate . Jefferson himself has put upon record what his lordship did or permitted during his brief residence there . He destroyed all the growing crops of corn and tobacco ; he burned all the barns , filled with last year 's product ; he took all the cattle , hogs , and sheep for his army ; he appropriated all the serviceable horses ; he cut the throats of the colts ; he burned all the fences ; he carried off twenty-seven slaves . With his usual exactness , Jefferson enumerates the items of his loss nine horses , fifty - nine cattle , thirty sheep , sixty hogs , seven hundred and eighty barrels of corn , nineteen hogsheads of tobacco , and two hundred and seventyfive acres of growing wheat and barley . Respecting the lost slaves he remarks : " Had this been to give them freedom , he would have done right ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putrid fever , then raging in his camp . " A few of these slaves crawled home to recover or to die , and to give the fever to five who had not left the plantation . Cornwal // 9 ' us , he adds , " treated the rest of the neighborhood in much the same style , but not with that spirit of total extermination with which he seemed to rage over my possessions. ** For twelve days Virginia had no governor . If Tarlton had ridden on that morning , without stopping for breakfast , he might have caught a quorum of the Legislature in or near Charlottesville , and kept the State without a government for the rest of the campaign . It would have been no great harm ; for during the next five months , while the allied fleets and armies , and all the militia of Virginia that Jefferson had been able to arm , were cornering the marauder of the Southern States , there was little for civilians to do . Tarlton halted at the house of one of Jefferson 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the privates were as hungry as their leaders , and devoured the food in the kitchen as fast as the cook could get it ready . Tarlton got no breakfast until he had placed a guard to protect the cook ; and this delay gave members time to come together at Charlottesville , and adjourn to meet , three days after , at Staunton , forty miles to the westward , on the safe side of the Blue Ridge . They met , accordingly , on the 7th of June . Discouraged at the aspect of affairs , soured and irritated by this fourth flight from the tramp of armed men , several of them were disposed to cast the blame of these invasions upon Governor Jefferson . One young member even said as much in the House , intimating that the governor should have foreseen Arnold 's coming and called out the militia in time . We all know from recent experience that , in war time , when affairs go ill in the field , the civil administration sinks in the esteem of the public ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musket famine of this terrible year , Virginians should bitterly regret the arms and accoutrements which the governor had sent down all the highways to Carolina , only to have them thrown away or captured at Camden and Guilford . Jefferson 's friends courted ; demanded inquiry into his conduct , and insisted on having it set down as part of the business of the next session . Still the House refrained from the election of a governor . Some of the weaker members revived the stale device of naming Patrick Henry dictator , but again laid the project aside from fear of the dangers of imaginary patriot-assassins . " The very thought , " as Jefferson wrote , " was treason against the people , was treason against mankind in general , as riveting forever the chains which bow down their necks , by giving to their oppressors a proof , which they would have trumpeted through the universe , of the imbecility of republican government , in times of pressing danger , to shield them from harm . " Jefferson had a far better device , one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several months before , he had resolved to decline serving a third term . In the belief that , at such a crisis , the civil and military power should be wielded by the same hands , he induced his friends , who were a majority of the House , to give their votes to Thomas Nelson , commander-in-chief of the militia of the State , who was accordingly elected . General Nelson had been a main stay of his own administration , giving to it the support of his honored name , his military talents , and the credit of his vast estates . On his own personal security he had raised the greater part of a most timely loan of two millions of dollars , and advanced money to pay two Virginia regiments who would not march for the southern army before their arrears were discharged . Governor Nelson took the field . He used without reserve the despotic powers with which he was entrusted ; forcing men into the field , and impressing wagons , horses , negroes , supplies . He was in at the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorktown , his own mansion being within the enemy 's lines and // occupied by British officers , he had the pleasure of sen4ing cannon-balls crashing through his own dining-room , and breaking up festive parties making merry over his own wine . It was a happy stroke of good sense and good management in Jefferson to leave his office to such a successor ; because he aj9peased the dictator party by giving them a dictator , while assigning the sole duty of the time to one fitted to perform it . But General Nelson did not succeed in satisfying his countrymen , for whom he had sacrificed health and fortune . He was an unpopular governor ; for the Virginians did not enjoy a dictator when they had got one ; and he could not long endure the , opprobrium which the exercise ofdictatorial power evoked . He threw up his office after holding it about six months ; and he , too , sought opportunity to defend his administration before the Legislature . 7ames Par/on.               @ @ @ @ @ @
