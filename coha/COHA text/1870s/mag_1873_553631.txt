THE EXTERNALS OF WASHINGTON . I SUPPOSE that no American , how poor and insignificant soever , can go to the city of Washington without feeling a sense of ownership in , and a desire to he proud og the political metropolis of his country ; and so many hundred thousand Americans do journey thither , that in looking at it a stranger inevitably wonders why such an overwhelming public opinion has not long since been created concerning its managemet*t as would have rendered impossible both the congressional recklessness and the private selfishness whose ravages he must now so vainly deplore on every side . For if ever magnificent possibilities were cruelly marred , mutilated , and mangled , those of the National Capital have been , and every day are being , so treated . It has been in existence eighty years . The greatest intellect and the highest culture of three generations have represented America here . All the wealth of the nation has been at its disposal . Superb cities with their parks and beautiful suburbs have grown up all over the country to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few things splendidly done , and everything else at sixes and sevens " ; here the opulence and progress of America , and there the poverty and shiftlessness of Africa ; and zesf now a lavish yearly expenditure of the local and national funds for the perpetration of stiffness instead of grace , of igliness instead of beauty , of aesthetic iYailure instead of artistic success , - in line , the most disappointing , disheartenino con*lome rate ever lhA that s*ocNeu the pride or patriotism of order-loving , beauty-worshipping woman . N*th in g , it seems to me , but the genuine masculine insensibility to both beauty and order could possibly have produced such a result ; and one may judge here how much the palaces and public places of Europe probably owe to the taste and aspiration of the royal ladies who inhabit and delight in them since men are alone responsible for everything in this draggle-tail metropolis . The city is on the eastern bank of the Potomac , and the site chosen for it has , or rather had , two leading features : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the Capitol stands ; the other , the undulating plain between the ridge and the river , on which the city is principally built . The plan adopted by Washington for making the most of this happy combination is imperial , and is said to have been taken by Major l'Enfant , the first engineer of the city , from the stately avenues and vistas of the park at Versailles . By it the whole surface was laid out , first in unusually wide streets running parallel to the four faces of the Capitol , and therefore at right angles to each other ; and then in a series of immensely broad avenues cutting the streets diagonally , like a huge diamond pattern superimposed upon a much smaller checkered one . Wherever these avenues intersect each other is a broad space , which in Paris would be called a " Place , " and wherein , jewel-like , some noble public building or church would be set ; and wherever the avenues cross the streets , little triangles are cut off the blocks , which are hardly suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers or shrubs , or a few trees and with something beautiful - a fountain or a statue - in the middle ; while the larger halves of the blocks left on the other side afford , with their obtuse angles , unparalleled opportunity for architectural effect . The plain is only a mile or two wide , and looking from one of the western porticos of the Capitol , the city , or at least all the noteworthy part of it , lies below you , stretching northwestward // The Ex/cruals of Was/wig/on. into union with Georgetown , and lining the Potomac southward until it is stopped by the so-called " Eastern Branch " of that noble stream , at which juncture the two rivers , often poetically flecked with sails , open and gleam broadly . For background to the picture , the heights of Virginia 's " sacred soil " lift themselves in answer to the height on which you are stand* ing , the great Doric portico of General Lee 's confiscated mansion being visible diagonally opposite , though the hills  --  stripped , alas of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - seem , not in the vigor and hopefulness of youth , but in the exhaustion and resignation of age , to stretch themselves sadly and wearily around the entire curve of the western horizon . It is a scene which nature and the great founder of the city meant to be unrivalled in loveliness , but which suceeeding waves of population and of congressmen have so deluged with deformities , from those bare hills in the distance to the shameful Capitol surroundings at your feet , that to a sensitive eye , enjoyment is completely swallowed up in vexation and disgust . For , first , it is evident that as regards the public buildings and parks of the National Capital , grozi*i ; ig with a view to general effect should have been the one thing greatly studied . Instead of which , half of the former . have been stuck down , like diamonds in a dish of sand , to suit the clamor of property owners who wanted a rise in the value of their lands ; while the parks have been invaded , mutilated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is beautiful and fitting in itself , but for the actual property of the nation . And , secondly , as to the domestic architecture , it would require the Gothic richness of Nuremberg , or the elegance , splendor , height , color , of the Grand Canal of Venice , to do justice to these wide streets and the great avenues that slash into them with such bold angles and unexpected vistas . But since these ideals are extravagant , why should not a second edition of dignified and respectable Boston , for instance , or of lovely suburban Cambridge , half seen and half screened amid trees atid vines , and with grass and flowers all about it , have grown up on the site of the National Capital ? * In sad reality , behold a city of flat-roofed houses , - boxes rather , - for the most part low , bald , mean , or squalid , standing in rows , or nearly touching one another , and placed originally right upon the sidewalk , with rarely ever a yard of turf in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornice , door , window , or step ; and if there is a garden , it is usually at the side , behind a high wall , so that it is utterly lost to every purpose of street ornamentation . So many negro-cabins are but eight feet high , and so m*iny *vooden and brick tenements are but double that , that , without exaggera tion , if one third of the city of Washington were razed down to the general level of the rest , I think it would all be about twenty feet tall ; and this with the streets averaging a hundred , and the avenues a hundred and fifty , feet in *vidth The third above-mentioned comprises , of course , the business and fashionable quarters of the town , which , to their mutual disadvantage , very much run into each other . Upper-tendom has naturally fixed its seat in the vicinity of the White House , but it is jostled at every step by the shop and the shanty , and its architectural flights are far more modest than one is accustomed to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , still on the box-pattern , are of plain red brick , brown paint or brown stucco making the only variation . One can hardly believe , in looking at most of them , that magnificent New York is within only eight hours ' ride ; while as for the French-roofed cottages in neat lawns , * The reader will pardon my specifying these two . It is merely because I am familiar with them there are many that rival them , and New Tork , of course , is far beyond . I 702 December , // that , with their gay slatings , bow-windows , and vine-clad porches ) are now everywhere in the North , they seem absolutely unknown . Never , surely , were greater incongruities tolerated in any civilized community ! In other places , people of wealth and taste like to get as close together as possible , so as to form solid streets , or at least squares , of respectability and order . But in Washington their instinct seems to be , choosing the Presidential mansion for a centre , to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lafayette Square alone , that I know of , presenting an unbroken phalanx of city residences . The consequence is that the interstices have had to be filled up anyhow , and the great houses of millionnaires or of high government officials will , more likely than not , have a tumbledown tenement , a mean grocery , or a negro-shanty not a block ofl and not seldom they are next-door neighbors . Even of the White House , the Treasury , and the Patent Office is this true ; while the buildings that immediately surround the grounds of the magnificent Capitol itself , and which , if one stands on its terrace , 11211sf affront the eye , are the most clisgraceful jumble of whitewashed sheds , saloons , and old boarding-houses that can be imagined . Pahces should hedge it about with awe ; but stables are leering impudently in its very face The churches in Washington worthily match the private dwellings . There are forty of them , I believe , and among all those I have seen I have noticed only four in stone , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Gothic , and if they fulfil the promise they will mark a new era in Washington ; most of the other forty being the brick " meetin ' - us " in various combinations of vagrant architectural fancy , utterly free from all trammels of schools and traditions , unities and proprieties , whatsoever . Yet one would think that every leading denomination in the country would take care to be represented in the Na-703 tional Capital by one costly and beautiful church at least . But perhaps the most distressing , because , it is to be feared , the most hopeless , feature of the city is Pennsylvania Avenue , in one grand intersection of which on the hill with three other avenues the Capitol stands , and in a similar one , a mile and a half off , on an undulation not far from the river , the White House ; so that it is the great artery of the political metropolis of our country . Until the spring of 1872 I had never been in Washington , and never shall I forget my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the President of that " giant Republic , " a trifling fraction of whose vast wealth only would have been requirecl to make it worthy of its , high office . Knowing nothing at all about it , I had yet , in a vague way , imagined it as shaded with superb trees dating from the founding of the city , and as lined with grand government buildings , fine churches , brilliant hotels , and , at the White House end , with the aristocratic residences of the Cabinet and foreign ministers . These latter I had fancied standing each al ) art , amid grass and glowing flowers , and surrounded with vines , evergreens , and shrubs ; and I had taken it for granted that the people promenading on this stately avenue were as distinguished or elegant in appearance as the exclusives one meets on Beacon Street or Fifth Avenue . So much for fancy . Now for fact . Pennsylvania Avenue is a boulevard no less than one hundred and sixty * feet wide . The inevitable double horse-car track defaces its centre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it is smooth like a floor , but , unlike a floor , it is swept so seldom that the dust lies thickly upon it . There is 710/ a single church org5ub/ic building11/5077 ii ; but the closely set houses along its length are of every variety of shabbiness and ugliness , and of all heights , so that their roofs are as uneven as the teeth of an old saw . In their lower stories may be found repre // 704 sentatives of all the avocations that wait upon the kitchen and back-stairs want of humanity , upon the sordid needs of the poor , or upon the cravings of the dissolute ; for alongside the grocer and the meat-man , the plumber and the gas-fitter , the cheap jeweller and milliner , are bar-rooms - barrooms - at nearly every ten steps The part nearest the Capitol is the worst section of the whole . As you emerge upon the avenue from the little , horseshoe-shaped park at its base , you see on the left the National Botanical Garden , which is a large enclosure surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with young trees . Its centre is necessarily filled with conservatories , which considered as conservatories are handsome ; but Horace Walpole said truly that " it is impossible to make a green-house ornamental , " and these look peculiarly out of place . Opposite the Garden , on the *igl*t , is a row of dirty and paltry shops and drinking-places that would befit an Irish alley , the corner one being actually a laundry ( only at this writing , May , 1873 , in course of demolition ) , which for years flapped the wash on its roof in friendly democratic greeting to the United States flags on the Capitol two stone-throws ' off ! From the latter to the White I-louse is a distance of fifteen streets , and at Seventh Street the avenue is intersected by another avenue , the three combining to form a large open space set off by triangles which , next to that of the Capitol itself , is , perhaps , the most effective situation for a magnificent building in all Washington . A year ago , the several hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with a roof of tarred shoddy , and as perfectly black and dilapidated with age as any smithy ever imaoined . This was the XVashin*ton b Market , and it had stood thus conspicuously in the very centre of Pennsylvania Avenue for two generations Behind it loomed up three immense brick barns ,  --  the centre of their roofs being raised in the ungainly fashion peculiar to grain - elevators , - which had just been built round three sides of the quadrangle of which the black shed was the fourth side . These are the new market-houses ; and now the old deformity of the black shed is pulled down , and the new deformity of the brick barns is fully revealed in its place . In the remote future a fine facade , it is said , will be built on the site of the shed , which will conceal them but of course , to put the City Market there at all was a glaring impropriety in the first place , bringing , as it does* inevitable market-carts and all unsightliness into the vicinity . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no excuse for its acceptance by the government . The Treasury or the Patent Office should have been placed there ; and with land at five or ten cents a foot , as it was then , it would not have ruined the country to have bought the property , and given to the city a market site also ; whereas the present disposition of it has ruined " the Avenue . " A little way past the market , come , within the space of a few blocks , the leading shops of the city , which , excepting the lace shops , are ordinary in the extreme ; and after these the avenue pursues its dreary and shabby way until , fronting you at Fifteenth Street , the southern portico of the Treasury Department shoulders itself into the air , . and , contrary to what I trust was the intention of Washington , completely hides the White House from the avenue and from seeing or being seen by the Capitol ,  --  an eternal dig in the ribs of posterity from the obstinate elbow of old President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there ) that posterity must ever resent and his conteml ) oraries should never have permitted ; for the awkwardness of the whole corner as then and there fixed to all time can not be exaggerated . Such , dear reader , are the dire realities of that Pennsylvania Avenue whose name , at least , is known all over the country . 1-laIf-grown or scrubby , ugly trees , or no trees at all , alternately // preside over the broad sidewalks , which , when Congress is in session , are alive with self-complacent negresses , with whiskey-soaked , loaferish-looking men , with loudly or tawdrily dressed women , and with dirty-faced children , whose homes are over their parents ' afore-mentioned shops . Several large second-rate hotels interrupt , but , with their fiat white facades , do not redeem the depressing succession . There are a few tolerable store fronts , and just two handsome Mansard-roofed structures approaching completion , but they are lost in the general don't-care impression . The soil upon everything is indescribable and , in short , as a gentleman remarked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the New York Bowery gone to seed . " - And yet there are not wanting enthusiastic sisters of the pen who describe it in their newspaper letters as a " splendid Corso , " and reel you off such a set of celebrities whose imaginary habit it is to continuously succeed each other upon its pavements , as will fairly turn your head ! Up to the close of the war , Pennsylvania Avenue might have been regarded as a " specimen brick " of the whole city , so utterly devoid of taste or beauty were most of its houses . But since then a new era has dawned upon it in domestic architecture , for on some of the newer streets - K Street , for instance - the brilliant idea has been put into execution of regarding a whole block as an architectural unit , and building the centre and end houses taller and more projecting , and with somewhat more ornamentation than the others . There are not many . of these blocks , l ) ut so effective are they , such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have redeemed the whole city from ugliness ; and indeed it is easy to see that if the idea should be extensively carried out , Washington would come to appear externally like a city of palaces . If we turn to the public buildings of Washington , we find ( the Greek architecture being once admitted ) achieve VOL xxxii. - NO. 194. 45 ments worthy in many respects of the United States , - structures of which Americans have no reason to be ashamed , whether for strength , size , or beauty . Excepting the Capitol , there is not a ray of genius in any of them , however ; and owing to the utter absence of unity of plan in the decisions as to their location , they make but a fragmentary impression , and add little to the noble presence of the capital as a whole ; while the mistakes and incongruities that have been perpetrated in connection with every one quite take off the edge of the satisfaction with which the educated visitor might otherwise regard them . Not but what things were finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were by Washington , the chance was afforded for two magnificent architectural groups : first , the Capitol , flanked by the Supreme Court , the Patent Office , or what not , might have crowned the ridge in the manner of a Greek Acropolis , while marble steps and terraces swept up to them with their own superb and dazzling effect ; and , second , the XVhite House , surrounded by whatever departments naturally cluster about it , might have risen proudly visible to the Capitol from the opposite end of the avenue Or , better still , each inight have stood in solitary state within its grounds , while the avenue between them was lined with all the other buildings , - thus producing indeed a " Corso " unsurpassed in the world . But , as has before been mentioned , the many-pillared Treasury is half-way across the line of the avenue , and completely conceals the White House from view . Its immense side-length is plump upon the pavement of Fifteenth Street and the steps of its northern portico are actually in a hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If placed in that spot at all , the land should have been filled up to a level with the Presidential grounds ; instead of which , a sunken street was graded between them , and the bank // terraced many steps high on the White House side . On the other hand of the latter are the old War and Navy Departments ; and as I walked by them a year ago I admired the beautiful level lawn which , shaded with fine trees , and looking as peaceful as an old-fashioned college campus , lay between them all . It has since been gullied through , howe ver , to form a new street , called Executive Avenue , and along this the new State Department , which is also to include the War and Navy Departments , is going up as a pendant to the Treasury . It is to be one of Mr. Mullett 's grandiose granite Mansardian structures ,  --  " only that and nothing more " ; and though one must rejoice that the tradition of the classical architecture is at last broken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low Greek Treasury and White House will not be dreadfully dwarfed by the towering roofs of their new French neighbor . Its cost is to be eight millions of dollars ; and if it had only been placed on the Avenue where the Market is , it would have been there an immense adornment , and would have shown itself to the most admirable advantage . No wtwo of its four faades will be lost , from fronting on obscure streets . The Patent Office is an immense quadrangle built around a whole square . It is respectable from its size and solidity , and its simple but spacious porticos are effectively reached by long flights of steps . But it is on a side street naturally unimportant , and , what is stranger still , the National PostOffice of white marble occupies another square diagonally opposite . If there is anything that can redeem for these two great and important structures their fatal , their inexcusable situations , I confess I can not see it . More fortunate than they by far , the City Hall was very well placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is on a public reservation , and might have been in the midst of beautiful grounds . B ut it , too , is directly on the sidewalk , Ju diciary Square being behind and at its sides only , and looking in a very rough and recent state . Like all the other public buildings , it is white and Greek and though plain and small in comparison with them , it is pleasing enough to make one regret the grinly pillars and the degraded and demoralized aspect that the colored loafers who haunt there have given it . The generous width of the intersection in front of it - perhaps two hundred feet - would have afforded a centre-piece of verdure with plenty to spare ; but the whole space is filled with the wooden block pavement , and poor Lincoln stands in the middle of it upon his bare white column , looking as ghastly and forlorn as one fancies St. Simeon Stylites himself . The Armory , the Smithsonian Institution , the Agricultural Bureau , and the Washington Monument stand nearly in line between the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was originally intended for the City Park , but which Congress , in the most flagrant and indefensible manner , has trifled away and " appropriated to this , that , and the other , until now there is no semblance of a park left , - only a separately fenced-off series of " grounds , " for the most part half laid out and half kempt . In the midst of the only one of them that has been at all improved into beauty , is the Smithsonian , built , I should say , in imitation of a feudal castle . The material is a rich red-brown stone , and it has seven or eight towers and towerlings , every one of them different , and which on a lofty height of the Rhine would look very picturesque and be suggestive of the growth and additions of different ages . In a flat park and for a scientific institution , the application seems a little forced ; hut as one approaches it through the winding walks laid out , and under the trees planted , by the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " its own excuse for being , " and to make one only give thanks for an escape from the everlasting Greek . From // Capitol Hill , however , the effect of its many irregular turrets is very much injured by contrast with the great white unfinished obelisk to Washington that even now looms much above them , and which , as yet neither one thing nor the other , but , with its melancholy crane on top , makes one think of a gigantic gibbet erected from which to swing off to universal scoff the dead body of that gratitude , admiration , and reverence once felt by Americans for the Father of their Country . Its completion on the bald monstrosity of its original design would be simply a national misfortune , but its size and its situation are so remarkable , since it towers up over everything even now , and forms the termination of innumerable vistas all over the city , that before pulling it down a jury of our most eminent architects and sculptors ought to sit upon it to decide whether something can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of imagination and power might be able to strike out from it some bold and grand conception . A Monument was a highly appropriate thing to place in the city park ; but were each of the other buildings now upon it as fine in their way as the Smithsonian itself , - they are both perfcctly insignificant , - this would not repay the citizens for the loss of what was intended to be their chief breathing-place and pleasure-ground , and its treatment is a rich but characteristic specimen of congressional recklessness , incapacity , and want of fixed principle . It was originally a reservation that began with the Capitol grounds , and ran straight down to the Potomac River between the two streets that front the north and south faces of the Capitol . It was a rectangle , therefore , a mile and a half long and three eighths of a mile wide , and , too stiff and cramped , perhaps , for much " park** effect , it is greatly to be regretted that , instead of the space between the two parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two diverging avenues ( Pennsylvania and Maryland ) , which soon run far outside of the 707 streets , was not rather reserved for the park , for so it would have included the White House grounds , which touch the present one only at a ri* ht angle ; and moreover , the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue being thus made a park boundary , the Market could not have been placed there , and the growth of the low quarter now infestin the region between the park and the avenue would have been impossible . Designed in this way , the park would have been a great isosceles triangle , a mile and three quarters long , with a base a mile wide on the Potomac , and an apex expanding round the Capitol into grounds three eighths of a mile square ; and were I my Uncle Sam , I would yet beg , borrow , or buy for national purposes this area between the avenues , cost what it would ; for so a fusing of the principal grounds and buildings of the National Capital into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Such even as it was , however , if the park had simply been planted thick with trees , and left to gro xv up this last eighty years into a wood like the Berlin Thier-Garten , by this time it would have been a wide belt of shade and grass crossing the city and extending into the river , such as would have utterly charmed the heart of the visitor , and satisfied the needs of the population . But the most malicious ingenuity could not have devised to deface and render it more hopeless for all purposes of a park than has really been the case . First , streets were carried across it , and the divisions thus made fenced in , in forty-acre lots . Then , at an immense expense , a canal was cut through the city and carried some distance up the centre of the park , in order to connect Georgetown on the Potomac with the Navy Yard on the Eastern Branch , - with what wild idea of a gigantic commerce to be transported at any sacrifice by a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved utterly useless ; and after remaining a noxious sewer in the nostrils of a long-suffering neighborhood . // it has just been filled up ( after first being dredged out ) by the present Board of Public Works . Right of way having been given to a canal , of course a railroad could not be refused the same privilege ; other interests were also allowed to encroach ; and finally , in May , 1872 , Congress actually gave away to rich railroad corporation Number Two a section of it worth half a million of dollars for a railroad s*'ation , with all its accompaniments I About two fifths of the very centre of the park have thus been stolen from the nation ; and while one severed extremity was appropriated to the Botanic Garden at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue , the other was divided between the three or four institutions just described . Ex uno disce o ; nnes . Washington City is full  --  and it might be its peculiar charm that it is so - of open squares , circles , and triangles ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds , there is hardly a creditable one among them . The two former are exquisite , and were laid out by Mr. Downing , that is , by a man who had made a lifestudy of what he undertook to do , which is why they are so beautiful . The latter is a stroke of luck or genius which is too much for the congressional Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds to stand , so they mean to clear the trees away , if they can , in order that the east view of the Capitol may be unobstructed . What is it that Horace Walpole says ? " The public taste is the taste of the public , and it is a prodigious quantity of no tastes , generally governed by some very bad taste . " The dire angularity of the laying out of all the open places upon which the public functionaries are now busy in Washington bears out the above fully . Nay , they contrive to make even the very water itself angular ; for all the fountains but two which they have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the squirt , instead of the jet or the cascade ; so their stiffness and insignificance may be conceived December , Yet with the great Potomac rolling by , Washington might well afford to have as many and as superb fountains as old Rome herself . And so now we come at last to the Capitol , which , with all its defects , is the greatest architectural triumph this country has produced , and which can lack a world-wide reputation only because Americans themselves have not known enough to give such to it . Like all the most famous structures , it was not built in a day , but has grown gradually into its present development ; and even unfinished as it is , hugely defective as it is , and with unlimited capacity for additions and improvements , it crowns the city and the landscape with a glory unsurpassed by any secular building in existence . It is not all of white marble , dear reader , but at first you take it to be ; and its extent , its strength , its evident costliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with joyous patriotism and pride , and in looking at it one feels that our money-loving and money-getting Brother Jonathan has the divine spark of genius hidden somewhere within him , after all . The first surprise and exultation over , however , a succession of mortifying discoveries dawns upon the visitor , of which the most crushing to me was , that , though splendidly situated upon the ridge commanding the city , the Capitol faces the wrong way / The front is to the EAST , and those magnificent porticos , with their crowds of Corinthian pillars , their sculptured pediments , bronze doors , and countless sweeping marble steps , the bronze Goddess of Liberty herselfeverything , - turns its back upon the city , the river , and the West , and the whole facade exists for the benefit of the trees that were idiotically planted in the East Capitol grounds just across the street from it , and which have now grown so great that they make a full or three-quarter view of the building impossible , and so beautiful that the threatened cutting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tue Externals of Washington . // Washington expected and intended that his namesake city should grow up in . state and splendor on the hill , instead of down in the marshy , malarial plain . But unfortunately he placed the President 's house down there , and of course all society inevitably clustered about it ; beside which , the original property owners held the land about the Capitol at such exorbitant rates that for years people were actually forced to purchase elsewhere . So for a long time the hill was comparatively abandoned , while the plain was peopled . But the marvel of marvels is , why , when the Capitol Extension was planned twenty-five years ago , and men had seen plainly where , contrary to the original expectation , the city had built itself ; that occasion was not seized for making the grand facade on the west instead of on the east front , and of placing the statue on the dome facing in the same direction ; for now the Goddess of Liberty looks as if , shrugging her shoulders at the hap-hazard city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent " itself , - she were gazing regretfully toward the ocean across which she had floated hither , and were vainly wishing herself safe back in the " tight little island " of respectabilities and proprieties that gave her birth . But the truth is , that Crawford 's statue , though in itself a most noble conception , is not at all the thing for that snow-white dome , which , more graceful and enchanting ( if it is only iron ) than any dome in Europe , lightly lifts itself , a bold , pure , perfect conception , into the blue dome above , and which , therefore , instead of being weighted by the very august and pensive maiden in dark brown who now presides there " in all her ponderosity , " should have been crowned by a white or gilded flying figure just poising there for a moment on one toe , and expressive , say , of " Westward the star of empire takes its way " ; and then the strange exhilaration and satisfaction with which even now the visitor be-709 holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete , i. e. extend , the eastern centre of the Capitol to correspond with the two newer wings , the present Capitol architect , Mr. Clark , proposes to spend two millions of dollars . But , as the reader can see from every greenback , for this generation the east front is well enough as it is . The grand facade of the Capitol , especially since the Presidential inaugurations take place from its central porch , ought to be on the west ; and until that is accomplished , every other interest of the building should be put aside , excepting only such as relate to the convenience of the Congress itself . More room is even now imperatively demanded , but there is no reason why it should not be gained as well on the west as on the east , while every argument of beauty and fitness - since our whole continent lies to the westward , as well as the city itself-is in favor of spending our millions on the former . But if the heart sinks with dismay over the mistaken frontage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the neglect , the disgrace of its surroundings . Imagine an immense and magnificent white marble building , which cost no less than twelve millions of dollars , standing in a desert of red earth , with a small , horseshoe-shaped park hugging its western , and a small square one standing off from its eastern facade , and you have the immediate entourage of the Capitol of the United States ; while just outside of this area , as I have before said , is a but too appropriate fringe of old boarding-houses , oyster-saloons , drinking-s hops , shanties , sheds , and tenements . Not a blade of grass , not a shrub , not a fountain covers this red desert , but only two or three vagabond trees which are quite lost in the abounding desolation . Horse-cars , carriages , and carts are driving over it ad Zibiturn all day long , and for years all the refuse of the Capitol restaurants was thrown upon it . The two little parks , on the contrary , // are so thickly planted with trees as very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge iron fence required by the period when elephants and megatheriums roamed at large through the streets ; but Uncle Sam 's money gave out before the fences were done , for that on the grand front of the east side is a common wooden picket one , anti black with age at that , while those at the foot of the side-terraces are made of three rough boards nailed upon intervening posts . In the centre of the western terraces , two flights of stone steps lead down into the horseshoe park ; but at their ends , unpainted wooden stairways with hand-railsanswer the same purpose , similar conveniences for the use of senators being provided also on the north side . The street or carriage-way between the eastern front and the East Capitol grounds is very badly paved and has no sidewalk , so that to look at the finest faade in the country you have to walk or stand in the middle of the horse-car track which runs through it ! And so it goes . All over the national city one may read in giant characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rings , RINGS ! " but the climax of the refrain is precisely here . Had this area of about forty acres been improved and planted as , eighty years ago , it should have been , it would now be an exquisite and historically venerable park , in which our every great statesman had perhaps left his own memento in tree or shrub , and in the midst of which the Capitol would have shone like a dream-land vision . On the southwest side of the grounds there are no houses , but the red desert ends abruptly , and fifteen feet below jt a marshy plain stretches in abject dreariness to the junction of the Eastern Branch and the Potomac . It is crossed by a railroad and seamed with a muddy creek and ditches . Negro-cabins are scattered sparsely over it , but as yet there are hardly any regular roads or streets through it ; arid though it is a square mile or more in extent , there is hardly a tree or a shrub to be seen , except at the extreme point , where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arsenal extend into the two rivers . Dismal and discreditable as it is , however , it affords an almost l ) rovidential opportunity for one of the loveliest parks imaginable . For along the top of the ridge which overlooks the city and this now wasted spot , New Jersey Avenue runs southeast from the Capitol grounds to the Eastern Branch , and Delaware Avenue , when laid out , will run southwest from the grounds across the plain to the river junction ; the two thus inclosing an isosceles triangle on the south of the Capitol , with a water-base on the Eastern Branch , similar to that on the west between Pennsylvania and Maryland Avenues with a base on the Potomac , which 1 mentioned before as the one Congress should have appropriated in the first place . Only , the park I propose would be far more beautiful than that , because in that the lay of the land completely hides the Potomac from the spectator on the Capitol terraces , whereas by pulling down the houses on the western side of New Jersey Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are very old , of little value , and there are not many of them ) one could drive along it from the Capitol down to the water , and have this exquisite prospect of the two rivers and the hills beyond and the intervening park all the way , while , returning , one would enjoy an equally unique view of the eastern and southern facades of the Capitol at the most striking angle possible , of the hill-cradled city which stretches southwestward below it , and , at the evening hour , of the gorgeous sunsets which display themselves over it . On the other side of New Jersey Avenue , on still higher ground , is yet left the old Carroll place , uplifted now like a green island above the horrible cutting of red earth which has been made all about it , and full of fine old trees . This would serve as the Belvedere of the park , and a lower ridge , which runs along the Eastern Branch at // right angles to Capitol ridge , abreeably diversifies the plain ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every feature here , in a small compass , that could render a park beautiful and even remarkable . Such a pleasure-ground as the above might be made , with its walks and drives and river prospects , is needed to indemnify the Washington residents , and particularly the poorer of them , for the one in the central section of the city of which Congress has so wantonly deprived them . It is needed , moreover , to rescue one of the beautiful creations of the Almighty from being everlastingly lost to the enjoyment of His children ; for New Jersey Avenue anhl the fast-filling plain once built up , it is gone ! Yet no other park in or near Washington could duplicate this exquisite river view , or give the drive along the river bank that this could do between the Navy Yard and the Arsenal , or have the glorious Capitol as the crown and apex of the whole . Can the English afford the Thames embankment for a pleasure drive , and can not Washington , without commerce , and with a double river frontage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . The city of VVashington is at present in the hands of a " Board of Public Works " appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate ; the public grounds near the XVhite House are in charge of General Babcock , one of the President 's secretaries ; the Capitol cxrounds are superintended by the Capitol architect , Mr. Clark ; the Botanical Garden is under somebody else ; and 1 presume that the Smithsonian , Agricultural , and City Hall grounds have each a guardian spirit in the employ of the government , whose training , like that of most of those above mentioned , has been in anything rather than in landscape architecture . Of all these functionaries , the most active and influential is believed by the Washin gton public to be a certain enterprising plumber whose sign is visible on Pennsylvania Avenue from far and near , - Mr. A. R. Shepherd , vice-president of the Board of Public Works . This Board , appointed late in 1870 , borrowed four millions of dollars ; they taxed the people two millions , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight millions . They themselves allow that up to December , 1872 , they had spent thus much . Their opponents say that they had spent over double that sum ; that they dare not exhibit their books ; that they have so much influence in Congress that the committee which was granted at the petition of one thousand tax-payers to investigate their affairs during the session of 1871-72 either could not or would not compel them to produce them ; and , in short , that in proportion to the prop5-erty valuation of XVashington ( only about $ 62,000,000 ) , the peculations and corruptions of Tammany in New York are moderate when compared with those of this " ring . " Their friends , on the contrary , declare that never was there an incorruptible and beneficent public body on earth subjected to such " fiendish* ' persecutions as this Board has been ; that it has had " diabolical " difficulties , trials , and stumbling-blocks to encounter , worthy only of the invention of the " imps of darkness " ; and that their especial accuser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his figures as he pretends the Board are in theirs. * Of course , in the face of such flat contradictions on both sides , one must only use one 's own eyes and ears to judge for one 's self as to whether the Board of Public Works appointed by the President were indeed fit persons to take charge of a national work of such magnitude and importance . Five years ago the National Capital was a magnificent mud-hole , among whose streets and avenues cows , pigs and chickens wandered as freely as the inhabitants . That these nuisances have been wholly suppressed , and that the city has been thoroughly drained * See the speeches of Mr. chipman , the congressional delegate from the District of Colombia , in Congress last spring , in defence of the Board 7 ' ' // and is now smooth and dry in all its length and breadth , with the latest inventions in pavements , is due to the immense energy of the Board of Public Works . Moreover , the streets of the city were , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else d wel ii ngs relieved with grass and trees in front . But everybody , as I have said before , rich and poor alike , had built their pikestaff-plain houses directly on the sidewalk , so that the effect was lamentable in the extreme . This painful baldness has been in many instances most happily remedied by the Board , for they have advanced the sidewalks from ten to fifteen feet toward the middle of many streets , and turfed the ground next to the houses to that extent ; and it is truly wonderful to see how deformity has been almost turned into beauty by this sim.ple process . Where the houses are at all handsome , as in K Street , the effect is positively enchanting , and gives brilliant assurance of what the city as a whole may some day become , provided the hideous cast-iron fences with which too many house-owners have already heavily loaded this redeemed turf are positively forbidden for the future . Thus much admitted , however , commendation - at least in my poor judgment - should end . The streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily be immensely expensive ; and if anything better was decided upon , evidently it should have been the most durable thing that could be procured . Some of the streets are laid with the concrete , and a few , I believe , with the Belgian stone pavement , but as a general rule the wooden block pavement has been used all over the city . Now , the concrete pavement that the Board has put down did not in many places last one year ; and as for the wooden pavement , business men say that it , only pays to use it where there is travel enough to wear it out as fast as in the course of nature it must rot out . But there is no business in Washington ; nothing much heavier to be drawn over these miles and miles of wooden streets and avenues than the softly driven carriages of the fashionable women who. spend the afternoons of the " season* ' in calling upon each other . Ten years from now , therefore , when in the course of nature these pavements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones , after it has nearly ruined the property-owners to pay for these ? Still , the appearance of the city is so greatly improved by the smooth pavements , and it is such a comfort to bowl along in a cushioned carriage over a floor instead of jolting in it over cobblestones , that within three years Washington property has greatly risen in value , and many more persons are attrac*ed here as winter residents than formerly . Granting , therefore , that the present paving is all for the best from every point of view , what shall we say of the grading of the city as carried out by this Board of Public Works ? The narrow plain in which Washington lies was not wholly flat , but gently undulating . The plateau on which the Capitol stands , and which stretches back on the level two miles or more , was also gently undulatinb . As the streets were first laid out , they followed the lay of the land , and houses were built on them accordingly . But Congress , forty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the city . The whole plateau was to be shaved off until the Capitol stood alone in its glory on its highest part ; and for the plain , no mortal , sure , can guess what their idea was . At any rate , from that time to this successive " Boards ' * have been trying their " prentice hands " in improvement of nature 's work . If the heavy loads of an immense commerce had had to be dragged up steep natural inclines , one could have pardoned the " ideal " of Congress and its agents in this matter . But with nothing heavier than a grocery cart or a carriageful of ladies to roll over it , to cut down every swell and hillock where it could be done to a perfectly flat surface is a piece of vandalism // possible only , as I believe , to self-taut , ht men . If a little learning is a dangerous thing , surely a little taste is a fatal one ! For at what cost and sacrifice has not this flatness been achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural drainage unbalanced , positive defin-mity has been created . For along these gently rising streets houses , of course , had been built , whose owners were suddenly told that the sidewalk was to be torn up , and the street graded two , five , ten feet below the previous level ! What then becomes of the houses ? Left up in the air , people have been obliged to terrace their few yards of turf to the pavement , and to provide a long flight of stone steps to get up and down to it . Of all things in the dry American climate , dear reader , and in the Washington latitude , terraces ! In " misty-moisty " England , terraces are appropriate and very beautiful , because they are green all the year round ; the winter does not kill them , and the summer does not scorch them . But over here , even as far north as Boston , people whose houses are unhappily on a bank have to water the latter with hose nearly every evening after June to keep it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to keep a terrace green in Washington ! Why , even the Capitol terraces are a misfortune , for they are an eyesore seven months at least of the year . Moreover , as everybody knows , the boast of Washington is the royal breadth of its streets . But with the centre of the street turned into a canal or gully , and the houses perched on the sides clear up above the pedestrian , the effect of the space is greatly diminished , and the street looks cramped and narrow . If , then , the reader will imagine the beauty of a vista of high banks that are brown all winter and withered all summer , and which are crossed at every house by long flights of stone steps all exactly alike ; if also he will figure up the added expense to every trunk , every barrel of flour , every ton of coal that is carried up these steps , and the tax on the callers and the residents who have to climb them to reach these stilt-mounted mansions , I do not think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the only word that can express much of the work of the present regime ; and no matter who may have the charge of the externals of Washinoton hereafter , it will never be the city it might have been , any more than a man who has had the bridge of his nose broken can be as handsome as nature intended . The assessments on property-owners for these " improvements " are absolutely terrifying , and many persons of small means have been obliged to sell their little homes from inability to meet them . Nor will the authoritjes wait for an advantageous sale . The time allowed is peremptory , and at the end of it the property must go for what it will fetch . The consequence is that it often goes very cheap , and is. then bought in by the " ring " and their friends . At least such is the common talk in Washington ; and it is certain that men whose paper five years ago was not worth fifty cents on the dollar , are now living at the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Expensive as is their grading and paving , the Board have been by no means careful to get it right at first in every instance , so that curbstones and pavements have been taken up in many places not once , but three times in succession , and the property-owner made to bear his share of the expense of the mistake . As for the wails of the women over the trees that have been destroyed in this process , every woman can imagine them ! And true enough , you walk and drive over this Southern city , eighty years old , blazing hot in summer , and ask yourself , " Where are the trees ? " For one sees few worth mentioning , and the Board of Public Works , it is said , is responsible for the absence of a great many . The grading or rather degrading , process carried out by the authorities has not been confined to streets already // in existence . Drive out into the country a mile or two and you find the prolongation of the Washington streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , so that the eye can not glance anywhere without being affronted by these unsightly red gullies , which are all the more distressing because there are so few trees in the landscape to conceal their desperate deformity . Yet - will it be believed ? - so well contented was Congress with the work and with the integrity of this purely local Board of ordinary business men that , at the last session , it actually voted them four millions of dollars with which to continue their cutting and slashing . But , by the end of spring , it was said all over the city that this was used up in paying debts , and that the Board ' intends next year to ask boldly for ten millions more Now compare their rate of expenditure and its result with those of Mr. Olmstead and his associates in the Central Park of New York City .

The last year 's excess of increased tax in those three wards over the interest on the cost of the land and improvements was $ 2,726,595.90 ; and this is only the beginning , for those wards are as yet but thinly peopled. * I have seen it stated somewhere that the Indian-extermination policy of the nation costs the government , on an average , half a million of dollars per squaw ! What a shriek of horror would go up from congressmen and their constituents were they asked to appropriate as much to make myriads of white men and women happy as they have cheerfully done to murder a few wretched copper-colored ones ! The women of this country can blush , if the men can not , at the spectacle of the National Capital farmed out - under the eyes and doubtless the sneers of the representatives of foreign courts - to art tyros and ignorant jobbers , who do with it what they choose for their own glorification and emolument , and are held responsible by nobody . We may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Michael Angelo or a Raphael , but we certainly have in this country men of genius and lifelong culture , men at the same time of high honor and established reputation , - artists , sculptors , architects , and landscape-architects , - who could take the Capital into their hands , and in twenty-five years present it to the nation to be held in trust for the world as a thing of beauty , worthy of shining in its place in Time 's coronet of famous cities . Our artists are now everywhere pursuing the limited ends of their own fortunes . Yet nothing less than religion or patriotism ever fired the human breast to its highest achievements ; and until American Art is called by the general voice to adorn the American Capital on its own re * The rise of prnperty in Brooklyn around its magnificent park , also in charge of Mr. Olmatead , is said to be still more extraordinary . // sponsibility , and to make there its home , it will never be worthy of its native country , or rise to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extravagant Republic of forty mulions of prosperous people has not a single national gallery wherein it can see even what its own eminent sons have done !

Yet in Europe not only the great centres all boast their immense and priceless art-collections , but nearly every little Italian or German city , and of late even the English provincial towns , can point with pride to valuabie galleries , and to memorable or beautiful buildings , which are adding richness and dignity and content incalculable to the otherwise barren sum of human life . I trust I have convinced the reader that , from an artistic point of view , Washington at present is in a bad plight . A year 's residence amid , and a year 's brooding over the mismanagement that prevails there have " borne in " upon me the following propositions , which , of course , like all amateur attempts , are but a lame and impotent conclusion , and to which I only invite attention until such time as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee of acknowledged artists whose achievements proclaim them the fitting persons to pronounce it . i . The city of Washington , having been created by and for the national government alone , private interests and wishes should in no case be allowed to stand in the way of a full regard for the national dignity and honor , and the innate fitness and propriety of things . 2 . Congress should therefore buy up peremptorily at its present ( not prospective ) valuation the property entirely surrounding the Capitol grounds for half a block in depth , the whole of Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House , * and , * The retail business now transacted there could be gradually transferred to side streets . in case the new park south of the Capitol should be purchased , as has been above suggested , the whole of New Jersey Avenue from the Capitol grounds to the river . 3 .

A National Board of Public Works , consisting only of landscapearchitects , landscape - gardeners , and engineers of acknowledged ability and reputation , should be appointed by Congress , and given charge of the entire surface of Washington City , of the District of Columbia , of the National Cemeteries , and of Mount Vernon ( for even there the hand of the Vandal has been committing sacrilege of late ) , and thereafter not a tree should be planted , far less cut down , without their sanction and approval . * . Whatever funds this National Board requires for the improving , restoring , or beautifying. of the above areas should be granted from the national treasury , and the citizens of Washington should only be taxed to keep the improvements in repair . 6 . A National Commission of our leading architects , sculptors , and painters should pronounce upon all the buildings and works of art to be henceforth erected or purchased by the nation . And no house - not so much as a negro shanty even - should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since there may be art even in the design of a shanty . An attempt is being made by speculators in city lots to get the Presidential Mansion removed a mile to the north of where it now stands , the White House to be retained only as the President 's Office . This should be sternly frowned down by public opinion , since from its historic associations , the beauty of its situation , and every other reason , the Executive Mansion should be where it always has been . At present it is too small // and insignificant for its obvious purposes , and the White House , therefore , should be built out towards the Potomac in a quadrangle with high roofs , and when these are done the portion now existing should be altered to correspond . Then the government , having as above recommended , taken possession of Pennsylvaniaand New Jersey Avenues and of the streets surrounding the Capitol , the lots at the White House end should be granted by it to foreign governments whereon to build the houses of their respective legations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , should also be built in the same vicinity , and on both Avenues and around the Capitol blocks handsome and stately without , substantial and simple within , should be built and arranged in " apartments , " continental fashion , to be leased to senators and members for the longer or shorter periods of their congressional terms . This done , and the interstices filled up with the buildings of the Government Bureaus , of the future National University , of the Congressional Library , the Hall of the Supreme Court , and what not , a sort of " Grand Boulevard of the Republic " - extending from the White House on the Potomac along Pennsylvania Avenue , round the Capitol , and thence at an obtuse angle down New Jersey Avenue to the Eastern Branch - would be created which the world could not excel . The land and improvements of the Central Park up to the present time have cost New York twelve millions of dollars . But what of that ? The NewYorkers are proud of and devoted to their Park , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for its adornment , simply because they know that it repays them so bountifully for all ; not merely , dear reader , in money , though we have seen that it does even that amply in the rise of the taxable property about it , but in happiness , - happiness that beauty alone can bring to the human heart , all unable as we are to explain it . Out of their poverty the citizens of Washington have spent , in all , ten or fifteen millions of dollars to improve its disproportionate streets and avenues , while the government , though paying no taxes on its numerous and valuable reservations , " has , until last winter , given almost nothing at all to city improvements , but has confined itself to paying for those merely of its own buildings and grounds . I fancy that the reader will be surprised to learn how little these latter have cost the country , and hereafter will not wonder that Washington is so beggarly as it is . Up to the year 1870 the government had spent in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , of which twenty millions went " for such general purposes as are not peculiarly a part of the Capital of the nation , such as the Navy Yard , Arsenal , Insane Hospital , bridges , canals , fuel , gas , water , fences , etc. , etc. , etc. " * For the public buildings , grounds , pictures , and statues in Washington the nation has been assessed during four fifths ofacenturybut twenty-five millions of dollars , i. e. just twice the cost of the Central Park .

His own admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his movements ; and in respect to those which followed , the essential facts are beyond dispute . We propose to consider these campaigns in their chronological order . 1. - THE SEVEN DAYS ON THE PENINSULA . On the 20th of May , 1862 , the Federal army , ioo , ooo strong , under McClellan , reached the Chickahominy . Its immediate object was the capture of Richmond , whither the Confederates , numbering 47,000 , under J. E. Johnston , had fallen back ten days before . The Chickahominy , a little stream running through a broad belt of swamp , formed an admirable defensive line about ten miles in front of Richmond ; for it could be ctaossed with artillery only by bridges . For a space of twenty miles there was but one place where an available military bridge could be constructed except by building long causeways through the swamp . At this point there had been two bridges a mile apart , one known as Bottom*s Bridge , the other that over which passed the railroad from Richmond to the York river . The Confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were easily repaired in two or three days . Richmond was at this time wholly unfortified , and the retreat of Johnston from Yorktown the moment he was seriously menaced should have convinced McClellan that his own force was greatly superior . Nothing can be more evident than that the one thing for McClellan to do was to throw his whole force by these bridges across the stream and march directly upon the Confederate capital for if , contrary to all likelihood , he should be worsted , the bridges furnished a perfectly safe way of retreat , and by destroying them behind him he could in an hour place the impassable Chickahominy between himself and any pursuit . Instead of doing this , he sent a third of his army just across the stream , and stretched the remainder for eighteen miles along the north bank . His army then lay in the shape of a V , the left wing being six miles long , the right eighteen , and the river between . He himself accurately describes the position in which he had placed his army : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march the troops on the left or north bank of the Chickahominy down to Bottom 's Bridge , and thence over the Williamsburg road , a distance of about twenty-three miles . In the condition of the roads at that time , this march could not be made with artillery in less than two days . " In a word , he divided his army in the face of the enemy , placing a two days ' march between the portions . This initial error , as will be seen , was repeated and exaggerated during the whole campaign which ensued . Johnston , whose force had now been augmented to 67,000 men , could not fail to perceive the opportunity thus presented to him . On the 31st of May he made a sudden onslaught upon that part of McClellan 's force south of the Chickahominy . For this he had designed to employ fully *o , ooo men , but Huger blundered , and the attack was made with barely 3o , ooo . As it was , it narrowly // missed of success at the Seven Pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McClellan , was then in actual command , hurried a division across a half-submerged bridge whi6h had been with difficulty constructed , restored the balance , and on the following day drove the Confederates back in disorder to Richmond . Toward night on the 31st Johnston was severely wounded , and the command of the Confederates devolved upon G. W. Smith , who *vo days after was disabled by a paralytic stroke , and on the 2d of June Lee was appointed to the chief command . For some months he had nominally been merely superintendent of fortifications , though really acting as Secretary of War . While awaiting the movements of the enemy he set himself at work to surround Richmond with a strong line of intrenchme*ds . McClellan , untaught by the sharp lesson which he had received , kept on* in his old way . In three weeks he had got eleven bridges built , over which on the 20th of June he passed half of the force which had been lying along the north bank of the Chickahominy , where Porter was still left with about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin offensive operations . On the 25th his picket lines were advanced , " preparatory , " as he said , " to a general forward movement . " At five o'clock in the afternoon he telegraphed to the President that everything had succeeded . An hour and a half later he sent quite a different despatch . Beauregard and Jackson , he said , had joined Lee , raising the Confederate force to 20Q , oOO men , and he should probably be attacked the next day . This was true in the one point that he was to be attacked the next day . For the rest , Beauregard , sick and without any command , was in Georgia ; Jackson was a day and a half away , and even including his force of 30,000 , the whole Confederate army numbered barely 100,000 men of all arms , instead of 200,000 . Lee had maturedhis plan of attack . It involved in a more egregious form the very error which McClellan had committed . He divided his army into two parts incapable of mutual support . The forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 5,000 from ioo , ooo . Lee 's plan was to leave Magruder with 25,000 men before Richmond , a few thousand more under Holmes being at Fort Darling across the James river , while the three divisions of A. P. Hill , Longstreet , and D. H. Hill , 36,000 strong , were to cross the Chickahominy above McClellan 's extreme right , and , uniting with Jackson , who with 30,000 was moving down from the Shenandoah , fall upon the Federal force , the bulk of which Lee supposed to be still on the north side of the river . But , as it happened , Porter with 36,000 was all there was on that side , the other 70,000 being already across . Early on the morning of the 26th Longstreet an dtheHills , having marched since midnight , were concentrated opposite the extreme Federal right ; but Jackson was a whole day 's march behind time . Weary of waiting , A. P. Hill crossed the Chickahominy , here a mere brook , and fell upon the Federal outpost , held by two brigades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of a creek . The Confederates were repulsed with a loss of r , 5oo , the Federals losing but 300 . Thus commenced the so-called " Seven Days ' Battles , " although they were really comprised within six days . M6Clellan had that very morning resolved to do what he should have done weeks before-cross the Chickahominy with all his force , and change his base of operation and supply from the York river to the James . The brigades at Mechanicsville were quietly withdrawn , and on the morning of the 27th all the troops on that side of the river were concentrated near Cold Harbor . Here in the afternoon a fierce battle was fought between Porter 's 36,000 and the Confederates , who , Jackson having come up , numbered after their losses 63,000 . The // Federals were defeated , although the enemy advancing under a hot artillery fire lost fully 9,500 , the Federal loss being about 7,500 , of whom nearly 3,000 were prisoners . Had McClellan sent back a seventh part of the 70,000 which he had actually unengaged across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter felled the trees in his front and thus formed barricades , he could have easily held his ground ; bia unluckily the axes had all been tak* n over , and when Porter , perceiving the approach of the enemy , sent to ask or axes the officer , who happened to be half deaf* misunderstood his message . Neither until it was too late did McClellan attempt to reinforce Porter , for he had been amused all day by showy demonstrations from the Confederates on his side of the stream . The action at Cold Harbor was in every way an error on the part of McClellan . He was under no necessity of fighting at all . Hours before it commenced he could easily have got every man and every gun across the Chickahominy , and Lee would have had his two days ' march for nothing ; and before he could retrace his steps Richmond might have been taken ; and at that time its fall would have insured the destruction of the Confederate army , for outside of the city Lee had not provisions for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McClellan could easily in two hours have sent over a sufficient force to insure victory . Lee 's position on the morning of the 28th was one of extreme peril . He had indeed won a formal victory , but at a heavy loss , and with only the result that McClellan had done just what he had meant to do without a battle . He had crossed the Chickahominy , and with fully 90,000 men was in front of Richmend , defended only by 25,000 , stretched along a line of ten miles . For all purposes of defending the city Lee 's remaining 53,000 on the north of the river might as well have been a hundred miles away . Of all possible things to be done , McClellan chose the one only which could have relieved Lee from his peril . Instead of attacking Richmond , or even remaining where he was , he resolved to retreat to the James . This retreat , euphemistically styled a " change of base , " was in itself a simple operation , and with the most ordinary precautions could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the bridges which he had built . But by some incomprehensible negligence these were so slightly damaged that the Confederates rebuilt them in a few hours . McClellan , abandoning his sick and wounded , set out on his retreat , sending on in advance a herd of 2,500 cattle and his long train , which in a single line would have extended forty miles . Yet even this could convey only a part of his stores and munitions , immense quantities of which were destroyed . On the 29th his rear-guard was attacked at Savage 's Station by a few regiments from Richmond , and sustained considerable loss . Lee , finding the passage of the Chickahominy perfectly feasible by the bridges with which McClellan had kindly provided him , attempted a grand stroke of strategy . Jackson and D. H. Hill were to follow hard after the retreating Federals , while TLongstreet and A. P. Hill were to make a long detour , and , joined by Magruder , to strike the flank of the column . He hoped to cut this in two , and drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to annihilate it . Strangely enough , the Confederates had neglected to make themselves acquainted with the roads lying right around Richmond . Magruder lost his way in the swamp , and failed to cooperate . Longstreet and Hill , after a weary march , fell on the afternoon of the 30th upon the centre of the Federal column , rear Frazier 's farm . Jackson had come up with the Federal rear , but was checkecI ' by a battery which covered the only ford across a creek running through the swamp , // and though in full hearing of the battle could render no assistance . Hill and Longstreet attacked furiously , but were unable to effect their purpose . Darkness put an end to the action , or rather group of engagements , and the Federal column , pursuing its retreat , took up an admirable position at Malvein Hill . Longstreet and Hill had five days before marched from Richmond with 24,000 men . In three engagements they had lost 8,200 killed and wounded , and the remainder were so exhausted that they were not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . In the action at Malvern Hill , July i , Lee committed every possible error . The enemy considerably outnumbered him , and were in a position which could be held against a double force . Lee attacked in driblets with only a part of his force . Jackson made an attempt on the right , and was speedily repulsed by an artillery fire . Lee ordered him and Magruder to again attack " with a yell . " The charge was vigorously made , but without a gleam of success , the assailants being everywhere swept back in hopeless confusion , losing 4,500 men , double the loss which they inflicted . It was not merely a defeat , but a rout . What must have been the surprise of Lee when as the rainy morning broke he saw the strong Federal position abandoned . McClellan had not merely continued his retreat , but had fled from a complete victory as though from a field irretrievably lost . In these " Seven Days ' Battles , " the entire Confederate loss was 19,400 , of whom 18,400 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Federal loss is officially stated at 15,249 , o ( whom 9,291 were killed and wounded , and 5,958 missing ; but probably many hundreds put down as " missing " were really among the killed . Reviewing the campaign , it may fairly be affirmed that there has rarely been better fighting and never worse generalship than were displayed on both sides . Where everything from beginning to end was a series of blunders , the commander who happened to make the last great error must lose . When McClellan fled from Malvern Hill , without even attempting a blow against a beaten enemy , he committed the final blunder , and so Lee won in spite of himself . The siege of Richmond was raised , and thereby the Confederacy gained almost three more years of life . 11. - NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND . On the 2*h of Jupe , the day on which began the Seven Days ' Battles , Pope was placed in command of the Federal forces in Northern Virginia ; and Halleck , with the title of General-in-Chief , was placed over both him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play into each other 's hands . Halleck thought the thing to be done was to enable McClellan to get away from the James , and so directed Pope to demonstrate upon the Rappahannock , hoping thereby to draw away a part of Lee 's army to check the movement . Lee , also wishing to get McClellan away from the neighborhood of Richmond , proposed to send a strong force toward Washington , hoping that the Federal army would be called back to defend the capital . McClellan was unwilling to abandon the peninsula ; but Halleck was peremptory , and McClellan , nervously apprehending an attack while retreating , only breathed freely when on the i8th of August he had put the Chickahominy behind him . On that very day the bulk of the Confederate army was a hundred miles away confronting Pope on the Rappahannock . At Richmond , besides a few local militia , there remained only D. H. Hill 's divi- , sion of not much more than 10,000 men . Lee with 75,000 men pressed Pope , who had barely 40,000 , half-way back // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of receiving reinforcements from McClellan 's army which would enable him to assume the offensive . On the 22d of August accident placed in Lee 's hands the despatch-book of Pope , which showed the precise situation of the Federal army , as*d the time when it would be strengthened . He conceived the idea that by a bold and rapid movement he could gain Pope 's rear , cut off his supplies , and perhaps even destroy his army before it could be reinforced . He undertook tith a part of his force to occupy Pope 's attention in front , while Jackson with some 30,000 should move rapidly around the Federal flank , and establish himself in its rear , where he was to be joined by the others . This manc*uvre was a delicate one , for it involved the separation of the Confederate army for a week , even should the weather or any other mischance not hinder the execution of the movement . Still the advantages to be gained by success were so great , that the chance was worth the risk . Lee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had anticipated in the outset . On the morning of the 25th Jackson moved rapidly , his march being partly hidden by the intervening mountains , rounded Pope 's flank , and passing through a gap took up on the 28th a strong position within sight of the old battle-field of Bull Run ; Longstreet , with whom was Lee , following more slowly . Pope , whose force had now been increased to 6o , ooo , moved upon Jackson , whose position was critical , for he was outnumbered two to one ; and unless Longstreet , many miles behind , should come up in time , he ran imminent risk of being overwhelmed . On the 29th Pope attacked in force and gained some apparent advantage . He believed that Longstreet was more than a day 's march distant , and that he could at reast cripple Jackson , and then , if need were , fall back across Bull Run and intrench himself until large reinforcements which were not far distant should come up . On the 30th he attacked with all his force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longstreet had come upon the field . The action , sometimes called the Second Bull Run , or the Second Manassas , but better distinguished as that of Groveton , resulted in a disastrous Federal defeat . The Confederates lost during the two days about 9,000 in killed and wounded , the Federals about i , ooo , besides some thousands of prisoners ; and the army was so disorganized that on the next day Pope could rally only 38,000 men . He fell back to Centreville , where on the next evenihg he was joined by 24,000 , raising his force to 62,000 . Lee , after all his l6*sses , had about 6o , ooo men , to whom were soon added D. H. Hill 's io , ooo , who had hurried from Richmond . The situation was far from unfavorable for Pope , for the Confederates could not count upon another man , while the Federals were constantly increasing . But a senseless panic had seized the authorities at Washington , and the troops were hurried back to the capital . Lee 's plans had succeeded beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond been definitely raised , but all Virginia was freed from the enemy , and the rich harvests of the fertile valley of the Shenandoah would feed the Confederate army . The season also was favorable for military operations , and it seemed feasible to carry the war into the North , for which also there were political as well as military reasons . Lee himself gives succinctly the reasons which induced him to cross the Potomac : " The condition of Maryland encouraged the belief that the presence of our army , however inferior in number to that of the enemy , would induce the Washington Government to retain all its available forces to provide against contingencies which its conduct toward the people of that State gave it reason to // apprehend . At the same time it was hoped that military success might afford us an opportunity to aid the citizens of Maryland in any efforts they might be disposed to make to recover their liberty . " In a word , he hoped , and not altogether unreasonably , that Maryland would join the Confederacy , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . The march to the Potomac was promptly begun and rapidly prosecuted-too rapidly , indeed , for in four days fully Io , ooo men dropped from the ranksJfrom absolute exhaustion ; and thus it happened that when on the 7th of September the army was concentrated at Frederick City , it numbered but 6o , ooo . Pope had meanwhile , at his own request , been relieved from the command of the forces around Washington , which passed almost informally into the hands of McClellan-Halleck , however , as General-in-Chief , resting as an incubus over him . McClellan set himself earnestly at work to reorganize his shattered army . However deficient he had shown himself , and was yet to show himself , as a commander in the field , for the work now to be done he was admirably fitted . As Secretary of War , or even as General-in-Chief directing operations at a distance , he would have been in the right place . In a week there were gathered aroun*d Washington 72,000 men , besides 13,000 most foolishly and against his earnest remonstrance posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly xoo , ooo men to operate directly against Lee . But the moment that active operations were to be undertaken , McClellan 's constitutional timidity came into play , and he also as usual estimated the force of the enemy at double its actual number . So when he began to head toward Lee , he moved only thirty miles in the first six days . A week in Maryland showed Lee that there was no hope of a rising in that State , and he resolved to move his army northward , hoping to draw McClellan after him and away from his base of supplies . Meanwhile , in order to keep open his own communications , he thought it necessary . to gain possession of Harper 's Ferry . Here he committed a grave error , for a place more utterly useless in a military point of view does not exist . It commands nothing , and in order to cross the Potomac no army need ever go near it . He could not reasonably hope to capture the force there , and he could not wish them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy ; and although he did actually capture them , it was owing to a stupidity beyond all example on the part of their commander . In order to capture Harper 's Ferry , Lee divided his army into three parts . Jackson , with fourteen bi*igades , was to make a detour of eighty . miles , crossing the Potomac and attacking the Ferry from above ; McLaws , with ten brigades , was to march forty miles and attack from below ; while Lee himself , with sixteen brigades , was to move to Hagerstown , fifty miles from the Ferry , where the whole army was finally to rendezvous . Supposing that there was no delay or mishap , a week would be the shortest time at which the junction could be effected ; for Jackson would have to make a march of 130 miles in all . The operation was begun on the ioth of September . On the morning of the 15th , a day later than was expected , Jackson and McLaws invested the Ferry , which was surrendered with 11,000 men , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the pusillanimity of Miles , their commander . At noon Jackson was startled by evil tidings from Lee . Accident , which had three weeks before favored Lee by givin*g him Pope 's despatch-book , now played a like good turn for McClellan . D. H. Hill had carelessly left behind a copy oC Lee 's order , which fell into the hands of the Federal commander . McClellan 's course was too plain to be mistaken . He had but to follow Lee , who with hardly 28,000 men was moving leisurely toward the // appointed place of rendezvous . For once McClellan moved rapidly , and on the 14th came up with the Confederate rear in the passes of the South Mountain . Lee faced about , and vainly tried to check the pursuers . The passes were forced at two points , which cost Lee 2,000 men . There was but one thing now for Lee to do . He must change the direction of his march toward Harper 's Ferry , and hasten Jackson and McLaws back to rejoin him on the way . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sto*d at bay near Sharpsburg . He could go no further , for the Potomac was in his rear . He had now barely 24,000 men , for straggling had increased his losses to 4,000 . The position was not of great strength . It was one which a commander with 20,000 might hope to hold against 30,000 , or which one with 30,000 might fairly venture to assail against 20,000 . Jackson was summoned to Sharpsburg . He commenced his march at midnight , and by dawn on the x6th joined Lee , having crossed the Potomac and made a night march of fifteen miles in six hours . He brought but himself and * , ooo men . The others , outworn by a week 's constant marching , could not keep up . The afternoon of the i*th and all of the z6th was spent idly by McClellan . During the night he made up his mind to attack on the next morning . All told , he had 83,000 infantry and artillery . McLaws in the early dawn of the 17th had come up with such of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle opened Lee had 36,000 . Of the cavalry on either side we take no account , as they were not engaged . When the plan of action was determined upon , it was understood that McClellan had resolved upon the one only right thing to be done  --  to throw his whole force upon Lee . Had he done this , the Confederate army could hardly have escaped destruction . When and why a different course was resolved upon has never been told . But McClellan , to quote the words of Sumner , " attacked in driblets . " First one corps was sent in ; when this was repelled another took its place . These desultory assaults were made mainly upon the left and centre of Lee , who , by withdrawing every possible man from his right , was able to oppose about equal numbers . At last Burnside with 14,000 men was ordered to attack Lee 's right , which had been so weakened as to leave barely 25,000 . Hour after hour the attack was delayed . At length Burnside forded the creek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he swept the weak enemy before him , and had gained a point whence the whole Confederate position could be enfiladed . The battle on the centre and left had died away ; but at this moment A. P. Hill with 4,000 men came hot-foot from Harper 's Ferry . With but half of these he struck Burnside , and fairly drove him in the gathering darkness across the creek ; and so the battle closed . Of McClellan 's six corps , two were not at all engaged . Out of 83,000 men , *8 , ooo were at different times brought into action . Of Lee 's entire 40,000 , including Hill 's late arrival , 38,000 were engaged , most of them all the day . The Federal loss at South Mountain and Antietam was 15,000 , of whom x , ooo were " missing , " besides the 11,000 surrendered at Harper 's Ferry , who , however , were never fairly in the enemy 's hands . The entire Confederate loss was 17,000 , of whom 5,000 were " missing . " On the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising his force to 38,000 . McClellan received also 14,000 , giving him after his losses 84 , ooo ; of these 39,000-more than Lee 's entire force-had not been engaged , while the others were in better plight than the best of the enemy . Yet he dared not attack . He shall state his reasons : " One battle lost and all would have been lost . Lee 's army might have marched as it pleased on Washington , Baltimore , Philadelphia , or New York , and nowhere east of the Alleghanies was // there another organized force able to arrest its march . " But if a commander with 84 , ooo men fears to lose a battle upon an open field against 38,000 , with what force could he gain it ? He changed his mind during the day , and ordered that an attack should be made on the x9th . But in the darkness of the night Lee had quietly slipped away , and by daylight was safely across the Potomac . He moved leisurely on for a few miles , gathering by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet on the 30th he had butI*3,00o men present for duty . On that day McClellan had with him Ioo , ooo present for duty , besides 73,000 around Washington , 5o , ooo of whom might have been safely given to him . The merits and demerits of Lee during this campaign are apparent . His operations against Pope were judicious ; for though hazardous , there was a fair prospect of gaining much , while a failure could hardly have proved ruinous , since the way of retreat down the Valley was unobstructed . The invasion of Maryland is open to grave criticism , yet on the whole it must be considered justifiable , for he could hardly have imagined that the army which on the 3d of September was flying before him , an apparently demoralized mob , would in a week be not only restored but increased to twice his own numbers . Lee 's besetting error , one which , as we shall see , was to cost him so dearly at Gettysburg , was that of underestimating the force of his enemy . He doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to any that could be brought against him , and that either with or without a battle he might dictate peace at Washington or Baltimore , or perhaps even at Philadelphia . The movement upon Harper 's Ferry was in every way an injudicious one . The place was useless to him , and the best that he could ask was that the 13,000 men who occupied it should stay there and not be added to the active army opposed to him . That they should be captured without a show of resistance , when retreat was so easy , did not come within the limits of military probability . Too high praise can not be awarded to the ability displayed by him at Antietam ; but that its result was not the surrender of his army can fairly be attributed only to the incapacity of the commander to whom for the second time he found himself opposed . 111. - FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE . After five weeks of delay in Maryland McClellan began to move slowly toward Lee , whose force had now been recruited to 73,000 . McClellan. marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were ordered to be sent to him from around Washington whenever he wished for them . Lee fell back quietly down the valley of the Shenandoah , crossed into that of the Rappahannock , and halted at Culpepper , whence he had started eleven weeks before . McClellan followed , and seems to have made up his mind to attack . But on the 7th of November he was removed from the command , which was forced upon Burnside against his wish . Of this amiable man , who before-at Antietam always excepted  --  and after performed such good service in a lower position , little need here be said . He gave his true measure when he urged upon the President that he " did not feel himself competent to take the command of so large an army . " His command is notable mainly for the disastrous battle of Fredericksburg , fought on the 13th of December . Lee with 8o , ooo men lay well posted on the south bank of the Rappahannock . Burnside with ioo , ooo crossed the river and attacked . Lee forbore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferring to receive it on his side of the stream . He could hardy have gone amiss here , for he had only to meet the assault where made . The result was that the Federals were repelled at every point , and recrossed the river the second night after un // 1871 . THE CAMPAIGNS OF ROBERT E. LEE . der the cover of storm and darkness , having lost 13,700 men , the Confederate loss being 5,400 . This great disparity in loss took place in the assault upon Marye 's Hill . At the foot of this hill there was a sunken road forming a perfect fosse . From below this was wholly invisible , the face of the hill presenting the appearance of an unbroken slope . In this road were posted 2,000 men , drawn up four deep . Two desperate assaults were made upon this hill , in the last of which Humphreys 's division charged up almost to the br*k-of the road , but were met with such a sheet of musketry from invisible foes that the column melted away like a snow-bank before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 6,5oo ; that of the Confederates hardly 5oo , and these fell before the artillery while getting into position . In the final charge , made by Humphreys with unloaded muskets , when he was flung back in fifteen minutes with a loss of 1,700 men , it is doubtful whether the Confederates lost a man . So sudden was the repulse that the Confederates never suspected the extent of their advantage , and lay upon their arms all that night expecting a renewal of the attack . Much surprise has been expressed that Lee did not on the following day follow up his victory . An absurd theory has been put forth that he saw the enemy so completely at his mercy that he refrained from attacking them on the score of humanity . He himself gives the true reason : " The attack on the 13th had been so easily repulsed , and by so small a part of our army , that it was not supposed the enemy would limit his efforts to one attempt , which , in view of the magnitude of his preparations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant . Believing , therefore , that he would attack us , it was not deemed expedient to lose the advantages of our position and expose the troops to the fire of his inaccessible batteries beyond the river , by advancing upon him . But we were necessarily ignorant of the extent to which he had suffered . " Lee might well style the attack " insignificant , " in proportion to the force which had crossed the river , and the part of his own army actually engaged in its repulse . Of the 55,000 composing Buraside 's left , only 17,000 were brought into the fight . For a final effort they awaited the result on the right . Here there were 45,000 , of whom 15 , ooo actually assaulted ; they were hurled back by only 5,000 out of the 40,000 whom Lee had at hand in position to meet the grand assault which he expected . Severe as were the losses in this battle , they formed only a small part of the injury suffered by the *ederal army . Its morale was seriously impaired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and men . Burnside at length became aware of this , and offered his resignation , which was accepted ; and on the 26th of January , 1863 , Hooker was placed in command . Only three days before Burnside had drawn up an order dismissing him from the service . Hooker set himself at work to improve the discipline of his army . By the middle of April it was in admirable condition . Besides 12,000 cavalry , who were sent upon a separate expedition , he had 120,000 men . Lee , who had strongly intrenched himself , had sent away nearly all his cavalry , with many of his infantry , and had 62,000 . Hooker resolved to move up the Rappahannock , cross above the extremity of the Confederate line , and then descend , taking the enemy in the rear ; a strong force meanwhile being left behind to demonstrate , or if occasion served , to attack in front . The turning operation was begun on the 28th of April , and on the afternoon of the 30th the columns , 45,000 strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre of the Wilderness , eleven miles from Fredericksburg . During the night Sickles 's corps came up , raising the force to more than 6o , ooo . Hooker was fairly justified in believing that " the enemy // must either fly ingloriously , or come out from his intrenchments and give battle on our own ground , where certain destruction awaits him . " But he had neglected the one thing then needed for certain success . A march of two hours would have taken him clear , out of the Wilderness . Directly between him and Fredericksburg were only Anderson 's division of 9,500 ; Early with io.ooo was just below the town , and Jackson with the remainder of Lee 's army was a score of miles further down the river . Lee had been taken by surprise , and the night was far spent before he learned that his rear was threatened . How formidably he did not anticipate ; and resolved to attack this flanking column , he ordered Jackson to come up . The long march began at midnight ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to move , he found the Confederates , less than 5o , ooo strong , drawn up ready to receive him as he emerged from the Wilderness . After some skirmishing , Hooker fell back into the Wilderness to await an attack instead of giving it . During the night a plan was proposed by Jackson and adopted by Lee , which can be explained only by supposing that he believed himself much stronger than Hooker . Jackson with 30,000 was to make a circuit around the Federal position and fall upon its right , while Lee , with less than 20,000 should demonstrate upon its front . By three o'clock in the afternoon the detour was accomplished , and after a march of fifteen miles Jackson was close upon Hooker 's right , and only six miles in a direct line from the point whence he had set out . So little was an attack here anticipated that no . pickets had been sent out ; the intrenchments were unguarded and the arms stacked . At five o'clock in the evening the Confederates burst from the woods upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying in every direction . But the Confederate advance was soon checked by an artillery fire . Jackson was mortally wounded by an accidental shot from his own men . Hill was also wounded , and the command of the division was devolved upon Stuart . During the night Reynolds 's cori*s of 17,000 joined Hooker , so that after the partial disorganization of Howard 's corps , he had still in hand on the morning of May 3 fully 75,000 men . If he had had the posting of the enemy , he could hardly have wished them otherwise than they were . Stuart 's 30,000 were separated from Lee 's 20,000 by six miles of dense forest . Had Hooker struck either , nothing which lay within the limits of military probability could have saved Lee from a disastrous defeat . That Hooker should have now awaited an attack , or that Lee should have ventured one , would never have entered the mind of one who , knowing the respective forces , could have overlooked the whole field . Hooker 's position formed three sides of an irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre southward toward Lee ; the left eastward toward Fredericksburg , with no enemy in its front . Sickles had rested the night before on a small cleared eminence known as Hazel Grove , whence Jackson had been repuJsed . This , though a little out of the line , was the only point of strategical importance , since from it the whole Federal centre could he enfiladed by artillery . Hooker ordered it to be abandoned . Stuart at once seized it , and planted a battery of thirty guns from which he opened fire without the possibility of reply , and then brought his whole force against Sickles . The battle raged furiously for two hours with varying success . Sickles , who was greatly outnumbered , and whose ammunition became exhausted , sent repeatedly for aid ; but none came , for at the moment Hooker was stunned by a shot which struck a pillar against which he was leaning , and there was no one at hand to // give an order , though all the while Reynolds 's corps lay inactive within half an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have taken Stuart square on the flank , and swept him into the wood from which he could never have escaped . As it was , the Confederate reports show how nearly they lost the day . The entire left , consisting of Meade 's corps and the remainder of Howard 's , was also wholly unengaged , for Lee had bee* demonstrating agains , t rather than assaulting Slocum and Couch in the centre , all the while edging toward Stuart , with whom he effected a junction while the battle yet hung in even scale . The combined force bore upon Sickles , whose corps fell back in disorder upon Chancellorsville . Couch had now taken command , and by his order the whole force fell back to a strong position two miles in the rear . After all losses they still numbered 70,000 , not half of whom had been seriously engaged . Lee , with but 40,000 after his heavy losses , was on the point of again attacking , when he was arrested by ominous tidings . Sedgwick had assailed Early on the heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22,000 men was fairly between him and Lee . Four brigades were sent to meet Sedgwick , when after hard fighting night fell and suspended the battle . No comman.der ever was in a more perilous position than was Lee on Monday morning , May 4 . At all events Sedgwick must be driven back . Leaving but 20,000 in front of Hooker , the remaining force of 32 , ooo , Early having joined , was hurled upon Sedgwick 's remaining - 20,000 , and the action went on all day within hearing of the intrenchments where Hooker 's 70,000 lay motionless . During the night Hooker ordered Sedgwick to cross the river . Half an hour later he sent countermanding the order , for he would attack next day . But the messenger was delayed by the darkness , and the order was not received until the corps was nearly across . Hooker meanwhile had called a council of war , and it was voted to abandon the enterprise , and the Federal army returned to its old position opposite Fredericksburg , foiled in an operation which had promised so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Thursday till Monday when success would not have been easy . The killed and wounded and about 3,000 missing . Hooker declared that he " felt that he had fought no battle , " because he c6uld not get his men into position , and that his enterprise had failed from causes " of a character not to be foreseen or prevented by human sagacity or resources . " A careful survey of what was done and left undone will evince that every untoward circumstance was of a character which should have been foreseen and prevented . If final success were a sure test of the merits of a military operation , that of Lee would deserve the highest praise . But with the exception of the first movement toward Chancellorsville every other was such a palpable violation of every principle of warfare as should have insured a total defeat . He succeeded through a series of accidents , the failure of any one of which would have proved fatal ; and a general , save in the direst emergency , has no right to reckon upon fortune . Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on Sunday when be attacked an enemy of superior numbers strongly posted ; still more desperately when on Monday he again divided his force . He had no right to presume that the Federal right would be surprised in broad daylight , while an action was going on in full hearing ; that his opponent would on one day fail to use well-nigh half his troops and on the next hold three fourths of them inactive , when a quarter of these would have been amply sufficient to insure a complete victory .
