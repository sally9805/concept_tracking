ART . I. - The Character and Logical iJietlioci of Political Economy . By J. E. CAIRNES , LL . P. , Emeritus Professor of Political Economy in University College , London . New York . 1875 . WE have at the present day a large body of writers on a subject commonly known as Political Economy . This term is , etymologically considered , entirely inadequate to give any proper conception of the exact nature of the subject , and many attempts have therefore been made to find a more suitable name . That these attempts have failed will not seem wonderful , if we reflect that there has been no complete agreement as to what the thing is to which the name is to be given . It is , we believe , generally agreed that the thing either is , or aims to be , a science , and that its subject-matter is the production , distribution , and consumption of wealth . But this is a wide subject , the ramifications of which may include almost every human interest in the promotion of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is desirous that that branch shall be considered an integral part of the science ; and if the object of defining the science were to please the greater number of its cultivators , it would be advisable to give the term a pretty wide range . But the wider the range we give it , beyond certain narrow limits , the more confusion we shall introduce . If we examine the differences of opinion // between different writers , we shall find that many of them have their origin in fundamental differences respecting the objects and methods of the science . Now , it is obvious that the wider the range we allow , the greater the number and variety of the methods which may be allowed in its investigation , and the less the chance of giving any clear statement of what may be peculiar in the method . The only rational and complete mode of settling these differences is to find whether any peculiar method of arriving at truth which is or may be employed by the political economists exists . Then , any branch of the general science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be considered a part of political economy . Perhaps the most fruitful source of the confusion to which we have alluded is the failure to distinguish between the abstract or general principles of the science and the actual phenomena of human society in which these principles come into play . The latter are the product of a vast number of causes , some of which may be entirely ignored by the political economist , and it does not follow that if he fails in correctly representing them , his science is a failure . Yet many respectable writers seem to think that if they can find or even invent cases in which events do not occur according to the laws of political economy , they have disproved some of its principles . The insufficiency of this mode of proceeding may be well illustrated by a case from the physical sciences . More than two centuries ago Galileo discovered the law of falling bodies , expressed by saying that a body falls sixteen feet the first second , three times that distance the next second , five times the third second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best established laws of mechanics ; yet , if we attempt to verify it in nature , we shall fail , for the reason that the law takes no account of the resistance of the air . Is it therefore no law at all , but only a delusion and a snare to those who attempt to apply it ? Were we to adopt the system of one half the critics of political economy , we should have to say yes . For instance , the most criticised theory to be found in any standard writer on the subject is , we believe , Ricardo 's theory of rent . Its refutation has , in this country at least , almost become fashionable . And the task of refuting it , as a concrete law actually carried out in human society , and accounting for // the rent of land everywhere , is very easy . It can not be denied that it rests upon hypotheses which , if true at all , are true only in very limited districts or under special conditions , and that it may be modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . And yet , we believe this most abused theory to be , if not the expression , at least an illustration , of one of the most important laws of political economy . The criticisms upon it are much like those of one who should show that Galileo took as the fundamental basis of his law the hypothesis that there was no atmosphere , and should descant upon the absurdity of calling that a law of nature which could only be verified above the air , where no human being could ever go to try the experiment . Granting the hypothesis of Ricardo , his conclusions inevitably follow . And , though not unmixedly true in the case of land , yet his law has its analogue in every case in which a commodity or a faculty in any market commands a high price from being limited in supply . The incomes gained by the ability of an eminent lawyer , the skill of a man of business , the ownership of a valuable mine , or the invention of a new machine , might be shown to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our whole science seemed to shake from an attack by Mr. Thornton upon some of its fundamental principles , and especially upon that best-grounded one of all , the law that supply and demand govern price . He instanced the Dutch auction of fish on the shores of the British Islands , and the sale of a horse or a house under hypothetical conditions , thereby proving that supply and demand would not control price in every possible case . But this looking up of cases in which the law did not operate was really no more a disproof of the law , than the discovery of a mountain would be a disproof of the rotundity of the earth . The foregoing examples will serve to illustrate the first point we wish to bring to attention . Concealed as it were within every logical system of political economy is the framework of an abstract science , of which the doctrines actually taught are little more than applications . The same thing is true of applied mechanics , but in this case the abstract science is taught and studied apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium and motion , in which is traced the operation of certain laws , learned by induction . These laws are in operation in every piece of machinery which man can construct , and without a clear understanding of them it is impossible to understand the machine . It is true that any one who expects the machine to operate according to any mathematical formula3 derived from those laws may be deceived , but this is not from any want of knowledge of the laws themselves , but from ignorance of the exact coiiditions under which they operate . Knowing these conditions , the operation of the machine can be predicted with entire certainty . But , if we examine the courses of political economy taught in our colleges , or even the works of the ablest writers on the subject , we shall find no such clearly drawn distinction between the abstract science and its application . It is not unlikely that one half the writers on the subject might even deny the existence of any such abstract science of wealth , apart from its applications ; we shall therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , but that it has many of the marks of an exact science . If we were required to state at the outset what this science is , we should define it as the study of the mode of operation of those causes which affect the production , distribution , and consumption of wealth , in so far as they act through human volition . The necessity for this limitation will be evident on reflection that the introduction of human volition brings in causes of a character different from those which act where it is not an element , and that the latter class of causes belong , for the most part , to the physical sciences . For example , the state of the weather is a very powerful agent in affecting the growth of agricultural products , the amount of wheat or cotton produced in any one season being very largely influenced by the season . The study of this cause belongs , however , to agricultural chemistry and botany , not to economy . But , the prospect of a good crop inducing the farmer to sow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of an economic cause , because it would be one acting through the volition of the farmer . That there are a great number of causes , acting through hu // man volition , and affecting the production and distribution of wealth , the operation of which can be traced with entire certainty , will not , we conceive , be denied . That the higher the price of any article of wide consumption , the less can be sold in any market ; that the scarcer and more difficult of production it becomes , the higher its price will be ; and that taxes operate in a certain knowable way in raising the price of the goods on which they are levied , - are propositions which none will be found flatly to deny . The province of our abstract science is neither more nor less than to furnish the means of tracing every cause which can thus affect the quantity , price , and final disposition of the exchangeable products of human labor . The existence of means of transportation , the demands for commodities constantly arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects of the crops , the invention of improved means of production , and the statute laws of different places affecting the sale of goods , are examples of the innumerable causes in question . Every circumstance which affects the willingness of large masses of men to buy or sell any particular article is an economic cause affecting the price of that article . A corollary from these views is that every new and correct explanation of the mode of operation of a cause in the commercial world is a valuable contribution to our science , no matter how rarely that cause may act , nay , no matter if it never goes into actual operation at all . The error commences only when it is wrongly assumed to be in operation . Every writer on the subject , from Adam Smith downward , who has had any clear conception of causes at all , has given us something of value , and deserves to be honored by the philosophic critic for what he has thus done , rather than condemned because he may have supposed conditions which were peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; just as we honor Galileo for discovering the law of falling bodies , though it is never carried out in nature . Real progress in science does not , however , consist so much in the discovery of new cases , or new modes of operation , as in the reduction of all laws to their simplest and most general form . Thus , the numerous and complicated laws of the celes // tial motions were reduced by Newton to the one law of gravitation toward each other ; and Lagrange reduced the whole of abstract mechanics to a single equation , in the development of which he made the science to consist . Abstract political economy is susceptible of a similar reduction , the fundamental principle of which is that each man seeks to employ his productive po wers in the way which will yield him the maximum amount of enjoyment . But the problem of tracing the action of this principle through the complex conditions of human society is a much more intricate one than any met with in abstract mechanics ; and however completely it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists who apply it have not yet succeeded in securing that common assent to all their conclusions which is granted in the case of the physical sciences . Still , as we shall presently endeavor to show , it is on this fundamental principle that economic science must rest . We have , we trust , made it clear , from what precedes , that there are some general principles by which the action of causes in the industrial world can be traced , and that in the study of the mode of operation of these causes we have the development of an abstract science . We have now more fully to justify our limitations of the causes to be considered to those acting through human volition . If we examine the field of abstract political economy as occupied by the great writers on the subject since Adam Smith , we shall find that this limitation defines it with a good deal of precision . The production , exchange , distribution , and consumption of wealth are all human acts . Although natural forces come into play in all these processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by these forces , man merely setting them in operation , yet theiraction does not concern the economist , but only the physicist . We can readily trace the distinction between these two classes of forces through all the great operations of industry . Let us begin with production ,  --  the manufacture of cloth , for instance . The growth of manufactures is constantly spokcn of as if it were analogous to the growth of a tree ; and , no doubt , many a paternal statesman founds his policy on the // tacit assumption of this similarity . But in what does the growth of the manufactures of a nation consist ? Examination will show that it consists entirely in the erection of individual manufacturing establishments by men who have money to spare for that purpose , and who believe , in each particular case , that it will prove a profitable investment . The belief of a number of men of wealth that the factory will prove profitable is the cause of the factory , without which it would not exist , and with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their volition . When the economist shows how a careful estimate of the cost of building and running the factory , of the price which may be obtained for its products , and of the consequent profits which its owners may expect , leads to its erection , his functions with the building end , and the architect and engineer come in and execute the work . The machinery all ready for use , operatives have to be hired and wool purchased , when economical laws again come into play . Whether Jones , operative , will give his services for two dollars per day , is a question which can be decided only by Jones 's own volition . His volition is indeed determined by his taste for the work and the wages he can command elsewhere ; but the acceptance or refusal of the terms is undoubtedly an act of volition , and not the operation of a physical cause . So , also , the price which the manufacturer must give for raw material - wool , for instance - is that at which the producers choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of causes which lead them to fix their prices , the final exchange is a matter of choice with them . In the same way , the price at which the finished cloth can be sold depends on the value set upon it by those to whom it is sold , and it is quite optional with the latter to accept or refuse it at the price offered . We may say , with entire certainty , that the factory must sell cheaper than any foreign establishment which formerly supplied the market could supply cloth of similar quality . But it remains none the less true that the paying of any price for the cloth is a human act , and must be considered as such in any sound philosophy of the subject . We thus see that the effect of building the mill , and indeed the whole question of its success or failure , is as completely // dependent upon human volition as is a question of war or peace . The only difference is , that in the one case the question is decided indirectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exercised in an entirely different way in the two cases - that there is no meeting of patriotic citizens to decide the fate of the factory , and no official judgment upon it pronounced in any quarter - does not in any degree weaken the position which we maintain . Moreover , causes of the class we are considering are the only ones the range of which comes within political economy . The wear and tear of the machinery , the character of the country , and the quality of the material are very important elements in determining the fate of the establishment ; but their consideration b longs to engineering and commerce , not to political economy . Finally , as the success or failure of the one factory is a powerful ag nt in leading men to decide whether they shall build an9ther , we may say that the growth of all manufactures depends on human volition . In so strongly insisting on human volition as a link in every economical chain of causes , we must not be understood as countenancing the vulgar notion that the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - are arbitrarily fixed every morning by the brokers over their coffee . The will of any individual is as powerless in altering economical laws as it would be in altering the course of nature , and this for two reasons . In the first place , the individual will itself is very largely , though unconsciously , governed by these very laws ; since every man who spends his income so as to procure for himself the maximum amount of gratification is simply acting in exact accordance with the fundamental principle of political economy . In the next place , the phenomena of our science are not the acts of individuals , but of great masses of men , and it is only among great masses that most ol its laws are exemplified . There is much that is changeable and capricious in the wants of the individual , and to bring laws into play the mass must be so great that the caprices of individuals are no longer felt . Then the law of averages comes into play , without which there could hardly be such a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in an ocean ; and however the drop may be beaten about by the winds , the ocean preserves its bounds unchanged . Having thus shown that the phenomena with which the science of wealth is mainly concerned are really phenomena of human volition , the next question in logical order is , How are these phenomena to be investigated and brought under the domain of law ? The answer of a very large body of intellectual men of the present day , and possibly that of the greater part of the intellect of the world , will be that human acts , consAcred in the mass , are to be studied in the same way that modern science studies the course of nature . The general reaction which we are now witnessing against the speculative philosophy of the past tends toward the view that man himself is as completely subject to natural law as is the merest atom , and must , therefore , be studied by the same methods which have been so successfully applied to the physical sciences . Curionsly enough , in the case of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking into which nearly the whole world is prone to fall in reasoning on economical subjects , and which consists in considering the community only as a mass , and forgetting that the mass is made up entirely of individuals , and that the acts of the mass are only the sum total of the acts of individuals . Now , while human volition , from a scientific point of view , is as completely subject to laws as are the operations of nature , the laws are of an entirely different kind and to be studied in an entirely different way . The fundamental difference which we wish to elucidate is this : the operations of nature depend entirely on antecedent causes , whereas deliberate human acts are the result of what the older philosophers might have classed as final causes . That is to say , some result of the act , or , to speak more precisely , some expected result , is itself the cause of the act . The cause of all the phenomena of political economy is the desire of mankind to enjoy wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of this enjoyment , and not the antecedent conditions* which is the proximate cause of the efforts of man to acquire wealth . This distinction between the laws of human action and those of the course of nature is so fundan*ntal , not only in our present inquiry , but in the philosophy // of physical science , that , elementary though it be , we may be pardoned for endeavoring to elucidate it further . In the answer which the common-sense of intelligent mankind now returns to the questions , " When the loose mountain trembles from on high , Shall gravitation cease if you go by ? Or some old temple , nodding to its fall , For Chartres ' head reserve the hanging wall ? " we have the postulate of modern science , not a principle which it seeks to prove , but one which it adopts as the basis of investigation . Perceiving a certain phenomenon , it assumes it to be the result of some previous conditions and of some knowable and invariable law or laws , and thence seeks to discover what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casa does the result of the phenomenon enter as an element into the investigation of its cause . It is not necessary to see who stands under to determine when and how the stone will fall . The motion of a storm-centre across the ocean takes place without any regard to the ships it may eiicounter , and a ship drifting in the current moves without regard to the storm which is coming . Entirely different is the case when the ship is under human guidance . If her navigators are acquainted with the course of storms , she moves aside to avoid the storm , and , in any case , her sails are reefed as soon as the barometer falls . If we had to explain this phenomenon by the postulate of physical science , we should have to say that it is a law of nature that ships reef their sails when the barometer falls suddenly , or , to speak more scientifically , when the pressure of the air rapidly diminishes at the point where the ship is found . But this would be a misuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , how invariable soever the rule may be , it has not the characteristics of natural law . The sails are reefed , not in obedience to a knowable law , but in order that certain evils which would result from nob reafing them may be avoided ; whereas , so far as we can see , no natural law operates " in order ' that any result may follow . We have , therefore , a necessity of some postulate which in the investigation of human acts shall take the place of the // postulate of physical science already referred to . In the case of political economy , this postulate is found in the unlimited desire of civilized man for wealth and its fruits , and the li*nitations placed by nature on the gratification of that desire . Man is thus obliged to recognize an order of preference in his wants , and is led to satisfy those which are most pressing before he atteiids to those which are less so . As natural science assumes the operations of nature to depend in an invariable way upon antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provident and reasonable being , who employs his labor so as to secure for himself , so far as he can foresee , the greatest possible return of wealth avid the maximum of enjoyment . As the explanation of a physical phenomenon is complete when the antecedent conditions on which it depends are shown to exist , and the law of connection is stated , so the explanation of any economical phenomenon is complete when it is shown how it resulted from the efforts of men to secure the greatest return from their labor . The much-discussed decline of American commerce and ship-building may afford us one out of many illustrations of the principles we are seeking to establish . This decline may be called , in strictest scientific language , a politico-economical phenomenon , and it is a phenomenon the explanation of which has occupied the thoughts of our statesmen for several years . Viewing it from the stand-point we have taken , it is as completely a deliberate human act as is the reefing of the bails of a ship . Our people can build ships and sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , only they do not choose to . Why do they not so choose ? Clearly no one can answer this question so well as the men who formerly built ships and have now ceased to do so , since every man must know best the reasons for his own acts . And when they tell us , in detail , the motives which influence them , we have a complete answer to our question , so far as the proximate cause is concerned . No one would doubt that this cause is to be found in the fact that it does not now pay so well to build and sail ships as it formerly did . While , in former years , this was the most profitable employment in which the men in question could employ their capital and time , this is no longer the case , either // because other employments have become more profitable , or this one less so . Supposing the latter to be the cause , the next question in logical order would be , Why this diminution of profits ? This question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of the ship-builders , showing on the debtor side what it cost to produce a ship , and on the creditor side what the ship sold for . If the principal changes for the worse were on the former side , it would be necessary to trace up the causes in the increase of price of the principal articles which enter into a ship . Here , as before , we should find the question to be one of human motives . To say that timber now costs more , is simply to say that the owners of that commodity now refuse to sell it so cheaply as formerly . If they could not produce it so cheaply , it would be because laborers charged more for their services , which would again be caused by an expectation on their part to profit by asking higher wages . We should pass out of the chain of causes acting through the hopes and fears of men only when we reached the purely physical conditions on which depends the production of articles necessary in building a ship ; such conditions , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rivers , or the changes of climate : and then we should pass out of the province of economical science entirely . Summed up in a single sentence , the position we maintain is that the causes which operate are not antecedent conditions , but results to be attained by the effect itself ; just as an immunity from damage , to be attained by reefing the sails of a ship on the approach of a cyclone , is the cause of the reefing . To this it may be objected that the real causes are as truly antecedent in this case as in the phenomena of nature ; that the reason why the sails are reefed is not that a storm is coming , but that the sailors believe one to be coming ; that this belief is an antecedent condition which will result in the effect , even if there be no storm ; and , finally , that the belief is the result of certain inductions from past experience , so that in any case the causes must be antecedent . This view is , in philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that it is the expectation of a result , and not the result itself , // which is the cause of human action . But it is none the less true that , if we attempt to found our science on observable antecedent conditions , entirely ignoring the consequences , as in the case of physics , we shall wholly fail . Nothing can be gained by ignoring the fact that man shapes means to ends , but one of the most precious instruments of investigation will be thrown away . To take a single example , suppose we wished to inquire whether the price of cotton was in any way influenced by reports of the kind of weather which prevailed in cotton-growing districts . The physical method would be to compare the weather reports with the price of cotton through a series of years , and find whether , on the whole , the price rose or fell after particular kinds of weather had been reported . This would be the method of the average editor and the average congressman ; and if the latter should prove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would probably receive more praise from his constituents for founding his theory on facts , than blame for want of sense . Yet , his result would prove nothing , because the price of cotton is affected by a variety of other causes , the effects of which it would be impossible to separate by such a method of proceeding . The economical method would be to find , as a matter of fact , or yet more accurately as a matter of opinion among the wholesale dealers in cotton the world over , what kinds of weather are favorable to the cotton crop , and what kinds unfavorable , and in what degree . He then would say that reports of the first kind would tend to lower the price , and of the latter to raise it , and no amount of statistics to the contrary could disprove his position . They would only show him that other causes than weather reports had influenced the price . The main objection to ignoring final causes is the impossibility of otherwise separating cause from effect . Suppose we wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it plenty or scarce in the market . It would be very easy to prove by statistics that whenever the price was high the article was scarce , and when it was low the article was plenty . The conclusion of blind induction would be that if it // is in the power of the community , as it is in some cases , to regulate the price at which an article shall be sold , the lower it is fixed the more plentiful the article will be . There is , in fact , no proposition in financial scieuce admitting of more apparently conclusive proof from statistics than this . It can hardly be necessary to say to any intelligent reader , that the fact is directly the opposite , since raising the price stimulates , men to produce and import , while lowering it has the opposite effect . Could more examples be needed , the reader would find plenty of them in the writings of Mr. Carey and his disciples , and especially in that author 's " Principles of Social Science . " Mr. Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental principle of which is the ignoring of human motives and human sufficiency , and the consideration of man as an atom impelled by forces of the same kind as those which act in nature , against which he is entirely powerless . Ranging over the whole of history for his premises , and recoiling froni no absurdity in his conclusions , his pages are full of results as completely at variance with fact as is the con clusion we have just cited respecting the relations of price to the supply of commodities . The absence of logical method and scientific ideas from his pages does not detract from the value of his conclusions as warning examples , because no logical acumen is required to draw conclusions in this manner by the blind application of the principle , post hoc ergo propter hoc . If we examine the method of the writers who have really contributed to the advance of economical science during the present century , we shall find their common characteristic to be the recognition of man as a being acting from motives , adapting means to ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could see , was best adapted to forward his intere*ts ; while the absence of such recognition is the mark of nearly all the speculation on economical subjects which has no logical basis . If we examine the arguments of those who oppose the views of political economists , whether in the matter of protective tariffs , irredeemable currency , governmental interference with the hours of labor , or regulation of the prices of commodities , we shall find that they tacitly ignore any adaptability in man , and place him as completely at the mercy of // external forces as if he were a ship drifting about in the ocean . In Mr. Carey 's philosophy , merely allowing him to trade will result in causing him to do such foolish things as selling hides at a sixpence and buying back the tails at a shilling . Mr. Wendell Phillips maintains that the rate of interest which men must pay throughout Great Britain , and we are not sure but throughout the world , is determined from day to day by the governors of the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the liberal introduction into commerce of suitably embellished pieces of paper , each declared by authority to represent an appropriate number of dollars , men will be made active and industrious , and will at once proceed to exchange a great number of*products ; while without them laborers will stand idle in the sight of factories and starve in the midst of plenty . The question , what motive men could have in acting thus unwisely , or how their freedom can be thus hampered , is one which they never consider . We are now in a position to apprehend clearly what political economy , considered as a pure or abstract science , is , and in what manner it is to be developed and applied . The hypothetical data with which it sets out are an indefinite multitude of men , each urged by an indefinite series of desires , but with only limited means of gratifying those desires . Each man is at the same time the producer and consumer of a limited portion of those objects of desire . But , between his positions as producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great number of commodities , his production is practically limited to one , at least at any one time . By exchanging this one with his fellow-men , he receives from them in return as many of their productions as he can induce them to give . To make the terms of the exchange definite and ascertainable , a common measure of value is necessary , and this measure is afforded by money . One advantage of money is that of enabling the producer to determine directly what commodity he can most advantageously produce , this being the one which yields him the maximum money income . Amongst the innumerable employments open to each individual , he is supposed to choose the production of this commodity , allowance being made for any agreeableness or disagreeableness in the employment . // The laws of production and of consumption are at first to be considered separately and independently . The law of consumption is known when we have found how much of each individual commodity the community at large is ready to purchase at any given price . For instance , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of barrels is supposed to be given which the population of the country is ready to buy and consume at that price ; to five dollars would correspond another and smaller number ; to six , a yet smaller number , and so on . Mathematically speaking , the consumption is given as a function of the price , or , in ordinary language , there is a determinate relation between the price and the consumption , which is supposed to be among the data . This relation is entirely independent of production , the latter only helping to determine what quantity shall be produced at any given price , or what shall be the price of production . The tatter being given , the foregoing relation immediately determines the amount consumed . It may be necessary to explain that , for the end now in view , a commodity is considered to be consumed when it has reached its final destination . The corresponding datum for production is the producing capacity of each individual for each commodity . This capacity may be expressed by the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite time , say a year , and depends partly on natural and partly on acquired qualities . It was one of the faults of the economy of Adam Smith and his immediate successors , that differences of natural capacity for various sorts of production were ignored . It is now well understood that the numbers from whom the highest intellectual efforts can be obtained , by any amount of training , are limited by nature ; that a hod-carrier , in fact , could never have been educated into an eminent lawyer , no matter how much capital might have been sunk in the attempt . Finally , production and consumption are necessarily connected by relations expressed in the following two rules : - ( 1 . ) The quantity of each commodity produced is equal to that consumed ( or sold ) . ( 2 . ) The money value of each man 's total production is equal to that of his total consumption . // With the data we have set forth , the problem , to determine a priori the industry of a community or of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , it is possible to deduce , by strictly logical operations , in what production every man or class of men can most advantageously engage , what price they will obtain for their products , and what products of others they will spend their money for . In the mathematical method by which this result would be obtained in any given case , we have a pure or abstract science , in itself as exact as any other pure science . The exactness with which it could be applied in any particular case would depend on the exactness of the data ; and the fact that these might not be accurately attainable would not detract either from the exactness of the pure science or from its value measured by a purely intellectual standard . A little consideration will show that the data we have supposed are not all that are necessary in the rigorous application of the science to the case of actual human society , but that many disturbing causes come in . We have , for instance , taken no account of capital as an agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each kind of capital would be regarded as a commodity until it reached its final owner , when it would become an instrument increasing his capacity for producing some class of commodities . Thus , with the increase of capital , the capacities of the oxvners for production would undergo a continual change which would have to be taken into account , and would make the problem yet more complex . Again , there would be some modification in the problem whenever any combination among all the producers of any one commodity to charge the same price might be entered into . This cause would be allowed for , by supposing the class to act as a single individual , possessed of the aggregate capacities of production of the class . Each individual has been supposed to produce a finished commodity , which he sold directly to the final consumer or employer . But , as a matter of fact , each commodity requires the services of a number of producers in succession . Still another modification of the analysis would be required to take this fact into account . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . A science of industrial dy // namics is therefore possible , and this science will stand in the same relation to sociology and to practical statesmanship that physical dynamics does to physics and engineering . As the solution of a problem in dynamics is complete when , from the forces which act on a body , we determine its position and velocity at any time , so a problem in industrial dynamics is complete when we have determined the quantity of the commodity in question produced and sold under given conditions , and the price at which the sale is made . When we say that the sole object of our science is to find the means of determining the quantity and price of each commodity under all conditions , it may seem that we are confining it to very narrow limits ; that , in fact , only a small portion of the great work of Adam Smith , or even of recent works , is devoted to the investigation of the problem of quantities and prices . But a glance will show that the problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical interests of the community than would at first sight be supposed . Let the question be that of the expediency of levying an excise duty on iron . The legislator asks the economist in what manner such a duty will affect the interests of the community . Supposing his methods and his data to be sufficiently complete , the economist would reply by furnishing a statement of the following particulars , corresponding to each and every proposed rate of duty : Number of tons , by which production of iron would be diminished by the duty ; Increase in price per ton at which it would be sold ; Percentage of diminution in wages of producers ; Percentage of hands who would change employments in consequence of this diminution of wages . These results being given for each rate of duty which it might be proposed to levy , it is clear that the legislator would have means of judging whether any excise duty should be levied , and what should be the best rate , in a degree of completeness and perfection which no one ever before thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities produced and prices of selling under hypothetical conditions . The degree of exactness and certainty with which they could // be actually presented would depend entirely on the accuracy of the knowledge possessed by the political economist respecting the variations in the consumption of iron produced by the variations of price , and the capacities of the men engaged in the production of iron for producing other things . That the problem would be a determinate one when these data are given will be evident to any one having a clear conception of cause and effect under circumstances so complex . But can data be found sufficiently exact to lead to a solution that shall have any practical value ? If we answer this question in the negative , it will be equivalent to saying that there is no possibility of foreseeing the effect of a duty on iron , since such foresight can be attained only by reasoning from some principles and data assumed to be true . If this were the case , a tax would have to be levied in entire blindness . The very fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out its effects , shows that they believe themselves in pos. session of data and principles for foreseeing those effects . To ultimately expect from political economy results of such certainty and exactness , that it can present the legislator with numerical predictions like those we have described , is by no means hopeless . To attain this end it is not necessary that we should be able to foresee the effect of all causes on the iron market , and hence the exact price of iron , but only the effect of such duty as may be levied , and the consequent difference between the circumstances of the trade , price , quantity , etc. , if no change be made , and these same circumstances under the proposed duty . This difference may be predicted with entire exactness when the absolute price may be incapable of being foreseen in either case . We can say with entire certainty that to burn one fourth of the crop of wheat next year would make flour dearer than to preserve the whole , and it might be possible to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict a higher price than that of this year , because good crops the world over might make good the destruction . That the degree of exactness in treatment and prediction here described can be attained only by mathematical methods , is a proposition which we would not stop to maintain , were it not disputed by many high authorities , and distrusted by a // large portion of the intelligent community . Quite surprising is it to see Mr. Cairnes , one of the ablest and clearest of recent writers on the logic of political economy , and one whose ideas seem quite in unison with those expressed in the first part of this article , maintaining that mathematical methods can not be successfully applied to economic investigations . Such a proposition must , we conceive , arise from some misapprehension of the nature and objects of the mathematical method . Mathematical analysis is simply the application to logical deduction of a language more unambiguous , more precise , and , for this particular purpose , more powerful than ordinary language . That a vague and indefinite language can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , no one will maintain , and the dispute must turn upon the question , whether it is possible to express the propositions of political economy in mathematical language . In this Professor Cairnes seems to labor under some extraordinary misapprehension . He conceives that mathematics can not be applied to the development of economic truth , " unless it can be shown either that mental feelings admit of being expressed in precise quantitative forms , or , on the other hand , that economic phenomena do not depend upon mental feelings . " The answer to this is so obvious , that it seems almost superfluous to express it in words . It is not degrees of mental feeling which it is necessary to express in numbers , but only the phenomena to which these feelings give rise . The price of consols depends on the opinions and feelings of men respecting the money market , and these feelings can certainly not be expressed in any quantitative form . But this throws no obstacle in the way of the precise quantitative statement , that on a certain day consols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt expressing hunger and thirst in numbers . But this fact does not make it impossible to say precisely how many barrels of flour the inhabitants of a city have consumed in a given period , nor how many they are likely to consume in time to come . The more common and weighty argument against such applications of mathematical methods is that , owing to the necessary inexactness of the subject-matter , it is impossible to obtain precise quantitative results in any economical investiga // tion . This argument applies only to political economy as an applied science . One of the principal objects of the present discussion has been to show that , back of applied economy , there is a pure or mathematical science , which admits of as much rigor of mathematical treatment as any other branch of pure science , and to this science the objections under consideration do not apply . The only question left open is that of the utility of attempting to apply the rigorous formulae and methods of this pure science to the actual case of human interests , in which precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm can ever result from the application of a rigorous method and a precise language , while we thereby enjoy the undeniable advantage of greater precision of thought . If we do not attain accurate results , it is not because they are inherently unattainable , but because we are ignorant of some of the requisite data . Economical phenomena really occnr according to laws as exact as those which control the elements . The number of barrels of flour consumed in the city of New York during the ten years 1865- 1874 , and the number of dollars paid for them , is now susceptible of exact nunierical statement . The reason it was not susceptible of such statement ten years ago , is that the necessary information respecting future crops , population , and other matters was not attainable . It is quite likely that we have devoted to the refutation of this unscientific opinion more space than it deserves , since , as a general proposition , it admits of direct overthrow by a single appeal to the commonest acts of the mercantile world . Arithmetic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of precise quantities ; while the business of the world , and a fortiori , that of each individual man of business , is necessarily dependent upon a multitude of indefinite and uncertain ageiits , human opinions included . Yet every individual merchant does keep all his daily transactions subject to exact numerical calculation , and does find his reward in so doing . If the arguments we are combating were resorted to , they would lead to the conclusion that the merchant might gain something by substituting shrewd guesses for exact calculation in the transaction of his business . // It will conduce to clearness if , before going further , we sum up the conclusions to which we have been led in a few brief propositions . Viewing the industrial activity of a country as a connected whole , it presents to our consideration a network of phenomena comprising the production of a multitude of objects of utility to man , their transportation from one place to another , their transfer to various owners , and their ultimate attainment of some destination in which they fulfil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the gratifleation , directly or indirectly , of some human desire . The science which investigates the causes and relations of these phenomena is political economy . These phenomena are , from an economical point of view , controlled and directed by man , and may , therefore , properly be considered as phenomena of human volition . They are not reducible to laws of the same kind as those which govern the operations of nature , where every phenomenon depends in a determinate and invariable manner on conditions antecedent to and surrounding it , which conditions are , phenomenally , its cause . The cause of every step in the production of any object of human desire is the good which that object is expected to produce ; and it is only by learning what that good is , that any complete theory of the production can be formed . Any system or any method of investigation which presupposes the acts of man in carrying on the operations presented to our view in the industrial activity of the world to be governed or directed by any other cause than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is thereby attaining the greatest good his exertions can secure him , is founded on a false basis , and can lead to no valuable result . The explanation of an economical phenomenon is complete only when it is shown how the actors who brought about that phenomenon , under the circumstances in which they were placed , found or believed the acts which brought it about to be those most conducive to their good . The manner in which man can best attain his ends depending on the circumstances in which he is placed , his acts are influenced by those circumstances . Ec3nomical phenomena // are thus affected by a multiplicity of causes , the combined effect of which can be determined only by analyzing the separate action of each . The investigation of any one is economically complete when it is shown how it causes , or might cause , man to act in his effort to attain the maximum good . Any such investigation is a contribution to economical science , whether the cause investigated has or has not an objective existence . In the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volition , we have the elements of an exact science , susceptible of being treated by mathematical methods with mathematical rigor . This science is based on the general character of civilized man , and especially on the indefinite extent of his desires for objects which he can obtain only by exchanging services with his fellow-men . Its mathematical magnitudes are quantities of products and values . The latter is an element peculiar to economic science , and measures a quality of the object which may be dependent on all the causes which influence its production . In applying this science to any special problem , or to the circumstances of mankind in any particular country , the exactness of our results will be measured by that of our data , which it can never exceed . If an inexact method be applied , its uncertainty will be added to that of the data in the effect upon the final result . The pure science is the same everywhere and at all times , so long as human nature and the general condition of mankind remain unchanged . In applying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each case . Hence , each country may be said , in a certain sense , to have an applied political economy of its own , though it would be inexact to consider results of this application as a scientific system . The foregoing discussion of the method of political economy as a science will enable us better to understand its relation to kindred branches of inquiry . As we have defined it , it covers but a small portion of the ground occupied by the general subject of sociology , or even by most treatises of political economy . There is a class of thinkers , too numerous and influential to be ignored . who view such limitations with ex-* // treme disfavor , and consider them as marks of a certain narrowness of view on the part of the economists who make them . Their idea seems to be that the economist tacitly assumes everything in sociology outside the limits he sets as comparatively worthless , or , at least , as of not enough miportance to merit his consideration . It would be interesting and instructive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mr. Mill 's celebrated definition of the field of our science , in which he says that it considers mankind as occupied solely in acquiring and consuming wealth . The general opinion of the critics seems to be that this implies a most narrow , grovelling , and selfish view of human nature and human motives , and entirely ignores the higher aspirations of humanity . The fact that the criticism was equally applicable to algebra , so far as ignoring many noble things is concerned , does not seem to have been generally remarked by its authors . The reason for limiting the range of the science in the way we have done is simply to avoid confusing branches of inquiry , which have to be pursued by different methods . The method of political economy is peculiar , and is practicably applicable only to the , acts of man in the pursuit of the enjoyments afforded by the exchangeable products of his skill and labor . The economist does not regard other subjects as inferior , but only as subjects which must be pursued , in part at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come in only as an auxiliary . The reasons for all this will be clearly seen by comparing it with some kindred branches of inquiry . The general subject of human desires in their relation to sociology naturally divides itself into three branches . The first includes the laws to which these desires are themselves subject , the causes of their inception , growth , and decay . This is a part of what Mr. Mill proposed to term " Ethology , " * or the science of the formation of character . Character being already made for man , and its formation or change lying without the sphere of his direct volition , this science can not be treated by the method of political economy , which considers only results of volition , and indeed only such results as admit of being foreseen and determined . In the latter , man as he is , * System of Logic* Book VI . // with all his desires , is supposed to be given as an element of the problem . The domain of moral science is that on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moralist is told that economy does not criticise human desires , but places all on the same level , and recognizes no other good than their gratification , he is apt to conclude that it is in some way opposed to moral philosophy . To him it is obvious that there is a higher good than the mere gratification of the natural and acquired tendencies of humanity ; and he analyzes and criticises the various appetites and emotions to which humanity is subject , and shows their relation to that higher good . But the limitations of economy do not imply any antagonism to the conclusions of the moralist . The economist does not claim that his good is superior to , and should take the place of , that of the moralist ; in fact , he can hardly be said to have a good , in the sense in *rhich the word is used by the other . His method is fitted only to determine the results to which the acts of men lead , and the restrictions to which they are subject ; and the attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The questions whether certain methods of proceeding are or are not those best fitted for the attainment of any desired end , and whether that end is itself a good one , are so obviously distinct , that it would be superfluous to insist upon their separate treatment , if we did not find them so constantly confused by popular writers . It is only by keeping within its proper sphere that economy can efficiently help morals . Our judgment of the good or bad tendencies of an action ought to largely depend on the ultimate effects of the action , and these can be learned only by processes to which moral philosophy is a stranger . It is well known to economists that , while the judgment of individual men respecting the best course to promote their immediate personal interest is generally the best that can be formed , this is far from being the case when they attempt to judge of the interest of society . This is seen most strongly in the case of charity , - a field in which the views of the moralist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have laid down , the province of economy // is only to say whether the object of a philanthropist is really attained by the course which he pursues , not whether it is a good or a bad object . If his object in giving alms to a mendicant is simply to increase the income of that particular mendicant , without regard to the rest of society , or to rid himself of his importunity , then he does wisely . But the motives sanctioned by morals would not be these , but the general good of humanity . If this be the motive of the philanthropist , the economist will show him that he is making an unwise application of his money in giving it to a mendicant . He is simply hiring an idle man to remain idle , by giving him bread taken from the mouth of the honest laborer . In the large majority of cases , at least in this country , the mendicant has become such for the same reason that the bricklayer has , - because he has learned from the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum total of wealth given by society to mendicants represents a certain proportion of the products of labor which is set apart as a reward for those who may follow the profession of mendicancy . This result is one which , from his own point of view , it is the duty of the moralist to take into consideration . The clear definition of the distinction between the abstract science of political economy and those of its applications which we nearly always meet with in works on the subject , is also of prime importance . Very few indeed are the writers on this subject who are content to treat it as an abstract science , without any reference to its bearings on questions of public policy ; and it is largely to the want of such cultivators that the unsettled condition of its fundamental principles is due . No real progress is ever made in physical science except by men who aim at nothing beyond the discovery of general truth , regardless of its bearing on human affairs ; and it is not unreasonable to expect that no important advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . Unfortunately , there are obstacles in the way of the development and application of its principles in the manner in which those of physical science are developed and applied . In the first place , it would seem that the abstract science of wealth is lacking in that interest which attaches to the study of nature . // The writers on it are very few indeed , and have remained almost entirely unknown , even to each other . Their readers must be at the same time mathematicians and economists , - a combined class so small that it could hardly make itself heard , even by the scientific world . In the next place , the subjectmatter to which the pure science is to be applied is one in which conflicting interests are so involved , that the prospect of disinterested investigators being allowed to settle them does not seem encouraging . When an academy of scientific experts shall be called on by Congress to investigate the effect of a proposed tariff upon the industry of the country , an extraordinary advance will have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the boundary line between the pure science and its applications admit of being laid down with entire precision . Any application to purely hypothetical cases , framed for the purpose of illustration , may , in a certain sense , be regarded as an extension of the pure science . But we can have no difficulty in deciding that an application to an actually existing case for practical guidance lies without the domain of the pure science , as does also the application to all problems , real or hypothetical , the solution of which demands that we adduce other principles than those of the science in question . Viewed from this stand-point , the larger part of the existing treatises on political economy are occupied with the applications of that science to the very complex conditions of the affairs of men . Among these applications the discussions of questions of governmental policy occupy the foremost place . Indeed , it is not unfrequent to find writers attacking these questions with such ardor as to forget that there is any science behind them . That free-trade is a fundamental principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest intelligence ; while writers of another school suppose themselves to be discussing that science when they are seeking to prove that free-trade should not be allowed . Accordingly , the policy of a protective tariff is nearly always discussed in connection with the laws of foreign trade . Now , it is quite true that no one can form a really intelligent and weighty opinion on tha subject of protection without a clear under // standing of the elementary principles of our science in all their ramifications . But it is no more necessary that he should understand the laws of foreign trade than those of any other department of the science , since the arguments for and against the policy in question are not generally founded on any peculiarities of trade , but on quite elementary principles . The argument against considering the laws of foreign trade and the policy of protection together is the same that holds against the combinations of heterogeneous forms of thought in other discussions , namely , the confusion of ideas into which the reader is thus liable to be led . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes affect the phenomena of foreign trade , that is , the quantities of each kind of goods imported and the prices at which they are sold , is one of interest and importance , without which the science of economy would not be complete . Moreover , among these causes tariffs and other regulations of government are just as legitimate objects of investigation as any others . But , when the economist has completely traced the action of each cause to its ultimate effect upon both foreign trade and domestic production , the scientific part of his task is done . Considerations of a similar character apply to questions conne*ted with money . The origin of banks , the functions they fulfil in exchange , and the various effects of an inflated and irredeemable currency on economical phenomena , are all legitimate questions of economy . A complete understanding of the mode of action of all the causes which come into play through the peculiarities of the currency is essential to the construction , and even to the correct judgment , of any system of regulating the currency . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , whether they be natural or artificial , he has performed his duty as a scientific investigator . He may devise a complete system of regulating the banks of the country , but if he inserts this system into a work on economy as a part of the science , he is mixing two heterogeneous subjects , to the probable confusion of mind of his readers . It is not merely in questions of public policy that we see the boundary lines of our science disregarded . There are a // multitude of social questions to_the which its principles may be applied with more or less success , and these are nearly always confounded with the science itself . The Malthusian theory of population is a case in point . Here the question is whether population does really so tend to increase that it must ultimately be pressed for the means of subsistence . Its solution depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the rate at which population tends to increase ; ( *2 ) the improvements in the means of providing subsistence for it . The first being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first sight , that , by the principles we have laid down , its consideration belongs to political economy . To see that this is not the case , we have only to reflect that , in the case of economy , the volition is directed toward a certain definite end , and is exercised in accordance with a law of greatest result which enables us to reduce its action among great masses of men to exact laws ; while those volitions which result in the increase of population are not subject to this law2 and are not directed with any view to an exchange of services between different classes of men . The method of political economy is not , therefore , susceptible of application in this question . And if it can not be applied to the increase of population , much less can it be applied to the question of further improvement in our means of procuring food . To what extent , by what means , and at what cost the productive power of land can be increased are very important social questions , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be investigated by the methods of political economy . The data are of that class with which the economist must be supplied before he can apply his science . We are at the present day witnesses to a widespread effort , at least among English-speaking people , to study the wide subject of sociology from a more purely scientific point of view than has hitherto been taken of it . This movement is probably due to the influence of Herbert Spencer more than to any other one cause . It is one from which great good may be expected , especially if social reformers can be in any way influenced by it . But if it invades the peculiar and limited field of political economy , nothing but harm will result . That it may seek to do so to a greater or less extent will // appear highly probable , if we reflect how fascinating to a large portion of the intellectual world must be the idea of helping the economists out of their perplexities by an infusion of new ideas , and by the application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical sciences . To show that no other method than that already described can be successfully applied to purely economic questions has been one of the principal objects of the present article . It is with no disposition to undervalue general sociology that we express the hope that it will not supersede any part of the old-fashioned political economy in the curricula of our colleges . Even combining the two will be subject to the danger of leading the student into forgetfulness of the different methods which must be applied to them , and losing sight of any clearly marked line between what is to be regarded as scientific certainty and what is not . In consequence , he will fail to form a clear and definite idea of the manner in which public questions pertaining to revenue , to foreign trade , to domestic industry , and to the currency are to be approached . These are questions on which every influential citizen should be able to form an intelligent opinion ; and he can no more do so without a clear conception of the peculiar mode of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the workings of an engine without a knowledge of mechanical principles .
