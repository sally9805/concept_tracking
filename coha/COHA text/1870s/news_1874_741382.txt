txt A strange affair took place in a Police Court on Thursday , before Justice BIXBY , On complaint of a lady who had lost a valuable watch while riding in a Fourth avenue : car , two men were arraigned . On discovering her loss . which may have been by theft or accident , for aught she know , she inserted . an advertisement offering a reward of $50 for the recovery of the property . In answer to this came an advertisement announcing that the subscriber was in possession of the lost watch ; had paid . a larger sum for it than the amount of the reward offered , and expected for its return a more liberal compensation . The owner again advertised , offering 00 reward . This second offer brought to her house a man having a written agreement based upon its terms . A detective in waiting arrested hini , and he gave the name *of John Smith , which was not his true name . The lady identified him as a passenger on the car in which she lost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also arrested . Both men were taken before an Inspector of Police , and by him were released . The complainant next sought justice at the Tombs Police Court , where the accused men gave the names of GEORGE SPIKE and ClIARLE6 D. CRAWFORD . The watch was found in the possession of one of them . After considering the evidence above recited , Justice BIXBY dismissed both persons " with a severe reprimand . " This is altogether a queer proceeding on the part of the Justice . Putting the case in its most innocent aspect , could . " John Smith " be held . guiltless ? We certainly think he could not . When he entered into negotiation for the return of that watch , he knew he was wrongfully possessed of another person 's property , and even if every . previous act of his had been in the strictest accordance with the law , it was his duty , legally . us well as mortally , not only to see the watch , restored its oWner , but to disclose the manner in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a charge of larceny , or of receiving stolen goods , or both , could and should have been , preferred against him , and only on giving an . explicit ) account of his part in the transaction could any court or jury exonerate him . But without explanation , " John Smith 's " conduct is susceptible of the very worst construction possible . And . this view is justified by the fact that he was a passenger in the same car with the lady when she lost her property . But this case derives additional importance from another view of it . A certain class of scoundrels , either thieves themselves or brokers for thieves , carry on a thriving trade in the " John Smith " way . Take up the Herald any day , and it openly offers the thief of the day before an excellent opportunity to return , for a valuable money consideration , the stolen property , " and no questions asked . " In many instances ; the thief could in no other way so readily realize upon the proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this class is caught in a trap of his own setting , a kind Police Justice discharges him with " a severe reprimand , " volunteering the information that the law holds him to no accountability for acts of this character . Truly , this must be comforting to the thieves who advertise in ' the Herald .
