Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : ODENSEE. from Odensee 1876-1879 The man whose heart is true and tried , He may wander fearlessly ; Yet beware of the island of Funen , And the valley of Odensee . We stood on the bridge together As the sunset faded wild , And I heard the seaman 's story Of a wanderer beguiled . As the stranger paced down the valley , The mill-stream his footsteps laved , The robin sang by the pathway , And the green grass glittered and waved . All murmured , " Though storm and destruction In the whole wide world may be , There is rest in this one low valley , In the valley of Odensee . " How swiftly the hour of slumber In the faint noontide was gone ! The robin sang o'er him in locust-boughs And the mill-stream murmured on . The dreams of a thousand years stole back On his dreaming soul that day , And dim , fair forms through the brookside woods Went glimmering and waning away . Ah ! how his footsteps faltered , When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world seemed altered , And how hushed the quiet dell ! As the wanderer went up the valley , There were sad thoughts clung round his mind , As the poplars clung on his pathway , While their bright leaves sighed in the wind ; And he knew , ere he reached the hill-top , He had left his soul behind . It waved in the locust-blossom , It gleamed in the poplar spray , It sang in the robin 's singing , And it murmured , " Stay , O , stay ! " " The bees suck honey from the flower , And the soft winds steal it from the bee , And the honey of thy soul is drained away , By this sweet air 's luxury . " And as he went wandering onward , His heart beat , ah ! wearily , And he looked , and looked , to the westward , To the valley of Odensee . His cheek grew whiter and thinner , And his pulse ebbed day by day , But he only looked to the westward , Where the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the dark fish glance , His dying eyes did seem , But still they gazed to the westward , And closed upon the dream . Ah ! sadly I heard the story , For my full heart answered me , There were spells in Merrimack valleys As strong as in Odensee . Anonymous .
