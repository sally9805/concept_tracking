DINNER vs . RUFFLES AND TUCKS . Lv the eager struggle to widen woman 's sphere beyond the home , our literary monitors seem in danger of relaxing their watch over those whose fortunate allotment has been " the sweet safe shelter of the household hearth behind the heads of children . " Beyond the irrepressible topic of grievances involved in the reign of Princess Biddy , few other details of home living and doing are just now being discussed . We have barely begun to discover that another equally potent destroyer of domestic peace has crept into the household , and as you read probably not half of you will guess that I mean no less than the sewing-machine . The peerless Queen of the needle ! My admiration of the wonder-working thing is as complete to-day as when I saw it flash off its first eam , and cried exult-ingly , mc*re to be a s1ave* Along with the barbarous Turk . where woman has nevera soul to save ; For this is Christian work ! " How could I foresee that we were only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet hand for the twenty yards that must put a thousand additional nerves and muscles to the stretch I The direful discovery has duly been made that no form of labor more surely and irretrievably undermines the health than that of this same invaluable sewing-machine , when used at . the rate now almost universal . " I never could get along without my machine , " says the weary young mother , looking arou*d upon her ruffled and betucked little brood . No , poor little woman , nor with it either . That thought comes to me new every morning as I try to lure you out into the sunshine and fresh air . * you always say ; " I // do wish Icould ; but if Igo out in the morning , I am so tired directly , I can not settle down to sew , and get nothing accomplished all day . And just look at my work , here . " I do look at it , and oh , the pity of it ! Round and round , till yards on yards of tucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flounce , scalloped and bound , garnish the dress without adding one whit to its beauty or use . No wonder , at this rate , though you have a servant in the kitchen , and another in the nursery , all you can do is to get time to sew . No wonder , when these helpers are of the class described la the Biddy-essays , the husband 's step in the hall brings no lighting up of your face , but rather , alas ! a little cloud of apprehension as you wonder how affairs may be in the dining-room to-day . For you know you have not " had time " to run down to see to things . No , little dame , no inclination ; for you know , and every woman who will tell the truth admits , that nothing gives quite so complete a disrelish for housework of every description as steady sewing . " I had rather be whipped than go down into that kitchen , " I have heard a wife sigh , rising from a long session at her machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the dinner is Irish , and the swill-cart carries off daily a pailful of viands that a few hours before were the pick of the market , and paid for in extremely hard cash . Of course , the children want to be where mamma is ; but they and the machine together are more than she can bear . So nurse drags them off to fret and bicker away profitless hours in the other rooms , or marshals them forth to the scanty resources of the sidewalk , where they catch , under her management , those omnipresent " colds " which scourge out children 's lives . Meanwhile mamma sews on , with a sense of home-affairs in general not going as well as they sh9uld , and perhaps a vague , unrestful feeling that life is sliding away without her gaining or giving what she ought , standing as she does on the heights of the world , no childless " woman without honor , " but wife and mother beloved , with ample room in life to live and love in . As her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do her aching head and weakening limbs never warn her that it is a treble thread this wearing motion reels away ? That , with every additional yard of ornamental and needless stitching she runs off there shortens , by one subtle and sure atom , the thread of her life ? No whit less surely than Hood 's gaunt starveling in her garret , she too is " Sewing at once , with a doable thread , A shroud as well as a shirt . " Now that the physical results of much labor on the sewing-machine have become apparent , the question of how far a woman who is bearing and rearing children is justified in its use , rises into a question alike of morals and expedience . When I review the days many of ouse most conscientious and diligent young mothers pass , I only wonder that they do not fade faster-that more chords of their mental and physical being do not grow utterly " out of tune and harsh . " And I only marvel that it is not oftener , rather than so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no strength to bring forth . " DeaT little mother , shall we not reason together ? And must you not first confess that it has come to that morbid pass , that , however you may deprecate what you call the " necessity " of so much sewing , you would rather spend six hours at the ruffles and tucks than four in your kitchen and about your house ? And yet those daily four hours , with a reasonable vigilance over the cooking and general disposal of provisions , would make all the difference between a satisfactory table at fair expense , and wilful waste of materials with woeful want of comfortable meals . And here a remark of Dr. Duryea reminds me where the inevitable " moril " comes in . He says that regular , // 710 PUTNAM 'S MA ( SAZINE. inviting , and digestible meals would go farther to do away with that uneasy wish for " something to take , " among our men , than all the temperance eloquence and effort in the world . Do you say you have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run also ; but turn your back resolutely on that , and persevere in the first , and the days will surely come when you find your strength up to the level of every need . " But the sewing must be done , and hiring two girls and a seamstress is out of the question . " Quite , and so it ought to be ; but suppose you leave out one of the girls ? Here , in one of the largest towns in the Eastern States , the highest pay of our skilled dressmakers who go out by the day , is a dollar and twenty-five cents . And a woman competent to stitch all sorts of work upon your machine receives but a dollar a-day . She expects ( alas for her ! ) to sew steadily from eight till six . It is for you to consider that she , too , has health to lose , and by tempering justice with judgment , to see that as little as possible is wasted in your service . Suppose you take the hundred dollars a-year you pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a-week , eight weeks in the Spring and eight in the Fall . See that she does not overwork , no matter how nervously " willing " she may be ; and with fair diligence on her part , do you not think she will accomplish in those sixteen weeks all it spoils your whole year to do ? True , to do this you will have to conquer bravely your repugnance to " see to things " about the house . And once get into the habit of seeing to them daily , and you will find a surprising improvement in the quantity and quality of the work of your remaining girl , if you are thus omnipresent . When things have fallen into system , and the whole incubus of sewing is lifted off ; there will come sure days of peace ; the children will have their mother . She , and not an ignorant nurse , will be transfused into their souls . It occurred to me the other day , as I passed along the street , how rare a thing it has become to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She has no time , " may be the reply , " to range about in that aimless way . " But what is she doing with her time ? Is it any more aimfully spent if she uses it to prepare little Miss to mince abroad alone in such fantastic guise as plain old grandma epitomized the other day , when she saw her grandchild thus prepared , and said : " Now , daughter , just tie a string to her , and she will be all ready to travel with the hand-organ . " It may be that a force is at work , which for ages has accomplished what the most earnest preaching against specific follies has failed to do . If Fashion has a mischief , it has no less at times a mission . The windows of the cheap shops are now full of coarse , flimsy materials , loaded with machine-work in every respect as profuse as the richer fabrics they imitate . These caricatures may lead to the sorely-needed discovery that excessive elaboration is vulgar , and that may prove the happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to put away from the sewing-machine what our foolishness makes " the worser part of it , " and let it be to us all the perfect gift that it is I Finally , let us insist that whatever in the domestic economy ought to be subordinate , it is " the fine sewing .

At least make the fair triaL If all were to make this beginning , the great army of workers for bread would soon find it out , and the result would be much greater certainty and economy in this branch of work than at present exists .

I wish , indeed , that words might come to me strong enough to prove to every woman in this land the foolishness of such reckless multiplication of ruffles and tucks . The time it takes to make them is not our own , but bought time , believe it ! and given us for the soul 's life of ourselves and children . And it takes much healthful work and air and sunshine to train all bodies so that they may yield up the soul uncrippled for the long Eternity . - 4 - -   - -   PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION . WE call ours a popular , representative government , that is , a government of the people acting by their representatives . The theory of every law in any one of the States is expressed in the enacting claifse of New York statutes , which is that " The people of the State of New York , represented in Senate and Assembly , do enact as follows . " The purpose of the present essay is to show how far this is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . It is no part of our plan to examine the reasons for regarding the theory of our institutions as the true one . That belongs properly to another discussion . We are not now to compare republican governments with those which are monarchical , nor the different kinds of either class . The fundamental principle of American polity is , that all government comes from the people , to be exercised by them , and for them . The motto supposed to be written here upon every symbol of authority is , " from the people , by the people , for the people . " The conformity , or rather nonconformity , of our practice to our theory is the subject for present discussion . In pursuing it , we will , for illustration , begin with our own State , New York-that great commonwealth , which stamps the name of the supposed lawgiver upon the front of all its statutes . Our Legislature is composed of a Senate and Assembly , the former consisting of 32 members , the latter of 128 . Each member of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of which may be changed even ten years , so as to make those of each class equal in population . Each district is single , and at each election the candidate having the largest number of votes is declared elected , though that number may not be a majority of all the votes belonging to the district , or even of the votes cast . ii ; for example , there be three candidates , two of whom receive each one third of the votes , less one , the third candidate will be chosen , though he has received only one third of the votes , with two added . The Senate is chosen every two years , the Assembly every year . In 1868 eight hundred and eighty-one statutes were passed ; in 1869 nine hundred and twenty . We now begin to perceive how truly , or rather untruly , speaks the enacting clause of each of these eighteen hundred and one statutes . Apart from the fact that the Senate chosen in the autumn of 1867 for the next two years may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn of 1868 , we see that each election must have resulted in giving the representation to a majority or plurality in each district , leaving all the rest of the voters unrepresented . Thus it may happen , and does in fact often happen , that , inasmuch as a bill may be passed by a majority of the members elected to each House , 17 Senators and 65 Members of Assembly may enact a law , and these 82 men may , in fact , hold their seats by the votes of a minority of the electors of the State . If the enacting clause were i*hen to speak truly , it would run in this wise : " One third ( or one fourth , or one fifth , as the case may be ) of the people of the State of New York , represented in Senate and Assembly , do enact as follows . " // This comes of perverting what should be a personal selection into one that is local or territorial , and makes a Legislature almost as likely to misrepresent as to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system works . We will look at the state governments first , and the federal government afterward . In doing so , we will take for the most part the election of 1868 , the time of the last presidential election , and therefore most likely to bring out a full vote . In the Senate of New York 17 Republican Senators had been elected the year before by 324,687 votes , and 15 Democratic Senators by 353,136 votes . In the Assembly 76 Republican members were elected in 1868 by 397,899 votes , while only 52 Democratic members were elected by 431,510 votes . There were thus 28,449 more votes cast for the 15 Democrats in the Senate than were cast for the 17 Republicans , and if the representation had been faithful to the principle , there would have been 17 Democrats and 15 Republicans , and tile majority of 2 for the latter would have been reversed and made 2 for the former . There were at the next year 's election 33,611 more votes cast for the 52 Democratic members of Assembly than for the 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the votes , the number of Democrats elected would have been 67 instead of 52 , the number of Republicans 61 instead of 76 ; and the majority , instead of being 24 for the Republicans , would have been 6 for the Democrats* Turning to other States , we find the following results : in Maryland the Democrats cast 62,357 votes , and elected every member of both Houses , 111 in number ; while the Republicans polled 30,438 votes , and elected nobody . In Delaware the Republicans elected only 2 members by 7,623 votes , while the Democrats elected 28 by 10,980 . In Kansas the Republicans elected 105 members by 31,046 votes , while the Democrats electg4 only 7 by 14,019 votes . In Nevada the Republicans cast 6,480 votes , and elected 51 members ; the Democrats cast 5,218 , and elected only 6 members . In California the Republicans elected 23 members by 54,592 votes , while the Democrats elected 97 members by a less number , that is , by 54,078 . In Vermont 240 Republicans were elected by 44,167 votes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 243 members , and 42,396 Democrats only 37 . Maryland 's Republicans thus cast nearly a third of all the votes in the State , without getting a single representative in either branch of the Legislature . In Delaware the Republicans gave over 40 per cent . of the popular vote , and gained but 6 per cent . of the Legislature , while in California they gave an actual majority , but gained less than one fifth . On the other hand , the Democrats in Kansas gave a third of the votes , and obtained but 6 per cent , of the Legislature ; in Vermont they cast 21 per cent . of the vote , and obtained but 9 per cent , of the Legislature ; in Maine they cast 37 per cent , of the vote , and obtained only 13 per cent , of the Legislature ; in Nevada , with nearly half the vote , they had but 10 per cent . of the Legislature . Passing now to the federal government , we find that the representation in the House of Representatives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , though the former received but 416,492 votes , while the latter received 423,365 ; that is to say , the popular majority was 7,073 for the Democrats , while the congressionul majority in the delegation is 3 on the side of the Republicans instead of being , as it should have been , 1 on the side of the Democrats . Taking the whole House of Representativeswithout the unrepresented States , we find 148 Republicans and 71 Democratic members ; the former having received 2,654 , O48votes and the latter * , 037,178 ; that is to say , the Republicans on 56 per cent , of the popular vote have 67 per cent , of the congressional vote ; and the Democrats on 43 per cent , of the former have 32 per cent . of the latter . In the Senate the representation is // still further removed from the people , as the following statement will show . There are 37 States entitled to 74 Senators . This table gives the vote of the 18 States having the largest population and entitled to be represented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Pennsylvania , 655,602 ; Ohio , 518,828 ; Illinois , 449 ,  - -  436 ; Indiana , 343,532 ; Michigan , 225 ,  - -  619 ; Virginia , 220,739 ; Massachusetts , 195,911 ; Iowa , 194,439 ; Wisconsin , 193,584 ; North Carolina , 176,324 ; New Jersey , 162,645 ; Georgia ,  |p8,926  ; Kentucky , 155,455 ; Alabama , 147,781 ; Mls-. souri , 147,135 ; Mississippi , 114,283 ; Maine , 112,822 . Total vote , 5,022 ,  - -  871 . The following table shows the vote ot the 19 States having the smallest population and entitled to be represented in the Senate by 38 Senators : California , 108,660 ; South Carolina , 108,135 ; Texas , 107,780 ; Connecticut , 98,947 ; Maryland , 92,795 ; Tennossee , 82,757 ; Minnesota , 71,620 ; Louisiana , 71,100 ; New Hampshire , 69,415 ; Vermont , 56,224 ; West Virginia , 49,397 ; Kansas , 43,648 ; Arkansas , 42,148 ; Oregon , 22,085 ; Florida , 22,022 ; Rhode Island , 19,541 ; Delaware , 18,575 ; Nebraska , 15,298 ; Nevada , 11,698 . Total vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 787 ,  - -  310 votes . New Yo*k , with 2 Senators , cast 849,750. 26 States , with 52 Senators , east 1,948 ,  - -  189 ; 3 States , with 6 Senators , cast 2,024 ,  - -  240 . The City of New York casts more votes than the 6 States of Oregon , Florida , Rhode Island , Delaware , Nebraska , and Nevada . Before passing from the subject of rep* resentation in the federal government , let us pause a moment to consider how far the presidential electoral colleges represent the people . At the election of 1868 , 214 Republican presidential electors were themselves elected by 3,013,188 votes , while the eighty Democratic electors received 2,703,600 votes from the people ; that is to say , the Republicans on 52 per cent , of the popular vote obtained 72 per cent , of the electoral vote ; while the Democrats on 47 per cent , of the popular vote obtained only 27 per cent , of the electoral . These statements serve to show that our practice and our theory are irreconcilable . We must accept one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . According to the latter the state governments are republican and representative in respect to persons ; the general government is federal , national , and representative in respect to both persons and corporations  --  the States . There was a time when representation in some of the States was largely corporate . That was so in Massachusetts . It is easy to see how corporate representation began . In England the municipalities were summoned by their representatives to Parliament for the purpose chiefly of granting aids to the Crown . In New England the town took the place of the municipality . It was counted as the unit in the composition of the Legislature . The representation there was of the towns as corporations , and the majority in each not only ruled in town affairs , but sent a representative to speak for the town in the General Court , or council of towns . But they have changed the theory and the practice . Corporate representation is nearly gone even there , and in most of the States there is not a trace of it . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit , for the arrangement of representation in all the States . The federal government meantime depends upon the representation of the States in the Senate , and of persons in the House of Representatives . But so faulty are the contrivances for carrying out either theory , that neither in the federal nor in the state government is there a representation faithful to the principle on which it rests . Where the representation is intended to be personal , it so happens that some persons only , and not all , are represented . And when the representation is intended to be corporate , that is in the federal Senate , the State may fail of representation , because the Senators are chesen by the Legislature , which in its // PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . turn is , or may be , chosen by a minority of The people of the State . Our practice thus contravenes the fundamental principle of republican , government , which is that the majority must rule . This principle is essential to the idea of such a government . Where the power resides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number must prevail , or the minority will rule . This principle , carried to its legitimate result , requires that every question shall be decided by the majority of those in whom resides the ultimate power . As all citizens are equal in rights , the consent of the larger number must necessarity overbear the consent of the smaller number . This , however , is applicable only to the whole governing body ; for when you apply it to a body or number less than the whole , you may create a government of minorities . That is to say , when the city of New York is exercising the functions of local self-government , the voices of a majority of her citizens should prevail upon every question ; but when she comes to participate in the government of the State , and for that purpose elects representatives to the State Legislature who are to vote upon State questions , if the electoral machinery is such as to express only the choice of a majority of the city 's voters , the minority is lost . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to decide it should be heard in person or by representation . Therefore , when the question is local , the local majority should govern ; but when the question is general , it should be decided by the general majority , and not by local majorities , or a combination of local majorities , which may come to be in effect the same as a general minority . This can be made plain by the example of a private partnership . Suppose it to consist of 25 partners . In a conflict of opinion , 13 may rightfully control 12 ; but if it were arranged at the beginning of the year , that the partners should be diviaed into 5 sections , and each select one of a managing committee of 5 , by which the whole business of the year should be conducted ; who does not see that each one of the managing committee might be chosen by 3 of the 5 partners in the section , and that thus the whole 5 of the committee would be really the representatives of 15 partners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 out of 5 , might in fact represent only 9 of the 25 partners . Would any thing come of such an arrangement but discontent and dissension before the end of the year ? What would happen in a private partnership , upon so faulty a scheme of management , does h*pen , and must inevitably happen , in the State where a like faulty system of government is maintained . We think a careful examination of the irregularities and excesses of our politics will show that most of them have come from our disproportionate representation . The government of a republican country must represent the people , or the people will be dissatisfied . Those who have no voice in legislation , whose opinions are not heard or heeded , will be restive under authority . And it is not the minority only which suffers ; the majority suffers also from having no proper or sufficient check , and when at last the scale turns , the revulsion is violent and dangerous . If the antislavery minority could have been heard by its representatives from the beginning , increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the proslavery majority would have been benefited ; and who knows but the emancipation of the slaves might have been procured through peaceful legislation , at a cost in treasure , to say nothing of the cost in blood , of less than half the expenditure of the war ? With how much less friction would the machinery of government move , if all the parts were carefully adjusted ! Thus far we have looked at the matter in a party light ; but that by no means gives us all there is of it . The statutes which proceed from our legislative chambers are often the acts , not of parties or of party majorities , but of schemers and traffickers in legislation , to whom our present system gives scope . * ( 14 // Of the 1801 statutes passed by the Legislature of New York in the last two years , not a hundred were general , and of these scarce a tenth were passed upon party grounds . We have thus not only a misrepresentation of parties , with its tremendous consequences , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting our legislative halls into scenes of jobbery and intrigue . Under the false pretences of party , the elector is cheated or seduced into voting for one of two men , neither of whom he likes or would trust in the management of his private affairs . He is reduced to a choice of evils , and he makes it under the pressure of party discipline . We all know , that it is the custom for two conventions , supposing , as is generally the case , the division of the electors into two parties , to select each a candidate , and for the voter to choose between the two , or lose his vote altogether . This is the system in its best estate , which supposes the primary meetings to contain only the voters of the party , and the delegates to be fairly chosen , and these in their turn to discharge fairly their own duties of nominating candidates . Such is doubtless the fact in some districts of New York , and in some or perhaps all of Massachusetts . But since there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblies or nominating conventions , they are in other districts carried by fraud or violence , so that it may be said of not a few , that the scheme there established is for two bodies of incompetent or illintentioned men to put up each a man , and for the rest of the community to take their choice between these two . A system so vicious , can beget nothing but vice . The man who thus obtains a seat in a legislative chamber repays the fraudulent instruments of his elevation by defrauding for them , and represents not even the voters whose enforced ballots were cast in his favor , but knots or rings of speculators , office-seekers , and plunderers . It is tftne to look these evils in the face . The frauds of elections-the illegal voting and the false counting-have grown to be a scandal and a curse . But even these are less than the scandal and curse of legislative corruption . To betray any trust is disgraceful ; to betray a public trust is both a disgrace and a crime . No just man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch , forsaken of God and accursed of men , can falsify his convictions and give his vote for money or personal advantage . He to whom a father entrusts his daughter for protection , and who abuses his trust by corrupting her , is accounted a monster of depravity ; but his crime is less than that of the legislator , who , entrusted by his constituents with the great function of representing them in the making of laws , abuses that trust by selling , or bartering , or giving away his vote . And yet the miscreants who do this walk the streets , hold up their heads , look honest men in the face , and even get themselves returned from year to year . How does this happen ? The majority does not approve their conduct ; it must be a small minority which does . How then do they manage to gain and regain their seats ? They do it not by the free , unbiassed choice of the electors , but by the contrivances and tricks of our present system of local or district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have long bewailed these evils , but have failed to arrest them . We see no chance of doing so but through a better system of representation . The choice of bad men is , however , not the only evil of the system . The good men who find their way into our Legislatures are crippled by it . Their influence is weakened and their independence menaced . When one of them opposes a favorite scheme of the party managers of his district , he is sure to receive a warning as well as a remonstrance . Thus the representative and the constituent are both demoralized . These evils do not spring from a corrupt community . The majority of the people are not debauched . The fault lies in a vicious electoral system , which produces a representation neither of parties nor of the general public , which // constrains the majority , and stifles the voices of large portions of the people . The importance of representation , or rather the evil of nonrepresentation , is measured by the value of popular government . By leaving large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only lose the benefit of their counsel and cooperation , but we make them discontented . The fraud and falsehood of the system beget other frauds and falsehoods , and lower the moral tone of the whole community . The vast power and patronage of government often depend upon a few votes . Need we wonder that force and fraud should both be used to procure them ? Parties are themselves deceived by their preponderance in Legislatures , without considering how far it rests upon a like preponderance out of doors . The opinions and wishes of large portions of the people are disregarded . They see measures of great significance adopted which they disapprove , but are powerless to prevent , while they are nnable to procure a consideration of others which they think indispensable to the general good . If we can devise a remedy , if we can by any means procure an electoral system , by which the wishes of the whole people will be made known , and the votes of their real representatives taken , on all measures of legislation , we shall hnve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impending over it . Various plans have been proposed , of which we will now proceed to give an account . The problem is , how to procure a legislative body , which at the time of its election will faithfully represent the whole body of electors . The point to be gained is the giving to every elector a representative , so that when the Legislature meets the former may feel that he can point to some one on the floor , to whom he has given authority to speak and act for him , and that the latter may represent only the voters who hai*e given him their suffrages . In this country , as we have said al ready , the basis of representation is generally population , except in the federal Senate ; that is to say , the representatives are apportioned among the people in the ratio of their numbers . In the federal House of Representatives the ratio must be determined by population , instead of electors , because the States differ in the distribution of the suffrage , some admitting more persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States the representatives may be apportioned among the electors as easily as among the population . It does not matter , however , so far as the principle is concerned , whether we take the quota of population or of electors , since in either case we adhere to the quota . In this respect , the remedy we are seeking is more easily applied here than it can be in England , where corporate representation so largely obtains . The peculiarity of our system is , that when the quota is ascertained we assign it to given territorial limits , the effect of which is to disfranchise the minorities in the districts , whether the districts be single or plural , since we require each vote to be cast for all the representatives to be elected from the district , be they several or one . What we have to do is , to divorce the quota from the district , either by dispensing with the districts altogether , or by enlarging the districts to the limits of several quotas , and allowing the ballots to be divided , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elect a representative . Speculations on the subject were begun as early as the latter part of the last century . A bill for English parliamentary reform , introduced by the Duke of Richmond in the year 1780 , contained a clause looking to a representation of local minorities . In the former part of the present century a scheme having the same object was broached by the late Mr. Hill . In 1855 a plan , proposed by M. Androe , was introduced into the representative system of Denmark . In 1859 Mr. Hare published his great work on the election of representatives parliamentary and municipal . Since then the // subject has received much attention and given rise to many discussions in this country , and in England , France , Switzerland , Germany , Belgium , Sweden , and Australia . Mr. Hare 's scheme is one which , for the sake of distinction , may be called that of preferential voting . It ascertains the quota by dividing the whole number of voters by the whole number of representatives . Thus , if the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chosen 200 , the quota of voters to each representative would be 4,000 . Then the voter is to deposit at the polls a voting paper , on which he shall have placed , in the order of his preference , the names of the candidates , or of so many of them as he pleases . No vote is to be counted for more than one candidate ; any candidate receiving 4,000 votes is to be declared elected ; if the candidate first on a voting paper fails to obtain the quota , or has already obtained it , the vote descends to the next in order of preference ; when a candidate has obtained the quota , his votes up to that number are to be laid aside , and the remaining votes are to be counted for the candidate next in the order of pre .. ference , and so on till all the votes are appropriated , and the whole number of representatives is obtained . If there be not 200 persons credited each with 4,000 votes , and the representative body is consequently deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by taking the candidates who come nearest to the required quota . This method , which we have called that of preferential voting , is also called by the Swiss reformers that of the electoral quotient ( le quoti6nt electoral ) . A second plan is that of cumulative voting . The theory of this is , that a qnota being ascertained as before , each voter shall have as many votes as there are representatives to be elected ( either from the whole State , or from electoral districts less than the State , as may be determined ) , and shall be at liberty to cast them all for one candidate , or divide them among several , as he pleases . This plan has been proposed in Congress by Mr. Buckalew , of Pennsylvania , and in the Illinois State Convention by Mr. Medill and others . Its operation may be illustrated thus : Massachusetts has 10 representatives in the lower House of Congress ; each voter has 10 votes ; he may give them to 10 candidates , one to each , or he may cumulate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One tenth of the voters may so be sure of a representative , if they choose to unite upon one person . Thus , suppose the number of voters to be 200,000 , and each with 10 votes , making 2,000,000 votes in all , of which 200 ,  - -  000 shall be sufficient to elect . The friends of any one candidate might secure the concentration or cumulation of the 200,000 votes , east by 20,000 voters , and these would have a representative , though all the remaining votes were cast for one person . In practice , no doubt , tickets would be made up by the two parties , and each party would send representatives nearly proportionate to its constituency . A third plan is that of limited voting ; by which is to be understood that of requiring the votes to be cast for a less number of candidates than the whole . Thus , if the number of voters were 100 ,  - -  000 and the number of candidates to be elected from the State or district 10 , and each voter were allowed to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he that every 10,000 persons might have a representative , if they would . This plan is generally mentioned in connection with several candidates , sometimes in connection with single ones . For example : in what are called the threecornered districts of England , that is , the districts which send three members to Parliament , it has been provided that each voter shall vote only for two candidates . And in the late amendment to the Constitutiofi of New York , it is provided in respect to the first election of seven judges of the Court of Appeals , which election is by general ticket for the whole State , that each ticket shall contain the names of only five candi // PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . dates . Of course , there will be two tickets , each nominated by a party convention ; but the minority party will certainly elect two of the judges . The fourth plan is that of 8UbStitUt6 voting ; which permits candidates to cast anew the useless votes given to them , and substitute a third person in their place . A plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Philadelphia . Thus , supposing again the number of electors to be 100,000 and of representatives 10 , and 10,000 votes to be sufficient for election , and then supposing 6 candidates to have received each 15,000 , that is , 90,000 in all , and two others each 5,000 . Here are 30,000 surplus votes , cast for the elected candidates , and 10,000 insufficient votes , divided between two persons , so as to give neither of them enough to elect him ; the plan we are speaking of allows the ( three elected candidates to cast the 30 ,  - -  000 surplus votes , and the two defeated candidates to cast the 10,000 insufficient votes , for new candidates . These eight persons would then substitute four other persons as the candidates to receive the 40,000 votes , and would elect them , to serve with the six first elected . Theftftl&amp; plan is sometimes called that of proxy voting ; which permits every voter to give his vote or proxy to any person he pleases , and that person to represent him in therepresentative chamber if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electoral quota , and if he receives more than this sufficient number , then to cast additional votes in the chamber , proportionate to the number of proxies received . This is the plan put forth three years ago by the Personal Representation Society of New York . The sixth plan is that of list-voting , or what is called the free concurrence of lists , or the open list , a plan recommended by M. Naville of Geneva , as second in merit only to the plan of preferential voting . It supposes lists of ' candidates containing each the names of as many as . *there are representatives to be chosen , ranged in the order of preference , to be deposited with the proper authorities a certain time before the election and numbered . Each elector gives his vote for a particular list . The whole number of votes for that list is divided by the electoral quotient , and the result gives the number of candidates chosen on that list . For example : if there be 15 representatives to be elected , 15,000 voters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 votes , secures 5 representatives ; list B , receiving 4,000 votes , secures 4 representatives ; list C , receiving 3,000 votes , secures 3 representatives ; list D , receiving 2,000 votes , secures 2 representatives ; list E , receiving 1,000 votes , secures 1 representative . In case of a vacancy caused by death or resignation , election on more than one list , or other cause , the place is to be supplied by the candidate next in order . This plan would operate thus , in a State having 100,000 voters and 10 representatives in Congress to choose , and 3 parties with each a list , list A receiving 60,000 votes ; list B receiving 30,000 votes ; list C receiving 10,000 votes . The quota , or electoral quotient , being 10,000 , list A would be entitled to 6 representatives , list B to 3 , and list C to 1 . The 6 highest names on list A , the 3 highest on list B , and the 1 highest on list C , would then be chosen as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these different plans , in general terms , with very little detail ; but sufficient , we think , to show the principle on which each of them rests . They are not always presented in the form in which we have given them . Modifications , greater or less , have been suggested . But we think we have given the substance of all the plans which have been , proposed for the amendmen4 of the electoral system . All of them are large reforms ; but they are not alike in merit . That of preferential voting is theoretically the most perfect , and if faithfully executed would give the best representative chamber . It would compel a certain degree of deliberation before voting ; would insure to two or more parties proportional representation 718 // in the Legislature , and would insure a certain degree of non-partisan representation . Whether it would prove , as has been predicted , too complicated in its working aTmong a large constituency , can hardly be determined before actual experiment . We should fear that under it there would be opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each party its proper weight in legislation , it would leave much in the power of party managers . The proxy system would give the most complete representation . The objections to it are that there would be a loss of the deficient votes ; that is to say , the votes given for a candidate who could not concentrate upon himself sufficient to make a quota , would be thrown away , unless a transfer to other candidates were permitted . Preferential voting avoids both the objection of too great concentration of votes upon one person , and the loss of votes belowthe quota , since no candidate can have counted in his favor more than enough to elect him , and every vote will be counted , except the number less than a quota left after electing all of the required number of candidates . Other difficulties , however , might appear in the actual working of any of the plans which we do not now foresee . Indeed , though we are confident that any one of them would go far to purify our elections and our legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by actual experiment . Some of them may be best in a large constituency , and others in a small one . If we might choose which to begin with , and where to begin , we would try the plan of cumulative voting for lnembers of Congress in the State of Massachusetts , and that of limited voting for Aldermen in the City of New York , restricting in the latter case each voter to one candidate . The former might require concurrent legislation of Congress and of the General Court ; the latter , only an Act of the New York Legislature . In either case , the process would be simple enough . To begin with the Congressional election in Massachusetts , which sends 10 mem bers to the House of Representatives , and has about 200,000 voters . Every voter would give 10 votes , which he might scatter among 10 candidates , or cumulate them upon a less number , even upon one . The whole number of votes to be counted would be 2,000,000 . Parties are divided between the Republicans and Democrats in nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third to the latter , giving the Republicans about 134,000 voters and the Democrats about 66,000 , though the laP ter have not a single member of Congress . Each party would calculate its strength beforehand , and nominate as many candidates as it was confident of electing . If the Republicans were to nominate a full ticket of tan candidates , they could give each only 134,000 votes ; while the Democrats , if they nominated four candidates , could give each of them 165,000 votes . The result would be that the Republicans would nominate only 7or8candidates , andthe Democrats3 or 4 . There would also be an opportunity for any number of voters wherever obtained throughout the State , not less than 20,000 in all , to elect their own candidate , without regard to either party . If by any chance , a most improbable one , the votes should be cumu lated upon a less number of candidates than 10 , a new election would have to be ordered to supply the deficiency . Then in regard to the trial of limited voting for Aldermen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : supposing 15 Aldermen to be elected by general ticket , which is the scheme of the new charter just enacted by our Legislature , each voter should be limited to one candidate , and each ballot should have only one name upon it . There being about 150,000 voters in the city , every 10,000 of them , wherever residing and of whatever party , might have a representative in the chamber of Aldermen . If there should happen to be a large concentration of votes upon one person , that would not be a very great evil , since it could scarcely happen that there would not be candidates *ufficient to fill the board . If that very // improbable event should come to pass , a new election would supply the deliciency . In practice , parties would probably distribute their tickets about the city in such manner as not to waste their votes . That these changes would be great improvements upon our present system , we venture to think we have already shown . If irregularities or difficulties should appear in the practical working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any new scheme ,  --  they can be remedied afterward , as occasion offers . When once the theory of proportional representation is reduced to practice , and made familiar to the people , it will assert its superiority . If one of the methods of practical application is found imperfect , it will give way to another and better . All the plans which have been explained , are kindred in general theory and in purpose . Any of them would give to a minority party a representation proportional to its numbers ; and most of them would give to electors who are not partisans an opportunity of being heard and felt in representative halls . The elector would be independent of party in his choice of a candidate ; and the ' person elected without a party nomi nation would be beyond the domination of nominating conventions or party managers . Even these would be put upon their good behavior , by the knowledge that their favor was not essential to the success of any person ; and their candidates being placed in competition with men independently nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fitness . Any person who has the confidence of a quota of electors could be elected to represent them , whatever party , or partisan tool or master , might say . No bully of the primaries , no tempter of the lobby , no hound of party , would have dominion over him . We boast that a popular representative republican government is the best in the world . It has been already shown how far in practice we fall behind our theory . To this cause is due in no small degree the corruptions , gross and monstrous , which oppress us . We have saved the life of the nation in ite struggle with slavery *and rebellion . We have now to save it from another enemy more subtle and not less formidable , official and electoral corruption . There is no time to be lost . Let us begin at once .
