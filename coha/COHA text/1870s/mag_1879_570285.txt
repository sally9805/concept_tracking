ARTICLE V.-FJNAL PURPOSE IN NATURE . SINCE the days of Francis of Verula the doctrine of Final Purpose in Nature has fallen into comparative disrepute . Bacon 's far greater predecessor in philosophy , Aristotle , had , by the use of a method in many respects the same as that of Bacon himself established this doctrine as a fundamental principle in his philosophic system . The Fathers and the Schoolmen , following their Greek master , had given unquestioning acceptance to his principle for hundreds of years . But Bacon " saw the might of the world " in working or efficient causes , and seems even to have shared in the fanciful hope of the Middle Ages that there might be enticed out of these causes , if only they were sufficiently understood , some new creation as the work of man . The consummate flower of the new blooming in the garden of the physical sciences appeared , however , in the book *of Mr. Darwin upon the Origin of Species , first published in November , 1859 . Since then many , especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , or even settled in the conviction , that the entire conception of final purpose in nature has been forever banished to the region of dead philosophic myths or other products of senseless abstract thought . Probably this is one of those conceptions to which the most forward and confident of the German Materialists has referred as " strangled snakes " lying around the cradle of the young Hercules of modern science . The rejection of Aristotle 's great philosophic principle has taken two forms ; the one of indifference , the other of open contempt . The reasons given for the strong contempt with which the announcement of this principle is sometimes greeted , are found for the most part in the mistaken applications of it made by its too ardent or too ignorant advocates . Final purposes of many kinds have been announced as embodied everywhere in nature which , when the test of scientific examination has been made , have proved to be only crude whims or false conjectures embedded in the brains of the would-be discoverers. // Even the incomparable Greek fell into the error of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of cooling off and warming up the body . It is moreover alleged against the doctrine of final purpose in nature that it is generally used in such way as to control unduly investigations into the real facts and efficient causes of nature . When narrow minds become convinced from mere conjecture that this or that so-called natural contrivance is for such a purpose and no other , they are certain-especially if some theological or cherished metaphysical opinion be at stake  --  to cramp investigation as to how and by whaI* causes the object of such investigation came to be . Now as long as these charges are directed agaiust the improper uses of their doctrine which are made by some of its advocates , the sincere lover of the truth , whether scientist or theologian , has no motive to complain . The question arises , however , whether any of these charges are at all adequate to discredit in the least degree the doctrine itself . Mistakes in alleging final purposes in nature can be pointed out and corrected as can all similar mistakes . And if Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and real purpose of breathing in the economy of the animal , this does not at all affect the fact that we do now know the purpose of breathing to be the effecting of chemical changes in the air which enable the blood to receive oxygen and give off carbonic acid , and so the perpetuating of animal life . And furthermore , as many mistakes have perhaps been made in the matter of assigning the efficient causes which concur to produce any special organism , as in detecting the final purposes which the same organism serves . The entire so-called science of medicine is , so far as the causes of disease and the working power of remedies are concerned , in a lamentably insecure condition . Shall we therefore pour strong contempt upon all research or alleged discovery of efficient causes in therapeutics ? There would indeed be much more show of reason in such a course than in contemptuously refusing to say that the muscles and joints are designed for each other , and are together designed for moving the body , or that the heart is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many investigators in the physical sciences , when not the attitude of open contempt , is nevertheless one of indifference toward the doctrine of final purpose in nature . Science , say they , has nothing to do with this doctrine except to keep clear of its influence and correct its misapplications ; science deals only with the facts and the working causes out of which spring the facts . The answer to this argument from indifference is not difficult . We suppose that the scientist remains ever a man ; a rational animal is he even when employed in collecting and connoting facts as to other animals . Now in the discussion of the doctrine of final purpose in nature we begin with facts , the very facts with which so-called science deals as its peculiar possession . We proceed then by several steps to remoter and yet remoter inferences ; but in testing all these inferences we have ever to return to the facts themselves . The inferences at two or three steps remove , the student of the physical sciences is not indeed bound to make ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher or the theologian . But the student of the physical sciences is bound to see and acknowledge all his own facts ; and further , since he is still a man although also a scientist , he can not avoid taking the first step in a rational interpretation of facts . Indeed without giving phenomena a rational interpretation he can not treat them scientifically , whether his object be to discover laws and efficient causes , or final purposes . The anatomist does not take up his scalpel in order to cut out his own reason ; nor does the geologist break up the structure of his judgment when breaking down rock with his mallet . Assumed or enforced correspondence , in any respect or degree , to a condition of idiocy is surely no decided advantage for either scientist or theologian . The discovery of final purpose in nature is indeed always a matter of the rational interpretation of nature ; the final purpose is a somewhat seen in nature by a reasoning being , because he looks upon nature as a reasoning being is bound to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equally a rational work of inference ; so the discovery of orders of being , of general forces and laws . Moreover , so-called science is dependent upon the validity of the facts and doctrine of final purpose for its own development // and indeed for its very existence . Investigation is tracking out something ; and the tracks quite as often lie forward toward the goal as backward toward the starting-point . Without this guiding conception of final purpose even the physical sciences could make no progress whatever . Says the German master who may be quoted as both physiologist and philosopher : " The shunning of teleological conceptions , if it had been hitherto resolved upon , would have rendered impossible the advance of physiology to its present condition ; if it should now be carried into practice , it would introduce a complete and altogether useless subversion of anatomical and physiological views. *** It is indeed only as forms of thought in nature answer to forms of thought in mind that we can have any scientific knowledge of nature whatsoever . We may make bold to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature is simply an indisputable fact , and that to reject the corresponding doctrine is simply to refuse to acknowledge the undoubtedly real meaning of the very forms of nature with which science continually deals . Moreover , the numerous wonderful discoveries of modern scientific research , instead of bringing any real discredit upon the doctrine , in fact greatly enrich it . For fulness , beauty , and convincing power of illustration and argument , no other books ever written are at all comparable to certain recent ones which are saturated with the scientific atmosphere and its new forms of nutriment . Among the greater German authors , Trendelenburg , ijlrici , Lotze , and even ( or so far as wealth of illustration goes , especially ) Hartmann , have illumined the ancient principle with lamps taken from the hands of the modern physical sciences . We can not expect that any author will ultimately increase his valid claim to interpret nature scientifically , by following some of the more prominent English names in the refusal to acknowledge both the facts of final purpose and their obvious significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloaming at the house door , we shall not frighten it away by shutting our eyes and uttering a prolonged canine howl ; if our eyes are opened they may discover , the form in the gloaming is not that of the supposed thief , but no other than that of the master of the house . * Lotze , Atigemeine Phyeiologie , Leipzig , 1851 , p. 50 f. // The ract that the final purpose is found in nature we will now illustrate by the detailed examination of a single example ; and speaking of open eyes shall bring us at once to the chosen example . The more usual method of illustrating this principle in Articles current in our leading Reviews , has , been to accumulate a considerable number of examples taken from the more curious and unfamiliar contrivances of animal life , and then leave them to make , unaided by analysis , whatever impression they prove able to make upon the mind of the average reader . We much prefer , however , a different method , viz : the complete presentation and more thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere given form and bodily shape in the contrivances of nature , one example may be made to serve the purpose better than a thousand . And the very fact that the example chosen has been so often made to do duty in discussing the philosophical principle , is favorable to its further efficient use . The science of Optics and of Vision is become , however , within these last few years , almost wholly new ; in its new form it brings more abundant and convincing proof of the ancient doctrine of final purpose as exhibited in the structure of the human eye . Certainly the popular belief does not hold it doubtful that the eye is in its construction an expression of thought and final purpose , and that its most evident and immediate final purpose is to serve the body as an organ of vision . This belief holds that the eye is designed for seeing . But only the most intricate and manifold scientific researches can , after years of closest observation , describe in detail how this wondrous little orb called " the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent orb called " the eye of day . " The eye is the most complex organ of the special senses ; as such it illustrates better than any other the declaration of Trendelenburg : " Without thought in the ground of things the organic can not exist . " The evidence of final purpose in the eye may be arranged in groups or systems of contrivances . We have first the system of contrivances found in the nerves of the eye . The optic nerve is the only kind of nervous fibre which is capable of conveying to the brain sensations of light ; it // responds , however , to all excitations only with sensations of light . It is the nerve of the power of vision ; and although no difference in structure between it and other nervous fibre can be detected by the microscope , we know that this nerve is entirely unique in the economy of the animal . Entering the eyeball it spreads out into an exceedingly minute net-work of nerves known as the retina , which is the sensitive plate in the photographic instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple net-work of fibres from the expanded optic nerve ; it consists of several layers of transparent nervous matter-cells , fibres , and granules-each layer of strange complex construction , and all taken together forming a very special arrangement for receiving impressions of light . At the back of the retina are the so-called rods and cones-closely packed ends of nerve matter bearing the shape indicated by these words-which are so minute and numerous that it is supposed one exists in each case of vision for every visible point in the object whose image falls upon the retina . It is on these rods and cones that the motion of the waves of light becomes translated into an entirely different kind of motion in the nervous matter of the organ . Besides this unique and complicated nervous system connected with the special sense of vision , the eye has nerves of motion connected with its muscles , nerves by the sensations in which the various judgments of the mind are determined in connection with the movement of the muscles , nerves connect* ing together the two eyes , and nerves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of the eye , if we may regard that system as a whole , provisions for preserving the eye , for enabling the mind by use of the eye to judge of distance , direction , and the third dimension of bodies , and-by far most wonderful of all-provisions for translating the motions of waves in ether into the special sensations which we call those of color and light . But all these contrivances could give us at most only sparks and shimmerings of light . We must , however , take in objects which lie outside of us and are lighted and colored , if sight is to occur . There is , therefore , in the eye a system of arrangements designed to transmit light and color and to bring the rays to a focus at the right point within the eye . // In order to transmit light to the retina it is of course necessary that a large part of the eye should be transparent ; and this need is provided for in the structure of the eye . No blood vessels large enough to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most clearly transparent portions of the eye ; but the white corpuscles of the blood are conveyed through those portions , and the process known as endosmose and exosmose is invoked in aid of the desired end . Moreover , the most sensitive part of the retina , the part needed for clear vision , has an amazingly minute distribution of the blood-vessels in order that its sensitiveness may not be impaired . But the use of a most complicated system of means is again necessary in order through these transparent media to introduce into the eye a clear , correct , and achromatic image of the external object . For the final purpose of vision , three lensesthe cornea , the aqueous humor , and the crystalline lens-lying back each of the other in the order named , and each one of different refracting power , are skilfully employed by the architect of the eye . The refracting power of these lenses is so related , each to the other and all together to the medium in which the animal lives ( in our case of course the atmosphere ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . The cornea bends at a certain definite angle the ray which enters it from the air ; this angle depends upon a constant relation between the construction of the cornea and the composition of the atmosphere . The aqueous humor also receives the ray at a definite angle and refracts it in accordance with the relation which exists between its own structure and that of the cornea . Finally the crystalline lens receives and so directs the same ray that it comes to its focus with other rays at just the right point in the eye . In the perfect and healthy eye all these contrivances are secured and result in the final purpose of clear vision . Another problem which must be solved in order to secure the final purpose of the eye , is achromatic vision . For , as every body knows , the different colors in a ray of white light are separated , being unequally refracted , on passing through a lcns . They must , then , be united again in order to clear and correct vision . This can be done only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers are precisely so related as to accomplish the desired end . So difficult is the first solution of this problem of the achromatic transmission of light . through several lenses , that Newton denied that any solution could be reached ; but Euler on the contrary referred for the possibility of solving the problem to the human eye which in fact possesses such an achromatic arrangement ; and at present achromatic glasses are discovered and in use . That partition between the aqueous humor and the crystalline lens which is known as the iris , and its aperture for admitting light , together with the concentric and radiating muscular fibres by which this aperture is diminished and increased in size , are also necessary arrangements for clear vision . The iris like the eye-piece of a telescope , shuts off such rays as otherwise falling in upon the outer surfaces of the crystalline lens would become wandering rays , and so obscure vision . Back of the lenses is found also the other part necessary for the construction of a camera ol3scura , namely , the screen , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also of the black coating ( pigmeritum nigrum ) of the choroid . This black coating absorbs the fugitive rays and prevents their obscuring the vision by being reflected from side to side in the chamber of the eye . All this complicated arrangement of transparent and lens-like structure designed for bringing the achromatic rays to a focus in the eye , and the arrangements for cutting off or absorbing unnecessary and fugitive rays , are manifestly instances of final purpose in the structure of the eye . Thus far we have examined apparatus which , although very complex , is adapted only for perceiving shaded and colored surfaces ; and , as the well-known case of Cheselden and other similar cases seem to indicate , surfaces which appear at our first experiences of vision to be in immediate contact with the eye . But the objective world is a world of distances and solids , of objects contiguous or widely separated in space and variously related to each other by position and motion . How shall the eye be so constructed as to perceive through vision the varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question introduces us to the so-called system of // accommodation in the eye and in its accompanying muscles . Only a definite amount of light is needed for each act of clear vision ; the iris , therefore , dilates in the increasing darkness and expands on coming again into more light . The range of vision in the normally constructed eye is from between two and three inches to infinity . Bat to see objects at all the distances between requires a rapid and accnrate adjustment in the convexity of the lens ; this adjustment is accomplished by the ciliary muscle which forms a kind of belt of muscular tissue around the front region of the eye . The action of this muscle and the accompanying sensations aid the mind in making accurate judgments of distance and size . Six muscles attached to the outer surface of the eye , and to its bony socket , move it in various directions ; up and down , in and out , and in rotary fashion upon its front-to-back axis . By their use the power of vision and judgment through vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the part upon which the image must be brought in order to the clearest vision , can thus be made to coincide with the whole object or with any desired part of it ; and by bringing the most delicately receptive part of the organ to correspond with the brightest part of the object , the utmost clearness of inspection can be attained . Through the muscles and nerves of motion we also make many of our most needful discoveries and distinctions with the eye . For example , if the eye has the sense of rest and an image moves over the retina , we judge that the motion is in the external object , but if the eye has the sense of being moved we may conclude that the external object is at rest ; yet again , we may deceive ourselves by moving the eyeball with the finger up and down , when , missing the sensation in the muscles usual in such cases , the eye concludes falsely that the motion is in the ez*ternal object . Furthermore , all these muscles are themselves examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in man specially designed and adapted to serve a mind like that of man , and in a manner which will be more clearly indicated farther on . Another very curious system of contrivances in the eye is made up of the means used to preserve the organ in its best // condition . Surrounded by a bony socket it has a fleshy curtain which , upon intimation of danger , instinctively and quick as the winking of an eye drops down over the tender ball . Winkt ers and lashes furnish further protection . Salt water is constantly distributed over the exposed surfaces , being furnished from a number of glands and ducts . This water , which we call tears when it becomes through excitation of emotion excessive in quantity , is exactly fitted to moisten and clarify the transparent cornea . The " salte teres " of which our early English poet sings , are j ust as salt as they should be and no salter ; were they salter than they are they would absorb moisture from the surrounding tissues , were they less salt they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps them from a sack into which they collect , over the surface of the eye . The only fault to be found with such a contrivance is that the duct by which this sack empties itself into the nasal passages is difficult of access to the oculist . The oculist who complained to the writer of this fault , did not indeed seem quite certain that its final purpose is to make oculists more careful and skillful . But he did declare that one of the things which operators most dread , is giving injury to the tear apparatus ; so delicate and exposed is it , and yet so necessary to the welfare of the eye . Each lid is also provided with a score or more of tree-like glands which secrete an oil ; the object of the oil is to prevent the lids from adhering and to make a gutter along the eye-lid for the tears . Now the combination of as many as six different principles to form an available instrument even for the coarsest uses , has justly been reckoned a clear proof of final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrivances , each of which is necessary to clear vision and all of which are united in the eye . But when we have spoken of six or even thirteen different contrivances we have not begun to estimate the intricacy of the means employed to solve the problem of clear vision . We have been considering groups or systems of contrivances . Each system is made up of several individual instruments ; each individual contrivance affords a number of examples of final purpose . The nervous structure of the eye * Philosophie des Unbewitssten . Berlin , 15*i6 , vol. i. pp. 42 if . // shows at fewest these contrivances : a contrivance for isolating and transmitting sensations of light ; a very complicated set of contrivances for receiving as a sensitive plate , the impressions of color and light , and then translating them into motions of nervous matter ; contrivances for moving the eye and for judging size and distance by sensations of motion ; contrivances for making the eyes act together in binocular vision . Each of these contrivances is itself a complex system . In like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proof of final purpose inasmuch as it is a lens , but manifoldly more proof as soon as we regard it as fixed in its own place within the system of lenses . We might thus analyze each of the other groups of contrivances . Here , then , are wheels within wheels and wheels within those wheels , yet all filled with a living spirit and moving toward one end . Every particle of living matter which enters into the composition of the eye , yes , even every chemical atom , as well as all the most complex systems of contrivances into which all the atoms enter as contributing particles , does its workfor one final purpose . That final purpose is clear vision . We have scores of various parts , each one displaying the imprint of thought , and millions of atoms working forward harmoniously toward a goal . If we can not use Trendelenburg 's declaration that thought lies at the ground of organisms , with regard to the eye , we have no means for affirmIng anything whatsoever regarding nature . Thus far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of mechanism confined to the socket and its contiguous muscles and nerves . But the eye has numberless relations of a kind external to itself . Only as it is adapted to exist in these relations can it fulfill its final purpose . Some of these relations are outward and downward . The eye , like every other organism , stands in close relation to all the mechanical , chemical , and vital forces and laws ; in this regard it shows no special marks of final purpose , but only displays those which are common to it with every other organism . It has , however , its own special and most wonderful relations . The eye of man is obviously designed to act with perfection only in the air ; its action in clear vision is dependent upon the relation of the angle of refraction in the air to the angles of refraction made by its // lenses . Tts means for protecting and lubricating itself are also adapted for use in the air . The membrana nictitans is wanting in man . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for use in a medium of the refracting power of water . Yet each human eye was formed while hidden away from the atmosphere and after the breezes of heaven had been moving over the earth 's surface for thousands of years . The eye is also obviously adapted for use in a world of light and color ; it is , therefore , variously related to the sun as the source of light , to the nature of the waves of light , to the laws of the refraction and reflection of light , and to the whole science of prismatic colors . It is made for use in a world where the sun shines and where its objects are lighted and colored , as they are all about us . Yet each human eye was not only formed in the darkness , but nearly up to the time of its owner 's birth was so penetrated with large blood-vessels as to be incapable of vision . Then , as for countless ages preceding , the sun was shining some ninety million miles distant ; rays of light were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors were reflected in many and changeful hues from thousands of surrounding objects . But as yet the forming eye was in the darkness , though forming as designed subsequently to be used in a world of light and color . It is also plain that the eye of man is designed for use in connection with his other bodily Qrgans . Steady and coordinate motion of the body is dependent upon the eye . The eye is made to guide the legs when we walk , and to guide the hands in all their varied uses . If the muscles whose use is needed for forming judgments of position and distance are injured , perfect locomotion is impossible : the blind feel feebly after what they want , and can never walk with free , erect step . But this organ of vision is also designed to be used in relations which reach inward and upward from itself . Its final purpose is to be the organ of the human mind . Seeing without the mind is not real seeing . The eye is in the totality of its structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as are its separate parts with one another . All real seeing is accompanied with comparison and // judgment ; we can not indeed really see without using this mental faculty . Living in a world of solid objects and dealing constantly with them in sight , we really see them only as the mind judges of light and shadow and compares these impressions with those of touch . Comparing muscular sensations with one another the mind judges of direction and distance , and so sees objects in their real places . By comparing one point with another and by tracing out lines upon the retina , the mind comes to clear notions of form and relations in space ; by this kind of seeing which is not all in the eye , we largely build up the science of geometry . Not eye alone , or mind alone , could accomplish this result . It is the organ fulfilling its final purpose to serve as the instrument of the mind , which must be taken into every more complete account of the whole act of perfect vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the retina and the muscles and the lenses are , however , constructed so as to furnish the materials of judgment and comparison in the physical eye-under the mind 's eye . Attention to objects of vision is also the result of this designed relation between mind and eye . It is the mind which gives attention in vision , as the following curious observations will show . If we look intently for some time upon any light object and then close the eyes , a counterfeit image of the object will remain for a moment upon the retina , although it rapidly undergoes a change of color . An object at first white , becomes in time blue-green , blue , violet , purple , and red . Helmholtz observed this singular fact that , when the counterfeit image is very clearly marked , we can under favorable circumstances observe , even after closing the eyes , peculiarities in the object which before had been entirely overlooked . The eyes are indeed closed and the physiological phenomenon is complete ; but the mind is looking over more carefully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such as is designed to favor attention ; so also the power to adjust the most sensitive part of the retina to the object . Both our physiological and our mental construction are , therefore , designed to work together in attending to the objects which we wish clearly to see . // The mind also corrects many false impressions of the organ : this correction is necessary in order to clear vision . The two images in the two eyes are perceived as one by the mind . The eye is constructed so as to occasion the correction ; for the same visible point in the object falls upon exactly corresponding points in the retina of the two eyes . The intensity of the two images in the two eyes must also correspond ; otherwise two images may be seen . But it is the mind which after all makes the correction . One part of the retina , moreover , is not sensitive to light and is called " the blind spot . " Most persons know nothing of its existence ; its discovery by science even is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn through this blind spot , no break in it occurs ; this is because the mind fills out the line by a sort of instinctive assumption . Instances of the final purpose of the eye in relation to the mind which uses it , might be indefinitely multiplied . We can scarcely do less than adopt the opinion of Yolkmann , when in his Pkys*ological Inve.9tigations in the doqnain of Optics* he declares : " the soul has not received the image of a body from the eyes , but has constructed it out of an extensive and varied material derived from sensuous sources , with an activity of its own . " In examining nature for proofs of final purpose we have thus far confined our narrative to the one illustration of the eye . And yet we have found ourselves unable to do more than hint at a few of the manifestations of design which this one organ affords . It does not accord with our plan to multiply instances ; one such instance as the eye is for this plan even more than enough . Everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same pervasive fact and law of final purpose . In individual cases the proofs may be sometimes clearer , sometimes more doubtful ; they may even seem for the present to be almost wholly wanting . But on the contemplation of certain curious physical contrivances , the healthy and unprejudiced mind is as thoroughly persuaded that all things are for some purpose as that everything has some efficient cause . We * Pfrysiotogische Unterauchungen im ( Jebiet der CYptik , Leipzig , 1864 , ii 266. // do not need to range the universe over as llartmann has done , in order to come to this persuasion ; to do this under his guidance is , however , helpful study for illustrating and strengthening our persuasion . From the curious mechanism of the insect-trapping plants to the play of the higher spiritual faculties of man , this idea of final purpose dominates and is found everywhere illustrated . Concerning these illustrations in general we now make the following observations . And first a word as to instinct in general . The word and notion of instinct has sometimes been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctrine of final purpose . But as llartmann declares , " instinct rests upon the conception of final purpose . " Whenever we use the word " instinct " to signify anything more than a mere title of our ignorance , we have to include under it the notion of final purpose . And further upon a similar subject of remark ; the vis medicatr*x natura3 or healing power in nature , forms a most noteworthy example of double recognition given to the law of final purpose . Wounds heal , and in the lower animals lost organs are replaced , in order that the unity of the organism may be preserved . The placing of the power to heal within the organism is an instance of final purpose ; the actual use of the power can be explained only as a higher kind of recognition given to the great idea of final purpose . The idea which controls this healing act is that the parts are for the whole , and that the life and safety of the whole depend upon the concurrent working of the parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of final purpose . We must remember , however , that haste in pronouncing upon final purposes is as dangerous as in declaring the discovery of efficient causes . The facts determine what things are for , as well as how they came into being . Besides , in every product many final purposes are served ; just as in every product many causes are involved . The final purposes may rise one above another or run one into another until lost to view . The transparency of the lens is in order to transmit light ; the lens is in order to bring the rays to a focus in the eye ; the eye is for seeing ; the seeing is for the welfare of the whole organism of the // individual ; the individual is for its own perfection and for the propagation and welfare of the race . Nor must we so handle the doctrine of final purpose as to control or cramp unduly the investigation of causes . The doctrine of final purpose in nature enquires , for what end is this so-called natural contrivance ? research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what material and forces did this contrivance come into being ? The one looks for ends , the other upon means . The efficient causes are means to carry out the ends of the final purposes . Both bring us down upon the great philosophic principle that thought and will combined are the ground of the umverse . The existence of final purpose in nature is an indisputable and widely distributed fact . Of all the ideal elements in constructing the universe , this , as Lotze has said , lies nearest to the daily observations of science . To shut our eyes to the facts does not destroy them ; to be afraid of them or of the inferences from them is ridiculous . It is the work of science to acknowledge the fact of prevalent final purpose , and in the light of this acknowledgment to discover and present the specific final purposes of all its objects as well as the means by which these final purposes are accomplished . We cart excuse the natural sciences from making remoter inferences ; we can not excuse them from observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant facts . The present attitude , then , of some of our scientists towards the doctrine of final purpose in nature , is rather childish and justly liable to suspicion of prejudice . Says one of the greatest of living physiologists : * " The bare name of final purposes has become a bugbear for our present physiology . " The passion with which it is persecuted he justly entitles " senseless . " " It is a foolish tediousness , " he goes on to say , " to resist every effort to make valid the conception of final purpose in the domain of life ; " without the presupposition of adaptations to final purpose he declares that investigation would be an impossibility . The final purpose of the eye is indefinitely plainer to science than are the causes which constructed it . Its whole mechanism is constructed for seeing ; but no amount of research * Lotze , Aligemeine Physlologie , pp. 49 and 51. // has begun to set in order the complexity of natural causes which produced it . The more complex these causes are seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the existence of that thought which directs their combination for the purpose of vision . The doctrine of final purpose in nature can not , then , be shaken . It is substantially the same now that it was in the days of Aristotle ; it is , however , beyond measure enriched in illustrative material through the discovery of the physical sciences . We turn now to make a few of those remoter inferences from this great fact , to which reference has already been made . What is the meaning and the account of these facts observed everywhere in nature ? The true first meaning of the facts can not easily be mistaken ; their whole account is of course difficult , if not impossible to give . The meaning of such facts as are seen in the construction of the human eye , briefly stated , is That nature is grounded upon thought and will , that all its forms bear the impress of thought , that so-called physical forces and laws , and so-called material atoms , are everywhere used by thought as means toward ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . We can not now controvert in detail the several false and misleading views sometimes taken of these facts in nature . To find the meaning of the facts in chance , is simply to refuse to explain them at all , and , nevertheless , to make one 's self absurd in an alleged attempt at explanation . Chance , by the very nature of the conception , is debarred from explaining anything . To say that the atoms and forces concerned in the eye come together by chance , is to say we do not know how or why they come together . We all , when unprejudiced , instinctively feel the absurdity of such attempts at explanation ; we all instinctively prefer the view which sees thought and will working out final purpose . llartmann has attempted to construct this absurdity in mathematical terms. * He concludes that according to the doctrine of probabilities there is just about one chance and a half in ten million , upon a fair estimate , that the thirteen special contrivances which he finds in the eye may be combined * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without final purpose . But each of his thirteen special contrivances contains many instances of final purpose . Minuter estimates would diminish even this small chance of accounting for the eye by chance , to the infinitely small . Nor is there much less absurdity in speaking of " self-moved and self-posited atoms , " a thing which even Mr. Tyndall has been known to do . Such atoms are an absurdity , as DuBois Raymond admits . In using this language of Prof. Tyndall , the mind simply distributes the power and thought conceived as necessary to account for the fact of final purpose , amongst countless atoms , and then conceives them as agreeing to propel themselves together into organic forms . This is surely a camel to swallow even for a mind that feels itself called upon to strain out the gnat of one thought and one will , which is the source of all these final purposes . What then is the further interpretation of those facts which lead us to see all nature penetrated with this final purpose ? In answer we need do little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean by the term , a final pur-pose ? We have expressed in this term an ideal or mental form of viewing nature . All the facts of nature must be viewed , and are rightly viewed , under ideal forms . Force and law and genera , efficient causes and final purposes , are such forms . They are man 's way of seeing nature ; they are true ways because nature really is so and is so to be seen by reason 's eye . This last statement it is the task of constructive philosophy to establish . The mechanical , the dynamical , and the ideal modes of explaining the universe , must all be employed in order to understand it . We view nature in all these forms because we are rational , and because nature presents to our view all these forms . Final purpose always and in its very conception , involves both thought and will . In forming and executing final purposes our own course is the subject of clear experience , and is as follows . The final purpose may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the building of a house is the forming of the idea of the house , as it is to be built , in the builder 's mind ; the idea may be made more nearly perfect in // details by the plans of an architect , or it may perfect itself as the material is being put together into the material house . The idea of the house precedes and controls the material construction . With the idea goes the will , the purpose to build , and to build such a house as is called for by the idea . The conception of the materials to be used as means and the definite purpose that they shall be used , now follow . Then the actual employment of the materials-stone , brick , iron , wood , laborresults in the actualizing of the original idea . The house is in existence as the final result . In this entire process , these elements are to be noted ; the idea of the whole , the will to execute the idea , the conception of the parts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the actual use of the means , and the whole actually realized as the result of the plan . In other words , thought and will precede in the building of the house ; by use of the necessary means they realize themselves in the material building . The idea is first and controlling ; the stone and other material , the labor , and even the laws of matter and mind involved in the structure , are used as means and combined as elements in order to put into execution the idea . The reverse process is occasioned when we study the efficient causes of the building as it already appears materially constructed . We begin with the house which is actually existent in wood , iron , brick , and stone . We inquire what is that complex whole of materials and forces which we call the cause of the house ? Wood , iron , brick , stone , human labor , and all the forces-mechanical , chemical , and vital-which enter into the result , are enumerated as the cause . But is our enumeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we have also taken account of the thought and will of the architect , the co*irdinating cause the cause which combined the materials and forces as subordinate causes , the final purpose which in execution became a final cause . Let us briefly analyze , following Trendelenburg , another example to illustrate the meaning of final purpose . The problem before me is to draw a tangent at a given point to a circle of a given size . The idea of the result  --  the work as an idea-is the first condition for the solution of the problem . // The final purpose to realize this idea of a tangent to the given circle uses the means for its execution , and moves forward toward its goal . I take the crayon , tie on the string , and stand before the blackboard . The total problem in idea shows at once a subordinate problem , which must be solved as a first step . A circle of the given size is to be drawn . This is easily done ; then follows the drawing of a radius to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem now emerges , for a perpendicular must be drawn to this radius ; this done by means already known , the problem stands solved by use of material and laws of construction and motion . If , however , I come upon the problem already solved , what am I to say of its total cause ? I may enumerate the wood and paint of the blackboard , the string and crayon , the construction of the hand which uses them , the mechanical , chemical , and vital forces used in the drawing . What still remains ? The superior and dominant element in the whole problem as it stands solved before me , still remains . The thought and will which were combined in the final purpose , and which stand out in the problem as plainly as the white particles of chalk upon their black ground , must also be taken into account . These are indeed instances of final purpose drawn from human experiences . The manifestations of final purpose in nature differ from these examples in form of manifestation ; but essentially and in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature we have no direct consciousness of thought and will , preceding and set over against the causes which are used as means to the end . In our own final purposes we have , each one within himself , this consciousness . In the case of others we infer this preceding thought and will as an essential element of the final purposes , the proofs of which we see in the works of others . In nature , thought and will appear manifested in the organism ; but they are not the organism , they are manifested in it . We too , however , have an experience which illustrates somewhat more clearly the case of nature . We manifest our final purposes not indeed in the construction , but in the use of our own organism . The seeing of the mind as already described , is in such close union with the material organs of seeing , that we are forced to speak of the mind as though it were in the organ when it uses the // organ . The extended surface of the retina is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retina uses it for seeing color , light , and relations in space . In solving the geometrical problem , the string and chalk and board are tools wholly external to me , both mind and organs . My organs , however , are so closely united to my mind that my mind manifests its final purposes only in them . Still are the thought and willing of the mind the essential elements of that final purpose which is manifested in and carried out through the organism . The closeness of relation which exists between the final purpose and its own means of execution , does not change the essential nature of the final purpose . Space makes no difference with the idea . My final purpose to adapt my eye for seeing and comparing two objects lying side by side exactly two and ninety-nine one-hundredths inches from the cornea 's external surface , is essentially the same as that to build a house in China . Thought and will combined and working toward a goal belong to final purpose in nature . Nor does great multiplicity or subtlety of efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of final purpose . The more numerous and independent the causes which are combined , the more complete is the proof of the idea and energy which combined them . According to the doctrine of chances , there is less and less probability of chance as the number of combinations increases . Every organism is the result of countless efficient causes , but no enumeration of them can do otherwise than make more pressing the inquiry after the final purpose of the organism . Nor does the lapse of long time daring which the means for reaching the goal are in use , nor a countless series of secondary causes , change the essential nature of final purpose . The idea thus carried out into execution may be all the grander . The thought and will which use through long stretches of time , wisely and unswervingly , the necessary means for realizing the final purpose , are for that reason all the more admirable . It is the largest final purpose which requires most time and most numerous means to realize itself . The meaning of final purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ udiced mind clearly apparent . Such facts as are held before us by the construction of the eye , by all organism indeed , and by the urnverse // as an orderly whole , prove a principle underlying all the forms of nature . Thought and will , combining and using efficient causes as means to secure results , are everywhere manifested . We may sum up these inferences from the facts of final purpose in nature by noting the following points : In final purpose the whole as an idea precedes and controls the execution of the parts . The thought and plan to secure the whole is first ; the parts are planned and executed in reference to the whole . All the parts , moreover , can be understood only in reference to the whole of which they are parts . All the details are illumined only in the light of the complete idea . In final purpose thought combined with will precedes and forms the principle of the whole process . The thought of the perfect eye with its final purpose of perfect vision , is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embryo or of the diseased adult . Everything about the eye is to be understood only in the light of its idea . In considering final purposes our thought shows itself as overleaping time in unique and marvellous fashion . In tracing the causes of any product we desire to go step by step backward , never leaving out any links in the endless chain . In inquiries into final purpose we leap at once forward to the final result as an ideal whole , though its realization may be countless years and even ages removed . The distant goal is reached by one bound in thought ; and then the mind returns from this ideal future to understand better the present facts in the light of the great idea which it has brought back . Every seed contains within itself certain refined material for the protection and nourishment of the germ when it shall grow , certain forces also of mechanical , chemical , and vital sort . But no seed is comprehensible to the human mind until the final purpose of its construction is brought to light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what end it is constructed . The idea of the perfect plant must be brought from the ideal future of the seed to shine upon its present construction . Final purposes are never accounted for by simply enumerating efficient causes ; unless we reckon thought , stimulating energy and combining these forces , into our problem , we can never even approach its solution . The facts of design and adaptation in nature are proofs of a principle underlying all // nature . Thought and will are at the ground of things ; for the facts are clear and numerous enough to prove the principle . In this truth that thought and will combine to express and realize themselves by use of means toward their end , do we find the meaning of final purpose in nature . With a few last words we take another step to a remoter inference . As we have already said , manifold final purposes are more or less clearly manifest in many single organisms of nature ; just as manifold material and forces are seen combining in every effect . The way , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak above peak till we are weary of climbing with the staff of logic . Yet every instance of final purpose in nature is a proof that thought and will is present with us-here and now . The thought is therein manifest , the will is therein expressed-face to face with us . When we look widely over nature we discern a unity of materials and forces in this infinite combination of them under varied types and forms . We discern also , though only dimly , a unity of final purposes . This first is made for that second , and that second may also be made for the first ; both first and second may be made for a third something-we know not what . Some things we count higher in the scale of being than are others ; a man than a monad , a thought than a mechanical force . We seem to trace an advance in the forms taken by matter and physical forces ; they seem to be going forward toward some goal . Means and ends in nature are complicated , involved , involuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes we know not whence , and-why we know not - goes we know not whither . But this conclusion is mostly drawn in those moments of melancholy such as came over Mr. Tyndall when he wrote his Belfast address , and consigned him . self and everything else ultimately to the azure of the past . The spectacle of the grand whole moving forward to its grand and distant goal , in better moments rouses and nourishes *rithin us the larger hope . Nor are we left in condition of mere unevidenced hope . We have not a few clear proofs that all things are bound together in unity of thought and force ; that the universe is moving according to underlying , absolute thought , and under the impress of interpenetrating , absolute will-forward toward a goal . // The claw of the tiger is enough to class him amongst the flesh-eating animals . As Cuvier showed , his whole construction , not only in paw and shoulder , muscles and blade , in tooth and jaw and eye , but also in the internal organs of nutrition , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , the evidence shows , is not in the animal part of him , but is in mind and morals , in character and spirit . So may we reason from history , that the final purpose of the entire race of men is in the highest and most spiritual development of the race . And then there may be final purposes still farther on . For the final purpose which is manifested to us in nature is never an isolated and closed one ; it is ever one of many , a segment from an infinite circle , a link in an infinite chain . We find , however , unity of force in the varied and number . less exhibitions of force . So do we find unity of thought in the varied and numberless manifestations of final purpose . The unity of forces leads us to the idea of One Absolute Will , the unity of thought to the idea of One Absolute Mind . If then there is only a first and second step from the clear and prevalent fact of final purpose in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only another step still to its grand conclusion . The first and second steps lead us to the inference that thought and will underlie nature ; the next step leads us to the inference that the thought arid will are the thought and will of the Absolute One . The grand conclusion from the fact of final purpose in nature is as to the being of God . The time is come to express our conclusion in the words of one , distinguished alike as a student of science and philosophy : " We are therefore satisfied to utter the conviction which has been indicated by the foregoing remarks , viz : that we surely recognize only one single principle for the universe , one single living idea , out of whose reality , though itself needing no deduction , springs the reality of all existence , out of whQse significant contents spring the forms of unfolding as well as the general laws which each particular effect obeys ; so that , finally , apart from this , there can neither exist any separate world of matter resting on itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * Lotze , Ailgemeine Physiologie , p. 59.
