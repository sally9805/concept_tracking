txt Rev. Mr. SEE , a Presbyterian minister of the City of Newark , is now undergoing an ecclesiastical trial for the alleged crime of permitting a woman to preach in his pulpit . Mr. SEE denies the charge , but admits the specifications thereof , and hence renders it rather difficult for us to decide whether he considers himself guilty or not . There was once au astute Western editor who , with the fear of a libel suit before his eyes , judiciously pronounced a murderer , who had been captured red-handed , a " probable fiend . " In like manner , it would perhaps , be safest to term Mr. SEE a probable criminal , and to thus avoid risking the opinion that a defendant who denies the charge against him but admits all its specifications is or is not a guilty man . The defense offered by the accused minister is interesting because of its novelty , and important because it establishes a new canon of Scriptural interpretation . He concedes that St. PAUL ordered that women should keep silence in the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found i His accusers reply that it is found in an Epistle to the Corinthians ; whereupon Mr. SEE takes the impregnable ground that Newarkians are not Corinthians , and hence argues that what St. PAUL may have said to the latter does not necessarily concern the former . He further asserts that in the Corinthian church of the period there was a variety of woman , now notoriously extinct , who was addicted to " babbling " and " gossiping . " This naturally failed to meet the views of St. PAUL , and he therefore directed that Corinthian women should neither babble nor gossip , or , in other words , that they should keep silent in the churches . It may seem incredible to people of the present day that there should ever have been persons , whether men or women , who either babbled or desired to babble in pulpits ; and it is unfortunate that science has not yet supported Mr. SEE 'S interpretation of Scripture by bringing , to light the organic remains of the extinct babbling woman . Still , there is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it affords a new pretext for delivering the modern Christian world from the somewhat stria regulations Or St. PAUL . The argument is susceptible of a very wide use . If what St .. PAUL said to the Corinthians is not binding upon the people of Newark , neither is what St. PAUL , or any contemporary saint , may have said to the people of other Asiatic or European cities . Mr. SEE and the members of his Newark congregation are not Galatians , nor Thessalonians of the first or second variety , nor yet Hebrews , Colossians , Romaus , - or Ephesians . They have , consequently , nothing whatever to ? do with the rules which St. PAUL laid down for the guidance of those ancient communities , and can thus amaucioate themselves from the burden of nearly one-half of the New Testament . Moreover , Mr. SEE 'S most mendacious enemy will not go so far as to assert that he is either TITUS , or PHILEMON , or first or second TIMOTHY . It may be all very well to read as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , but , according to Mr. SEE 'S theory , it would be extremely unjust to expect him to hunt up the cloak that St. PAUL loft at Troas , or to take a little wine , instead of the local apple-jack , for his stomach 's sake , merely because TIMOTHY was told to do those things . By rigidly applying this new rule of interpretation to the New Testament , Mr. SEE will find that only the Gospels , the Acts , the Apocalypse , and the General Epistles have any authority in Newark , while the Old Testament , being unquestionably addressed to the Jews , is of importance only to such Newarkians as are engaged in the retail clothing business . Having thus refused to admit the jurisdiction of St. PAUL in Newark unless it can first be shown that he has written an especial epistle to the Newarkians , Mr. SEE might easily have rested his case . Ho had , however , two other new and powerful arguments , He quoted a passage in Acts in which it is said that " your sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that to prophesy is the same thing as to preach , and secondly , that the passage in question is a command to women to indulge in that exercise . It would , perhaps , have been better if Mr. SEE had demonstrated the truth of his assertion that prophesying and preaching are synonymous . Still , we ought , doubtless , to accept the unsupported assertions of so skillful a master of exegesis , without a skeptical murmur . It is , however , reasonably certain that Mr. SEE 'S opponents will insist upon calling his attention to the rest of the passage in Acts , which says " your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams . " If the daughters of Newark are really commanded to prophesy , the young men of that city are likewise under obligation to see visions , and the old gentlemen to dream dreams . Very probably Mr. SEE has the courage of his opinions , and will promptly detail half a dozen of the young men of his congregation to see immediate and miscellaneous visions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with head-rests , and request them to proceed to dream with such vigor as their years may permit . Finally , this fearless and fertile logician clinched the argument for his defense by asserting that he regarded a pulpit as " no more sacred than a barrel on a sidewalk . " If we correctly conceive the full meaning of this assertion , it is a plea of confession and aviodance . Even if the Scriptures do forbid woman to speak in churches , Mr. SEE is evidently prepared to take the ground that the building in which he preaches is not a church , but a sort of public hall provided with an ash-barrel for the accommodation of speakers . If he repudiates the ecclesiastical conception of a pulpit , and regards it as in no wise different from an ash-barrel , except as to the nature of its usual contents , he ought consistently to reject the idea of a church as a sacred edifice , and to class it with town halls and engine-henses . St. PAUL undoubtedly never forbade women to speak in an engine , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a passage in the Old or New Testament which says that women may not enter ash-barrels . Thus , although neither of his first two arguments should be accepted as constituting a good defense , his last argument is clearly incontrovertible and unassailable . It is proper to add , that the ministers who are now engaged in trying Mr. SEE did not attempt to refute his arguments , but contented themselves with asking him to promise not to permit any more women to preach , prophesy , or babble , either in his pulpit or his ash-barrel . But he stoutly refused to do anything of the kind . Ho admitted that " in the days of his ignorance and unbelief " he thought as did his brethren , but that he had since seen his error . How the trial will end remains to be seen , but if Mr. SEE maintains his position that a Newarkiau is not a Corinthian , and requires his accusers to produce St. PAUL 'S epistle to the Newarkians , or his epistle to SEE I. or SEE IL , before admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be exceedingly difficult to convict him in any way which he will consider legal or fair .
