txt The Legislature of 1875 , like most of its predecessors during the last twenty years , seems to exist mainly for the purpose of making laws for the City of New-York . Paying half the taxes , and containing onefourth of all the population of the State , the City has an undoubted claim to a large share of legislative attention . But unfortunately , laws dictated by considerations of public interest are the exception , and laws designed to assist professional politicians in dividing the spoils of our local Government are the rule at Albany . Two influences are at work in the Legislature which tend , so far as the tax-payers are concerned , to the same result . The one is the greed of place , patronage and . plunder of both leaders and subordinates in the Tammany Hall organization , and the other is to be found in the far-reaching political schemes of some of the Manhattan Club magnates in regard to the influence to be exerted through the possession of offices in this City upon the New-York delegation to the Democratic National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be able to elucidate the latter phase of the plot . Meanwhile , the important thing for the people of this City to remember , is that whether with the remoter view of packing a Democratic convention , or with the more immediate purpose of satisfying a gang of disreputable politicians - who have been long debarred from the public crib , there is a steadfast purpose on the part of our Democratic rulers to plunder the City . The methods adopted will certainly bo less gross and vulgar than those of TWEED . The machinery is not ready , even if there was the requisite amount of public apathy , to secure the wholesale manufacture of bogus claims , and the open confiscation of public revenues . But there are millions of fraudulent bills whose chance of recognition is staked upon the prospect of securing a more ductile Controller , and some of which are already being worked through the Assembly under cover of legislation designed to supply their lack of valid authority . These methods of undermining the public , treasury have at least the merit of carrying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Democratic majority in the Assembly have not much character to lose , but we have a Republican majority in the Senate who can not afford to brave public opinion in such matters . There IS , moreover , a State Executive very unlikely to become a party to any gross piece of jobbery , and very certain to be politically ruined if he does . A less palpable and therefore more potent form of danger to the pockets of this community is to be found in the determination of our local Government to rush once more into great schemes of what are called " public improvements . " Some of these are of a perfectly defensible character ; others , among which are the projected up-town boulevard operations , are simply a fraud upon the City at large for the benefit of a needy ring of realestate speculators . But whether defensible or not , all these " improvements " will be tainted with the same vice of furnishing the occasion for political bargain and sale . The interests of the party will be considered first ; the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the new Commissioner of Public Works been appointed than Tammany Hall selected . a committee to dictate to him who should be selected for the places within his gift . Numerous as the positions are in that department , Messrs . KELLY and MORRISSEY Will probably have fifty applicants for every place there is to give away . We have seen the class of men that Tammany thinks good enough for the Board of Aldermen . It is hardly necessary to describe the kind of men that will be considered good enough for clerks , inspectors and foremen in the Department of Public Works . The departments next in order tor the extent of their available patronage  --  the Docks and Parks  --  will be subjected to precisely the same kind of manipulation . The heads of these departments must take thoir cue from the Mayor and . Tammany Hall or things will be made very uncomfortable for them . And it will not be enough for KELLY , WICKHAM &; Co. to command the vast number of permanent positions in these departments . Every Democratic Alderman and prominent ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a few laboring men . To give the departments the power of directly employing their own labor , every means will be taken to secure the abrogation of the contract system . The Legislature has already been asked to allow work to the value of $10,000 to be done without the formality of public letting , and a further attempt has been made to enable a Limas majority of the Board of Aldermen to allow improvements to be done under the wasteful method of " day 's work . " Add to these the further proposal to invest the Mayor and Board of Aldermen with the authority to authorize unlimited issues of bonds , and to make the yearly apportionment of Municipal expenditures , and it will be seen that if the City of New-York is not egregiously plundered . in the immediate future it will not be the fault of the gang of hungry politicians , who are laying their plans so as to get uncontrolled power over all departments of local administration .                @ @ @ @ @
