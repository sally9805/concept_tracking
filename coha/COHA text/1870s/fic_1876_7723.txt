Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : THE OLD THIRTEEN . from The old thirteen 1876-1879 The curtain rises on a hundred years ,  --  A pageant of the olden time appears . Let the historic muse her aid supply , To note and name each form that passes by . Here come the old original Thirteen ! Sir Walter ushers in the Virgin Queen ; Catholic Mary follows her , whose land Smiles on soft Chesapeake from either strand ; Then Georgia , with the sisters Caroline ,  --  One the palmetto wears , and one the pine ; Next , she who ascertained the rights of men Not by the sword but by the word of Penn ,  --  The friendly language hers , of " thee " and " thou " ; Then , she whose mother was a thrifty vrouw ,  --  Mother herself of princely children now ; And , sitting at her feet , the sisters twain ,  --  Two smaller links in the Atlantic chain , They , through those long dark winters , drear and dire , Watched with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid , in white and green ; One guards the Charter Oak with lofty mien ; And lo ! in the plain beauty once she wore , The pilgrim mother from the Bay State shore ; And last , not least , is Little Rhody seen , With face turned heavenward , steadfast and serene ,  --  She on her anchor , Hope , leans , and will ever lean .
