txt It is not difficult to understand and appreciate the enthusiasm which Mr. FROTIDE awakened in his audience of Saturday evening . . About the practical utility of the mission with which he charged himself there may be two opinions ; about the high-toned honesty of purpose . and the courageous devotion to truth and . justice which dictated it , there can be but one verdict possible . Mr. FROUDE has set many people thinking about the real causes of Irish discontent who had the faintest possible conception of them before , and . has given many others an insight into what are the conditions of historical truth , and what are the methods of the honest and earnest student of the recorded past , sufficient to constitute a genuine contribution to the intellectual development of the average reading public . To such general services of an educational kind , must be added the sensible check which Mr. FROTTDE has given to the possibilities of Irish agitation on this soil . It is true that the historian hardly appears to have comprehended bow thoroughly Americans understand their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as minutely amid the shanties around the Central Park as we could in the mud-cabins ' of Connaught . The " land hunger " of the Irish Peasant . his shiftlessness , his low ideal of comfort , his ready wit , and his superstitious kind of piety are all so faithfully daguerreotyped at our very doors as to leave nobody who cares to understand the matter any excuse for ignorance . Then that Celtic gregariousness , that unfaltering and unreasoning devotion to the head of the tribe or the clan , which has been for generations the glory and the curse of the Irish people , has had . its counterpart in New-York as well as in Munster . Government through a " Boss " is the ideal of social order entertained by the average Irish laborer of this City , just as the leadership of a Kildare or a Desmond was &kind; of divine ordination to the kerns of two centuries ago . It has . been the fate of the Irish masses to be betrayed . cheated , and preyed upon by their ancient chiefs as by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been unmindful of the arts .133r. which the confidence of a generous and impulsive people has been abused , to the profit ' of those who traded on their credulty . We understand the vitality of the =store. of " coyn and livery " all the better from having seen Fenian " generals " splendidly equipped and luxuriously maintained out of the hard-won earnings of Irish servant-girls and hodmen . But seeing and knowing all this , a large section of the American public failed to appreciate how honest had , in many oases , been the efforts of the English governors of Ireland to do justice to their peculiarly intractable subjects . Mr. FROUDE has . given the thinking portion of this community a firmer grasp of the continuity of Irish history than it had before , and in doing so has rendered it more difficult in the future for the mere agitator to get his rhetoric accepted for reasoning and his legendary myths for ascertained facts . The great historian has shown how possible it is for an educated Englishman to unite a cordial appreciation of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen perception of the causes of Irish misfortunes and an ardent desire for the rendering of unstinted. justice to a country for whose discontent England has much to be responsible . His frank appeal for the sympathy of Americans with such a desire has not assuredly gone without its response . Though it can hardly operate in the way he anticipated , though it may not have much immediate effect upon relations which need a change of mutual feeling rather than an adjustment of logically-drawn convictions , yet , in one way or other , Mr. FEOUDE may rest assured that his labor boa not been wholly in vain . Now that Mr. FROUDE has discharged a duty which he regarded as equivalent to a moral obligation , can he not be induced to widen still farther his circle of American admirers by lecturing upon some of the other historical or social subjects with which he has shown himself so competent to deal ? The zest of the reading and thinking public has been whetted by his Irish lectures for a fresh display in another field of the intellectual fearlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed in a very eminent degree by Mr. FROUDE . We trust it is not too late for Mr. FROUDE to introduce a new course of lectures .
