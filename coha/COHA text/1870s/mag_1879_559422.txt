ABSENT FRIENDS . IT is the purpose of this paper to recover the forms of half a dozen men , distinguished in the annals of the country , and closely associated with the " Review . " Men of letters were they all ; men of letters by both predilection and practice ; men of letters , in all but two instances , by profession ; and in these two the literary element was probably the most enduring title to fame . Bryant , though a journalist , will owe to poetry his immortality ; and Cushing , though a lawyer , will be longest remembered as a man of great intellectual versatility , a brilliant writer , talker , and speaker , a devourer of books and thoughts . Hillard was a lawyer , too , by profession ; but his legal career is so completely eclipsed by his literary achievements that scarcely a trace of it remains . Dana , Motley , and Taylor were men of letters purely . RICHARD HENRY DANA , who died in Boston on the 2d of February last , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Review , " which amounts to saying that he was one of the pioneers of literature in the country , one of the inaugurators of the literary life . He was then in the practice of the law , about twentyseven years old . His passion for literature thus early prevailed over the uncongenial habits of professional life . His connection by marriage and kindred fostered this predilection . Washington Allston , who married his sister and lived near him in Cambridge , was a man of genius , and , had he been less famous as an artist , would have been eminent as a writer . Dr. William Ellery Channing , the philosophical-rather , one would say , the imaginativepreacher , who took theology up into the region of the higher intelligence , and suffused the questions of religion , as well as all other questions , with the luminous atmosphere of thought , was his cousin . Edward T. Channing , scholar , writer , and critic , was his intimate // associate and fellow laborer in the work of establishing the " Review . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these , coinciding with strong individual tastes , should have diverted the young man from pursuits for which he had no keen relish . It is not to be wondered at that the preparatory studies for the Boston and Baltimore bar were productive of little professional fruit , or that the office in Boston was soon closed . Nor is it to be wondered at that a brief course of politics was enough for his ambition , that even membership in the State Legislature did not satisfy the cravings of his mind . He had no hunger for wealth , being moderately provided for by his patrimony , and being by disposition unworldly ; no passion for power , no desire for popularity . His manliness , and he had a good deal , of a rare kind , appeared under other forms , in the shape of individual opinions on the questions that addressed themselves to the intellect . He was one of the foremost to recognize the claims of the new school of poetry represented by Wordsworth , and did his part to revive an interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one of the editors of the " Review " he protested against the dominion of didactic writers like Alexander Pope , whose star wa* then in the ascendant , and with uncompromising vigor defended the higher standard , which was excessively unpopular in England and had no reception in America . In this task he was an educator of his countrymen , a prophet of the better future , which the " Review , " under the management of his successors , was effectual in establishing . His first pieces were written for its pages ; the " Essay on the Old Times " was printed here ; here appeared his article on the poems of Washington Allston , not at that time related to him by marriage . Whatever he wrote was characterized by a conservative purity of diction , free from quaintnesses , affectations , and novelties , as well as by a kindling force of intelligence which compelled attention . He was felt in the quality of his work , which was interesting and significant , but not much in conformity with the prevailing standards of taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , " which came out in numbers , in l821- ' 22 , and met with a cold reception from the general public , said : " One reason why it took so little at its first appearance was probably the hardihood with which its author slighted the venal arts of attracting the public attention and conciliating the public favor . " . . . . And these forbidding peculiarities were not , the critic thought , relieved by the charms of imagination , by descriptive power , or by expressions of feeling . The tone was // severely intellectual . The author , to use once more ' the language of Mr. Bryant , " loves to describe a peculiar and unhappy mood of the mind , cherished , as if by a kind of fatality , instead of being healed by the succession of events and the lapse of time ; drawing into its vortex all the lesser and feebler emotions , and making them its own nourishment . " With all these qualifications , the critic calls the writer a man of genius , and ascribes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy of , the moral sentiment , and a rare susceptibility to the influences of external nature . A similar judgment the same friendly critic pronounces on Mr. Dana 's poetry : " There is the same propensity to deal with strong and gloomy passions , with regret , remorse , fear , and despair ; with feelings over which present events have no control except to aggravate them , and which look steadily back to the unalterable past , or forward to the mysterious future . " The style is pronounced occasionally abrupt and harsh , with now and then an unpleasant homeliness of expression . On the whole , the praise is not exuberant ; and if so indulgently disposed a critic as Mr. Bryant must have been is grudging of plaudits , the modern reader , having no personal predilections , and educated in a very different school , may be pardoned for admitting a much qualified gratification from the perusal of " The Dying Raven , " " The Husband 's and Wife 's Grave , " and " The Buccaneer . " To tell the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful reading . The occasional beauties of expression , a few musical lines , here and there a graceful description of some natural object , do not redeem the somber monotony of sentiment . A course of lectures on Shakespeare , eight in , number , prepared at the instance of Dr. Channing , and read with great acceptance before cultivated audiences in Boston , Philadelphia , and New York , but never printed , are spoken of with much enthusiasm as precious contributions to the literature of the subject . The study of Shakespeare was one to call into action his best powers as critic , expositor , and poet . There was an unlimited field for his genius and his grace . His enthusiasm was always kindled by the classic authors of England , and it was not readily stirred by any othcj*s . Mr. Dana was no sentimentalist . His taste was exacting , his judgment austere and , however limited his own domain , he could enjoy a wide range that was opened for him by others . Perhaps he enjoyed this the more because his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Dana 's fastidiousness restrained him in the exercise of his creative genius ; that , preferring quality // to quantity , he was content to produce a very few pieces of prime excellence . But this explanation can hardly be received as final . To say nothing of obvious defects in the quality of his work as far as it is accessible to us , the natural constitution of his mind , as exhibited in other ways , accounts both for the limited quantity of his intellectual production and for a certain dryness and thinness in its substance . He had no craving for expression , literary or social . He was a silent man , for the most part . His thoughts did not readily come either to his pen or his lips . He was deficient in the sense of humor , and consequently in the feeling of sympathy with other minds , which prompts communication . He was deficient in wit , and consequently was never a delighted spectator of the nimble achievements of his own mind . He observed and reflected . He read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literatures , and in the works of the elder bards . His acquaintance with the English classics was intimate . He was well versed in the politics of the mother country , was familiar with the attitude and the career of her statesmen , and could talk well on the current topics of her society . He was , moreover , conservative in politics and religion . His only appearance in home politics was as a champion of the Federalist party , and it was a general impression that in mature life his predilections were for the monarchical form of government . When the divisions arose between the Unitarians and the Trinitarians , Dr. Channing was on the one side and Mr. Dana on the other . He was then a Congregationalist . Subsequently he joined the Episcopal Church , and was a quiet representative of high-church principles . The passion of his soul was for Nature . He loved her unadorned . He adored her in silence . In his summer home , at Manchester , a secluded , remote , weird , and lonely place on the seashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in extreme - simplicity , the poet loved to be alone . The touch of art was not visible about him in field or wood . Before the square house , designed , we believe , by Allston , at the foot of a steep declivity of rock and sand , stretched a wide , long beach , tc'rminated at either end by jagged masses of stone , and shelving so gradually that at one point , when the tide was low , there was a broad , dry passage to a wooded island which lay at a little distance from the coast* There the poet , with form erect , his flowing hair and beard blown about by the wind , would walk up and down , absorbed in thought and emotion . He loved to be alone ; he desired no companion . The friend , if he had one , was some literary guest whose most acceptable // speech was his silence . Last summer , the old man , thin and weak , but bright of mind and eye , sat on his little piazza and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more walk the beach . His mind had gone into itself . WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT was introduced to Mr. Dana through the medium of " Thanatopsis , " which was published in the " North American Review , " anonymously , in 1817 . Its extraordinary character stimulated the editor 's curiosity , and led to a friendship which lasted through the years of a long life . The two men were in most respects strikingly dissimilar in temperament and intellectual convictions . Neither in politics nor in religion were they sympathetic . But their literary tastes were in accord . Both were purists in the matter of style , and conservatives in the matter of sentiment . Both loved the classic authors . Both were contemplative and interior . Both were more inclined to silence than to speech . Both had the adoration of Nature , and were observers of her moods . By the seashore or in the country , they would be together , without conversation , each communing with his own thoughts . It is not improbable that Mr. Dana 's admiration for " Thanatopsis " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately lines . This solemn veneration for Nature is , indeed , the characteristic of the poem . It was the first of those studies which disclosed the real bent of Bryant 's mind . When first printed , it was preceded by four stanzas , commonplace and conventional to an extraordinary degree , which read like a farewell to the somber associations of the hard New England life and the grim New England theology . The last stanza runs thus : This bitter cup at first was given When angry Ju8tice frowned severe , And t is the eternal doom of Heaven . That man must view the grave with fear . The lines are a fitting introduction to the poem which follows , and it is not surprising that the editor printed them together . The longer poem was calculated to change the mood suggested by the dismal verses , which correspond in sentiment to the lines afterward added to " Thanatopsis " in later editions . Nature , the poet would say , is not under the curse . This idea is directly expressed in the " Fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wood , " which was published along with " Thanatopsis , " and immediately after it : // The primal curse Fell , it is true , upon the unsinning Earth , But not in vengeance . Hence , these shades Are still the abodes of gladness . The " Fragment " is warmer in feeling than " Thanatopsis , " which was written earlier , but the key-note is the same . Both are poems of reflection , passionless and colorless . " Thanatopsis " is the more colorless and passionless of the two . It is neither melancholy nor gloomy ; it is simply stately and grave . The piece , as originally published , was much shorter than our version . It began at what is now the seventeenth lineYet a few days and thee , and it ended sixteen lines earlier than our form , with the wordsAnd make their bed with thee . The Greek spirit of the poem is disclosed in the title and in an occasional phrase like the " all-beholding sun , " which suggests the poets whom the elder Bryant loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he threw it into a drawer instead of hurrying away with it to the printer . It was apparently with him a product of reflection rather than a work of creative genius . " Thanatopsis " is a meditation . Bryant was a lover of Nature , and a keen observer of her forms . He caught the sentiment of the woods , the birds , the flowers , and he possessed a happy gift of expression , not always poetic , but accurate , smooth , and graceful . lie was not a man of strong emotions ; not a man of many words . His observation of Nature was more remarkable for accuracy than for insight . His perception was less sympathetic than clear . It is interesting , in this connection , to compare Lowell 's poem " The Bobolink , " published in his first little volume , " A Year 's Life , " and beginningAnacreon of the meadow , Drunk with the joy of spring , with Bryant 's " Robert o ' Lincoln , " one of his last and most delightful effusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits , his domestic and home life , giving a charming imitation of his note and a pretty picture of bird-existence . Lowell attempts nothing of // this kind , but makes one feel the thrilling glee , the heedlessness and overflowing joy of the little songster . Similarly contrasted are the two poems on " The Fountain , " published by the same men . Lowell expresses the soul of the leaping water , Bryant moralizes on the lapse of the running stream . The temperament of Bryant was pensive , inclined to sadness . At the close of his essay on " The Happy Temperament , " printed in an early number of the " Review , " occur the following sentences , which contain the key to his poetry as well as to his life : " In short , the melancholy feelings , when called up by their proper and natural causes , and confined to their proper limits , are the sources of almost all our virtues . The temperament of unbroken cheerfulness is the temperament of insensibility . " This philosophy may be a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , and take the blows that are aimed at reformers ; but it is not congenial with poets or men of letters , who have faith in sunshine , and who believe that in order to be good they must be happy . The radiance in Bryant 's poetry is like the gleam of sunlight upon a snowy landscape , like the music of a brook singing a cheery tune beneath the ice . His verses usually end with a thoughtful moral which connects their melody with the tender experiences of a chastened soul . An autumnal wind sighs through the woods . The foliage is touched with frost . Bryant was a man of reflection-grave , serene , patient . He " meditated his Muse . " In a letter to a friend , written in March , 1871 , Mr. Bryant thus described his habits of life : " I rise early , at this time of the year about half-past five ; in summer half an hour or even an hour earlier . Immediately , with very little incumbrance of clothing , I begin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand the chest , &amp;nd at the same time call into action all the muscles and articulations of the body . These are performed with dumb-bells , the very lightest , covered with flannel , with a pole , an horizontal bar , and a light chair swung around my head . After a full hour , and sometimes more , passed in this manner , I bathe from head to foot . . . . My breakfast is a simple one-hominy and milk , or , in place of hominy , brown bread , or wheaten grits , or oatmeal , and , in the season , baked sweet apples . Tea and coffee I never touch at any time . . . . My drink is water , yet I sometimes , though rarely , take a glass of wine . I am a natural temperance man , finding myself rather confused than exhilarated by wine . I never meddle with tobacco , except to quarrel with its use . . . . I abomi // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . nate all drugs and narcotics , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not otherwise make . " None but a calm , equable , self-poised , self-contained man , patient , regular , not subject to moods , unvexed by " nervousness , " unexcitable , cool , deliberate , can pursue for years a regimen like that here described . We doubt if another poet or creative mind in the world does or ever did it . We say nothing against the rules themselves , which are excellent , and must *iave an admirable effect on the person who can put them in practice . The ability to put them in practice is the marvel . The man who has the patience and perseverance for that already possesses the virtue which the regimen confers . He has the prudent disposition of the sage , hardly the burning temper of the man of genius . This quality of calm persistency stood Mr. Bryant in good stead as a literary man . Through the force it gave him he was enabled to begin , continue , and finish his translation of Homer , that admirable performance which sustained and consoled him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring and roar of the original ; it shows us homer chastened and subdued ; but it is faithful , musical , refined , and is , on the whole , the best of the English versions . All there is is Homer . The translator had the modesty as well as the judgment to stand behind the original and reproduce as much of it as he could . If he could not reproduce the whole , he would at all events forbear to eke out his deficiencies with his fancies . Mr. Bryant 's contributions to the " Review " extended over a long course of years , and numbered in all sixteen pieces . Thus , during the greater portion of a protracted and busy career , he fed the fountain of good letters , and aided the cause of elegant scholarship in the country . The service he rendered in this way was of the most enduring and valuable kind . To rank him with the mighty bards of the world-with Homer , Dante , Milton , Goethewould be to t*ast on him the reproach of satire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be extremely injudicious . A place will hardly be assigned to him by posterity on a line with the Victorian poets or the authors of the highest mark among his countrymen . But , as a steadfast friend of pure literature , he stands preeminent . None put so modest an estimate on his performances as he . Posterity will add this grace to the wreath that is placed on the head of the man who never allowed // the discords of the worldly life to disturb the harmonies of his spirit . JOHN LOTUROP MOTLEY was an infrequent contributor . Only three articles came from his pen ; but they indicated original powers , clear and strong convictions , independent research , and literary capacity of a high order . His three topics were " Peter the Great , " " Balzac , " and " The Polity of the Puritans " - three topics as well adapted to exhibit an author 's intellectual qualities as any that could be selected . In his treatment of them there was nothing commonplace or conventional . The historical papers were not bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoughtful student of affairs ; and the judgment on Balzac was not merely the impression of a reader of the Frenchman 's novels , but the opinion of an intelligent man on the true province of art in works of fiction . Bright glances are thrown upon other writers , which exhibit a remarkable affluence of mind . Of Goethe he writes , in 1847 : " We have always considered him a great naturalist . His pursuit is always truth , natural truth , which he delights to track through all its external manifestations up to its living principles . He was no moralist , but a student of universal nature , both physical and metaphysical , who watched the sprouting of a hyacinth or a passion , the combination of an alkali and an acid , and the conflict of the affections , the efflorescence of a carnation , the revolution of a people , the eruption of a volcano , all with equal attention , and classed them all as natural phenomena , each as worthy to be studied as the others . It is for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a very immoral writer . The same persons should denounce the immorality of Professor Agassiz , because , for instance , he informed the respectable people of Boston that , in a certain family of the Radiata , every female always marries her grandfather . " Of another distinguished author he writes : " George Sand is no doubt a philosopher , and her style is better than that of any modern French writer ; but she always reminds us of what Yorick told the Count de B , in the Sentimental Journey , ' The only fault I have to find with your nation is that you are too serious . Of Balzac himself he says : " As for his philosophy , his principles , moral , political , or social , he seems to have none whatever . He looks for the picturesque and the striking . He studies sentiments and sensations from an artistic point of view . He is a physiognomist , a physiologist , a bit of an anatomist , a bit of a mesmeris ' , // a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineralogical , misanthropical , skeptical philosopher ; but he is no moralist , and certainly no reformer . " And this , Mr. Motley thinks , is to the writer 's credit as an artist in fiction . Mr. Motley reads novels first of all to be amused . He declares himself " a little fatigued with the reforming tendency of writers of fiction , the authors who are for changing everything , abolishing everything , and who have a radical objection to everything in existence . " This is the true literary spirit . It is not at all inconsistent with moral earnestness , only the moral earnestness must not be introduced in the wrong place or in the wrong manner . One may have a profound respect for the conscientious and untiring zeal by which abuses are attacked and overcome , and yet dislike to see novelists devoted to the work . " No doubt , " says Mr. Motley , " the country needs reformation  --  the world needs it ; but in the mean time let us occasionally be amused , and let novel writers think less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a large infusion of French novels into American literature , he would prefer more of Balzac and less of Sue or Sand . For Balzac , too , takes the world as it is. lie is essentially an artist who accepts the materials which society affords . If they reveal a vicious or disorderly condition of society , society , and not the artist , is responsible . Mr. Motley 's historical works show no lack of moral conviction ; his enthusiasm is always for the really noble in character and achievement , and his reprobation falls inevitably on the mean and base ; but he is never a dogmatist or sectarian . Of Puritan stock and nurture , he clearly perceived and frankly criticised the defects of the Puritan character , and would not be betrayed into unjustifiable eulogium of men because they happened to be the historical predecessors of principles that he admired . He has little patience with writers who exalt Puritanism , because democracy , unintentionally , as he thinks , grew out of it . " The New England fathers , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The real reason why the democratic principle prevailed was because it is a true principle , and because it never before had so fair a chance to develop itself . . . . The virtues of the Puritans were many and colossal ; their vices were few but formidable , for they were intolerance , cruelty , tyranny , and bigotry . . . . They came here to establish not liberty of conscience , but the true Church . The people , as such , had no rights at all . . . A true picture of those early times would present this quaint , sol // emil , arbitrary government keeping the people as tight as a drum , prying about , and thrusting its primitive and patriarchal nose into everybody 's business , and meddling with the most minute and trifling matters . " Bancroft 's history is described as a work of genius rather than of laborious detail , which owed its success to a " vigorous imagination and a crisp , nervous style . " There is an impression that Mr. Motley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-democratic institutions . The paragraphs with which the article on " The Polity of the Puritans " concludes would remove that impression , if any labored attempt at its removal were called for . He counts it an advantage to America that she has no past , and consequently is untrammeled by traditions . " America has no past , but she has a future . The possible future of this country is as exciting to the imagination* as the vague and fading past of other lands . " This sentence is followed by a brilliant passage , too long for quotation , portraying the splendors of the period when the States , confederate and compact , numbering three hundred millions of freemen , will be " distinguished for progress in those beautiful arts which embellish life , and appeal to the higher parts of a nation 's character , as well as for those useful ones by which the happiness and comfort of the citizens are secured . " Mr. Motley was an intellectual man , of high attainments . His associations with wealth and refinement only added grace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a prophet of humane ideas among people whom Matthew Arnold describes as " barbarians , " namely , the so-called upper classes of society . It is so unusual for intellect and conscience and noble art to be associated with opulence and social position that such an example as Mr. Motley presented should be held in special honor . His place in American literature is his own . It is pleasant to find in the pages of the " Review " so clear a presage of his fame . Of the six men we have chosen for our portrait-gallery , CALEB CusInNG was the most copious and varied . The index mentions thirty-five articles from his pen . His subjects were of great diversity law , civil and criminal , in principle and pra*ctice , national , international , municipal ; history ; biography ; education ; botany ; fiction ; discovery ; the civil and legal condition of women ; coal ; romantic adventure ; in fact , almost everything that was of interest to his contemporaries , from Perri 's " Roman Nights " to the civilization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // with fullness of information . His interest in Mexican and South American problems was particularly keen . He was perfectly at h6me with Spanish affairs , and seemed familiar with the vast range of subjects connected with them . His papers were not remarkable for brilliancy of style or richness of suggestion . They contained few touches of surprising talent , none of genius ; but they abounded in good sense , and were never deficient in learning . There is never the least approach to levity ; the tone is high , the thought is grave and weighty . Even such a theme as " Boccaccio 's Decameron " does not tempt him to depart from his usual decorum . This versatility of mind was in part answerable for a common impression that Mr. Cushing was superficial and even shallow . The generality of men find it hard to believe that interest in many subjects is compatible with thoroughness , accuracy , or depth . Still less are they disposed to think that interest in many subjects is compatible with moral sincerity . Earnestness is usually associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even heartiness of conviction , goes , it is conjectured , with monotony of opinion . The prejudice is countenanced by many facts of common experience . It is true that in most cases steadiness of moral feeling and fixedness of opinion are found together . The current is strongest in the stream which is most confined between precipitous banks . When the banks are removed the water spreads out into a still marsh , and soon becomes stagnant . All-sided people are prone to be moral skeptics . They can not give themselves to a single cause-they can not attach themselves to a party or be devotees of a creed . It is by limiting the gaze to one view that the will becomes fixed and the emotion centered . Largeness and openness of vision are almost always attended by fluctuation in the moral sense . Partisanship is peculiar to the fanatical . Men like Goethe , whom Matthew Arnold calls " the greatest critic perhaps that has ever lived , " are , according to Mr. Motley , neither moral nor immoral . An ordinary power of conscientiousness would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intellect like Mr. Cushing 's , who should have been endowed with a prodigious moral sense to balance the vigor of his mental processes . The examples of men who have been greater in intellect than he was , and correspondingly great in conscience , are scarcely to the point ; for these men hav.e , for the most part , been attached to a fixed system , political or religious , which confined their genius within certain speculative limits , and forbade any wide excursions of their faculties . // They were shut up to a view , though their vision may have been far-reaching and their glance penetrating . Mr. Cushing belonged to the least restricted of the learned professions , and lived in a community which countemtnced the widest diversity of opinion on all subjects . That he was an able man as well as a versatile one was proved in many public and extra-professional ways . That he was an enlightened and humane man is evidenced in many of his writings . That he was capable of large views appears abundantly in the papers we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of women is one that calls forth strong opinions on either side , and , perhaps more than any other , tests the independence of disputants . Two of Mr. Cushing 's articles treated this matter . The article on " The Legal Condition of Woman " was printed in April , 1828 ; that on " The Social Condition of Woman " in April , 1836 . In neither paper does the writer take the position of the modern reformer ; he does not , that is to say , advocate the extension of the franchise to women ; but he does make distinctions and lay down principles which strike at the heart of much popular prejudice . The technical opinions are conventional , but the general course of argument is humane . " We do not propose to ourselves , " he remarks in the first article , written , it must be remembered , fifty years ago , " to set up for the female sex any extravagant standard of legal privilege , nor to lay lance in rest for the support of quixotic pretensions , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the male sex . The constitution of nature , ordained by no human conventions , recorded in no fundamental charter of government or petition of rights , but written over the face of the universe , and stamped indelibly upon the very organization of our race , has , we conceive , settled the question whether the female sex should exercise political franchises equally with men . " On the next page he writes : " We do not esteem it any hardship , as some have done , that the property of an unmarri*ed female is taxed without being represented . Taxation procures for property the protection of the body politic ; and neither the alien friend who claims the safeguard of our laws , nor the unmarried female , nor the minor , whose estate the government guarantees against domestic pillage and hostile invasion , has just cause to complain of exclusion from elective privileges . " He protests against the " pernicious facility of divorce , " and doubts whether any nation will ever renew the experiment , which was tried in France during the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose and transitory that it was described as " the sacrament of adultery . " But he contends that , even with all the benefits conferred on woman by the irregular interposition of the courts of chancery , " her legal condition is honorable neither to the generosity nor to the good sense of that sex which alone exercises the right of establishing laws . " In particular he takes exception to the iniquitous disposition of married women 's property , and to the absurd mixture of masculine and feminine responsibility in cases of complicity in crime . Not only are the writer 's views on these topics exceedingly liberal and reasonable , but the causes of the iniquity complained of are indicated with a sagacity which reminds the reader occasionally of the investigations of Sir Henry Maine . He alludes to the deification of woman in primitive Greece  --  to the female deities , Rhea , Juno , Proserpina , Venus , Minerva-as indicating the respect paid to the sex by these people , and cites Andromache and Penelope as beautiful examples of conjugal truth and virtue . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevating the character and condition of woman " ; but the drift of his exposition is to show the prevailing influence of intelligent customs under rational civilization . The attentive study of these two articles has impi'essed us deeply with the essential earnestness of Mr. Gushing 's mind . In quality as well as in quantity , in depth as well as in fluency and swiftness , he was remarkable . Had he been less universal , he would have been more famous . The variety of his gifts was against his popular influence . The old New-Englander can not easily disabuse himself of the belief in Mr. Cushing 's alleged tergiversations and political infidelities ; but local prejudices are temporary , after all , and substantial qualities of mind stand vindicated at last . If what Faraday said is true , that " in knowledge that man only is to be contemned and despised who is not in a state of transition , " Caleb Gushing has nothing to fear from the judgment of posterity . Of the six men our space allows us to describe , the most copious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cushing , was GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD . His articles number twenty-two , and are on diverse themes-law , education , history , literature in many branches . Literary subjects were clearly his favorites . He was essentially a literary man , and a literary man of a rare mold-cultivated , scholarly , elegant , studious , hospitable , sympathetic , a lover of books , accomplished in language , enthusiastic yet clear of appreciation ; his place is among the refiners of American taste . From the first // he gave promise of intellectual distinction , as a student at the Boston Latin School and at Harvard College . His mental accomplishments admirably qualified him to teach at the Round Hill School at Northampton , and dictated the choice of him as the first Dean of the Boston Latin School . His associates were , from first to last , the most brilliant intellects of his day . His Phi Beta Kappa oration , in 1843 , on " The Relation of the Poet to his Age , " was an event in the history of academic addresses . We recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful delivery , and the fine intellectual enthusiasm , on the throng that crowded the church in Cambridge when the effort was made . In 1847 the genius again broke forth in twelve lectures on Milton , delivered in Tremont Temple , before the audience of the Lowell Institute . Though educated for the law , the companion of lawyers , and to some extent a practitioner , his taste was for elegant letters . His extensive acquaintance with books and his loving appreciation of them came out on all occasions , and in every form of expression ; in affluent and brilliant conversation , correspondence , newspaper and magazine writings , interest in young a4uthors , and veneration for the classics of all nations . He was a diligent reader and an accurate master of style . A sensitive organization rendered him delicately appreciative of the finer aspects of all questi6ns , confining him rather to the aesthetic side of problems . That he was no reformer , in the harsh , aggressive sense , need not be said . He was not born to thunder and lighten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolted against inhumanity , and his heart was always on the side of mercy . In the terrible days of the Fugitive-Slave Law excitement , when the opinions to which he was most sensitive were on the side of what was deemed oppression , fugitive slaves found refuge and shelter in his house . The situation of the Afric*an race in America excited his deep commiseration , and , though he struck no blow in their behalf , he did his part to create the humaner sentiment which ultimately decreed its emancipation . We have not space to dwell on Mr. Hillard 's literary performances . We can not even name the works of his diligent hand . His biographical sketches were vivid and lifelike . His edition of Spenser had a high reputation . His " selections " from Landor gave to that powerful but eccentric writer a certain vogue , and revealed to a heedless world some of the wonders and beauties of his style . The " Six Months in Italy " was for many years the very best work of its kind , and still holds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official addresses attest the extent of his mental reach and the richness of his mental endowment . School-books , containing choice gems of literature , raised the standard of rhetorical excellence in the places of public education . His fine touch may be felt everywhere , in illustrative record and criticism . But what we desire especially to note is the unerring sagacity of his literary judgment , as displayed in the pages of the " Review . " Two contributions , in particular , show this  --  a review of Lowell 's " A Year 's Life , " in 1841 , and an article on Mrs. Browning 's " Prometheus Bound " and " Seraphim , " in 1842 . It may seem a thin.g not at all remarkable that a critic of the smallest pretension should discern the merits of poets so striking in power as Mrs. Browning and James Russell Lowell , whose fame has renetrated to every class of readers . But to pronounce a verdict on writers entirely unknown by literary report , writers of a new school , and a school of marked peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict which subsequent judgment will sustain , implies perception of no mean order . And this is what Mr. ilillard did . His recognition of the newly revealed genius is as hearty as could be desired ; and his criticism is as firm as it is frank . Mr. Hillard was one of the earliest scholars in German . It is a surprise to read , in 1842 , 50 nice a translation as the following of Heine 's " Pine and Palm " : Where polar frosts are sharp and long , A single pine-tree grows . It sleeps ; and winter round it weaves A robe of ice and snow . Its dreams recall a lonely palm That , far in Eastern lands , By crags that glow with tropic heat , In mourning silence stands . The contributions of BAYARD TAYLOR , the last of our friends , deceased , number but two , and these short literary notices merely ; one a review of Swinburne 's " Laus Veneris , " the other of the poems of Fitz-Gr*ene ilalleck . They are characterized by the manly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind , and give eviAence of his homage to the literary art , but otherwise are not remarkable . Mr. Taylor was a workingman in letters ; not a genius , not an artist of high rank ; but a patient , persevering , loyal , and devoted student in literature ; ambitious and self-asserting , but single-minded , // pure-hearted , and lofty of aim . From the beginning to the end , always and everywhere , he was the man of letters , consecrated to the task of putting into literary form the observations , experiences , emotions , and aspirations of life . His ideal artist was Goethe , whose calmness he sought to attain , whose universality he aspired to emulate . He never forgot that he was an author-author by profession , not from necessity , but from love of the craft . As a traveler , he had a thought to note down what he saw , in letters and books , and he was untiring in his diligence to master everything that went to make his letters and books worth reading-languages , historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , the influence of institutions and men . His method was rather the method of painstaking labor than of quick insight . On one occasion , after listening with great interest to a lecture on Moscow , a hearer said to him that his method recalled a visit he had made , a few days before , to the studio of Church , who had on his easel the celebrated picture of Niagara . The painting was considerably advanced , and the visitor put to the artist the obvious question , " How soon will the work be finished ? " The artist measured the canvas with his eye , and quietly said that , at the rate of his proceeding , so many days in the week , so many hours in the day , the picture would be completed in about two weeks . He worked steadily , gaining ground inch by inch , and was certain that , if each detail was conscientiously executed , the final result would be harmonious to the eye and true to nature . Mr. Taylor was struck and gratified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the way . Put the parts together , and you make the whole . " But this is not the way of genius ; and genius , it is commonly allowed , Mr. Taylor had not . He may have had what was more serviceable , but he had not that . The translation of " Faust " tells the story . It is a remarkable literary achievement , a wonder of accomplishment . The second part of the poem , especially , is a miracle of patience , fidelity , and loyalty to the original master . He might have evaded the responsibility of turning it into English . He might have pleaded the difficulty of the task , its unprofitableness , its thanklessness . He might have echoed the disrespect in which that portion of the poem was held by critics and admirers of Goethe , in his own country as well as elsewhere . But no ; the task of translating the drama had been undertaken , and must be performed unflinchingly , cost what it might in time and toil . Goethe had written it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goethe would slight it . // For reputation , influence , support , happiness , Mr. Taylor resorted to literature . It was the occupation of his time , his recourse in strength , his solace in loneliness and depression of spirits . His books were his joy and his crown . He lived in and by literature ; literature , in whatever form it presented itself-journalism , lecturing , poetry , fiction , the making of books . Though resolved to do his full and exact duty to the Government that sent him as minister to Germany , his deep-seated purpose was to write the life of the man whose genius he so much revered . The literary ambition filled his heart , and made him all but insensible to the public honors that were heaped upon him . He was not an aristocrat in literature ; he was , however ambitious and soaring , content to be a door-keeper at the house of that . supreme monarch of art . He was a servant , often a day-laborer , doing drudgery , unwillingly but still proudly , lamenting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected , but de1*ermined , for his part , to hold it in supreme honor . He would have appreciated , had he been alive to witness it , the tribute paid by the printers of leipsic to the man who had himself been a printer . He had the conservatism and the radicalism of the man of letters . He knew how slow and toilsome was the progress of literary art , and , from reverence of soul , forbore to smite the creations of* the human intellect , which represented so much patient labor . But none knew better than he the force of thought to pulverize systems , and the becessity of opening a way through institutions for new thought to flow . His " Masque of the Gods " and " Deucalion " were attempts to express in poetic form philosophical ideas at once destructive and constructive-ideas born of the most andacious speculation , and yet fraught with reconciling and healing virtue . Such , in our judgment , was Bayard Taylor . Unlike any of those that have been spoken of in connection with the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as scarcely to belong among them-yet their brother in spirit and in labor , one of the men who have given dignity and beauty to literature in America . 0 .
