ARTICLE VIII. -A QUESTION IN CONGREGATIONALISM . Ecciesia : Church Problems considered in a Series of Essays . Edited by HENRY ROBERT REYNOLDS , D.D. , President of Cheshunt College , Fellow of University College , London . London : ilodder and Stoughton . First Series , 1870 . Second Series , 1871 . New York : A. D. F. Randolph &amp; Co . THE future historian of the theological literature of England in this generation will remark a characteristic mode of discussion and publication as distinguishing it This method is neither that of ordinary book-authorship , nor that of quarterlies and other periodicals , nor yet that of occasional tracts and pamphlets , whether by one author or by many , whether to be afterward collected , or not to be , into volumes . It combines many of the advantages , and avoids many of the inconveniences , of each of these plans , by producing simultaneously , in a single volume , essays by different and mutually irresponsible writers in general sympathy with each other , on subjects mutually related , with no more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from repetition or cross-purposes . It combines the brevity and point of the occasional pamphlet ; the power of codperation and combined influence incident to the quarterly or monthly ; and the strength of a sustained ,  - -  continuous appeal to the public attention on one general subject , which belongs to the " bound volume . " At the same time , it is neither ephemeral and perishable ; nor does it protract discussion over long intervals of time , and imply promises for the future , and involve the writers in certain prescriptive responsibilities ; nor does it deter busy men from beginning to read the volume by binding them over to finish it .. It is a most convenient , serviceable , many-handed engine , that " stands ready to smite once and smite no more , " unless more be necessary . The first notable success of a volume of this kind-in the case of the " Essays and Reviews " - was so out of proportion to the absolute value of the contents of the book , that it is not strange that the method was promptly adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first for the immediate purpose of contro* verting that agitating and unwholesome little bundle of neol. *-gies , and afterward for the positive expression and vindication of the various schools and tendencies of British theology . It is strange , and , on the whole , not creditable to the activity and efficiency of American theology , that this new type of literature is not represented amongst ourselves . The successive volumes of " Boston Lectures " come nearest to it , but after all they are not of the same sort . The knot of really vigorous American scholars , holding independent convictions on subjects of serious concern , and having " the courage of their convictions , " who should be first to adventure together into this new field of literature , would be sure of a hearing from the public . Two of the most recent and notable works of this class are the series of Essays by moderate High Churchmen of the Establishment , edited by Dean Hook , once famous as Vicar of Leeds , under the title " The Church and the Age , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Independent Nonconformists . We name the two together for the sake of remarking the general superiority of the essays of the Dissenters , to those of their graduated , titled , and beneficed brethren of the Established Church , in elegance of style , breadth of thought , thoroughness of argument , and almost every quality of cxcellence. * The superiority is unmistakable , and all the more impressive from the fact that , all things considered , it was hardly to have been expected . The temptations to a narrow polemic view of current questions , on the part of British Dissenters , are many , and their opportunities of the highest liberal culture are unrighteously few . All the more honor , then , to the scholarship and liberality which demonstrates that their best men are " standing in a large place , " such in point of catholicity and comprehensiveness as challenges the deference of " the comprehensive church " itself * We must except from the comparison the Article on Modern Missions in Ecciesia , which in a literary point of view is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sir Bartle Frere in The Church and the Age , on Results of Missions in India , which is quite the best thing in that volume . But both these essays are so valuable that the firm or society that should reprint them together for American circulation in a neat little volume would render a good service to the whole Christian community . // Of course , writings conceived in such a temper , can not be occupied with that indiscriminate vindication of part*san traditions which is characteristic of vulgar polemics . That is poor generalship which knows no art of defense bi4 to keep all you bold , at all costs and all hazards- And yet when the capable soldier takes command , and begins to strengthen his line by abandoning untenable outworks , how few there are that are able to see that this course , instead of being treacherous abandonment of the defense , is really the one condition which makes defense , in the long run , practicable ! Congregationalism owes much to such men as the writers of these essays , for the great but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning the untenable points . Is it not better that this should be done in the council of its friends than by the successful assault of its enemies ? The main object of this Article is to introduce to the consideration of American Congregationalists a single one of the weighty questions put by the Rev. J. OTuinness Rogers , B. A. , in his essay on " The Congregationalism of the Future . " This essay is a thoughtful forthlook to the time when , at the approaching disestablishment of the Episcopal Church in England , Congregationalism will be placed on a new footing-on nearly the same footing , in fact , which it already occupies in America . Accordingly it deals with questions that are already practical to us- But with all its freedom of criticism , it makes no mention of that usage which is the universal and most grievous blemish and corruption of American Congregationalism-the imposition of codes of dogma as conditions of membership . The reason why this abuse is not mentioned by the English writer is because it is unknown to English Congregationalism , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was no part of the original institute adopted by the New England fathers . It would have been utterly abhorrent to their principles and feelings . It never was deliberately adopted at any time , but stole in as an indolent and corrupt practice , and came into universal *ise , not by the care of the churches , but through their carelessness . It is not , at this hour , intelligently approved by Congregational ministers , as a body , but holds its place in church usage by // that exaggerated vis inertki* which belongs peculiarly to Congregationalist traditions from the very fact that the system has no written statutes , and therefore no law but tradition . It is condemned by a hundred reasons , both of expediency and of duty , and sustained by no single argument that does not rest upon the false and mischievous definition of faith as meaning assent to propositions . The question of administration which our writer presses upon the consideration of his brethren is stated in his own language thus : Looking more closely at the constitution and practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertaining whether any or what changes may be made to meet the objections of those who admit that it has laid hold of certain grand principles of Church polity , but are staggered by present modes oC administration , we are necessarily led to consider its conditions of Church fellowship , and the plans adopted for their enforcement . Those who have been so trained in Nonconformist ideas on Church membership , that they have almost come to regard the details of its arrangements as of Divine appointment , have but very inadequate conceptions of the revulsion of feeling produced in the minds of those who have been educated amid other associations , when they are first brought into contact with the practices that till recently obtained in all our Churches , and which even now are to be found in the majority . To some the idea of an investigation into their private religious experience by comparative strangers , in order that a report of the results may be made to a meeting of the Church , is so distasteful and repellent that they at once turn away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is impossible not to respect from laying bare their most sacred feelings ,  --  those which they would hardly confide even to their most intimate friend ,  --  to visitors with*whom they have little or no acquaintance , and whose want of tact in the prosecution of their inquiries , may very possibly furnish little guarantee that their judgment will be formed with wisdom and discrimination . Others object to it on the ground of principle as well as of feeling . They regard the whole proceeding as essentially inquisitorial in its character , and insist that as no man has a right to assume such a position of authority in relation to another , so he in his turn is not justified in sacrificing his Christian liberty by allowing another to assume it to bim . They have no objection freely to converse on the subject of their Christian profession with a minister or others , but they demur to its being insisted upon as a necessary condition to Church fellowship.1 Holding that a profession of Christian faith spontaneously and intelligently made should be accepted as genuine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard Churches who require more than this as usurping a power which Christ has not committed to them , which has no warrant in the New Testament , and the exercise of which is attended with serious practical evils . They urge , further , that experience has proved that such attempts to maintain the purity of the Church defeat their own purpose , operating as barriers to prevent the entrance of many whose lives would adorn a Christian profession , arid yet failing to exclude those against whom they are specially directed . A third class go further still , and deny the // propriety of establishing any distinction at all . Advocating the multitudinist theory which consistently enough finds its place in a National Church , they d*emand that the doors of the Church should be thrown open to all who choose to enter and that any separation between believers and unbelievers should be left to Him who knoweth the bearts and who alone judgeth righteous judgments . Can Congregationalism , with a due regard to its own principles , properly make any changes in deference to these views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of this third class , and reaffirming the principle that a true Christian church should be a church of true Christians , the writer returns to the question , by what processes shall this principle best be carried into practice ? " Congregational principles stand on an entirely different ground from the usages which are based on them . For the former there is ample Scriptural authoritythe latter have at best only the tradition of a denomination , or the evidence of experience , to allege , in their favor . The former therefore must be maintained until it can be shown that we have been misled as to the meaning of the New Testament  --  the latter are open to such modifications as a wider experience may dictate , or as the altered circumstances of the times may appear to demand . Yet there is a style of argumentation which puts them both on the same basis , and quietly assumes that the demonstration of the one carries with it the proof of the other also . It is proved , as it can be proved easily enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential qualification for membership in Christ 's Church , and here it is supposed that the whole necessity of proof ends , that everything else follows as a matter of course , that the visitation and personal examination of each candidate by the minister and a deputation from the Church , followed by a report on the whole to the assembled community , and the verdict pronounced thereupon by a body who at jest can have very scanty materials on which to form a decision , are just as Scriptural . To all this an objector may reasonably demur , and when he comes to demand proof at each stage of the process , those who are engaged in the defence will not be long before they find themselves in sore straits . At the very next stage of the argument-at the assertion that as every member of a Church should be a Christian , therefore he is bound to satisfy the Church that he is so , and that for this something more is requisite than his mere profession , their difficulties will begin . It is a position which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will not be easy to adduce that Scriptural proof on which alone Congregationalism professes to rest . The New Testament warrants the separation of the Church fr*m those who do not live in accordance with the laws of Christ ; and it would justify the refusal to admit such into the Church . We would go even further , and say that it would warrant the adoption of a more rigid law than that which was applied to men just gathered in from heathenism ; but to infer from this that it gives a Church authority to institute tests by which the inner life of men should be proved , and the conformity of their experience with the standard of the Gospel decided , is to press the conclusion further tha.n the premises warrant . A good deal has been gained when this simple distinction between the essential and accidental parts of the system is made clear : it is at once understood that the // abandonment of present modes of administration does not involve any alteration in the fundamental law of Church fellowship ; that a proposal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find as little favor with the members who feel the necessity of some change , as with those who adhere most rigidly to the old system ; that nothing more is contemplated than an improvement in the mode of working out principles which will be retained in all their integrity . The idea of leaving the responsibility wholly with the individual himself may indeed at first sight seem startling and revolutionary , but a more careful examination may possibly dispel much of the alarm that is felt . It is true that at present the Church apparently assumes a good deal of responsibility in each decision , but it is only in appearance . It is by the candidate himself the Churchs opinion must in the majority of cases be shaped ; for how can the Church judge of the inner life except by the help of what he communicates . He narrates the story of his awakening to spiritual consciousness , of the hours of secret penitence through which lie has passed , of the inward conflicts through which he has fought his way into the kingdom of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , by which he has been led to a knowledge of the Saviour , and an enjoyment of that peace which He imparts to the souL If he should simply be using unctuous phrases which he has borrowed from oihers , and with which the clever hypocrite never finds any difficulty in making himself acquainted , if beneath the fair exterior and the profession in which it is impossible to detect a flaw , he conceals an unregenerate heart , or if he has been mistaking the working of natural feelings for the presence and influence of the Spirit of God . in him , how is the Church to unmask the deception ? All that it can do , at best is to pronounce a judguient on the supposition that the statements to which it has listened are genuine . It is , therefore , after all , the profession of the individual himself which determines whether he is to be accepted or rejected . It is important that we should remember the limits within which our action in this matter is confined . Convetsatioa with a judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right would seek , if it is not insisted upon as a condition of communion , may do much to enlighten and help a man . It may be useful in guarding him against crude and hasty views , and may stir him up to a more searching selfscrutiny , help to quicken the sensitiveness of conscience , and elevate his entire conception of a Christian profession and its demands . It may teach him to discriminate between mere temporary excitement and true spiritual feeling , or supply encouragement and help where it is needed by those of timid and shrinking spirit ; but this kind of moral guidance and support is about all that one man can do for another here . Every man must beat his own burden and act for himself in the decision of the question , the most solemn with which any one can have to deal , whether he is prepared , knowing what Christian discipleship involves , to adopt the name and assume the responsibilities connected with it , and anything which has the slightest tendency to weaken the sense of his individual responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case with the ordinary mode of procedure in Congregational Churches . Great care may be , and generally is , taken to guard against the notion that the Church has pronounced the accepted candidate a Christian . But the fact remains that he has been subjected to such an investigation as it was thought necessary to institute , and that he has so far satisfied those by whom the enquiry has been conducted that lie has been welcomed to Christian fellowship . That fact tells with him far more than a thousand // cautions . He has passed the ordeal , and it is difficult tomake him understand that even those who have instituted it do not regard it as a decisive test . Thus the Church , intentionally or not , appears to asume a most onerous respobsibiity , and the man has obtained what he accepts as an implied assurance as to his own spiritual state , an assurance that will weigh little with those who are intent on working out their own salvation with fear and trembling , but which will be most greedily welcomed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . Most pastors of long experience will , I believe , testify that this is no imaginary or unfrequent evil ; but I fear that what comes under our observation gives but a very inadequate conception of the injurious influence that is exerted* The positive advantages of a system must be great indeed if they are sufficient to counterbalance the evil of fostering that self-deception to which the soul is only too prone . But will any one , who has had an extensive acquaintance with the working of the system , venture to say that such advantages have been secured , or that as a whole the results hsve been satisfactory ? It would not be sufficient , in order to justify such statement , to be able to prove that as a rule those who are accepted by the Church are consistent Christians , while those who remain outside show by their lives that they have had no experience of the practical power of the Gospel , and that the line which is drawn does , with such exceptions as might fairly be expected , represent with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so general a statement is not to be accepted without examination . There are some who would go so far as to pronounce it the very opposite of the truth ; but could it be shown to be true , it is really littie more than might be said of any system . There are certain marked features of religious character which it is almost impossible to ignore , and that those in whom they appear are ranked accordingly , is nothing very wonderfuL There are some who would be welcomed by any Church ; there are others who , if they were to seek admission , would be just as certainly rejected by any body which attempted to preserve the purity of its communion . It is by its action on other classes , in the detection of formalism or hypoerisy , or in the attraction of persons whose morbid conscientiousness would keep apart from those with whom they have nevertheless deep spiritual sympathy , that the ordinary usage is to be tried , and it is here that it has signally failed on both sides , in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it admits . It is a frequent subject of regret among all ministers that there are so many in their congregations of whose piety they entertain no doubt , who can not be persuaded to join th. fellowship of the Church . It is easy to say that their religion is imperfect , as it has not taught them to subdue the pride which rebels against **25;740;TOOLONG ; thatiftheirlovetoChrist were deeper they would be more willing to accept the cross which they are asked to bear for His sake , and that their reluctance to submit to the ordeal applied by the Church is itseif a proof that , whatever excellence they may possess , they are not fitted to enjoy the privileges of Christian fellowship . The charity which thinketh no evil ought to rebuke such harsh judgments , and facts continually prove that they are as fallacious as they are severe . Such reasoning , indeed , assumes all that has to be proved . If Christ has imposed this upon all who would be His faithful disciples , for them there must be an end of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if they are made by the Master , those who desire to // keep His commandments must cheerfully comply with them . But the ground on which the opposition to them rests is , that they are not made by the Master at all , and that from first to last , they are a human device , and a device inconsistent wTh** the genius of the Gospel and with Christ 's mode of treating human souls . He was ever tender , pitiful , mindful of the peculiarities of men 's temperaments and circumstances ; ready to welcome the faintest germ of penitence and faith , and to aid its development ; always encouraging the timid and helping the feeble . It was His glory that He would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax ; and how , it is asked , can it be supposed possible that He can lcok with approval on the system , which meets the soul at the very beginning of its pilgrimage with demands so onerous , that the timid and the sensitive are sure to recoil from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , that these barriers be thrown down , not because they appear formidable to themselves , but because they hold them to be unauthorized , and because they feel that they are calculated to repel those whom Christ , with His tender consideration for the weak and ignorant , would have encouraged and welcomed . It is not for those who have always maintained the rights of conscience themselves , to sneer at these scruples in others , and to impute to a want of Christian principle that which is the result rather of a desire to guard the liberty of the individual against the usurpations of the Church . Even if it should be considered that these objects are mistaken , it will scarcely be maintained that their mistake is sufficient to warrant their exclusion from fellowship , and yet that must be the case so long as the existing methods are preserved . They may find a home in other communities , but the doors of Congregationalism are barred against them . There can be little doubt that it does thus continually lose men whose lives would adorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence would contribute materially to the strength of any society with which they were connected . Nor do these constitute the only class thus kept outside . Timidity , quite as often as pride , leads men to shrink from the investigation of spiritual life , which our Churches have hitherto thought necessary . It may be said , and sad with truth , that the difficulties are greatly exaggerated , that the interview even with a couple of deacons is not so terrible a thing as the imagination paints it , and that the cases are rare in which there is anything that ought to disturb even the most sensitive or alarm the most timid . But such a plea really involves the most emphatic condemnation of the system . To represent the euquiry as so harmless and unmeaning , is really to abandon the only ground on which it could possibly be defended . If it is to have any value , it ought to be one of the most searching inquiries that can be instituted , conducted by the wisest and gravest men the Church can find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at an opinion on which the Church would be justified in acting . Notoriously this is not the case in a great number or instances , but this is the light in which it presents itself to outsiders ; and therefore it is that many , whose earnest pietyis beyond a question , shrink from the application of such a test , especially by those with whom they have little or no acquaintance , and either remain out side the Church , or having made up their minds to dare everything rather than lose the privilege of a Christian communion , prepare for the inquiry with a fear and trembling which , in several cases , I have known to be attended with serious consequences . My own doubts *s to the wisdom of the system were awakened years ago by observing the painful // effects produced on the physical and mental health of some candidates , for I could not but feel that Christ had never intended to impose suffering of that character on any of His disciples as a condition of their reception into ' *His Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantoms of their own creation , increases instead of relieves the difficulty . The only plea that could be urged for such a course is its necessity , but if the inquiry instituted be for the most part of a superficial , almost of a formal character , even that fails . As a safeguard for the purity of the Church it is illusive , and yet a grievous burden is laid upon the individual conscience . The fact is , if the inquiries were generally of the nature they ought to be , they would long since have become intolerable . It is only because they are generally made so easy that they have survived ; but in making them easy they are made practically worthless . It is said that the Church can not concern itself about exceptional cases , that it must provide against the admission of unworthy men , and that , if the plans it adopts for this purpose unhappily exclude those whom it would joyfully receive , it is one of those inevitable imperfections that attach to all human systems . The argument is specious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ends which a Church should seek to secure . It is meant to be a gathering of those who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity , and it should aim to embrace in its fellowship all who desire that privilege , and who possess this one qualification for enjo*ying it . It should not be more anxious to be pure than to be complete , and therefore should seek to include all who are Christians , as well as to exclude all who are not . It is not in any sense a private society , partaking of a character of a club , and entitled to lay down conditions which shall give it a selectness beyond that which is required by the law of its constitution . Admission to its communion is not a privilege which it can give or withhold at pleasure , or in relation to which it can lay down arbitrary laws , but a right which every Christian can demand . That Church can not answer to the true idea of a Church of Christ , which has regulations that exclude from it those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems obvious , but it has been and is constantly ignored in practice . Christian societies have continually acted , and do still act , on the assumption that they have rights of legislation as well as administration , that they can exact certain things from their members beyond those which Christ has prescribed in the New Testament , and that they are justified in depriving recusants of the benefits of Church fellowship . But , surely , if the spirituality of a Church is impaired by the introduction to its ranks of those who are not Christians , its catholicity is destroyed on the other hand when its laws interfere with the admission of those who are . It would be a thankless task to insist upon the utter insufficiency of the system as a guarantee for that purity for the sake of which it is preserved . There are few Uhurches whose records do not furnish melancholy evidence that a most careful and jealous watchfulness can not prevent the intrusion into the Church of men who have neither part nor lot in the great Christian heritage . No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sure to commit , but the question recurs-Why ask them to form a judgment at all ? They are not to be blamed for the natural and necessary mistakes they commit , but for taking upon themselves functions to which they are confessedly unequal , and in the discharge of which they are , as all experience shows , continually falling into error , fraught with most mischievous consequences . My own acquaintance with Congregational Churches enables me to assert with great confidence that the evils which might // have been expected to arise in the administration of such a polity are extremely rare , that it is not often that the gates of the Church are opened or closed in obedience to mere personal feeling , and that though many mistakes are made the ? are for the most part errors of judgment . But while this ought to be remembered in justice to the men , it does no thing to take away the force of the objection to the system . Those who are engaged in carrying it out may be , and in general I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are conscientiousljr anxious to do their duty . But a man may be eminently conscientious and very crotchetty , extremely narrow , capricious , and wayward in the formation of his opinions , disposed to attach importance to trifles and to underrate some of the clearest evidences of Christian character , and any one of these faults will detract from the value of his judgment . To discharge the duty assigned him with even a moderate degree of efficiency , there must be in his character a combination of qualities seldom met with . He should have great spiritual insight . but , at the same time , a power of ' holding his judgment in suspense , such as men with clear , intuitive perceptions seldom possess . He should have a sympathetic temperament so that he may win his way to the hearts of others , and at the same time possess the strength of mind which would preserve him from those too lenient and flattering estimates of character to which such a spirit would incline him . He must have the caution which would save him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally found to be in inverse proportion to he depth and reality of spiritual feeling , and yet he must have that hopeful trust which will teach him to recognize , even amid many signs of weakness and imperfection , the presence of a simple faith and a sincere love , as yet , perhaps , only in its beginnings , but on this very account needing to be met with genial confidence . Freedom from prejudice , boundless tact , large and varied experience , power to enter into the special difficulties of others , and considerate tende ' ness blended with keen discrimination , strictness that shall not degenerate into severity , charity that shall not be hlindly credulous , and last , but not least , confidence in his own judgment , associated with that humility which ought to he the great characteristic of a man called to such an oAlce , are qualities indispensable to those who are to guide the Church in its decisions as to those who seek its fellowship . The bare enumeration of them is sufficient to show how few there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Yet , according to present arran*ements , each Church ought to contain several . It can not be thought wonderful that they are not found , that the investigation is often of a most perfunctory kind , that there is nothing like uniformity in the judgments pronounced , that some err as much on the one side from comprehension , as others on that of restriction , and that Churches are continually discredited and distressed , as time and experience show them the mistakes they have committed . The remedy for these evils some would find in increased stringency of the preliminary investigations . But if the difficulty be , as most will admit , to find men who can conduct them with any approach to success , it is evident that no attempt to make them more severe will meet the case . The tendency of Congregational Churches has been for many years past in the contrary direction , and the changes which have been made have not lowered their character . The demands made upon candidates have been gradually relaxed . First , the oral statement made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted for it , and in most cases even this has been altogether discontinued or made optional . A considerahie // number of Churches have gone further still , and no longer insist on the visitation by the deacons and other members . There is a growing feeling that the system has not guarded against the evils it was intended to avert , and that it has itself created others of a very serious character ; that it is open to question ( to say the least ) whether the most free and libenal plan-one on which all who desired to make a public profession of faith in Christ , whose lives are in harmony with their profession , should be accepted-would have introduced a greater number of unworthy members , while it is certain that there is a tendency in the present plan to foster pride and exclusiveness in those who , having been received into the sacred circle themselves , fancy that they are invested thus with a right to pronounce on the fitness of others to join them . It is , perhaps , hardly to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedily , renounce the practices in which they have been educated ; but it wrn be something if they are led to recognize that these do not form an essential part of independency , and that those who advocate their disuse are just as zealous for the spirituality of the Church , and just as ready to adopt wise means for securing it , as those who most earnestly insist on their retention . It is not proposed to tamper with the basis of our Church constitution , namely , that the Church of Christ should consist only of those who are " sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints . " It is not desired even to abolish the necessity of a distinct act of public profession on the part of each member in that application for fellowship , which in the ordinary course would be received at one meeting and decided at the next ensuing . It is asked only that the Church should regard a profession as genuine , unless the life shows it to be the reverse , and that it should abandon the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving every one to feel that the act is solely his own , and that to his own Master he stands or falls . I firmly believe that the purity of the Church would be at least as secure on this plan , as on that at present in vogue , and that the adoption of it would sweep away many of the most serious hindrances to the spread of Congregationalism among the very classes whom it is most desirous to influence . It is unquestionable that the ranks of our Churches are recruited principally from the ranks of the young , that comparatively few candidates for admission are found amongst men of mature years and high culture , and that numbers who have grown up in our congregations , and who have not in eariy life entered the Church , continue to remain outside , though their lives indicate them to be sincere Christian men . The truth is , they are unwilling to face the ordeal which the Church has instituted . Age , education , every influence which increases the sensitiveness of a man , and indisposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold men back who yet painfully feel their position , and would , under another system , gladly enrol themselves among Christian professors . Is it wise or right for us to tell such men that they are too proud , that their shrinking from the test the Church thinks necessary is a sign of remaining corruption which they ought to put away , that the cost is trifling for a privilege so great ? Nothing is more flattering to our own self-complacency than to adopt a tone such as this ; - whether it be Christian , or wise , or edifying thus to sacrifice to our net , and to burn incense to our drag , is a very different question . We are certainly robbing ourselves of much strength , and the only thing that can justify a course which certainly operates as a serious discouragement to many godly souls , is a clear proof that we are obeying the commands of our Master . If such proof be not forthcoming , our procedure is as unchristian as it is suicidal " ( pp. 488-.502 ) . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its substance and for its source , worthy at least of very respectful consideration among Congregationalists ; and considering the complica* tion of our Cis-Atlantic usage with the miserable corruption of imposed creeds , its claim upon the attention of American Congregationalists is a very special one . It is not strange that when points like this have been raised in the course of sectarian controversy , or thrust at us by the shrewd , cynical wit of Dr. Holmes , they have failed of being very seriously pondered . The ab hoste doceri is doubtless right and noble , but it is not , ordinarily , human . We have here the counsels of an undoubted friend ; and from these it is easier to learn . The whole case , both pro and contra , will be before our readers if we add , from the second volume of Ecciesia , the remarks of that singularly acute disputant and lucid writer , the Rev. R. W. IDale , evidently , though not expressly , directed against the very essay by Mr. Rogers , in the first volume , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Congregationali*t usage on the point in question is to us not the least interesting part of what he has to say . " The customs of our churches vary ; fifty years ago it was not unusual to require the applicant for membership to appear at the church meeting , and to declare publicly his loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ ; and every member present had the right to propose any question to him relating to his personal religious history . In many churches , till very recently , every applicant for membership was expected to address a letter to the clrurch containing a profession of his religious faithnot of his theological creed  --  and some information concerning the circumstances and influences which led him to decide to live a Christian life . It is still usual for one or two of the members of the church to visit the candidate before he is received into fellowship ; and it is on their testimony and that of the pastor that the church determines whether he shall be received or rejected .

But we would suggest that the largest mischief from such bars to church communion is done , not in the case of those few who come almost to the point of approaching the Lord 's table , and turn back , and of whom a single pastor recalls two or three in eighteen years ; but in the case of the many who are hindered by these usages from coming near the church to begin with , and whom the pastor can not recall , because he never hears of them .

" It is also alleged against the traditional usage of Congregationalism , that the church ought not to assume the responsibility of affirming , even by implication , the sincerity of a man 's religious faith . " But there are few ministers who do not solemnly remind the new member that the vote of the church conveys no infallible assurance of eternal life . No man 's doubts of his own salvation are ever suppressed by the fact that his name is on the church roll .

Let us conclude these extracts with the sound and instructive paragraph in which Mr. Dale presents his own strictures on the // method of administration of the usages which on the whole he would have preserved : " The real ground on which , as it seems to me , the customs of Congregational Churches are open to objection , is this : - they appear to imply that as soon as a man has received the life of God , the life will so distinctly reveal itself in new forms of thought and emotion , that there will never be any difficulty in recognizing its presence . This is a very grave mistake . The first movements of the supernatural life are generally very obscure . It must gather strength before it can manifest itself in an unequivocal manner . In innumerable cases the consciousness of regenoration does not immediately follow trust in Christ . We rely upon Him for redemption from this present evil world ; but very often , months and even years pass by before there is any vivid sense of actual redemption . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth may not at once be capable of direct verification either to the regenerate person himself or to others , every man who trusts in Christ receives immediately both the pardon of sin and the gift of eternal life . But the usages of Congregational Churches appear to suggest that faith in Christ and the regeneration , which , as we know , is granted in immediate response to faith , are not adequate qualifications for church membership ,  --  that there must also be certain developments of the supernatural life , sufficiently determinate and sufficiently obvious to demonstrate their supernatural origin to other Christian peopie . We wait trn the regenerate children of God are able to speak and to walk , before we are willing to receive them into the divine " household . " All that we have a right to ask for is an assurance of personal trust in Christ ; wherever this exists , our own faith should make us certain that whether or not we can discern the signs of regeneration , the man is really regenerate.
