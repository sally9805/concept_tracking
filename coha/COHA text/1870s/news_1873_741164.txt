txt unfortunate for the Senate that it has thus far disappointed the friends of Reform in its action on the charter . It is true that Mr. WOODIN , having taken the advice of Mr. WOOD , and withdrawn for a time from the stilling atmosphere of the Capitol , discreetly abandoned his tripleneeded appointing machine , which on Friday he was certain was precisely the thing required to remove all the grievances under which this City suffers . But be , unhappily , did not get enough of pure air , and replaced his favRrite of last week with a scheme which is as vicious in principle , as it leaves in office the present Commissioner of Public Works , Corporation Counsel , President of the Department of Parks , and President of Police , leaving the Mayor to nominate , and with the consent of the Aldermen . to appoint , the remaining heads of departments . That the Senate should adopt such a scheme as this can be explained only by supposing that many Senators assumed it would be abandoned in a conference committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of these retained officeis to receive this mark of favor from the Republican Party , but leaving this point wholly out of the question , the schen ' ? is indefensible . It is , practically , the naming of municipal officers at Albany , which the Republican Party found , in connection with the metropolitan commissions , to be , as dangerous in practice as it was vicious in principle , It is in flagrant violation of the idea of local self-government , for if the Legislature can appoint four of our municipal officers . it can with equal propriety appoint them all . That the Senate is prepared to take this position we . do not believe , and , therefore . suppose that the way is left open to recede from the scheme Mr. WOODIN managed to force through yesterday , with the help of Mr. MADDEN , whose natural antipathy to an honest man led him to indulge in seine reckless abuse of Controller GREEN . If the Senate proposes to be dominated permanently by such influences as plainly dictated its action yesterday , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second scheme of Mr. WOODlN , the Senate neutralized the good they accomplished in compelling him to abandon his first . In the end . it , too , must be repudiated. and valuable time is lost in granting it a few days of precarious life . Senators are beginning to feel the force of public sentiment , and it is evident will finally be compelled to choose between what they know it demands and . what is asked.by the politicians . Heretofore it has been difficult to say that the Senate was aware of the condition of the public mind upon this vital point of the charter , but the abandonment of the tscheme first proposed by Mr. WOODIN shows that they now know what is expected at their hands . They know that the people require them to adopt the Lowery amendment , without the obnoxious proviso which was attached to it , and any attempt to smuggle anything else through a conference committee will meet with such proofs of popular disapproval as those engaged in it will long remember . In dealing with the details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands , as in its determination on the appointing power . The failure to clothe the Controller with full power to cut off sinecures is not creditable , and the propositions to increase the Board of Police to five , as made by Mr. WOODIN , and adopted by the Senate , can not be defended . The Department of Public Works being left under one commissioner , the increase in the number of Police Commissioners becomes still more questionable . If one head . is enough for the great Department of Public Works , surely three are sufficient for the Police . The only defense for the provision is , that/it will afford places for additional dependents on political patronage , and some Senator should be honest enough to make it . If the Senate can do no better with the charter than it did . yesterday , it may as well send it back to the Assembly at once . Even a conference committee can be depended upon to show more courage and wisdom .               @ @ @ @ @ @
