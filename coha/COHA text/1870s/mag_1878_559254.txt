VI . UNDER the gospel , there is no dispute about the destiny of the righteous , that is , the truly penitent and believing ; but the question that is more and more agitating the religious world relates exclusively to the wicked , that large , heterogeneous class of ignorant , vicious , ungodly people , in their innumerable grades of depravity-heathen , Mohammedan , nominally Christian , infidel , or atheist-who live in rebellion against God , or in alienation from him , and die as they have lived . What is to become of them ? I hardly need say how this question is answered . A few have accorded to them the " sad cure* ' of annihilation ; a larger number has confidently remanded them to the mercy of God ; while the great mass of the Church has delivered them over-some in sorrow of heart , some with cold indifference , and others with apparent satisfaction  --  to the endless torments of hell ! But in the progress of our Christian civilization , through better thinking and broader sympathies , this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications . The doctrine of infant damnation has utterly disappeared frQrn Protestant Christendom , though we recognize its traces in some existing creeds . The relative numbers of the lost and saved have been reversed , and , instead of the great majority of our race being damned , the severest school of orthodoxy now assures us that the number of the finally lost will be " very inconsiderable . " Even hell and its horrors have not escaped this modifying process . An abyss of literal fire and brimstone , in which the wicked are burned , soul and body , without intermission and without end , is now seldom preached , and intelligent and candid men agree that " whatever high-wrought // pictures we find of God 's anger , or its continuance , we must hold fast to the primal truths which make God dear to our affections as our pitying Father , or venerable as our holy Judge . " So the old grounds of reason , on which the doctrine of endless punishment was formerly made to rest , have all been laid aside , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , the prooftexts of the doctrine , with which the Bible was once thought to be studded , have become fewer and fewer , and generally with an ever-lessening force , till now learned men fail entirely to find it in the Old Testament , and many orthodox clergymen of scholarship and talents begin to doubt whether " everlasting punishment , " in the New , is absolutely without end ! All this shows beyond question what are the tendencies of modern religious thought ; and no one can fail to observe that the whole movement is in one direction . In nothing but its eternity is the doctrine of endless punishment to-day what it was a century ago , and even this is no longer held with the same undoubting confidence . The heart and the head of all the better portions of the Christian world accept it only under an avowed or tacit protest . Such is the result of a hundred years of controversy upon this subject ! This discussion , in the oldest and most influential periodical of its class in the country , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strangely enough , they both start professedly from common principles . Both believe in the one living and true God ; both acknowledge the divine mission and infallible teachings of Christ ; both accept the Holy Scriptures as containing a revelation of the Divine will and the character of the Divine government ; and yet , in their interpretation of these fundamental facts and the issues of this government , they come to conclusions widely different , and , in some respects , antagonistic . I shall call one of these schools the Universalist , and the other , by courtesy , the Orthodox . The point of difference and antagonism between them , now under discussion , is simply the eternity of 8ifl . The Universalist theology , which it is the design of this paper to exhibit and recommend , recognizes sin as a very evil and bitter thing , terrible in its character and consequences  --  the only evil , we may almost say , that we know . It is an evil , however , incidental to the development of free moral powers , and rela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be overcome and wholly eliminated from the universe of God , by those retributive and redemptive processes , revealed in Scripture and manifested in providence , which the Infinite Wisdom and Love hold in their hand , and know so well how to employ , and which they will employ in a way perfectly suited to man as a free moral being , without destroying his personality or violating his freedom . The Orthodox theology , on the contrary , holds , if I understand it , that sin is , in its very nature , or is to become , by some divine appointment , absolutely endless , and in a portion of God 's moral creation , and perhaps with ever-increasing malignity and force , is to exist and reign through all eternity , followed by a train of woes and horrors which the human mind labors in vain to conceive . The Universalist theology has the advantage , it will be seen , of ending in a general harmony , while the Orthodox ends in an eternal discord ; the former in unity , the latter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing side by side ; one , that of Christ , the other , that of Satan , both equally indestructible and equally enduring ! To be self-consistent , this system should begin with dualism , as it ends . Then moral evil would have an eternal ground , and be self-existent , as goodness is , and be enthroned in Satan , as goodness is in God . But such a theory of the moral universe , common as it was in the ancient world , breaks down , under the light of reason , from the very necessities of the case , and is refuted and overthrown completely by revelation . There is , there can be , but one God , and he is good . Sin is not " from everlasting , " as God is . It had a beginning , and may therefore have an end-nay , must have an end-unless we are willing to adopt the absurdity that unspotted holiness and perfect love can will its infinite perpetuation ! Sin , so far as we know , is purely our own work . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote it , without denying himself . When he made man in his own image , he made him a personal being , and in that , rational and moral . But , to be moral , man must be free ; and in a finite being freedom is inconceivable only as it involves the po&amp;9i6ility of sin . Side by side with these transcendent gifts stands forever this unavoidable peril . For this possibility let God , if you please , be held accountable : that sin has become actual is solely our fault . Here // is at once our dignity and danger . But , in contemplating the danger , let us not forget that it is the sole condition of virtue , and all the moral goodness and greatness , the love , the self-sacrifice , that have thrown their glory over our race , and all the happiness , past , present , or future , that deserves the name . In making such creatures as we are , with all our liability to sin , God was wanting in neither wisdom nor goodness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may continue to sin on and on forever ; and it is the constant effort of our modern orthodoxy , as it is its urgent necessity , to show that it will actually do so . iRev . Mr. Cook delighted a Boston audience of this school with a series of propositions claiming to prove that , under irreversible natural law , there may exist in the universe eternal 8in ; and even President Porter suggests that it may be a law of our being that , when once we sin , we overleap a barrier along the path of goodness and life , which we shall never effectually desire to recross , and that every underlying purpose which we call sinful may , in its very nature , be permanent and eternal . Has God , then , so carefully provided in the laws of our nature for the eternity of sin , and thus for our final damnation ? Let us hope , for the honor of his name , that the moral economy of the universe has not been ordained by Infinite Wisdom and Holiness , chiefly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally to crown it with immortality . If , as we are assured by reason and revelation , God sees the end from the beginning , and if , as Dr. Dwight said , and as the Bible said long before him , " the whole moral character of God is love , an intense and eternal flame of uncompounded good-will , " is it to be believed that he ever has created , or ever can create , a single human soul , whose existence shall prove , even through its own fault , an endless and infinite curse ? Nor does it avail to say that the sinner , " if left to himself , " would never return to truth and goodness . The very supposition is inadmissible . God never intended to leave the sinner to himself , and could not do so without renouncing the moral responsibilities he willingly assumed in his creation . If he foresaw that he could not govern and would not save the sinning soul , that was reason enough that he should not create it . Men habitually speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he himself has conferred , but he permits no sin with approval , concession , or indifference . He protests // against it ; he arms against it the sinner 's own conscience , and menaces it with righteous punishment . " The chief end of man is to glorify God , and to enjoy him forever . " So says a half-forgotten catechism , which in this taught better than it knew . This is what man was made for , the final cause of his creation . Nor has God through all the ages ever relinquished this original purpose , or for a moment lost sight of it . Slowly it may seem , but surely , he is carrying forward his work toward its completion , and in the end an admiring and grateful universe will acknowledge that he has done all things well . To this grand result is tending the whole government of God . Justice and mercy , law and gospel ; have but one object , and are alike overarched by infinite love . The final victory of good over evil is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of revelation . Sin had no sooner entered the world , than there came , as llengstenberg says , " the consolatory promise that the dominion of sin , and of the evil arising from sin , shall not last forever . " That promise was repeated in various forms and with increasing light till the IMlessiah , to whom it pointed , finally appeared , and no candid reader can fail to recognize the tone of universality running through the whole Bible . The seed of the woman was to bruise the serpent 's head , and so destroy his power ; in the seed of Abraham all the families of the earth were to be blessed ; all nations whom God has made were to come and worship before him ; all souls are God 's . In the New Testament this is still more striking . " God so loved the world ; " " Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world ! " " The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " " He tasted death for every man ; " " He is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world . " Under the very shadow of the cross , Christ said : " Now is the judgment of this world ; now shall the prince of this world be cast out . And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself ; " a declaration of wonderful scope and power , and as wonderfully slurred over by the commentators . St. John testified that " the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world ; " and St. Paul that he has " highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name ; that at the name of Jesus every knee should // bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth , and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father . " Through repentance toward God , and faith in our ILord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the apostle assures us that he must continue his redemptive work till lie has subdued all things to himself , when , sin having been abolished and death destroyed , the kingdom shall be delivered up to the Father , that GOD MAY BE ALL fl ALL . TuoMAs J. SAWYER . VII . Ix closing this discussion , I shall give my reasons for holding that the doctrine of eternal punishment is not offensive to the moral reason , so as to require us to deny that Christ has taught it , or to affirm that , if he has , Christianity can not be from God . I must assume the fact of sin . The participants in this discussion , with perhaps one exception , all assume this . Mr. Frothingham uses words in a very strange fashion , or else in a sense from which I must earnestly dissent , when he asserts that " none but theologian8 admit " that God is personal and good ; that man is personal and responsible , and that a moral relation exists between them . I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " posit " these truths , but that , when I assert them , " I speak as a man , " and with the majority of men as they utter their convictions in language , and enshrine them in literature , and recognize them in society , and imply them in law , and embody them in institutions . There may be a scanty few whose wishes , borrowing wings of their imaginations , fly so high above realities as to fail to discern them as they are , or whose factitious or abnormal culture " consigns to " the limbo of " spoiled phraseology " the most sacred relations of human nature . Mr. Frothingham must speak as a theologian , and not as a man , when he would have us believe that " the moral order of the world " to " the rational thinkers " involves neither freedom , nor responsibility , nor retribution . A sinful will is the most dangerous and destructive of all evil forces . It is self-relying , self-justifying , and self-perpetuating . It gathers new force if let alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or many passions cruel , debasing , and malignant . Kow and then a human being exemplifies what this evil is in its nature and tendencies . The houses in which such men dwell , and the places in which they congregate , are in common parlance known as hells , in sober truth and with horrid significance . And yet sin exists by the permission of God . In Dr. Sawyer 's language , " he respects the powers which himself has conferred , " at the same time that he is most opposed to the abuse of them in sin , and desires most earnestly that men should abandon it . Why , then , does he suffer sin to be ? The only answer that can be given is found in the freedom which is essential to personality . God can not exercise personal influences except with persons , and personality involves the possibility of perversion . " For this possibility let God , if you please , be responsible , " says Dr. Sawyer ; " that sin has become actual is our fault . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in permitting it , and in punishing it , who shall say that he may not be good should he permit a person to continue to exist , and to continue to sin and to suffer ? Dr. Bellows asserts that God would dishonor his own personality , should he " voluntarily bring into an existence , which he foresaw would be infinitely miserable , a single spiritual being made in his image . " Dr. Sawyer says that God could not leave the sinner finally to himself , " without renouncing the moral responsibilities he willingly assumed in his creation . " I would submit that those who concede that God can permit the sin which he hates , and the sinner whom he must punish , to exist at all , can not assert that God is morally bound not to create a being who he foreknows will sin forever . We may not know why God creates such a being , but we have no such moral insight as warrants us in saying that no reasons are possible which justify him in doing it . The existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one comprehensive mystery . This is expressed in the problem , How could God create a being , and suffer him to sin at all ? When this has been conceded to be consistent with the Creator 's goodness , we assert , ethical grounds , that he mio'ht not can not on b create a being who he foresees would sin and suffer forever . All of which we are ethically sure is , that he detests the sin , and that he has made the creature capable of sinning for some other // reason than because he desires that he should sin . Iliad Drs . Bellows and Sawyer been asked , before sin existed , whether a perfect God could make a being in his own image who would dishonor that image by sin , they would have said " No  --  a thousand times no ! " - by the logic which they use against the possibility of continued sin in the kingdom of God . I can not resist the impression that , when lDrs . Sawyer and Bellows are confronted with sin as a fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they face the possibility of sin , they resolve it by a theory of development or fate , which makes the fact of sin a blessing . But , leaving these a priori considerations , let us take a nearer view of the Christian doctrine of the present life , and its relations to another . Dr. Bellows objects to viewing this life as " a state of probation , " which is brought to a " finality " by the act of God . I agree with him that this life is " a state of education and of discipline , " if I may add , " for a race which needs to be recovered or redeemed , " and provided I may emphasize the truth that Christ in his life and death is the central force , who disciplines sinful men to a perfected character in a perfect life . This theory of human life is taught by Christ himself in his conversation with Nicodemus : " God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solves the enigma of human life , with its sorrows and joys , its smiles and team . This is the key to human history , whether of the observant human being , or of the great evolutions of national and race life , that are directed by Christ 's agency , toward the redemption of the earth . But education , if it trains and disciplines , may also test and divide ; indeed , it must , if the education is moral and its subjects are free , and are capable of resisting its benign influences . A time may properly come when such influences may end , because they are proved to be useless . Christ declares this will be true of some . In the conversation referred to , which says that our human life is warned and cheered by light and love from himself , he says there are those who reject him , and are judged , and " this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men have loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed in another life ? It is certainly conceivable that it should , and under circumstances such as Dr. Bellows describes , which would seem to be far more favorable than those which fall to the lot of many in the present life . It is certain that it would be furnished were there promise of better results . Christian influences reach farther than many men conceive of . Christian civilization and redemption can win hearts in strange ways to the germ and promise of a better life . He that gives a cup of cold water , with any Christian aspiration , will not lose his reward . We can judge very imperfectly of the results that actually come to many on whom the recovering influences of the present life may seem to have been worse than lost . Of this we are certain , that not a seedcorn , that has under genial influences been warmed into the first movings of germinant life , shall be overlooked by the loving Redeemer , who is also the scrutinizing Judge , but every such germ shall sprout and grow under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be urged that faith , as the condition of life , is too narrow to satisfy our ethical judgment , inasmuch as the possibility of faith in Christ is necessarily very restricted . I do not undertake to defend the narrow dogmatism on this point of many so-called Christian theologians , or the practical uncharities of any ecclesiastical bigots . But I may assume that the only possible condition of entrance into Christ 's happy future life is the possession of the elements of a character in sympathy with its atmosphere . This sympathy is , for practical purposes , properly and adequately described as tested by faith , either actual or implicit , in Christ as a person , conspicuously in the relations in which he is prominently known . Hence the test , " He that believeth is saved , and he that rejects is condemned . " It is obvious that this test can in form be applied only to those who know of him . The Master himself taught most clearly that many who have never heard of him should be gathered into his kingdom . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so badly represented as to'reject the caricature of his person , in the spirit of the faith in his real character are in heart true believers . Then , too , when the future life begins , every man will see Christ as he is , and the sight of him may of itself bring af*nality to his character and destiny as it discovers each man fully to himself . // They that pierced him shall mourn , but not if , when they see him , they mourn that they pierced him . The next life may be another probation , in that , by its first revelations , it shall make everything clear which was dark , and bring out in vivid lines that moral and spiritual truth which the soul shall accept with sympathizing joy , or reject with sinful perverseness ; and , as it accepts or rejects , shall know its own character and its just award . It is certain that , unless this conviction of justice is produced , there is no hell worthy to be feared , and no heaven worthy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life may be at once the soul 's second probation and its final judgment . Christ may be manifested to every awakening spirit in the same indivisible instant as the accepted or rejected Saviour , and as the rewarding or condemning Judge . Whether the wakening be gradual or abrupt , whether the manifestations be as sudden as lightning at noonday or as gentle as the insensible approaches of the dawn , the soul may as unerringly and as justly find its own place in the spiritual world as after ages of purgatorial discipline . " The Dream of Gerontius , " by John Henry Newman , is an attempt to elevate the doctrine of purification by literal fire into the dignity of a spiritual operation , wrought by the manifestation of Christ as a person to the disembodied spirit . In the words of his guiding angel , who conducts him to Christ " The eager spirit has darted from my hold , And , with the intemperate energy of love , Flies to the dear feet of Emmanuel ; But ere it reach them , the keen sanctity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes And circles round the Crucified , has seized And scorched , and shriveled it ; and now it lies Passive and still before the aWful throne . Oh , happy , suffering soul ! for it is safeConsumed , yet quickened by the glance of God . " The scene was , doubtless , suggested by the words in the vision of John , " And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . " These words may be no more than literal truth to those who bring out of the present ilfe a character that in its aims and spirit is antagonistic to the King and Judge of the life that is to be . The effect of his manifested presence on those who love and honor him prevailingly , however feebly and inconsistently , is // more nobly conceived than by Newman in those other words of John : " It doth not appear what we shall be , but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with the perfect life-whatever of wood , or hay , or stubble-shall be consumed by the brightness of Christ 's spotless purity , " but the man himself shall be saved , yet so as by fire . " But we are using figurative language . Doubtless we are . Every man must use figurative language who thinks or writes of the future life . This brings up the ethical objections which are urged against the terrific sensuous imagery that abounds in the New Testament . These delineations , we know , have been very generally interpreted in their literal sense ; and out of them painters and poets and preachers have wrought fearful and even horrible pictures , which have either stupefied or bewildered the young and the sensitive , and have not infrequently weakened or destroyed the spiritual comfort and effect which they were designed to symbolize . Jeremy Taylor and Jonathan Edwards are examples of those whose genius and piety have not preserved them from grossly erring in this fashion . Against the imagery which we find in the Scriptures , when taken as imagery , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of historic candor can make any show of objection . Many of these images are taken from those agents of terror which are familiar to the race : fire , tempest , darkness , chains of darkness , weeping , wailing , etc . Not a few are peculiar to the Hebrew theocracy , its history and its prophetic symbolism . They did not offend the ethical sense of the men to whom , nor the times when , they were used . They enforce spiritual truth which is important for all times concerning the issues of another life . The great teacher and his apostles who used them are no more responsible for misconceptions of their import in this particular than for the countless other errors and misconceptions under which Christianity itself has been wellnigh materialized and destroyed . That eternal punishment has been enforced by symbols and words which have been unwisely and untruly used is no reason for rejecting the doctrine to which every man's conscience assents as possibly true . It is not the eternity but Me severity of the punishment which these images illustrate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a preacher of annihilation , is especially offensive for his use of these literal pictnres of horror . Not a few ill-instructed and exciting preachers content themselves with the use of sensational imagery to excite alarm , and overlook the fearful spiritual possibilities of sin , and the certain horrors of which even the present life furnishes such terrible foreshowings . Mr. W. IR . Greg , in his " Enigmas of Life , " chapter vii. , " Elsewhere , " has entered a passionate protest against Christian theologians for their material delineations of heaven and hell . And yet , after concluding this protest , he gives a theory of possible , nay , of certain , retribution , which , in its horrors and joys , excites far more serious terror and hope than any of those pictures by theologians which so shock and repel him . He says : " Surely , surely , it is not impossible to imagine a future world in such force and coloring as shall be easy and natural to realize , as shall be not only pos8Thle to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for an existence after death , then ( unless a miracle is worked to prevent it ) that existence MU5T be one of retribution to the sinful , and of purgatorial suffering to the frail and feeble soul . " And he justifies his thesis by the powerful ethical portraitures that follow of the hell and the heaven which the wicked and the good can not but create for themselves , under the revelations and influences of their future spiritual existence . He overlooks one element only , which Christianity and Christ can supply , that of help and hope from a loving person , who awakens gratitude and love to himself , and thus secures victory over sin , and consequently over every form of death . This is the moral " miracle " which proves Christianity to be needed and to be divine . I have confined myself to the ethical aspects of this doctrine , as the necessary preliminary to an unbiased interpretation of the declarations of Christ and the apostles . While it is important that Christian believers and preachers should be agreed in their interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should maintain those ethical views of the relation of character to salvation , which can make Christianity a hope of anything worth caring for , or " the endless life " which it promises a " power " for man 's real redemption .
