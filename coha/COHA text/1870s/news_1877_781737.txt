The Nark Lane Express , the organ of the grain trade , observes , " Farming as a business is certainly at as low au ebb as any other branch of production can be . * ' Indeed , those farmers will be fortunate who do nut find themselves at the end of the agricultural year to be poorer than they were at the beginning of it  --  au unpleasant revelation , which too many of them had to face last year when they came to balance their accounts . " And the worst of it is that this depression is likely to last . There is apparently no possibility of land , under existing conditions , affording the tenant fanner a better living .
