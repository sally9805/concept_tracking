txt President GRANT 'S Administration opens the third year of its term with a reduction for the month of the national debt of $11,011 , - 250 65 . This is about two millions in excess of the average monthly reduction of last year , ana nearly double the amount of reduction effected in March , 1870 . It brings the total decrease since the advent to power of the present Administration to $215,765,663 74 , and leaves as the total of interest and principal of our public debt of $2,434,076,643 06 . Taking the basis of our population at thirty-nine millions , this gives us a proportion of $62.4 per head as the measure of our national obligations . In England the existing proportion is about $123 per head , and in 1866 our own was over one hundred dollars . Such figures are more eloquent than the complaints of scores of political croakers .

The Commune remains master of the situation , and . Paris is , for the time , at least , a sovereign and independent unity . To do the Socialists justice , they have not yet lost the power of keeping their heterogeneous following in check . Up to the latest advises , there is no evidence of acts of pillage , and the only executions have been political ones . The true test of the moderation of the insurgents will come when the National Government finds itself strong enough to fight them . If Paris , face to face with civil war , does not give itself up to license and general confiscation of the goods of absent citizens , the supporters of the " Universal Republic " will have earned a much more respectable character than most people are now prepared to accord them .

These assume the form of a notice to " druggists and patent-medicine dealers " concerning the price of an abominable preparation , but are freely sent to the houses of private families . Until the Police force of this City is awakened to a thorough effort to apply the provisions of existing statutes to the professors of the hideous traffic which finds Its culminating point in the Fifth-avenue mansion , we do not see how respectable people can help having disgusting circulars placed in the way of their sons and daughters .

The Episcopalian has some timely suggestions regarding the necessity of curtailing the prevalent senseless waste of money on funeral expenses . Not only are " undertakers ' bills a heavy assessment upon the poor , " and one which frequently entails very great hardship to meet , but the conventional redundancy of absurd pageantry on an occasion where simplicity is eminently desirable , involves a sacrifice of becoming sentiment as well as of money . All classes of our community are open to the charge of introducing features into the last offices of the dead ' which contribute neither to their solemnity nor decorum .

The most shameless of the two managers appeared in patties last Fall as a Democrat of straitest sect . Two conspicuous members of the Tammany triumvirate are In the Erie directory . The Democrats in the Railroad Committee vote to maintain the usurpation which Gov .
