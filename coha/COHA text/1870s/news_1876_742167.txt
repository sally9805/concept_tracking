txt The Democratic leaders are bent on getting power at any cost . Ever since it became certain that 185 Electors had been chosen to vote for Gen. HAYEs and Mr. WitEEaxa , tricks of the most shameful kind have been tried to hinder that result . In Nebraska , where the vote had to be cau1 vassed by the Legislature , Democratic members of that body left the State to prevent a quorum from assembling for that purpose . In Florida , persons officially required to forward the returns , or to perform other acts necessary to the completion of the election , were violently detained or interrupted in their duties . In South Carolina a venal court was induced to interfere in the hope of preventing the legal counting of the votes . In Louisiana , every effort was made to overthrow public confidence in the Returning Board , and to prevent their exercise of their clear powers . In the meantime , lying dispatches have been sent throughout the country , for the purpose of inducing some one Elector to betray his trust , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unheard-of treachery of a Republican Elector voting for a third candidate , in order to throw the election into the House . The South has been ransacked by Mr. TILDEN 's agents seeking some Republican official able and willing to change the result for a. bribe . On Tuesday it was openly boasted by Democrats in Washington that a member of the Board of Canvassers in Florida had been bought to give the vote of the State to TILDEN . Yesterday one of the Electors of the State of South Carolina was approached with an offer of $10,000 if he would give his vote to the Democracy , security for four times that amount being very properly and naturally tendered . ' In Louisiana a bribe of ten times this amount was offered . To the honor of the Republican Party , Mr. TILDEN , with his great and ill-got fortune , has been unable to accomplish his corrupt purposes , nor has any Republican been base enough to adopt the course proposed by the Nation . Failing to secure a Republican instrument , he has turned to the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in defiance of law and right , to issue a certificate to a Democratic Elector for the purpose of securing the one vote needed for a majority in the Electoral College . How far such a scheme is likely to succeed is hardly worth very serious ' discussion . It is only necessary here to call attention to the fact that , even by the pretensions of the Democrats , the certificate was issued in contradiction to the will of the people , and with the intent of giving to the minorty the powers of the majority . Obviously , the policy of Mr. TILDEN and his party is that of the most dangerous and wicked usurpation . Whether it succeeds or not , the steady effort that has been made to force it to success must be terribly demoralizing , because it tends to accustom the public to the tactics of gamblers in the prosecution of public aims . Hit could succeed , it would go far toward making republican institutions in our country a sad and disgraceful failure . The Democratic House has not been behind the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency in order to secure its political ends . This is shown by its conduct in the case of the Representative of the State of Colorado , in that of the Representative of the Second District of South Carolina , and in that of the appointment of investigation committees in the South . 1 . Colorado is a State in the Union . It was enacted by Congress at its last session , the present House concurring , when it was certified to the President that a Constitution , with certain provisions , had been adopted , he should proclaim Colorado a State in the Union , without further action by Congress . The Constitution was adopted ; its adoption was certified to the President ; and Colorado became a State . Yet the Democratic House refuses to receive its Representative on the ground that the State may not have yet been admitted . For the first time in the history of the country the House refuses to accept as prima facie evidence of election the credentials of a Governor whose authority is undisputed . Plainly , if such a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat any member or members , however authoritative their credentials , until a majority , may be reduced to a minority , and the minority may elect its Speaker , the Speaker may appoint his committees , and the machinery of legislation may pass into the hands of the usurping members . 2 . In the Second District of South Carolina the House assumed power still more recklessly . The Representative in this district was elected by 8,000 majority ; an unsworn protest was presented against his admission by a dozen private citizens of the district , containing statements , some of which are notoriously untrue . The House thereupon refused to admit the Representative , and referred his case to a committee which need never report . This , and the foregoing precedent , were made with a purpose . If the next House should , by the filling of vacancies occurring meantime , be Republican , the Democratic minority ou meeting , presided over by . a Democratic Clerk , will arbitrarily refuse seats to enough Republicans to leave themselves the power to elect a Speaker and to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees to the South required a suspension of the rules by a two-thirds majority , which was declared to have been received . In this declaration , the vote of Mr. PLAISTED , of Maine , was announced in the negative , but was not counted , and did not get recorded in the negative . The next day Mr. PaarsrED demanded that the journal should be corrected , and his vote recorded , by which the resolution would have bean rogeinded . The leader of the Democrats , Mr. HOLMAN , arrogantly argued against allowing this simple act of justice , and the Speaker sided with him , until a Democrat from Indiana claimed that his vote had not been recorded in the affirmative . This restored the balance . The Speaker allowed the two corrections , and then by his casting vote secured the adoption of the resolutions . These are specimens of the temper of the Democrats . They show what the country has to expect in the way of unscrupulous usurpation , and what it must be prepared to meet .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
