ARTICLE V.-THE PACIFIC RAILROADS AND THE GOVERNMENT . ( SECOND ARTICLE . ) AT the completion of the Pacific Railroad the Government had issued its six per cent . thirty year currency bonds as subsidies to the road and its branches under the act of 1802 to the amount of about sixty-four millions of dollars . Of these , nearly fifty-five millions had been received by the Union and Central Pacific Companies , or about twenty-seven and a quarter millions by each company . The interest on these bonds , and their principal as they matured iii 1895-9 must of course be met by the Government , but by the terms of the act ( as amended ) , they constituted a second mortgage " on the whole line of railroad and telegraph , together with the rolling stock , fixtures , and property of every kind and description . " As additional security the act provided that the Government might annually reserve one half of the current indebtedness to the companies for mail and other transportation services ; and fhrther that , " after said road is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least five per centum of the net earninas of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment thereof . " We have already explained in a former Article how Congress in the midst of the Credit Mobilier excitement directed the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold all payments for freight or transportation services of any kind to the amount of the interest on the government bonds and five per cent . of the roads ' net earnings , with a provision that the companies might bring suit in the Conrt of Claims to recover such retained freight and transportation dues . This controversy , with the decisions upon it in the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court against the Government , were also adverted to . The Supreme Court rendered its decision in October , 1875 , and held it to be the clear meaning of the charter that the companies were not bound to make any payments to the Government on account // of its bonds , principal or interest , until their maturity , except to the amount annually of one half the government transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notwithstanding these decisions , prudence dictated to the companies that some movement should be begun by them at an early day toward providing for this ultimate payment . Indeed , several months previous to these decisions they had themselves called the attention of the Government to the subject and made overtures for an arrangement by which a sinking fund should be established for the extinction of the debt , and all controversies precluded with respect to it . This proposition was favorably received , and was made the subject of deliberation and conference between the representatives of the roads and officers of the Government , and members of Congress ; but when the amount of annual contribution to be made by the companies toward such a sinking fund beyond the amount they were already legally bound to pay came up for adjustment , a difference which had before been developed between the companies and the government authorities came prominently into discussion and proved to be irreconcilable . This difference related to the legal interpretation of the phrase net earnings , " as used in the above quoted provision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the surplus or profits which annually remained after paying their operating expenses and the interest on their funded debts . Of these funded debts the Union Pacific alone had beside its first mortgage bonds ( twenty-seven millions ) whose lien was prior to the government bonds , about twenty millions of land grant and income bonds , in all some forty-seven millions of indebtedness , the annual interest on which ( amounting to some $600,000 ) must be paid in addition to their operatin* expenses out of their earnings , or the company go into bankruptcy . This interest liability the companies maintained was a charge on their property , essential to its preservation and to the continuance of their business as much as their running expenses , and should therefore be added to the operating expenses before " net earnings , " within the inerming of the chartei ' , could be ascertained . The Government insisted that no such addition should be made , and that the " net earnings " referred to by the act were the entire surplus remaining // after operating expenses were paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . So that , although in any year this surplus should be just sufficient or even insufficient to pay the first mortgage interest , the Government was still entitled to five per cent . on account of its second mortgage bonds , in preference even to claims of the first mortgage creditors . Thus , although the Kansas Pacific Company was barely earning the interest on its first mortgage bonds beyond operating expenses , the Government has retained its transportation dues under this claim of " five per cent . net earnings , " and has actually forced the company into bankruptcy . The Government also maintained that the companies had not only estimated their " net earnings , " and the five per cent . government dues thereon , on a wrong basis , but that under the clause of the act which required such five per cent . payments annually " after the road should be completed , " they were in arrears since July , 1869 , when it was opened for business . To this the companies replied that from 1869 to September , 1874 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the road as completed and to issue their land patents accordingly , and that it was inconsistent for the Government now to fix any other date as the date of completion than that of its own acceptance . In order to enforce the government claim for these arrears , Congress directed the Attorney General " to commence suits in the proper Circuit Courts of the United States against the several roads which had been aided under the acts of 1862 and 1864 , and to prosecute the same with all convenient despatch to a final determination . " In pursuance of this direction , suits were brought in 1875 ; the first of these to be heard was one brought in the United States Circuit Court of California against the Central Pacific Company , demanding $1,800,000 as the accumulated five per cent net earnings since 1869 . In this suit the Government was again defeated , the Conrt holding that the obligation to pay the five per cent . did not accrue till one year after September , 1874 , when the roads were accepted . A year from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was held to have been prematurely brought and was dismissed . IDuring the present summer , however , the // opposite view has been taken by the Court of Claims . In a suit brought by the Union Pacific Company against the United States , that Court has held that the road was completed in 1869 . That the liability of the Company began at that date , and that interest on the bonded debt should not be deducted from the gross earnings before the net earnings are estimated . It now remains for the Supreme Court to determine between these conflicting decisions , which doctrine is correct , and until such final adjudication by the tribunal of last resort the questions in dispute must be regarded as unsettled . While the litigation respecting these mooted questions was pending in the Courts the first session of the Forty-fifth Congress commenced in December , 1877 . During the previous session the Senate Judiciary Committee had matured and presented a bill " to alter and amend " the acts of 1862 and 1864 relating to the Pacific Railroads for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the half transportation dues and the five per cent . net earnings which alone those acts required toward extinguishing the government loan . The railroad companies had also prepared a proposition which they brought forward in the form of a bill " to create a sinking fund for the liquidation of the government bonds , " etc. , and the Senate Railroad Committee presented a third bill with a similar title and object . The proposition of the railroad companies was substantially to the following effect : That the Govern meat should take back from each company six millions of acres of land in Nebraska , Wyoming , Nevada , and Utah , at a valuation of $1.25 per acre , and should credit the amount of the aggregate valuation ( seven and a half millions of dollars ) to each company as the foundation of a sinking fund , retaining such fund in the U. S. Treasury , and allowing six per cent . interest thereon ; that such sinking fund should be farther increased by the retained transportation dues already in the hands of the Government , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that each company should pay in annually to the fund such amount as would at six per cent . interest enable it to pay off the government bonds , principal and interest , by the year 1905 , or six years after their latest maturity . // Sept. , The Pacific Railroads and the Government . With respect to their proposal to return the granted lands in the regions specified , the companies said that these lands , since the building of the road , have become valuable for grazing uses , and are with the government lands adjoining them in demand for that purpose at rates even greater than $1.25 per acre . That for such use , however , they must he sold in large tracts of from 50,000 to 100,000 acres , located with reference to the water supply and other requisite natural features . But as they are now are held in alternate rectangular sections of 640 acres each , " like a checker board , " by the Government and the companies , some of which contain the only streams for many square miles while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsaleable , and are overrun by trespassers who take advantage of this divided ownership to benefit themselves without paying tribute to anybody . That it is therefbre for the best interest both of the Government and the companies that the proposed transfer should be made , and that from the necessity of the case such transfer to one of the two parties is sure eventually to come . In the meantime they complain that these lands so " muniAcently deeded to them by the Government as a generous gift , " are not only worthless to them in their present shape but are a heavy burden of expense owing to the oppressive local taxation to which they are subjected as railroad property . Says Mr. Huntington in his argument before the Judiciary Committee , " They tax the lands and make the railroad property pay everything . One year we paid $39,000 gold tax in one county . I guess it was seven-eighths of the tax paid in the county ; they will tax these lands right away from us . If the Government had them they would not . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps no property in it at all , and what do they find ? They find thirty or forty miles of railroad track and the lands . They will run a county from the taxes on that . A person living here has not much idea how they do things in that outlying country . " And he intimated to the Committee that if the Government thonght the valuation too high at $1.25 per acre they might have the lands at almost nor rate they might choose , as , althourh valuable and marketable in proper shape , they are in their present form a ruinous possession . // With regard to the extension of time for payment to five years beyond the maturity of the bonds the companies suggested that the request was Pot unreasonable in view of their proposition to pay the greater part of them within twenty years from their date or several years before any of them are due , and in view of the farther fact that the road was opened for government use seven years before the time named in the charter . this early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the companies in the cost of construction , but to a more than correspondilg advantage to the Government and the public . Apart from the immense political and commercial benefits accruing from this early opening of the road , they estimate that the direct saving to the national treasury during the seven years thus saved , would if funded at six per cent. , more than cancel the whole amount of government bonds at their maturity . Notwithstanding these suggestions , the proposition of the companies was ignored in Congress , and scouted as " impudent " by the public press . The ands so " valuable " when granted to the companies , although then remote and inaccessible , became " worthless " when the companies proposed to return them to the Government traversed by a national thoroughfare , on the edge of civilized society and in demand for occupancy . And the request that five years extension of time might be allowed for final payment , although coupled with security for the whole debt and the prepayment of its greater portion was regarded as little less than insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited tenfold the amount of its investment . The bill proposed by the Companies therefore made no progress beyond its presentation and dropped entirely out of the consideration of Congress . The bill presented by the IRailroad Committee was accompanied by a report in which the Committee took the ground that whatever might be the legal merits of the questions in controvei-sy between the Government and the corporations it was best for both parties to " reach some common around whereby their several interests may be conserved and their conflicting views relative thereto fairly , justly , and equitably N // adjusted . " They therefore decline to discuss these questions of legal right , and devote themselves to considering not what Congress has the power to do , " but what it " may most wisely do , in view of the past history , the present condition , and the future prospects of the roads . " They suggest that " one of the greatest interests that the Government and the people can have in these roads is in the maintenance of a high standard of perfection , assuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That " to impose harsh terms upon these companies , and to exact from them burdensome and embarrassing payments " would not only result in vexatious litigation , but if sustained by the Courts would impair the credit and finances of the companies , endanger the safety of the roads , and cause an increase of their rates of charge , to the serious injury of the public and an increased cost to the Government . They announce therefore that in framing their bill they have endeavored " to meet the subject in a spirit of practical adjustment , in order to secure to the United States ultimate repayment of the full amount of advances to these corporations without harsh or unnecessary embarrassment to them . " The principal features of the plan presented by the IRailroad Committee were as follows : The commencement of a sinking fund by crediting the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific Companies respectively with one million dollars from the retained transportation dues belonging to them in the hands of the Government . Each company to pay to such sinking fund annually one million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear interest at six per cent. , and its amount to be auplied on the 1st day of October , 1900 , to the liquidation of the government bonds . The balance remaining unpaid by the companies to be then divided into fifty equal parts , one part to be paid semi-annually with interest by the corporations , thus extinguishing the whole debt by 1925 . This proposition of the Government to be accepted by the companies before it should be binding on them , and if after such acceptance they should fail to perform any of its conditions , Congress to have full power to alter , amend , or repeal this act with respect to the company so making default . It was well under- ! , // stood that this bill , if passed , would be accepted by the companies as an adjustment of the controversy , but although strongly supported by several of the ablest lawyers in the Senate , the general sentiment was against it as offering too liberal terms of settlement and it failed to obtain a majority support . The bill presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of 41 to 19 , and shortly afterwards the- House almost without debate and with but two dissenting voices , was of a far more radical character . As this enactment is one of the greatest importance not only with respect to the companies whose rights and interests it immediately affects , but indirectly to all parties who deal with the Government and rely on its good faith to maintain unchanged their contract rights , so long as they fulfill on their part their contract obligations , we shall consider its provisions with some particularity . And as preliminary to this it will be necessary to bring together into one view those provisions of the charter by which the Government granted its subsidy of bonds , the conditions of the grant as therein stated , the terms of payment which they prescribed , and the limitations within which Congress agreed to restrict itself with respect to any future chance of this organic law or alteration of its proffered terms . The only part of any act in which the issue of the bonds is provided for is Section 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enacted that " to secure the repayment to the United States as hereinafter provided of the amount of said bonds so issued and delivered to said company , together with all interest thereon which shall have been paid by the United States , the issue of said bonds and delivery to said company shall ipso facto constitute a first mortgage by act of 1864 changed to a second mortgage ' on the whole line of the railroad and telegraph , together with the rolling stock , fixtures , and property of every kind and description , " and that " on the refusal or failure of the company to redeem said bonds , or any part of the ? n , the whole road with all the rights , functions , immunities and appurtenances thereto belongino- " should be taken possession of by the United States . Section 6 then declares in express language the condition of // the grants ( and under the well settled rule of construction expressio unius , exclusio alterius , their sole condition ) , viz : " And be it further enacted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company shall pay said bonds at maturity and shall keep said railroad and telegraph line in repair and use , and shall at all times transmit despatches over said telegraph line , and transport mails , troops , and munitions of war , supplies and public stores upon said railroad for the Government whenever required by any department so to do , and that the Government shall at all times have the preference in the use of the same for the purposes aforesaid ( at fair and reasonable rates of compensation , not to exceed the amounts paid by private parties for the same kind of service ) , and all compensation by act of 1864 changed to " one-half the compensation ' for services rendered for the Government , shall be applied to the payment of said bonds and interest until the whole amount is fully paid . * * * And after said road is completed until said bonds and interest are paid , at least five per centum of the net earnings of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment thereof . " And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case said company or companies shall fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this act , by not completing said road and telegraph and branches within a reasonable time , or by not keeping the same in repair and use , Congress may pass any act to insure the speedy completion of said road and branches , or to put the same in repair and use , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . And finally , in Section 18 , to guard still farther against any apprehensions of Government interference with the companies , or their contract relations in case they should faithfully build the roads and perform the conditions of the grants as previously specified , a limited power of amendment to the charter is alone reserved in the following words . " And the better to accomplish the object of this act , namely , to promote the public interest and welfare by the construction of said railroad and telegraph line , and keeping the same in working order , and to secure to the Government at all times , but particularly in time of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military , and other purposes , Congress may at // any time , having due regard for the rights of said Companies named herein , add to , alter , amend and repeal this act . " The act of 1864 , as we have already seen , was passed by Congress two years after , not for the purpose of restricting the privileges granted by the act of 1862 , but avowedly to enlarge them , those offered by that act having proved inadequate to attract the desired and needful aid of private parties to the work . It is of course a distinct enactment , passed by a different Congress , and bears the title " An Act to amend an act entitled " an act to aid in constructing a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri Biver to the Pacific Ocean , " etc . It contains twentytwo sections , some of them repealing portions of the act of 1862 , some enlarging the privileges granted , and others embracing entirely new matter . In all its parts it refers to the act of 1862 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is amendatory . " It effects its changes in it by specific reference to the portions amended , either by citation of the section or quotation of the language , or its substance . It increases the amount of the grants as respects the lands , and changes the security and terms of payment as respects the government bonds , but nowhere does it suggest that " the conditions of the grants " or " the object of the act " are different from those above recited in the act of 1862 . Nowhere is there a reference to the limited right of amendment reserved by the act of 1862 as a part of that act which is designed to be amended , but it closes with the following section : " Section 22 . And be it further enacted , that Congress may at any time alter , amend or repeal this act . " There was considerable discussion in Congress over the passage of this amendatory act of 1864 , but one will search in vain through the debates for any intimation by friend or foe that this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alter , amend and repeal " at its discretion or caprice , any and every provision of the contract embraced in the act of 1862 . So far from this , when it was proposed to amend the bill by requiring the company to perform government service free of charge , Mr. Stevens declared without being controverted , that it would be a violation of the contract contained in the act of // for the building of this road , and that least of all it will not violate the original law or charter under which this company was organized . " " I do not think it fair and legitimate now to go back to the original law and attempt to change its entire scope and meaning and thereby defeat its object after men have invested their money , relying on its provisions . " Such was the language in Congress when capital was timid of embarking in the enterprise , and when it was necessary to encourage it with a strong assurance that the Government would abide by its original contract unimpaired . And if as a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1864 when the road was scarcely commenced , with how much greater force are they now invested , nine years after its opening , when it has been fully and fairly completed and operated according to the terms of the contract , has alreaay saved to the government treasury more than the amount of its advances , and has returned to the nation in the enhanced value of the public property , and in the direct public benefits it has conferred at least five fold the amount of the national loan ; and when moreover its securities amounting to over a hundred millions of dollars are held by thousands who purchased them in reliance on the fidelity of the Government to its own agreements as expressed in the existing charter of the road . Quite different , however , was the point of view from which the Judiciary Committee of the Senate in Mareb , 1878 , considered the subject . In their report presented by Senator Thurman , introducing their bill , they do not even allude to any equities in favor of the corporations , or the holders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the Government in fairness and good faith to abide by its contract even at the risk of loss . Ignoring all those considerations , the Judiciary Committee devote themselves simply to an argument in favor of altering the charter . Their process of reasoning is interesting and significant . The first consideration they advance is that the companies are able to pay more to the Government annually than their charter requires  --  and the Committee add , we think their net earnings will not be less in the future . ' ' This point disposed of they next inquire whether Congress has the legal right to alter the terms of the contract , the companies // having fulfilled its obligations on their part . Here the act of 1862 first engages their attention as reserving to Congress no right to alter , amend , or repeal the charter , except " in order to promote the construction of the railroad and telegraph line , and keeping the same in working order , and to secure to the Government at all times , but particulai-ly in time of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , military and other purposes . " The reply of the Committee to this , is , at least , ingenious . They say , " were this limited interpretation placed on fhe reservation it would not in the opinion of your Committee defeat the hill they report . For , although said roads and telegraph lines have been constructed , yet it is manifest , having reference to their pecuniary condition , that some such measure as that now recommended is necessary in order to keqp them in working order , and to secure to the Government at all times the . use and benefit of the same ( ! ) It needs no argument to prove that insolvent corporations , or corporations in danger of insolvency i. e. twenty years hence when the government bonds mature , can not be relied upon to furnish the Government the benefits contemplated by said act . " But evidently considering this point rather a strained one , they fall back on another , viz : " It can not be denied that the right of alteration reserved in the amendatory act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In response to the objection , " that this right applies only to the act of 1864 , and does not authorize any alteration or amendment of the act of 1862 , " the Committee say that " were this so it would not defeat the hill of your Committee , for it might well be sustained as an amendment to the act of 1864 . " To recognize the act of 1864 as a separate statute , however , was to take dangerous ground , from which the Committee get off as soon as possible . " But it seems to your Committee , " the report proceeds , " that said acts should be considered Th* pari materia , as constituting for purposes of interpretation but one act , and that consequently the power to alter , amend or repeal reserved in the act of 1864 , which is the last expression of the legislative will , applies to both said acts . " They cite no authorities to sustain this view , but refer to various judicial decisions in support of the undisputed doctrine , that privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest may be repealed , whether such power of repeal is reserved or not by their charters . As , however , this does not quite reach the case of a mere business contract between the Government and the corporations for the loan and repayment of money , the Committee are prepared to go a little farther if necessary , and to assert the full power of Congress in any case to repeal or alter the terms of a bargain , " especially if the other contracting party is a corporation , public , or quasi public . " They say , " No State can make a law impairing the obligation of a contract because that is prohibited by the Federal Constitution . But there is no such prohibition upon Congress ; and as it is a fundamental principle that one Congress can not limit the constitutional powers of a subsequent Congress , it may be argued that no mere corporate franchise can be granted by one Congress that a subsequent Congress may not alter , amend , or repeal . " And so being satisfied that the companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal power to make them , the Committee regard the whole subject as conclusively disposed of and recommend the passage of their bill . In pursuance of these advanced views of Congressional powers over contracts irrespective of governmental justice and good faith , the Judiciary Committee Bill provided substantially as follows : First , That from and after June 30 , 1878 , the " net earnings " mentioned in the act of 1862 shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross earnings of the Railroad Companies their expenses of operating and repair , and their payments of first mortgage interest , but no other interest payments whatever , " and the foregoing provision shall be deemed and taken as an amendment to the act of 1864 as well as of the act of 1862 . " Second , That the Government shall hereafter retain the whole amount of its annual transportation dues to the companies , one half to be applied to paying the current interest on the government bonds , and the other half to a sinking fund for the payment of the principal . Third , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government $1,200,000 , arid the Union Pacific Company $850,000 , or so much respectively as shall make the annual amount carried to the sinking fund twenty-five per cent . // of the net earnings of each road estimated as above provided . Except that if in any year either company after actually paying its first mortgage interest should not have twenty-five per cent . of its net earnings left to meet the government demands , the Secretary of the Treasury may remit the deficiency . Fo*irth , That any officer or stockholder who shall vote , make , or receive any dividend while any of the above required payments shall be in default , " shall be liable to the United States for the amount of such dividends ; " and to knowingly vote , declare , make , or pay such dividend shall be punishable " by a fine not exceeding $10,000 , and by imprisonment not exceeding one year. ** Fifth ( Section 9 ) , That all indebtedness to the United States , " whether payable presently or not , arid all sums required to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into the sinking fund under this act , or under the acts of 1862 and 1864 , or otherwise , are hereby declared to be a lien on all the property , estate , rights and franchises of every description granted by the United States to any of said companies respectively or jointly , and also upon all the estate and property , real , personal , and mixed , assets and income of the said several railroad companies respectively , from whatever source derived , subject to any lawfully prior and paramount mortgage lien or claim thereonY* Sixth . That any failure for six months by either company " to perform all and singular the requirements of this act , and of the acts hereinbefore mentioned and of any other act relating to said company , shall operate as a forfeiture of all the rights , privileges , grants and franchises derived or obtained by it from the United States ; and it shall be the duty of the AttorneyGeneral to cause such forfeiture to be judicially enforeed . " Seventh . ( Section 12 ) " That nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to affect or impair the right of * This astonishing section was only at the last moment amended by adding the following clause . " Bnt this section shall not be construed to prevent said companies respectively from using and disposing of any of their property or assets in the ordinary , proper , and lawful course of their current business , in good faith and for valuable consideration . " it is obvious that as reported by the Coinmittee. the section amounted to confiscation of the whole " property , assets , and income " of the companies , and precluded them from paying a dollar for even current expenses , and from selling an acre of land or a pound of old iron . // Congress at any time hereafter , further to alter , amend or repeal the said acts hereinbefore mentioned ; and this act shall be subject to alteration , amendment or repeal as in the opinion of Congress , justice or the public welfare may require . And nothing herein contained shall be held to deny , exclude or impair any right or remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . " Eighth . ( Section 13 ) " That each and every of the provisions in this act contained , shall severally and respectively be deemed , taken and held as in alteration and amendment of said act of 1862 , and of said act of 1864 respectively , and of both said acts . " This extraordinary bill , which was justly characterized in the Senate as " one of the most deliberate attacks upon the rights of property and contract in the annals of legislation , " afterwards passed both Houses of Congress by large majorities and is now the law of the land . That its provisions are in many respects a wide variation from the offers and promises which Congress held out to the companies in 1862 and 1864 , as considerations for building the road , its supporters freely admit . That Congress has no constitutional or moral right to impair the obligations of a contract is also conceded . Notwithstanding the intimation which we have cited from the report , that Congress may alter contracts because it is not prohibited from so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted by Mr. Thurman during a previous debate on the bill that Congress had no such power because it is not cortferred by the Federal Constitntion . But the claim made by the supporters of the bill was , as we have seen , that the reservation to alter or amend the act of 1864 , binds the companies as a part of the contract of 1862 , and Senator Thurman declared in the course of the debate in language which reads more like sarcasm than sincerity , that " the companies by accepting the act of 1864 consented to this unlimited power of Congress to alter , amend , or repeal , and gladly consented to it , for they were getting the greatest bargain that ever corporations obtained from any Government on the face of the earth . " It may be that the corporations in 1864 , relying on the good faith of the Government to abide by its " bargain " as then // agreed upon , considered that they were obtaining a iberal contract , though it is certain that nut only then but for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact . It may be that they accepted the act of 1864 under an idea that it was in fact , what it professed to be , an enlargement of Government " generosity ' previously inadequate . But if they did they must have felt in 1878 , much the same bewilderment at their mistake as the victim of the thimble rigger experiences when be sees his expected gains swept swiftly off the board , and learns for the first time what cover " the little joker " was under . It xviii be impossible in the brief space allotted to us to discuss fully all the provisions of this act ( several of which indeed we have been compelled to omit in our analysis ) , and we must content ourselves with a very hasty review of the general features we have mentioned . It will be observed that it first assumes to impose its own construction on the words " net earnings " as used in the original contract , without regard to the meaning of those words which was had by both parties when the contract was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of the words " net earnings " in the act of 1862 was now before the Courts for adjudication , replied that he was " not willing to wait for the slow process of litigation . " It would be no objection to me , " he added , " if the Supreme Court were to decide to-day that the companies ' interpretation of net earnings ' is the true interpretation . All I should have to say would be that there is so much the more necessity for this legislation to secure the Government . That would be all I should have to say in reply to that . " With a shrewd reference , however , to the possibility that the decision of the Courts on this point might be in the Govern ment 's favor , the act while " amending " the sense of the words for the future has carefully guarded against waiving the claim of the Government based upon its own iuterprctatiou of them in the past , and provides that this amendment " shall not affect any right of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Having thus amended a new meaning into the language of the original bargain , the next step is to alter the language itself . The Supreme Court had checked a previous attempt to collect // from the companies annually on account of the government loan anything more than the terms of the loan required them to pay , viz : one-half of the transportation dues and five per cent . of their net earnings . The effect of the original contract having thus been judicially settled , nothing remained but to change it out and out , and they are now subjected to paying all the transportation dues and twenty-five per cent . of their " net earnings " as computed under the amended rule . It is easy to see that this enormous increase of annual liability of the companies antecedent to the accruing interest on their funded debts of the second and third classes ( the Union Pacific alone has over twenty millions of land grant and sinking fund bonds ) , might in a dull or unfortunate season or under the future competition which is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet their obligations and result not only in ruin to the companies but in wide spread disaster to the holders of these securities . Nevertheless the rights of these holders , which any Court of Equity would protect against alterations of prior contracts , are absolutely ignored by the new law . Even the first mortgage bondholders , whose interests it professes to recognize , are exposed to a similar sacrifice , for the law by appropriating the revenues of the roads to pay the government bonds before they become due , has given them priority over those of the first mortgage , and leaves to the latter as security only what will remain after the government loan has been paid , principal and interest in cash . Moreover the 11th section provides that " in case of failure for six months " by the companies to pay these new demands of the Government , or any government claim nuder this L* or any other act of Congress or right of the United States , " the Attorney-General shall seize the roads , and in such case what would the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first mortgage creditors quite as much as any others are interested that the road should be maintained in the best possible condition ; that its general credit should be high , and its finances unembarrassed , and that the owners of the property should be free to manage its affairs in such way as best to promote the prosperity of the enterprise . The 9th section , however ( although by the amendment to which we have adverted , it has // been modified from actual confiscation ) , still prevents the companies from accumulating a dollar in their treasury in advance as a fund for the most pressing contingencies , from incurring any expenses for the enlargement of their business by building branches or otherwise , or from making any provision whatever by sinking funds to redeem even their first mortgage bonds . The section referred to makes all liabilities to the United States whatever , present or future , a lien on all the property , estate , and franchises , of the companies , " subject to any lawfully prior and paramount claim thereon , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary , proper , and lawful course of current business , in good faith and for valuable consideration . " It is obvious that there is nothing here to protect a sinking fund accumulated for the payment of first mortgage bonds which have not matured , against seizure by the Government to pay its second mortgage bonds that have matured ; nor can the companies take up or buy in their first mortgage bonds in advance , for that would not be " in the ordinary , proper , and lawful course of their current business . " It was suggested , during the discussions over this act , that the validity of these amendments to the contract or some of them would probably be tested in the Courts ; accordingly the law has forestalled any such purpose on the part of the companies . A suit of this character would occupy at least a year before it could be decided , and the act provides , as we have already seen , that a failure by the corporations " for six months " to comply with any requirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willful or not , and whether it be unavoidable or not ) , shall ipso facto " operate as a forfeiture of all their rights , privileges , and franchises , " " and it shall be the duty of the Attorney-General to cause such forfeiture to be judicially enforced . " Of course under this section the roads would be seized before a judicial decision as to the validity of the act could be obtained and almost before the suit could be fairly begun . And finally , in order to leave ample room for any farther illustration of the " liberality " and " generosity " of the Government in making the original " bargain , " the right is expressly asserted , to impose new constructions to any extent // on the meanings of the acts of 1862 and 1864 , and that both they and " this act , shall be subject to alteration , amendment , or repeal , as in the opinion of Congress , justice or the public welfare may require . " What future possibilities may be contained in this reservation may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it would be quite legitimate for the Government when its bonds mature to demand compound interest from the companies , or rather ( let us give his words exactly ) " interest upon the instalments of interest as it the Government paid them . " " That , " the Senator assures us , " is not compounding interest because the interest upon each instalment of interest paid by the Government would run continually without rest until the maturity of the bonds ; but it will be found to add immensely to the sum which will then be due the Government and carry it far beyond 200 millions . " It is certain that the acts of 1862 and 1864 make no reference whatever to such interest upon interest , and the Senator 's distinction between it and compounding interest may not be very apparent , but it is quite superfluous to discuss any questions arising on these points , when the limit to the obligations that may be imposed on the roads is made quite irrespective of all rules of legal or judicial construction , and is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or notice the conjunction ! the public welfare may require . " Our limits will not permit us to review the debates which preceded the passage of this act , but it would be unjust to the minority in the Senate who opposed it with vigor , ability , and learning , not to refer briefly to the fact that the positions assumed in its support were contested upon grounds of good faith , justice , and judicial authority . We have already seen that the Railroad Comniittee rested their bill not on any conclusions as to the legal right or the constitutional power of Congress to alter a contract , and chose to consider only the questions of good faith and honor involved in the proceeding . Nevertheless in answer to the adjudications cited by the Judiciary Committee to the effect that corporation charters are always under the control of the legislature , it was pointed out that these decisions relate to the power of Government in its character as a sovereignty , and not at all to its legal rights as a // party to a contract . Numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain the distinction . " When , " says Judge Grier of the Supreme Court of the United States , in the case of Elliott vs . Voorst ( 3 Wallace , Jr. , 302 , ) " the Government of the United States becomes a partner in a trading corporation such as that of the United States Bank , it divests itself so far as concerns the transactions of that Company , of its sovereign character , and takes that of a citizen . " Of course it follows that in this capacity , as a voluntary party to a contract it is as much bound by the agreement as the other party , and has no more right than the other to change it without mutual consent . As to the claim that Congress acquired unlimited power of alteration by the closiug section of the act of 1864 , it was denied that such a construction could be sustained without violently wresting that clause from its proper connection , and its obvious meaning , and without ignoring the general rule that the repeal of amendatory acts revives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if its application can be so stretched over the whole act of 1862 , no contractor with the Government and no holder of government securities can ever be safe . Suppose the act of 1864 or some subsequent act had granted but one new privilege ( the right to cut telegraph poles for instance on the public lands ) , coupled with the clause , " this act shall be subject to be altered , amended or repealed at the pleasure of Congress . " Could it be legally or justly claimed that because the act related to the Pacific Railroads , it was therefore in pan materia with all previous acts , and that whenever the corporations should cut down a single telegraph pole by virtue of its permission , they thereby gave to Congress full power to alter , amend , or repeal all previous contracts , even such as it had pledged itself to maintain unimpaired ? Or suppose an act to be passed that the interest on the gold-bearing bonds of the United States might be paid one month in advance , " provided that this act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would Congress under the unlimited right of repeal thus reserved be justified in subsequently repealing the briginal contract that the principal and interest of the loan should be payable in gold , and in making it payable thereafter in silver // or greenbacks ? Yet this is the doctrine contended for by Mr. Thurman and sustained by the majority of the Senate , and it will be well if it does not come back for their future consideration in some form in which repudiation of the public obligations and the public faith will be more odious though not more real than in the case of the Pacific Railroad charters . It is a fundamental doctrine of law and of reason that a contract implies mutuality of obligation . But the right in one party to change or repudiate the bargain at pleasure , whether it results from general principles or from express reservation , destroys such mutuality , and with it the contract relation . And if the stipulated terms of a loan are , in the case of a corporation , not a contract but one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judiciary Committee , " any subsequent Congress may alter , amend or repeal , " then they would not be a contract in the case of an individual . But as no stronger instance of a contract can well be imagined , it would seem to follow that Congress is incapable by any act of binding the Government to private parties in any contract relation whatever . It is surprising that these views had so little influence in Congress , and especially in the minds of members of both Houses who have heretofore jealously guarded the public faith . In reading over the debates , however , and the comments of the public press while the measure was pending , perhaps a partial explanation may be discovered . Allusions to " Credit Mobilier frauds , " and the cry of " bribery and corruption by railroad lobbyists who swarm on the floors of Congress , " were copiously used to deter from opposition to the bill and with their usual paralyzing effect . The companies were stigmatized as " rich and powerful corporations which have for years been defying the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was of little consequence that the " Credit Mobilier frauds " were a myth , and that the Railroad companies , especially in their present hands , were in no way identified with the Credit Mobilier . As to railroad lobbyists , one Senator at least declared that he had heard much of their presence but never to his knowledge had seen any . But if they had been as numerous and as active as a swarm of Kansas locusts , they could have availed but little against the clamors and the // threats of that greatest of lobby agencies , the newspaper press , which with one voice demanded the passage of the bill of the Judiciary Committee . That the parties affected by the bill were corporations was a fact which could not be gainsayed . One Senator referred to " the enormous salaries received by officers of these corporations , " and informed the country that " this money comes from the Government , and every dollar represents the sweat and the toil of some of its citizens . " Another Senator sarcastically alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold his hands and allow himself to be placed into a bag and placed in the custody of the Union Pacific Railroad . " " Give a dog a bad name " and there are few who will interest themselves to vindicate his character or to avert his inevitable fate . But one . who compares the congressional discussions over this act of 1878 with those in 1862 and 1864 without reference to intermediate controversies will learn new lessons on the gratitude of republics and the value of government promises . Nothing is more manifest throughout the debates of 1862 and 1864 than that Congress considered that the construction of the road and the immense political and material benefit to be derived by the country therefrom would bring so full a compensation for its loan of government credit that provision for pecuniary payment was of subordinate consequence . The immense saving in the expense of government transportation which was anticipated , was constantly referred to as amounting to an offset to the annual interest on the government bonds and even largely to the principal itself . This saving has been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( during the Mormon war it was eighteen millions ) it has fallen to about two and a quarter millions in 1877 . Tn fact , as the Governinent has for years retained the whole amount and not paid the roads a dollar , it should be more properly said to have been absolutely annihilated . The eight millions thus annually saved , if counted according to the spirit of the grant as eight millions annually repaid , not only extinguishes the interest on the government bonds , but the principal also long before maturity . Nay more . We have already seen that the saving to the Government during the seven years between // 1869 when the road was opened and 1874 the time fixed for its completion , would o itself form a sinking fund sufficient to pay off the national loan . Yet this reduction in public expense , so far from being credited to the road as a sort of payment , is now used as an argument to show that at this diminished rate of earnings from government service the loan will never be paid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contract requires at whatever loss to them , or risk to their creditors . In the foregoing review of the act of 1878 , and the proceedings of Congress , we have not forgotten that under the acts of 1862 and 1864 an obligation was imposed upon the companies to pay the government loan , principal and interest , at its maturity . If those acts specified no adequate mode of providing for such repayment , it was , as we view them , because Congress trusted to the prudence and good faith of the companies to make such provision so far as possible . Should they fail to do so , it would not in our opinion justify the alteration of the contract , since this was one of the risks taken by Congress , as in the case of any lender who takes a long note for his loan . Nevertheless , any unnecessary neglect to make such provision , had it been shown by the companies , would have gone far to deprive them of any just sympathy in case of summary treatment within the letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the action of Congress in the premises to have been both illegal and unnecessary that we have felt moved to arraign it . The propositions submitted by the corporations , and by the Senate Committee on llailroads , were either of them adapted to save both the money of the Government and its honor , and even if the country had not already reaped full remuneration and tenfold more for the money it has invested in the roads , it could have far better afforded to make the small concessions of time which those propositions contemplated than to violate its good faith , sacrifice the rights of property and contract , and with more than Shylock 's rapacity alter its statement in order to grasp an advantage " not nominated in the bond . " In this point of view it is immaterial whether the companies were rich enough or not to be crippled by the spoliation . We care very little whether their stock and securities have risen or fallen in // Wall street since the act of 1878 , although in fact the passage of that act has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questions of right and wrong are independent of such considerations . It does not justify a breach of law and justice , to insist that it will do no harm . Still more absurd and contemptible is it to parade as its pretext former acts of pretended " generosity " and " munificence . " It would be as sensible and as decent for the butcher to call on the lamb to snbmit his neck gratefully to the knife in consideration of the " generosity " with which he has been fattened in order to be availed of as mutton . An act passed at the same session of Congress as supplemental to the preceding , which establishes a board for auditing Pacific iRailroad accounts , though stringent in its provisions is not open on principle to the strictures we have above applied . The statute professes for its object to secure to the Government a more constant and thorough inspection of the Pacific Railroad accounts . So far as the object is merely to ensure a strict and faithful compliance with existing obligations , and not to obtain pretexts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobjectionable , even if unnecessary . That it was unnecessary we have no sufficient information to aver . That it was needed in fact , we have the assurance of its originator , Senator Thurman ; but on this subject at leas* , Senator Thurman has proved himself not the most reliable authority . In the debate on the other bill he maintained that the companies had already justly forfeited their charters by a persistent failure to make annual returns to the Secretary of the Treasury of various items , including a statement of their earnings , expenses , and indebtedness , as required by the act of 1862 . Warming with the theme , he exclaimed ,  --  " Are those immaterial matters ? I will not stop to discuss the importance of each and every of them though there is not one single requirement there that is not important as I could easily show . But take the last three which are intended to require each company to make a sworn statement to the Government so that the Government may know that it gets its five per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is the fact ? Here are these Companies under this obligation-these Companies who have received such immense subsidies from the Government in lands and bonds , who never to this day have complied with that section of the law , and the Government can not tell you to-day what are the net earnings of these railroad companies . I hold the proof in my hand . " // Unfortunately for the charge , it afterwards appeared and was explained to the Senator , that a statute passed in 1868 required the returns to be made thenceforward to the Secretary of the Interior instead of the Secretary of the Treasury , and that in the Interior Department all the reports were on file , regularly made in conformity with the law . This review of the relations between the Pacific Railroads and the Government , especially in connection with the proceedings at the late session of Congress , brief as it is , would be too incomplete without an allusion to the " pro rata controversy , " in which the Union Pacific Company was for years arraigned before Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and its charter . The questions involved in that controversy , however1 we must forbear to discuss , and it is the less necessary as a recent judicial decision has settled them on their merits . A mere explanatory statement must suffice . The act of 1864 required that " the several Companies authorized to construct the aforesaid roads viz , the main line of the Pacific Road and its feeders , should operate and use said roads and telegraph for all purposes of communication and transportation so far as the Government and the public are concerned as one continuous line , and in such operation and use should afford and secure to each , equal facilities as to rates , time , and transportation without any discrimination of any kind in favor of the road or business of any or either of said Companies or adverse to the road or business of any or either of them . " It was claimed by the Kansas Pacific Road ( which as we have seen in the previous article is a competing and rival road to the Union Pacific erected against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tributary feeders ) , that the Union Pacific Company habitually violated this legal requirement with respect to freight and passengers , which it received at Cheyenne from the Kansas Pacific for transportation farther west . The Union Pacific Company denied the charge and insisted that its rates of freight and fare were entirely consistent with its legal obligations . The dispute between the roads was submitted to the Courts , but pending the suit the Kansas Pacific Company appealed to Congress to compel the Union Pacific Company to accede to their demands . In December , 1877 , the United // States Senate adopted a Resolution which assumed that the Union Pacific Company was habitually violating the law and inquired of the President " what , if any , impediments existed which prevented him from compelling that Company to observe it . " The Resolution was referred by the President to the Attorney-General and the Secretary of the Interior , who gave the parties a hearing . In their report to the President they declined to accept the assumption on which the resolution was based , and advised that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence should be carefully and elaborately taken and the true construction of the law discussed , and that such an inquiry was already pending in the Courts . " Notwithstanding these suggestions , bills were prepared by committees both of the Senate and the House in accordance with the Kansas Pacific demands , supported by the public press , to compel the Union Pacific Company " to comply with the provisions of its charter and to operate its road and branches as one continuous line without discrimination . " These bills were still under discussion as late as May 8th , 1878 , and with every prospect that some one of them would be passed , with little if any opposition . On that day , however , the decision of the United States Circuit Court upon the disputed questions was received . The Court held the claim of the Kansas Pacific Company to be untenable , that the Union Pacific Company had a right to make the charges complained of , and were both reasonable and fully in accordance with their charter in so doing . Its language is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the Union Pacific Road in charging a greater rate for transportation of persons and property west of Cheyenne than is found necessary east of that point . And the defendant the Union Pacific Company is not bound to transport the cars of , or passengers or freight carried by the plaintiff , the Kansas Pacific Company from Cheyenne to Ogden at one-half the regular through rates established by the defendant . Neither reason or justice requires this to be done Nor can I believe that Congress ever intended to impose such an onerous burden on the defendant . No reasonable construction of the law will lead to such a conclusion . * * To compel the defendant to do what is here // asked would be to require the defendant to discriminate in favor of the other roads , and against its own material interests . Such a result was never contemplated by the Government . " The controversies between the Pacific Railroads and the Government , which we have thus hastily reviewed , illustrate in a striking manner the inconvenience and the dangers arising to both parties out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually concerned . The only safety for either , if there is any safety at all , must be found in such a complete and final adjustment of their several relations , obligations , and rights , as to take the subject forever out of the sphere of legislation and to leave all questions of dispute , where they are left in private affairs , to the adjudication of the Courts . When of two parties to a contract , one claims every right , even to that of alteration or repudiation , and has the power to enforce it , it is inevitable in the nature of things that such claim will be sooner or later asserted with oppression and injustice . Especially must this be the case where the stronger party is a Government , and more than all a democratic government , swayed as such governments so frequently are by the passions and prej udices and selfish or sectional interests of even small minorities of the general public . If in such case the other party is a private individual there may be a chance that a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . But if it is a corporation the hope of forbearance is largely diminished . In either case the exercise of power on the one side , will surely sooner or later be forestalled or averted by acts of corrupti&amp;n on the other , and the greater and richer the weaker party may be , the greater the evil and the more widespread and protractetl the danger . Herein lies one of the most serious of the many objections to the legislation of 1878 , which we have been considering . By asserting an unlimited right in Congress to alter , amend , or repeal at its will the contract between the Government and the companies , the whole subject has been removed from the province of the Courts where alone it can properly and safely be left , and the foundation has been laid for the most enormous scandals of contending tyranny , and corruption , and for stock jobbing legislation of the most flagrant kind that have ever been known in our history . So long as the rights or privi // leges of the companies are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every grade will be sure to seize their opportunities ; political parties will be formed and bought and sold with the revenues of the road , and eventually that great and magnificent enterprise , now a pride and a glory to the nation , will be rather associated with recollections of public folly and disgrace . If any one deems these imaginings to be fanciful , or overdrawn , let him recall the history of the United States Bank , its connection with politicians , and parties , and party scandals especially in its later days , and consider what all this would have grown to had that institution been like a railroad stretching across the continent , incapable of annihilation , an indestructible , inexhaustible , and enormous source of political influence and intrigue , and of public and private corruption . Whether the companies will contest these laws in the Courts we know not , and with that we have nothing to do . Our purpose has been accomplished in reviewing the legislation itself , and in calling attention to its wrongs and its perils . Through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress has not received the attention which it deserved and it has been generally received either with indifference or approval . We feel assured , however , that when the facts are known and the measures we have criticized are duly considered , a correct public sentiment will be awakened in full accord with what we have written .
