txt A respectable and respected citizen , Mr. James ? P. Frye , living on Beacon Hill , in a retired but substantial neighborhood , was found today in the cellar of his dwelling , dead , with bullet and knife wounds in his body . On the floor above , in the diningroom , the house safe was found to be open and rifled of its contents . There appeared to be abundant evidence to show that this was a plain case of murder and robbery , but so singular were the circumstances surrounding it , that the suspicion was quickly raised and the theory as promptly advanced , that it was a case of suicide , and before anything like a thorough investigation could bo made , or , indeed , before the medical examiner had examined the body , so that the nature of the wounds could be ascertained , some of the chief Police authorities appeared determined to cling to this suicide theory , and conducted themselves accordingly . The discovery of the tragedy was made by a letter-carrier , William R. Jefferds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he called at the house No. 13 Joy-street to leave letters . He rang the bell , and , there being no response , he rang again and then again . He felt certain some one was in the house , as the outer door was unlatched . Pushing this open , he found the inner door wide open and two gas jets burning in the narrow hall . Hailing a police officer , who had just passed , he explained the situation , and the two men entered the house . The upper portion was first hurriedly examined , and found to be all right , and then , in the dining-room , was found the open safe , and in the cellar the body . Word was at once carried to the station-house , and Capt . Ford , with several officers , repaired to the house and took possession . A closer and more thorough examination of the premises was made by these officers . Every door at the rear of the house was found to be fastened , and the key was on the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been forced . The outer doors of the safe in the dining-room were open , and the keys were found lyhig on the safe tcp . The inner wooden door had been burst open , evidently with a large carving knife , which lay broken on the floor near-by . The safe is a large one , of the pattern usually made for domestic use , with a marble top . This marble slab had been removed and placed on a centre table a few feet away . Two of the large drawers were on the table empty , and three others , in which wore a lot of solid silver forks , spoons , &c.,; were on top of the safe . In the compartments of the safe were a magnificent solid silver tea service and other silver nieces , in all 32 , and a large pile of private papers , including insurance policies . None of these articles had been disturbed , and were apparently just as the owner had left them . There was also a bag of coins , but no money was found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing to show that there had been a struggle in the room . Down in the cellar the oody was found lying upon the brick floor , face downward . The arms were doubled under the chest . The left leg was also extended , and the right foot was twisted so that the left knee rested upon it . The head and face were covered with blood , and the glimpse of the pallid face and the white mustache , spattered and clotted with blood , was a ghastly and sickening sight . Across the floor , from under the head , extended a long , bright stream of blood , ending in quite a thick pool . About five feet front the head of the body a pistol was found in a coal-hod . This was a small , brass-mounted , old-fashioned weapon , and was still cocked ready for firing . Near the head of the man lay six letters and postal-cards , while close by were scattered three unlighted cigars . The window and all the doors opening into the room , except that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a : oy 's velocipede and other small articles , which were standing about , seemed to make it evident that no struggle had occurred there . One conclusion is that Mr. Frye was stunnedby a blow or stupefied with some anmsthetic in some other apartment , and then taken to the basement and shot , and another is that he went there of his own actors and became a self-murderer . In no part of the house was there any evidence of a struggle , nor has there been a drop of blood discovered in any room except that in the basement . It is &malty; true that there was no odor of chloroform or anything of that kind discoverable about the premises , nor have any sponges or napkins with which it may have been administered been found . Mr. Frye had on all his clothing except his coat . The gas was not only lighted in the hall , but on the first two floors . Mr. Frye 's sleeping-room was undisturbed , and it was quite evident that the deed had been committed on Thursday evening before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frye was out until about 8:30 or 9 o'clock Thursday evening , and returned to his home with some friends . They played billiards in the billiard room . in the top of the house , and later on the piano was heard by the neighbors . At about 11 o'clock a policeman , on going by noticed that the parlor was lighted and also heard the piano . Later still , friends were seen . leaving the house , and it is presumed that Mr. Frye left afterward to see the Tremont Temple fire and returned again . The evidence going to show that he was murdered appears to be almost conclusive , it is the supposition of those who have made the closest examination , followed the autopsy , obtained evidence , and studied the case most critically , that two persons entered the house by the front door , finding it open ; that the entrance was , made during the progress of the fire down town , when few policemen were to be seen about Beacon Hill , which is not over well protected , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a watercloset in the sub-cellar , struck on the head and stunned ; then stabbed with a stiletto in the neck and in the side , toward his back and in the region of the kidneys , and then shot ; that his watch was taken and the keys of his safe extracted from his pocket , the safe opened and rifled , and the house left in the same way it was entered , by the front door . This supposition is strengthened by a variety of evidence . The body , as it lay , must have been turned over after it fell . The autopsy showed several knife-wounds about the kidneys , which could hardly have been selfinflicted ; in Tact , one of the physicians states that they could not possibly have been self-inflicted . The inside of the hands was cut and bruised as if the blade of a knife had been caught and pushed away . The wound on the top of the head and back of the neck was distinct , and the pistol-wound was a single one through ? the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both empty . It is thought one shot was fired and missed . The body was neatly dressed and the boots were freshly polished . The coat , hat , and cuffs were hung in the rear hall , on the dining-room floor . Of the personal ornaments , the watch is gone , and this a clerk in a cigar store who sold him cigars early in the evening declares that he had on at that time . A diamond pin was found in his shirt front , but this was hidden from.Yiew. . by the blood which covered it . The safe was in appearance not unlike an old-fashioned sideboard , and the marble slab was a heavy one . It was so placed on the table to which it was removed that it was thought impossible that one man could have moved and placed it there . It can not be found that any one was with Mr. Frye after 11 o'clock . Those who advance the suicide theory base their arguments on the fact that so much valuable stuff was left ; that only the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the inside ; and that the pistol was found so near the body , as if thrown ahead by the fall of the body . Against this is the strong evidence above , showing that it was next to imposible for the gentleman to have inflicted the wounds found on his person , and also the absence of any motive for suicide . A most industrious search has been made to discover a motive , but as vet nothing has been found . dr . Frye was a man in good circumstances and of good habits ; his domestic relations were , as far as known , of the pleasantest kind , and he had no financial difficulties . He was genial , kindly , cheerful , and generous ; and so easily had he moved through the world that he had avoided making enemies , and , moreover , escaped care and trouble . As far as known he had absolutely no difficulties or intrigues to cause depression or annoyance . He married , about 18 years ago , the daughter of Peleg Gardiner , of Providence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion of his marriage he received some very handsome silver plate , for the safe-keeping of which he bought the safe which was found open in the dining-room . The house , No. 13 Joy-street , was his wife 's property , given to her by her father , and was an old-fashioned residence , which Mr. Frye had rearranged and decorated , making it a most picturesque and cozy home . It was comfortably and artistically furnished , contained finelibrary , and was quite peculiar and unique in its arrangements . He was in the house alone , his family , consisting of his wife and two sons , being absent for the Summer in Wolfborough , N. H. A sister of his , living in an adjoining residence , was in the habit of dropping in upon him each evening before retiring , to see that everything was all right and comfortable with him , the servants having loft with the family for th Summer . She saw him early last evening cheerfully moving about the house , watering the plants , feeding the canary birds , and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she know of no care or trouble afflicting him . His business was a light and easy one , and he did not disturb himself about it . He pas of the firm of Madan &; Frye , leather merchants , No. 1712 South-street , in this city . His partner is away on a business trip . Mr. Frye was yesterday at his office , and before leaving wrote to his family , who were preparing to return to the city , to stay away awhile longer . Business men who knew hint all speak of hint in the highest terms as a steady , industrious business man , whose credit was good for anything ho wanted for his business , which was a rather small one . The idea of suicide was scouted by all of them . Mr. J. A. Woolson , of the firm of William Claflin &; Co. , said that he had known Mr. Frye for 20 years , and had always thought him a steady , industrious , cheerful man , Among those who called at the house after being informed pf Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partner with Mr. Frye in the firm of Moseley , Dunn &; Frye , which firm was among the largest leather concerns in Boston . Mr. Frye was about 60 years of age , and had been quite an extensive traveler , having made a tour of America and Europe . The belief is strengthening , after further investigation , that the deed was done at the time the fire in the Tremont Temple was at its height . Some of the officers think Mr. Frye may have been followed into his house , while others are of opinion that the men had watched the house some time , and knowing the habits of Mr. Frye , and that he was alone in the house , took this time to enter . Finding him down stairs , they took him unawares , intending to stun him , and not to kill , but he resisting , the savage attack was made with the I knife and then the pistol , and the latter was thrown in the coal-hod to give the appearance of suicide . The neighbors have noticed several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bo peering about houses from which the occupants are absent for the Summer . It was well known in the neighborhood that Mr. Frye had a particularly strong safe , andneighbors were in the habit of leaving valuables , bonds , &c.,; in his care when going away . There is a young Italian who does odd work about the vicinity to whom Mr. Frye kindly gave occasional lessons in English , Two Italian friends of this youth were arrested on suspicion , bat it is not believed that any case can be made against them . A careful search has been made among the pawnbrokers for the watch , but nothing has been found . The wife of Mr. Frye has been . telegraphed for , and she will return to-morrow , when it will be ascertained what has been taken from the safe . It is generally believed by the officers that the crime was not committed by professionals .
