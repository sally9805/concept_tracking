txt The joy displayed by some of our conemporaries over the proceedings taken by Gen. KILPATRICK seems to be rather disproiortionate to the importance of the event . Lle charge reproduced . in these columns gainst KILPATRICK has been published at ne time or other in pretty nearly every paper in the country , and has never been lisproved  --  certainly , not to our knowledge . : east of all , has it ever been contradicted n this journal . When Mr. SHAFFER Mated that Mr. RAYMOND , or anybody else , lad withdrawn it , he was led. into an inacairacy , which we should be glad to afford Ara the means of correcting . Our files and ndex are at his service  --  if he can find . any irticle in this journal which withdrew the charge in question , we should be glad to have it pointed out to us . It has not been retracted , and . we say at once that we doi not at present see oar way clear to withdrawing it . We are always ready to correct an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing complained of is an injustice . In this case , we elect to go to trial in a Court of law . The Tribune , which has certainly libeled more innocent men in the country than any other journal extant , except its worthy companion , the Sun , is frantic with delight over this wonderful suit of KILPATRICIC 'S , and , in a kind of ecstacy , cries out for " Twenty more " actions to be brought against us by next Saturday . Most men have seen by this time many evidences of the narrow mind and still narrower intelligence , combined with defective moral principle , which characterize the present deplorable management of the Tribune . It seems to be half afiaid openly to defend . TCTTPATRIC1C . All that we shall say on that point is , that we hope our readers will do us the justice to suspend their judgment for the present . By no means let them accept the statements and reports of the Herald , World , Sun , or Tribune  --  all papers which were bitterly - opposed to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit our course in every conceivable way , which have ever since followed us with persistent abuse , and . which hate us today rather more than ever , because they find us more obstinately than ever in their paths . The Tribune is naturally rather more angry than its fellow-laborers , because a heavy blow was struck at its prestige last year ; because we have this year drawn away from it many thousands of its old readers ; and because most of Mr. GREELEY 'S friends , in this City at least , are persons of notoriously disreputable character , and therefore can not stand public discussion . It says that we have " attacked " many persons . So we have , and we did it in the clear discharge of our duty to the public . We have attacked most of the scandalous combinations of corrupt politicians and adventurers who now surround Mr. GREELEY , and . shall probably attack them again and again . We may take the liberty of saying that if we had not risked the inconveniences of denouncing these men a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of TWEED and his fellow-thieves . Do the public recollect how the Tribune , Herald and . other papers denounced us at that time for our " libels " upon TWEED and . his friends ! Do they remember how wildly it called.upon HALL and SWEENY and CONNOLLY to bring actions for libel against us ! We hope that the recollection of decent men in the community is still fresh on these points . We risked all at that time , and when the fight was over , the journals which had tried . to trip us up claimed all the credit of the contest . Now the Tammany and . Greeley faction are once more enraged at us , and . the Democratic manager of the Tribune implores them to bring a score of actions against us . Let them do it by all means . If we commit an injustice against any man we will honestly make amends for it ; but we will not be bullied into withdrawing any charge which we have reason to suppose is well-founded . It is this device of bullying which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be successful now . Within the Past week , a dozen letters have been sent to this office by Mr. GREELEY 'S supporters , threatening violence , and half a dozen others menacing us with libel suits . Among the writers of the latter class is GEORGE N. SAUNDERS , to whom we say thus publicly , that we will not withdraw a single word we have said about him , and , therefore , the sooner he brings his action the better . We will prove him to have been a traitor and a rascal . The disreputable characters who are at work for GREELEY need . not flatter themselves that they will deter us from exhibiting them to the public in their true light . The plain fact is , that one of the vilest gangs ever seen in politics is now leagued. together for the purpose of getting this City into their possession next November . We have broken down this same gang once , and . they are very anxious to prevent us doing the same thing again . It will be necessary to attack them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . It is for the public interests that this should be done , and . although . the task is attended with some annoyances , we propose to apply ourselves earnestly to it . We do not intend to stand by silently , while the stone which we rolled tip the hill last year is rolled down again by the Tweed and Greeley affiance . If we are to do work thoroughly , we must mention nanies  --  we can not succeed by talking against abstractions . The Tammany Ring would have been in existence today if we had only attacked it as a " Ring " ? it was by denouncing the individual members of it by name that we accomplished so much toward its overthrow , So it is with the new combination between GREELEY and Tammany . We must expose the individual members of it , if we are to bring their guilt home to them ; and we shall continue to do that , be the consequences what they may . We may be misunderstood and misrepresented now , but the day will come when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then do us justice , as they did after our first victory for the imperishable cause for which we have sincerely and honestly , if inadequately , contended .
