txt Twenty years ago the late Mr. GREELEY essayed , in the paper founded by hun , to prove that gold mining , on the whole , was not profitable , and that it even tended to impoverish , rather than to enrich , a country where it is carried . on . At a late meeting of a farmers ' club in Oaklands , Cal. , the same idea was advanced by Dr. E. S. CARR . and his arguments , having been extensively copied by the Press , have revived the old discussion . Dr. CARR affirms that every dollar of gold that has been dug in California has cost from one to one and . a half dollars . Fifty thousand people , he estimates , are engaged in mining in that State . The gold product of the State for 1872 was $20,000,000 . Now , if you reckon labor at $2 50 a day , Dr. CARR calculates the miners ' wages would come to $37,500,000 . His deduction is , that the difference between this sum and the actual gold product represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is plausible , as the chess players say , but not sound . In the first place , there is some doubt . to say no more , as regards figures . If we take the vote cast at the last election , and the number of Chinamen known to be in the gold-mining counties , we find . 25,567 as the number of the first , and 23,000 as that of the second . Adding ten per cent .  --  a fair allowance  --  for non-voters , the total adult male whites and Chinese together will number 50,000 . Now , by the assumption of Dr. CARR , the whole of these , to a man , are engaged in actual gold-mining . This assumption is palpably erroneous . It is well known that , in many of the mining counties , great numbers are engaged exclusively in agriculture . It is equally notorious that every mining neighborhood is always well provided with stores , so that many are occupied in trade and transportation . Again , a considerable proportion of the Chinese are employed as servants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much lower average is probably gained by the Chinese , than by the white miner . All these considerations must olearly operate so as greatly to affect the question whether gold mining pays , and certainly must go far to break the force of Dr. CARR 'S negative proposition . But even if it could be positively demonstrated that gold mining involves the loss thus claimed , we should still be far from admitting that the fact involved a loss collectively to the whole nation . For the enormous development of ether material interests  --  agricultural , perhaps , more than any other  --  the opening up of the heart of the Continent to immigration , the building of the Pacific railroads. the impetus given to . American commerce in the Western seas , and , in fact , . a great part of the grand national advance in wealth* ? numbers , influence , and area of cultivated territory have been due to SLITTER 'S discovery of gold in 1849 , and the subsequent yield of the precious metal in the regions surrounding . It is probably true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from her importations of gold from Mexico and Peru . Tlut , even admittin g this often-repeated theory , it is plain that , so far as the admission conveys a pertinent analogy , it . must relate to the moral rather than to the economic side of the argument . Sudden wealth , got without labor , is apt to demoralize nations as well as individuals ; but the gold . got from California was not wrung by force from the first ? possessors , but dug , with infinite labor , from the earth . We have a right to consider , besides , the differences of climate , race , religion , epoch , and other things bearing on the situation , before we can reach inferences of any probable value , to be derived from the suggested comparison . If the single matter of immigration alone were taken into account , on the familiar basis that each new corner is worth $1,000 to the country , the economic side of the case would be heavily affected . It would be hard , perhaps impossible , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who have been attracted , first and last , directly and indirectly , to come to this country by the California gold . mines must be very great indeed . Foreign capital , too , has likewise been diverted hither , not for investment in gold-mining enterprises alone , but for the numerous collateral and subsidiary undertakings that the auriferous discoveries have encouraged or made necessary . In a word , it is not an exaggeration to say that the gold . of California has put the United States full fifty years in advance of where they would now , in the ordinary progress of things , have been without it ; and . it is only idealogues or fanatics , whose microscopic vision only lets them see an inch or two before their noses , who fail to perceive this fact , or set themselves gravely to argue against it .
