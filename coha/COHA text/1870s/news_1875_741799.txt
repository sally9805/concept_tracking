txt Now is the season of the year when the householder sadly remarks to himself that republican government is a failure and American freedom a hollow mockery . With the advent of cold weather , the householder passes under the grinding tyranny of the plumber . From force of habit he'still calls himself a freeman , and his patriotic instincts lead him to adhere to the custom of mentioning to his children that they live in a land of liberty , where there are no despots , except a few trifling " bosses , " and no bloated aristocrats , except an occasional ward politician . He shrinks from blighting the spirits of his innocent offspring by mentioning the existence of the plumber , but he well kiiows that the plumber is his irresponsible and pitiless master . His small boy may pass his years of indiscretion in the belief that when he becomes a man he will be a free and independent citizen , but " In the shadow , year out , year in , The silent plumber waits for ever . " Like a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every limuau being who comes into the possession of a city house passes under Ins tyranny . It is a gloomy day when the young householder 's pipes first begin to burst , and he is made to face the terrible fact that ho is a slave to the merciless and procrastinating plumber . But sad as is the condition of that man who , on finding his water-pipes frozen , is forced to put himself under the yoke of the plumber , it is not wholly without hope . A philanthropist of exceptional ingenuity has devised a plan by which the oppressed householder may gain his freedom , and the lordly plumber be humbled and overthrown . Science has shown that water-pipes , if lined with a perfectly smooth surface , to which ice-crystals can not adhere , will never freeze nor burst . We have only to furnish our houses with iron pipes , lined with glass , to render them proof against those accidents which now give the plumber his opportunity to rivet his chains upon us . The man whose house is thus protected can laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the latter is as feeble as he inevitably becomes after a few years passed in sitting on the edge of householders ' bathtubs and chewing vast quantities of tobacco , while he considers what tools he had best forget to bring with him when he pays his next weekly visit " to see what wants to be done . " It is evident that with the gradual introduction of these revolutionary pipes , the plumber 's power will steadily wane until the happy time arrives when the deposed tyrant perishes miserably of starvation , and his public funeral is celebrated with popular rejoicingq , while his portable furnace is hung up at Washington by the side of the Key of the Bastille , as a perpetual rebuke to those who prate of the good old times of darkness and despotism . About the same time we shall rid ourselves of that domestic poisoner , the furnace . There can be but little doubt that the furnace was invented under the direct instigation of that personage darkly alluded to in serious New-England circles , as the Adversary . The furnace not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with its dry heat , but it has abolished that only effective means of household ventilation , the open fire-place . When the furnace has disappeared , diphtheria and consumption will have lost a firm ally and supporter , and we shall have pure and wholesome air in rooms where the furnace-flue now renders breathing merely a process of slow suicide . Of course , the custom of conducting sewergas into houses can not much longer survive . With proper traps and ventilating pipes , the sewer-gas which now slays its annual thousands can be . cheaply and easily kept at bay . The day will come when the crime of laying pipes to conduct ibis deadly gas into bedrooms and kitchens will be classed with those fur which Bias VILLIERS suilered . The crime has hitherto been mainly one of ignorance . The progress of sanitary science has now taken away the last excuse for vicious sewerage , and the day is near at hand when the waste-pipes of our houses will Ito longer be so constructed as to give a deadly foe easy and constant access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined by the furnace and the sewer-gas , and whose spirits have been crushed by the long dominion of the plumber , it may seem the tream of a visionary optimist to look forward to emancipation from these domestic evils . But nothing is more certain than the brilliant future which awaits the householder . The furnace is doomed , the sewer-gas is day by day finding itself cut off from houses into which it has been accustomed to bring disease and death , and the conscience-stricken plumber has heard of glass-lined pipes , and knows that the knoll of his cruel tyranny has struck . When we celebrate our next Centennial , men will look with wonder at the fossil furnace which will be exhibited in time collection of American antiquities , and will ask if the plumber , whose implements of crime are hung by the side of the furnace , was not au imaginary and malignant deity , who evoked the demon sewergas , and with the latter really constituted a form of the universal sun-myth.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
