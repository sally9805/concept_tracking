He said he could make a half a million apiece for us , if he had them in his possession for a day . I took them from the bank vault and gave them to him . He is shrewd and safe . But I did wrong .

One day in the winter of 1872 , the passengers in the waiting room of the Grand Central Station saw a young woman looking with anxious eyes as though expecting the arrival of someone . There drove up to the door a prison van . From it descended a batch of convicts . As they marched by , the woman , half rising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a solitary convict , his eyes bent on the floor , oblivious to everything but his shame . The woman , with a cry , rushed to him and buried her face upon his breast ; he made a move to put his arms around her , but the irons held him back , and he could only press a kiss upon the quivering lips that reached up to meet his . In that one moment , she forgot that the eyes of the world were watching her , forgot the disgrace of her husband . Then , she turned her tearstained face and met the gaze of the crowd . With a look of mingled defiance and pitiful appeal , she slipped her hand into his and passed on with him to the train .

Windows of Moorish glass above and at back , those at back leading to terrace showing a night view of New York City after a snowstorm . The snow still falling at intervals . Hanging Moorish lamps shed a soft , mellow light throughout the room . Off through entrance , L. , is seen a flood of light as though coming from the brilliant parlors beyond .

I 'm keeping out of his way . He has written me a note every five minutes . In the first he said , " What accident did you tell her had befallen me ? " I only answered , " Come late . " A few minutes after , another : " Why do n't you let me know where I am hurt ? Our stories must agree . P.S. Am I late enough ? " I replied , " Do n't worry . Bangor attentive .

Either I have lost the power of expressing myself on paper , or Sam has lost what little intellect he had . I never saw such blatant asininity in my life . What story has he told his mother ? What accident has happened ? Where am I wounded ? Ca n't be my leg , or I could n't get here . So I 've ventured my right arm . I have never suffered such agony as I did in that cab , knowing that that pine tree sapling was here , trying to throw me into the shade . Yet , Sam writes , " Do n't worry .

Calvin Stedman He came to me for advice . Cohen . Israel Cohen You  --  the counsel for the bank ? Sted . Calvin Stedman I am his counsel as well . I told him that the risk was great . It was at half-past ten that you sent Prescott down to the vault for the securities , and found them missing . Bank Examiner Kip should have been called at once , and Seabury arrested . Cohen .

Calvin Stedman I have never seen anything like it since Black Friday . Governor Rodman , at the mention of " Black Friday " calmly turns his head toward the speaker The events of that day were impressed upon my mind , by a trial in which I was afterwards engaged . I was United States District Attorney at the time , and I had occasion to prosecute a man whose defalcation had wrecked a bank as strong as the Jefferson . Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Did you send him to prison ? Sted . Calvin Stedman Yes . When the judge pronounced the sentence of six years , the prisoner turned his head and looked at me  --  the man who had fastened the crime upon him . That look I have never forgotten . Time , and the changes it brings , may have altered the man , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kate .

Mrs. Kate Delafield No wonder people call you merciless . Sted . Calvin Stedman Stand where I have stood , a public prosecutor , in the courts ! It is my fight against crime that has made men call me merciless . But I am merciless only to protect homes like yours , Mrs. Delafield . During the above Rodman has excused himself and joined Kate Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Governor , will you permit me to introduce Mr. Stedman ? Governor Rodman . Stedman and Rodman meet . As Stedman takes his hand , his attention is arrested by what he seems to recognize in Rodman 's looks Rod . Agnes Rodman Mr. Stedman , I overheard your remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too  --  enables me to speak with some authority . Sted . Calvin Stedman Your position must have brought you into contact with many criminals , Governor Rodman . Rod . Agnes Rodman You think when a man has once been buried in a prison cell , that it is impossible he should ever rise from that grave of his reputation to a life in which men will honor him again ? Is there no such thing as reformation ? Sted . Calvin Stedman Not with a prison as its birthplace . Whatever the cause , every day adds its proof to the fact , and we lawyers deal with facts . Rod . Agnes Rodman But , suppose a case  --  well , take for instance that man of whom you spoke just now  --  if you should meet him , find him respected among those who knew nothing of his antecedents , occupying a place of trust  --  Sted .

Agnes Rodman You would show him no mercy ? Sted . Calvin Stedman None ! Soft strains of light music are heard , off L. Rod . Agnes Rodman But if to expose him were to drag others down in his fall ? Agnes enters from the parlor , L. In contrast to Act I , her manner is that of one supremely happy . She goes joyfully to Mrs. Prescott , who takes her in her arms . Agnes at the same time extending her arm draws Dora to her and kisses her If he had a son  --  or a daughter  --  Agnes . Agnes Rodman Papa ! Rod .

Agnes Rodman A matter upon which Mr. Stedman and I do not agree . Sted . Calvin Stedman Pardon me . The last argument that you presented to me , I can not answer . Enter Cohen from parlor , L.

No one else must know it yet . I tell you now , that you may from this moment  --  Oh ! My darling ! There is no help for it !

Dora Prescott In terror Something has happened to Ned ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman Can you be a brave little woman and listen to your sister ? Dora . Dora Prescott Yes . Tell me . Agnes . Agnes Rodman With effort Mr. Cohen has discovered since his dismissal that he is a defaulter , Dora gifts a half-stifled agonized cry . Agnes quickly places her hand over Dora 's month and , supporting her with the other arm , sits on a couch , drawing Dora down with her , who sinks on her knees beside her Dora . Dora Prescott Ned ! Agnes ! There must be some mistake ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman It is true , or Mr. Cohen would not have said it . Dora . Dora Prescott Can we do nothing to save him ? Agnes . Agnes Rodman It is you that I am thinking of now . I can imagine what the pain must be  --  but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora . Dora Prescott Oh ! I ca n't give up Ned ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman It is because I know what your fate would be , that I have the courage to say to you , " From this moment , give him up . " With a moan , Dora buries her head in Agnes 's lap ; Agnes , in a trembling , half-broken voice , bending over and pressing Dora 's head with both her hands Dora , there is a place away up in the north of this state , where a cluster of hemlocks shelters a grave ! A woman sleeps there ! Aside My mother ! Aloud She was placed as you are now , only she was already a wife , and she is lying there of a broken heart . Not all the remorse of the man , whose crime , like Edward 's , blighted her young life , can stop the moaning of the hemlocks above her grave ! Dora . Dora Prescott Through her tears Ned ! Ned ! Servant enters , R. , with salver and card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Someone is here . Dora rises , and wiping her eyes , turns her face , L. Looking at card Mrs. Kirke . Ask her in here .

Agnes . Agnes Rodman We shall know all about it tonight when Will returns home . Dora . Dora Prescott Clasping her hands fervently I will go , Agnes ! I will pray that he may be innocent ! Agnes kisses her . Dora goes out , R.1.E . Agnes , without moving , follows her with her eyes . Mrs. Kirke , a young woman about the same age as Agnes , enters , R. , about the place where Dora went off . She is dressed in deep mourning . Her veil is thrown back from her face . She stands hesitating at the portire Agnes . Agnes Rodman Seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Delafield Coming forward and taking her hand Miss Rodman ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman I 'm very glad to see you . Motioning her to be seated and sitting L. of her Mrs. K. Mrs. Kate Delafield I knew you would grant me a moment alone , and I wanted to mingle my good wishes with those you have received tonight . I need offer no further explanation of my presence to the woman who extended her aid and sympathy in the darkest hour of my life ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman The favor was on my side , Mrs. Kirke , and I thank you for having allowed me the privilege of relieving you and your children from temporary embarrassment . Mrs. K. Mrs. Kate Delafield Looking earnestly at Agnes and speaking tremulously I am afraid there were others that suffered through my husband , besides his wife and children . Agnes lays her hand tenderly upon Mrs. Kirke 's arm In looking over some of Mr. Kirke 's papers late this afternoon , I found a letter that I remembered came to the house a short time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened until I opened it . It was from Mr. Prescott . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Quietly drawing her hand away in surprise Mr. Prescott ! Mrs. K. Mrs. Kate Delafield Upbraiding Mr. Kirke for not having returned certain securities . Agnes lets first one arm , then the other , fall on the couch beside her , supporting herself and looking intently at Mrs. Kirke It was only a line , giving no particulars , but it was evident that my husband had been borrowing extensively from him . The very food my children had for their supper , I was able to give them only through the goodness of the woman whose promised husband my husband had wronged . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Who has followed her words breathlessly , in a voice that she endeavors to render calm What did you do with that letter ? Mrs. K. Mrs. Kate Delafield Destroyed it with the other papers .

Mrs. Kirke raises it to her lips , then goes out , R. Agnes . Agnes Rodman That other letter  --  that Will received  --  the same day  --  signed  --  Arnold Kirke ! His looks when I gave it to him ! As the truth dawns upon her , horror comes into her face ; her hands are drawn back across her temples ; she stands frozen as though fighting back the awful truth ; then she starts to utter a wild cry which she stifles by pressing her handkerchief in her clenched fist over her mouth , and for a second a smothered pitiful sound if heard . Enter Edward quickly , L. Edward . Edward Seabury Mr. Cohen must have gone . I ca n't wait . Seeing Agnes Miss Rodman . Agnes , with superhuman effort , controls herself I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to Mr. Cohen 's house . He wanted to see me . Half laughing I do n't dare hope , and yet what else can it mean ?

His voice is heard beyond the portires Good night . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Starting , R. , to call him back .. Edward ! With outstretched arms , the words dying away on her lips Edward ! She turns , clinging to the portires , and directs a frightened look into the parlor , L. As she realizes that to proclaim the innocence of Dora 's lover would be to reveal her own lover 's guilt , her head sinks back and she is only prevented from falling to the floor by the portires . Swaying forward , she totters out of the room , R. , calling in a low hoarse whisper Father ! Father ! ACT III . Scene : Library in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The midnight meeting . The scene represents a magnificent , massively furnished library . On the L. are broad steps and balustrade leading to a landing , where are seen large double glass doors , opening into a room above . The portion of this room seen when the doors are opened is in marked contrast to the library . A hanging lamp in the room , dimly lighted . A door , L.1.E. , with portires leading to a more private part of the house . A door , L.2.E . On the R. are large doors opening into a hallway which stops at the doors . In the hallway a somber light is burning . From the doors , R. to R.C. at back , are windows through which is seen a low balustrade and trees completely shutting out the view of the street beyond , with the exception of a portion of one house , which is seen through the branches of the trees . At the back of the room , running obliquely to the R. is a large fireplace . Above the fireplace is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magdalen at the feet of the Savior . The picture is not discernible at first , that part of the room being in the shadow . A soft red glow proceeds from the fire in grate . The hanging lamp sheds a subdued light over the room . A lamp with a dead green shade stands turned down . Everything outside is covered with snow . The storm has ceased . The clouds have broken in places , showing small portions of a cold moonlit sky , a dull blue light pervading the atmosphere outside . Let the house lights be arranged before the curtain rises , every light possible being turned out . There is heard the distant sound of a bell striking twelve o'clock . At the fifth stroke a low weird strain of music is heard . At the eighth stroke the curtain is raised , being timed so as to reveal the entire stage picture on the twelfth stroke . The music continues . The doors of the room , R.1.E. , are opened , and Sam with two books comes down into the library . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large lamp , L. , and is turning it up as Mr. Cohen enters , R. He appears as though he has just left his cab , having on his hat , overcoat , and gloves . He leaves the door , R. , ajar . Cohen . Israel Cohen Removing his gloves Who is here ? Sam . Sam Delafield Mr. Bergman and Mr. Wayne . They are talking to Colonel Kip . Cohen . Israel Cohen The books ? Sam . Sam Delafield They are here , sir . Sam has been assisting him to remove his overcoat . He takes the coat and the hat from table , R. , and hangs them in the hall , R. Cohen . Israel Cohen Taking keys from his pocket , crosses to the back of the table , C. , and inserts the keys in the lock None of the servants are up ? Sam . Sam Delafield Turning in the doorway Except Andrews . Cohen . Israel Cohen Whose attention is attracted , crosses to the window A cab has just driven up to the door . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the back parlor and let you know . Do you know if my mother has retired ? Sam . Sam Delafield The servant said she fancied at dinner that you were not well , and she thought she 'd sit up until you returned home . Exit , R.1.E . Cohen Israel Cohen The bank examiner will take charge . Enter Sam hastily , R.1.E . Sam . Sam Delafield Governor Rodman and his daughter have called . They want to see you at once . Cohen . Israel Cohen Surprised At this hour ? Ask them here . Exit Sam , R. Mr. Cohen , crossing to front of table , turns the light higher Agnes and her father ! What can bring them to see me now ? Governor Rodman appears , R. , having his overcoat on , and his hat and gloves in his hand . He is followed by Agnes , wearing her wrap , the hood being partly pushed back from her head Governor Rodman ! Agnes ! Placing a chair for Agnes . Agnes grasps the back of the chair , supporting herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam has meantime withdrawn , closing the doors Rod . Agnes Rodman Mr. Cohen , I came at the request of my daughter . She was led to confide in me by the hope that I might be of assistance to you . I could gain from her no particulars except that your bank was in trouble , and that young Seabury was accused of a grave offense . Her anxiety is natural , when we consider that he is engaged to be married to Dora , William 's sister . As I live only for my child 's happiness , I share her anxiety ; therefore I am here . Cohen . Israel Cohen Extending his hand I thank you . You can be of great service to me . But as to Edward Seabury  --  Rod . Agnes Rodman It is Agnes 's wish that I save this young man at any cost . Cohen . Israel Cohen The affair is now in the hands of the directors . The bank examiner is , at this moment , waiting to confer with them . Agnes . Agnes Rodman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is all powerful . If you were to speak in his behalf  --  Cohen . Israel Cohen I should be false to my trust as head of this bank if I tried to shield a defaulter . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Aside God in Heaven , help me ! Aloud Father , will you let me speak with Mr. Cohen alone ? Rodman looks at Cohen Cohen . Israel Cohen Indicating room , L.1.E . Will you be seated in that room ? Rod . Agnes Rodman Thank you . Crosses and exit , L.1.E. , closing the door . Cohen turns to Agnes , who , leaning on the table at the R. front corner of which she is seated , raises her eyes to him Agnes . Agnes Rodman Was n't it in this very room that your mother once showed me that picture of the Savior ? Cohen . Israel Cohen The window ? Yes . Pointing to window at back It is there . The night is too dark to see it now . Agnes . Agnes Rodman It represents him pronouncing forgiveness to the Magdalen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel Cohen Yes . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Adhering as you do to your faith , why do you keep in your home that picture ? Cohen . Israel Cohen Because of my admiration for the man . Whatever the Nazarene may have been , His treatment of mankind , His help to them , His hope for them , puts the breath of Heaven into the words of His philosophy . What picture could I have in the house of a Jew more appropriate than this picture of a Jew . Agnes . Agnes Rodman He taught mercy . Slowly rising And it is mercy I came to beg of you . Cohen . Israel Cohen Agnes ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman Pointing The night hides that picture now . Is darkness to hide its teachings from your heart , in an hour like this ? Cohen . Israel Cohen You could not plead more earnestly , if it were your own lover . And if it were your lover , I could give no other answer . Agnes . Agnes Rodman Did you not tell me once that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agnes Rodman By that love , show mercy to Dora  --  to me . Supporting herself by leaning on table .

Aside Ah ! if it were only the man who had to deal with the case , and not the president of the bank ! Agnes , I can give you but one promise ! Agnes . Agnes Rodman Breathlessly Yes ? Cohen . Israel Cohen Let me call your father , Crossing and opening door , L.1.E . Governor Rodman . Rodman appears , L.1.E . I will take no part in the prosecution of this young man , but will lay your proposition before the directors and leave it to them . A knock heard , R. Come in . Sam appears , R. Sam .

Agnes . Agnes Rodman If they refuse my fathers offer ? Cohen . Israel Cohen I do not wish to hold out hope . They can not accept it , unless every other means to save the bank fails . Agnes , pressing her hand against her heart , gives one helpless , frightened look , off R. Cohen holding the portire and extending his hand . Come . Agnes places her hand in his and he leads her out of the room . Enter Sam . He turns up the stand lamp , R. , as Mr. Wayne and Mr. Reynolds are seen in the hallway in earnest conversation . Mr. Wayne , a man of 45 , with brown hair , dressed in a plain business suit ; Mr. Reynolds of about 60 , with white hair and white side whiskers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man of 35 , black hair , dressed in Prince Albert coat , with light trousers . He crosses to the fire and stands warming his hands , with his back to the audience . Stedman , still in evening dress , enters with Colonel Kip . Stedman and Kip stand in front of table , C. , Stedman talking , Kip listening impassively , and examining the books of the bank . Mr. Pendleton appears in hallway , a short , stout man of about 70 . His hair is a little long and bushy , no beard , his head representing somewhat the appearance of Ibsen 's . He is slightly deaf . He hangs his overcoat in the hall , places his hat on his stick in the corner . Sam places chair , L. of large table . for Kip , who sits .

Wayne and Reynolds come in from hallway . Sam , who has placed the chairs , brings from room , L.3.E. , two books which he places on large table , C. , then goes out , R. , closing the doors Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Rising and offering his hand Mr. Cohen . Cohen . Israel Cohen Taking his hand Colonel Kip , from the first I have opposed your being called in .

I remember being called to a meeting once  --  it was in the winter of ' 67  --  one night  --  Cohen . Israel Cohen Pleasantly Yes , my dear old friend , I have heard you tell that story a great many times . Going to chair , back of table Pend . Mr. Pendleton It 's a good one , though , is n't it ? Ha , ha , ha ! Cohen . Israel Cohen Across the table The way you tell it , it certainly is . Stedman , with his hands behind him , has walked anxiously to the door , R. , as though expecting someone Pend . Mr. Pendleton Turning to Stedman What did he say ? Sted . Calvin Stedman That affairs are too serious tonight for anything but business . Pend . Mr. Pendleton Apart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . I can see by his manner he has found a way out of the difficulty . Goes up to fire Sted . Calvin Stedman Aside Has he ? Mr. Cohen has meantime motioned the directors to be seated . Kip sits a little back from the table at Cohen 's R. Stedman sits in front of the table at the R. corner . A chair is left vacant at L. side of table . Bergman , R. of table , some distance off . Pendleton has seated himself close to the fire with his back to the others , his feet on the fender . When all are seated , the doors , R. , open and William enters . He is still in dress suit and wears a cape overcoat . He closes the door and looks for a moment as if to see where to sit Cohen . Israel Cohen Pointing to vacant chair at his L. William . Will . William Prescott Crossing to Mr. Cohen I drove home to get  --  to get my memorandum book . Am I late ? Cohen . Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table before him Are n't you going to take off your overcoat ? William , seeing that he has forgotten to remove his overcoat , looks quickly at the coat , then at Cohen ; gives a slight laugh , and without rising , takes it off , letting it fall over the back of the chair Pend . Mr. Pendleton Without looking around If it 's agreeable to the rest of the board , I 'll sit here and toast myself . Cohen . Israel Cohen To Colonel Kip Has the exact condition of affairs been made known to you ? We have our Daily Statement Book and our General Ledger here  --  Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Mr. Stedman has given me the particulars . I have examined your Statement Book and looked over your Bond Accounts . Sted . Calvin Stedman Mr. Cohen , for once in his life , is assuming a greater burden than he can carry . Against his earnest remonstrance , I urged you gentlemen to call in Bank Examiner Kip , that we might not be blamed for keeping from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been committed by an officer of our bank . Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Then it is the wish of the directors that I lay the affair before the Comptroller of the Currency at Washington ? Sted . Calvin Stedman I see no other way . Cohen . Israel Cohen I am the bank 's largest stockholder ; my risk is the greatest , and I say , " No . " Yesterday , we met the run without much difficulty . Today a new trouble was discovered . Even then , when these gentlemen would have called you in , I withstood the run . When my brother directors had done all they felt called upon to do , I used of my private fortune as much as could be turned into ready money . But by ten o'clock tomorrow morning there will be two hundred thousand more cash in the bank . The Imperial Trust Co. has made us a loan of that amount on our remaining bonds . Sted . Calvin Stedman Without looking at him It is not enough . Cohen . Israel Cohen To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Zachary T. Kip Will anyone pledge an addition to that ? I do not feel justified in permitting you to continue business in the morning , unless you have , at least , five hundred thousand in your bank before noon and a provision for more on the following day . Cohen . Israel Cohen I 'll manage with half that sum . Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Mr. Cohen , the condition would be even more severe , but for my confidence in you . The Tenth National this morning had a million to commence with , and yet , at noon today , it closed its doors . Sam opens door , R. , and stands on threshold looking at Cohen Cohen . Israel Cohen Gentlemen , Mr. Seabury is here . At the mention of Mr. Seabury 's name , William , unseen by the others , gives a slight start Sted . Calvin Stedman To Sam Let him come in . Sam withdraws , leaving the doors open . The eyes of everyone directed towards the doors , R. Cohen . Israel Cohen Looking straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , and provision for the day after ! Aloud Gentlemen ! They look at Cohen , with the exception of Stedman , who simply turns his head and listens It is my wish to recover as many of the missing securities as are still in Seabury 's possession . After the investigation of his case I have a proposition to lay before you , which , if you accept it , will save the bank . Sted . Calvin Stedman Aside What the devil is he going to do now ? Edward enters quickly . As he sees the Directors , his look of eager expectation changes to one of surprise ; he checks himself and watches the faces that are turned toward him . William , as Edward comes into the room , places his elbow on the table , leaning his head upon his hand , so as to shade his face . Sam , withdrawing , closes the door Edw . Edward Seabury Mr. Cohen , I did n't expect to see anyone but you . Bowing Gentlemen ! They make no return of his salutation Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you be seated ? Takes papers from the table drawer . Edward , perplexed , glances from face to face , draws the chair toward him and sits . During the following , William remains immovable , his head still resting upon his hand , but not so as to hide his face from the audience . Stedman , with his back to Edward , is watching Cohen Today we had occasion to use bonds of the Chicago &; Northwestern , Delaware &; Hudson Canal , and Gold Sevens . These , together with Milwaukee &; St. Paul first Eights , Cairo &; Fulton , Western Union Debenture Sevens , three bonds of the Brooklyn Permanent Water Loan and two of St. Paul &; Manitoba first Sevens , were not in the safe . Edward starts , looking at Cohen in amazement . With marked emphasis One hundred and five thousand dollars of the bank 's funds are missing . Edw . Edward Seabury Breathless I remember those securities when I had charge of the safe . Cohen . Israel Cohen I have asked you here tonight to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet Mr. Cohen ! Do you impute any wrong dealing to me ? Cohen . Israel Cohen To deny what you have done in the face of the most conclusive facts , is simply to add to your offense . Edw . Edward Seabury Vehemently I do deny it . As God hears me , until this moment I knew nothing of this loss . I deserved everything you said to me last week , and when you dismissed me because you feared I had dealings with Arnold Kirke , you were right ; I had been speculating that very day . At this admission , Stedman makes a note upon a sheet of paper on the table before him But I have never stolen . When you confront me with this terrible accusation , I say it is a lie ! A lie ! And it emanates from that man ! Pointing to Stedman He was responsible for my dismissal . I struck him in the face for that . And now , damn him  --  As Edward rushes at Stedman , Kip seizes him from behind and drags him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Holding Edward 's hands behind him Seabury ! Seabury ! This can do no good . Edw . Edward Seabury In frenzy He loves the woman who is to be my wife . He has been my enemy ever since he knew she loved me . Stedman rises and crosses to doors , R. Edward , struggling to reach him , turns as he crosses And now , not content with driving me out of the bank , he tries to complete my ruin . With superhuman effort I 'll kill him . A general movement . Kip , from whose grasp Edward wrenches his hands , stands in front of him . Stedman has during this opened the door and beckoned to someone in the hallway Sted . Calvin Stedman Speaking off Officer , give me those . A fair of handcuffs are handed to him by someone outside . To Edward Your bravado is not only useless but delays this investigation . Upon the complaint of Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Wayne this afternoon a warrant was issued for your arrest . Edw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy marshal is here to serve it . If our efforts to do what we can for you are met with abuse and violence , there is but one thing to be done . Edward sinks down in his chair . Stedman passes to the front of the table , placing the handcuffs down L.C. of table . As the handcuffs touch the table , William involuntarily draws back , lowering his hand until his arm rests upon the table . Without making a sound he moves his fingers , drumming on the table . The others have resumed their seats . Stedman stands by his chair Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Young man . I advise you to answer the questions that these gentlemen may ask . Cohen . Israel Cohen Mr. Stedman . Sted . Calvin Stedman In view of what Mr. Seabury has just said , I will ask you to hear the facts , not from me , but from the lips of his friend , the cashier of the bank , Mr. Prescott . To William State the circumstances connected with your absence a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that Edward and I have known each other from boyhood , that he is engaged to be married to my sister , you will understand my feelings , and that sooner than speak a word that would incriminate him I would have my tongue paralyzed for ever . Edw . Edward Seabury Speak out . Will ; you know I am innocent , do n't you ? Cohen . Israel Cohen To Edward Only three people have access to that safe  --  you , Prescott , and myself . If you did not take those securities , then either Prescott or I did . Edw . Edward Seabury Then somebody else has duplicated the keys , and found out the combination of the locks , for I did not . Cohen . Israel Cohen To William You owe it to me , to yourself , to speak . Edw . Edward Seabury Speak out , Will ; I ask it . Will . William Prescott May I be seated ? Cohen assents ; William sits About the middle of last November my health began to fail . The doctor ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . When January came and my condition was becoming worse , Mr. Cohen insisted that I should follow the doctor 's advice , and I yielded .

I was away only two weeks and upon my return received back the keys from my substitute , with his statement that the contents of the safe were just as I left them . Sted .

Sted . Calvin Stedman And it was not until today , when there was a sudden call for them , that , upon opening them , you found that some of the bonds had been stolen ? Will . William Prescott Yes . Sted . Calvin Stedman Turning to Edward You admit that you had dealings with Arnold Kirke . Edw . Edward Seabury Yes . Sted . Calvin Stedman With what result ? Edw .

Calvin Stedman You heard Mr. Cohen say that those were some of the bonds missing . Edw . Edward Seabury I knew that the bank held bonds of the same kind . Sted . Calvin Stedman Did you know that bonds , corresponding exactly with those missing , were sold by this broker ? Edw . Edward Seabury I did not know it . Sted . Calvin Stedman Do n't you see , we have reason to believe that you did not obtain those bonds from Kirke , but on the contrary furnished him with those he sold on the day of the panic ? If we are mistaken , surely there is someone you can bring , who will testify to the exact nature of your dealings with Kirke . Edw . Edward Seabury No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sted .

I could not give you back what I never took from you . Cohen . Israel Cohen Pointing to L.3.E . Will you go into that room and wait for me ? Reynolds and Wayne join Pendleton at the L. of the fireplace . Bergman goes to the group at the back . Cohen moves his chair towards Kip and they converse seated . As Edward crosses to William , L. , Stedman rises and walks silently out of the room , R. , leaving doors open Edw . Edward Seabury Apart to William Will , how am I to clear myself ?

Gentlemen , I implore you not to wreck his life . I know you will say that where crime is so evident , punishment must follow . I know that I am laying my petition before the officials of a bank , whose duty it is to guard its welfare . I bring to you , as officials , my father 's offer to save the bank .

If she had the strength , she would be here herself kneeling before you , begging for her lover 's life  --  God forgive me that I ever counselled her to do otherwise , but I did ! I did ! And now I come in her place . During this , William has stood at the fireplace , his hand resting on the mantelpiece , his being the only face turned away from Agnes Kip . Colonel Zachary T.

But it seems that six years were not enough , for there stands the prosecutor still , and I am as much the convict as when I stood in Auburn prison . Had I no other motives for wishing to save this young man , the knowledge of what a prison cell will make of him  --  what it would have made of me , but for my child  --  arms me in his defense .

I told him I did n't miss it , send it to you . Did he ? Marg . Margery Knox Sent me a draft on you for five thousand . Sam . Sam Delafield Eh ? Marg . Margery Knox Pa meant that you lost five thousand in speculation , and he won it . Sam . Sam Delafield I must have done that while I was changing animals . Marg . Margery Knox That 's nothing to the reception Colonel Kip will give you . He 'll never forgive you for that arm joke . Sam . Sam Delafield Nothing but the affairs of the bank that night saved me . I left for Chicago the very next morning . I suppose Kip and I will have to meet tonight . When he came in the front door today , I went out through the basement . Marg . Margery Knox Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delafield That 's what the early bird said to the worm . Marg . Margery Knox Well , as I 'm partly responsible , I 'll have to stand by you . Give me that bunch of flowers  --  I 'll take them up to Agnes . Sam . Sam Delafield Handing the flowers to her So much obliged for all the trouble you 've taken with me . Margery selects a rosebud and pins it on the lapel of his coat How is it that no one but you could blow away the cloud that has hung over my head ? Marg . Margery Knox I suppose because I came from the Windy City . Sam . Sam Delafield Aside This is a good opportunity to tell her all I feel . Abruptly Margery . Marg . Margery Knox Dropping the flowers on the floor Goodness me ! How you startle a body ! Sitting on a low ottoman beside the chair , she rearranges the bouquet Mr. Delafield , you never called me that before . Sam . Sam Delafield Aside For the first time I realize what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops on her knees to gather some of the roses from the floor , placing them on the chair ; then moves up snugly to it , and as she picks up the single flowers and replaces them in the bunch , coquettishly brings her head close to his , which he gradually pushes entirely through the lower part of the chair back . As her head comes close to his , he , embarrassed , moves up a little to a narrower part of the chair Marg . Margery Knox I only let people call me that who are very near to me . Sam . Sam Delafield I wish I were your cousin , or something . Marg . Margery Knox Why ? Bringing her head dose Sam . Sam Delafield I should be nearer to you than I am . Why is it we are told there are no marriages in Heaven ? Marg . Margery Knox Probably because there are no men there . Sam . Sam Delafield Aside That was a failure . Aloud How do you think it feels to be an engaged couple ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be an engaged couple , all by myself . Could I ? Bringing her head close as before Sam . Sam Delafield Aside If she does that again , I 'll use my opportunity . Aloud But if you had someone to help you ? Marg . Margery Knox I fancy it would be like going up to the seventh story of Heaven in an elevator of roses  --  Lifting her bunch cushioned with violets , and a little modest daisy as a bellboy . Throwing her head back and looking straight into his eyes Does that come anywhere near your idea of the picture ? Sam . Sam Delafield There is only one thing lacking . Marg . Margery Knox Bringing her head very close to Sam 's What ? Sam kisses her . Enter Dora , L.1.E . Sam . Sam Delafield Tulips ! Beg pardon  --  you took me up in that flowery elevator and I could n't help it . Marg . Margery Knox Starting to her feet Oh ! Sam . Sam Delafield Eh ! In raising his head he gets it fastened so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; in his efforts to extricate himself . Sam has turned the chair so that it faces the front . After trying to move his head down , he stands , the picture of hopeless despair . Looking from one to the other Beg pardon , ladies . Either this chair has shrunk or my head has swelled ; I ca n't get it back . Dora . Dora Prescott Laughing at him I 'm very sorry that I happened to come in when I did . Sam . Sam Delafield So am I. Quickly I beg pardon . The fact of the matter is , Miss Dora , what you saw me doing just now was pure impulse  --  there was no meaning in it whatsoever . Marg . Margery Knox Eh ? Sam . Sam Delafield Oh !  --  oh ! I beg pardon . I did mean it . Going up to Dora and speaking to her I love her with all my heart . Indeed I do . I have loved her from the time I first saw her . And , now so great has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , believe me , I love her  --  I want her to be my wife . During the above , Dora retreats a step or two under the fusillade of his declaration . Margery with comic indignation that Sam does not make the avowal to her instead of Dora , takes up a sofa pillow and throws it at him December oats , forty-two . Oh , I thought I was on the Board of Trade again . Marg . Margery Knox To which of us are you making this declaration ? She 's a married woman . Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Outside Left your purse in the carriage ? I 'll get it for you . Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Outside Thank you , colonel . Sam . Sam Delafield Here 's Colonel Kip . I 'm at his mercy in this helpless position . Margery and Dora seize the chair and try to lift it . Sam gets on tiptoes Oooo  --  the other way , please . Marg . Margery Knox There 's no other way . We 'll have to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora . Dora Prescott He 's coming . Sam . Sam Delafield I 'm doomed . Marg . Margery Knox Dora , give me that shawl . Dora gets shawl from sofa , Margery drags Sam , R. , pushes armchair back of table and places Sam , with the chair still about his neck , alongside of the table Here , Sam . Quick , Dora . They throw the shawl quickly over his head and the back of the chair , tucking the shawl in so as to make his head present the appearance of a pillow Give me that ribbon . Snatches ribbon from Dora 's neck or waist Make it look like a pillow . Pin your side . They pin the ribbon Sam . Sam Delafield Ooo  --  Marg . Margery Knox Tapping him on the head Keep quiet . Enter Kate , L.3.E . Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Why , girls , what 's the matter ? Sam . Sam Delafield I feel like an apple dumpling . Dora . Dora Prescott Sam ! Marg . Margery Knox We 're trying to save him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Margery and Dora stand hiding the chair from Kip , who enters , L.3.E. , with Kate 's purse Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Allow me . Giving her the purse I found your purse on the step of the carriage . Marg. and Dora . Margery Knox and Dora Prescott Nervously , trying to be pleasant How de do , colonel ? Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Young ladies , I salute you . Hello , what 's the matter with you two ? Marg and Dora . Margery Knox and Dora Prescott Holding their dresses so as to hide the chair Nothing . Nothing . Kip .

Dora and Margery give slight cry Keep me three hours in a cab , will he , waiting to come late with that wounded arm . For your sake , Kitty , I do n't want to get anywhere near him . Crosses over and sits in the chair where Sam is ; leaning back , he jumps up with a cry Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield What 's the matter ? Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip That 's the most extraordinary chair I ever sat upon . Must be a new style of antique . Feeling Sam 's head That pillow feels as if it were stuffed with a cannon ball . Punches the head Sam . Sam Delafield Groans Oh  --  h  --  h  --  h ! Kip starts back aghast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter , Colonel Kip ? Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Either I 'm crazy or that pillow spoke . Sam . Sam Delafield Throwing shawl from his face Mother , take me home . Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip You at last . Starting to seize him . Sam darts out , L.3.E .

Kip This suspense is wearing out my tissue . Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Our engagement is so pleasant that I 'm going to make it last as long as possible . You must admit , colonel , there 's a great deal in that . Kip . Colonel Zachary T. Kip Not for me , Kitty . Once more I beg of you , name the day that will make me  --  Hand on his heart your lord and master  --  Correcting himself No , I do n't mean that ; I mean your devoted slave . Kate . Mrs. Kate Delafield Laughing , Knowingly Ah ! You see . To Kip Impossible . You are such a delightful lover that I hate to lose you by making you my husband . At door Colonel , discretion 's the better part of widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kip There 's nothing preen about Kate , if she has been in weeds . They call us men the stronger sex !

The sun is now low in the sky , the red rays falling across the room , the daylight fading from the room , and during the following the light from the hall lamp , R. , falls upon two figures Will . William Prescott Standing by the window , C. , looking up to the hallway I heard Agnes come downstairs and go into the library .
