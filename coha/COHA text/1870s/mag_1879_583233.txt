THE COMMERCIAL CRISIS OF 1837 . THE decade from 1830 to 1840 is the most important and interesting in the history of the United States . The political , social and industrial forces which were in action were grand , and their interaction produced such complicated results that it is difficult to obtain a just and comprehensive view of their relations and influences . In the first place , the United States advanced , between the second war with England and 1830 , to a position of full and high standing in the family of nations . The security and stability of the government were accepted as established . England and France , on the other hand , just before and after 1830 , were involved in social and political troubles of an alarming kind . By contrast , the United States , with a rapidly increasing population , expanding production and trade , a contented people and a surplus revenue , offered great attractions to both laborers and capital . At the same time the pride of the Americans in their country produced self-reliance , energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by steamboats and canals were opening up the country and offering to the population the advantages of a new and untouched continent . Production therefore offered high returns to both labor and capital . The advantages of a new country were credited to the political institutions of democracy , and increasing prosperity , due to the fresh resources brought within reach , was held to be proof of the truth of the political dogmas entertained by the workers . A sort of boyish exuberance , compounded of inexperience , ignorance and fearless enterprise , marked politics as well as industry . Jackson 's election in 1828 brought to power a party which had been produced by these circumstances . The English Corn Laws cut off the best market for the best product of* the northern half of the Union , but the supremacy of the // southern states as the cotton producers of the world was established . The former fact seemed to be the great justification for protective duties on manufactures , and indeed to make them necessary for the northern states . Such taxes , however , really subtracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil directly . The circumstances were such that this injury fell most upon the South , and the agitation which was produced threatened civil war until it was allayed by the compromise tariff of 1833 . That law fixed the rates of import duty until 1842 , and put it beyond the power of *Congress to deal with them unless by violating the compromise . The war debt of 1812 became payable in the years after 1824 , and was distributed over the years down to 1835 . With growth and increasing prosperity , the revenue increased with such rapidity that the debt could be paid almost as fast as it became payable . The chief purposes for which the Bank of the United States had been founded in x8i6 were to provide a sound and uniform paper currency , convertible with specie , of uniform value throughout the Union , and to act as fiscal agent for the government , holding the revenue wherever collected , and disbursing the expenditures wherever they were to be made . The interest of the government and the people was the motive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the services for specified considerations . One of these considerations was the right of the bank to use the deposits as loanable capital . The government was not bound to keep any balance over expenditure , but the revenue was so large that the bank came to hold annually increasing average deposits , from five to eight or nine millions of public money , which it used for profit . From this vicious arrangement two consequences followed : first , public attention was directed to the deposits , not as existing for the public service but for the profit of the bank ; and second , the public considered itself entitled to claim something of the bank besides true business credit in matter of discounts . Jackson opened the war on the bank publicly in his first message . Sharp correspondence had been going on already between the Secretary of the Treasury and the bank , which had reached such a point that the Secretary had referred to the removal of the deposits as a power in his hands to coerce the bank . Generally speaking , the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1830 ; but the bank had begun in 1827 to issue branch drafts , which stimu* lated credit and soon produced mischief Of the war on the bank , it is not necessary to speak in detail . The charter of the bank was to expire , by limitation , in 1836 . In December , 1831 , Clay was nominated for President by the National Republicans , and he and his friends determined to bring on the question of the re-charter of the bank as a campaign question . The re-charter was passedby Congress and vetoed by the President in 1832 . The issue in the campaign was thus made up between the personal popularity of Jackson and the bank . The former won an overwhelming victory , which Jackson construed to mean that the people had weighed the question of re-chartering the bank , and had decided against it . In September , 1833 , he removed the deposits from the national bank on his own responsibility , and placed them in selected state banks which would agree to keep onethird of their note circulation in coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under five dollars . This was to be an experiment . In the meantime , the administration was eagerly pressing on the extinction of the public debt . The consequences were such as to prove that , however popular such a policy may-be , it may easily be carried too far . The public deposits were loaned by the bank to merchants , then recalled and paid to the public creditors , and then re-invested by them , so that the money market was subjected to continual and sudden shocks . The withdrawal and transfer of the deposits was another and more violent operation of the same kind , so that there was a crisis and panic in the spring of 1834 . The eight or nine millions of public deposits were a continual source of mischief to the money market . By the contraction of the Bank of the United States to pay the deposits , and the contraction of the state banks to put themselves within the rule for receiving the same , the currency , in the summer of 1834 , was perhaps better than ever before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard over from silver to gold . The deposit banks were urged to discount freely , so as to satisfy the public with the change . Banks were organized in great numbers all over the country to take the place of the great bank , and to get a share in the profits of handling the public money . January T , 1835 , the debt was all paid , and the government had no further use for its sur* plus revenues . There was but one correct // and straightforward course to pursue in such a case , and that was to lower taxes , so as not to collect any surplus ; but this the Compromise Act forbade . The surplus revenue was the greatest annoyance to the protectionists , who wanted to keep duties high for " incidental protection , " and they proposed scheme after scheme for distributing the lands , or the proceeds of the lands , or , finally , the surplus revenue itself , so as to cut down the revenues without reducing the import duties . With the increase of banks and bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring of 1835 , and went on increasing for two years . The Erie Canal had opened up all the lands bordering on the great lakes , and they were being rapidly settled . They accordingly rose in value with great rapidity . The states of Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana were found to be the best cotton lands in the world , and they were receiving a great immigration from the older slave states . Cotton was rising in price , for the new machinery and new means of transportation in England , together with the extension of joint-stock banks there , had given a great stimulus to the cotton manufacture , and there was an increasing demand for the raw material . It followed that the cities in which the exchange and banking of all this industry were carried on also enjoyed great prosperity . Railroads were just being introduced . Ships were needed to transport the products . Thus , from natural causes , the period was one of immense industrial development . The great need for carrying it on was capital , and the political incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as accidental . The combination of the two in fact , however , produced a wild speculation . The banks furnished credit , not capital ; and , being restrained by usury laws from exerting , through the rate of discount , the proper check upon an inflated or speculative market , they embarked with the business community on a course where all landmarks were soon lost . No sooner , however , was this condition of the commercial and banking community well established than a new shock was given by another political interference . The administration had now advanced to the point of desiring to e.tabiish a specie currency for the country . The object was laudable and the means taken were proper , but , following as they did in the train of the events already mentioned , they produced new confusion . In 1836 , various acts were passed to bring about a specie currency , and in July of that year the Secretary of the Treasury ordered the receivers of public money to take only gold and silver for lands . The circumstances warranted this order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to twenty-four million dollars in a year , and the amount was paid in the notes of " banks " b which deserved no credit . If the nation was not to be swindled out of the lands , the measure was necessary . It then became necessary for the purchasers of land to carry specie to the West , and vast amounts of it accumulated in the offices of the receivers or were transferred , at great trouble and expense , to deposit banks . The specie was obtained from the eastern banks , and , inasmuch as the whole existing system had pushed them to the utmost limit of expansion , those demands for specie were embarrassing . Two points here deserve notice . It is strange to notice what a superstition about " specie " had taken possession of the public mind . It was regarded as a good thing to have , but too good to use . A specie dollar was regarded as an excuse for its owner to print and circulate from three to twenty paper ones , but it was not regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis from an inflated paper was , no doubt , a serious blow to the whole fabric , but if the paper had not been redundant , the transfer of specie to the West would only have forced an importation of so much more . This superstition about specie also prevented any demand upon the banks for specie for any purpose . Such a demand was regarded as a kind of social or business crime . Hence the " convertibility " of the notes was a polite fiction . The second point worth noticing is that the bank advocates continually talked about " the . credit system " when they meant the system of issuing credit bank-notes , and they grew eloquent about the advantages of credit , as if those advantages could only be won by using worthless bank-notes , and not by lending gold or silver or capital in any form . We are not yet , however , at the end of the political acts which threw the money * Some counterfeiters were arrested at New York in a garret where they had $20,000 lfl notes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were very indignant ,  --  said they were a " bank , " and were printing their notes at New York for economy . They came so nearly within the definition of a " bank " current at *this time that they escaped on this plea . // market into convulsions . The opposition succeeded , in the summer of the Presidential election year , 1836 , in passing an act to deposit with the states , the surplus over a balance of five millions in the Treasury , January i , 1837 . The amount was thirtyseven millions . This sum was scattered in eighty-nine deposit banks , all over the country . Its distribution was , therefore , controlled by local pressure and political favoritism , not by the needs of the government ( for it did not need the money at all ) or by the demand and supply of capital . The banks had regarded it as a permanent deposit , and had loaned it in aid of the various public and private enterprises which were being pushed on every hand at such a rate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the country was importing bread-stuffs . It was now to be withdrawn and transferred once more , and this time it was said that , if these " deposits " were such an advantage , the states ought to have it , and they could be called on to give back the money as well as the banks , whenever it might be needed . The deposit withthe statestook placein 1837 , in three installments , January , April and July , amounting to twenty-eight millions . The fourth installment was never paid . The money was all squandered , or worse . The charter of the Bank of the United States was to expire on the third of March , 1836 . One year before that time the directors ordered the " exchange committee " to loan the capital , so fast as it should be released , on stocks , so as to prepare for winding up . From this iesolution dates th' subsequent history of the bank , for the exchange committee consisted of the president and two directors selected by him , to whose hands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches were sold and the capital gradually released throughout 1835 , but , in February , 1836 , an act was suddenly passed by the Pennsylvavania legislature to charter the United States Bank of Pennsylvania , continuing the old bank . The act was said to have been obtained by bribery , but investigation failed to prove it . The most open bribery was on the face of it , for it provided for several pet local schemes of public improvement , for a bonus and loans to the state by the bank , and for abolishing taxes ,  --  provisions which secured the necessary support to carry it . During the year 1836 the money market was very stringent . The enterprises , specu-* lations and internal improvements demanded continual new supplies of capital . The amount of securities exported grew greater and greater , and kept the foreign exchanges depressed . American importing houses contracted larger and longer debts to foreign merchants . The money-market in England became very stringent likewise , and these long credits became harder and harder to carry . Three English houses , Willson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these American credits which they found it necessary to curtail . The winter was one of continual stringency , aggravated by popular discontent , riots and trades union disturbances , arising from high prices and high rents . The failures commenced on the fourth of March , 1837 ,  - -  the day that Van Buren was inaugurated ,  - -  in Mississippi and Louisiana . Hermann , Briggs &amp; Co. , of New Orleans , failed with liabilities said to be from four to eight millions . As soon as this was known in New York , their correspondents , J. L. &amp; S. Joseph &amp; Co. , failed . The first break in the expanded fabric of credit therefore came in connection with cotton . The price had advanced so much during the last three or four years as to draw many thousands of persons into cotton production who had no capital , but the profits were so great that a good crop or two would pay for all the capital . The planters of Mississippi especially had accordingly organized themselves into banking corporations and issued notes as the easiest way to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking capital of Mississippi increased from three to seventy-five millions , which of course represented one credit built upon another , or renewed and extended debt , as the old planters bought more slaves and took up more land instead of paying for the old , or as new settlers came in . Mississippi was therefore indebted to the North-east for the redemption of this immense bank debt , or for the capital bought with it . The high rates for money in England and this country at last checked the rise in cotton in 1836 . Bad harvests and high prices for food fell in with a glut of manufactured cotton , and when cotton began to fall ruin was certain . As soon as the revulsion came it ran through the whole speculative system . The new suburbs which had been laid out in every city and village never came to anything . Western lands lost all speculative value , and railroad and canal stock fell with rapidity . The first resort for help was to Mr. Biddle . // The calamity most apprehended was a shipment of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit or the substitution of a better for a less-known credit . The Bank of the United States had high credit in Europe , and indeed all over the world . Ultimately payment must be made by crops yet to be produced or forwarded . Biddle entered into an agreement with the New York banks which seems to have been only partially carried out , but he sold post-notes payable one year from date at Barings ' in London . He received i 1212 for these , specie being at* 107 . The bonds were discounted in England at five per cent . United States Bank stock was at i 20 . The situation in England was so serious that all seemed to depend on remittances from the United States . The Bank of England extended aid to the " three W 's " to the extent of five hundred thousand pounds , on a guarantee made up in the city , and opened a credit of two million pounds for the United States Bank , if one-half the amount should be shipped in specie . To this condition the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of the United States a strength which it did not possess . The management of the Bank of England in this and the two following years was bad , and did much to enhance the mischief in both countries . France participated in the distress , although there had been no speculation there . A delegation of New York merchants was sent to Washington , May 3 , to ask the President to recall the specie circular , to defer the collection of duty bonds , and to call an extra session of Congress . In their address to him they said of the situation : In six months , at New York , real estate had shrunk forty millions ; in two months two hundred and fifty firms had failed , and stocks had shrunk twenty millions ; merchandise had fallen thirty per cent. , and within a few weeks twenty thousand persons had been thrown out of employment . Early in May three banks in Buffalo failed . May 8 , the Dry Dock Bank ( N.Y. ) failed . On the ioth all the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were fears of a riot . On the **th the Philadelphia banks suspended because the New York banks had , and because , although they had plenty of specie for themselves , they had not enough for the whole " Atlantic seaboard . " They said , however , that they were debtors , on bal ance , to New York . As the news spread through the country , the banks , with few exceptions , suspended . It was one of the notions born of the bank war that the United States Bank was guilty of oppression when it called on state banks for their balances , and the state banks had practiced " leniency " toward each other . Bank statements of the period show enormous sums as due to and from other banks . This was what carried them all down together , for one could not stand alone unless its debits and credits were with the same banks . During the summer the governors of several states called extra sessions of the legislatures . The President had refused to recall the specie circular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embarrassments of the Treasury forced him to do the latter . The collection of duty bonds was deferred , and the revenue thereby cut off . The public money was in the suspended banks , and the Treasury , nominally possessed of forty millions , at the very time when part of this sum was being paid to the states , had to drag along from day to day by the use of drafts on its collectors for the small sums received , or by chance left over in their hands , since the suspension . As notes under five dollars had been forbidden by nearly all the states , and as specie was at ten per cent . premium , all small change disappeared , and the towns were flooded with notes and tickets for small sums issued by municipalities , corporations and individuals . The most interesting fact connected with this commercial crisis is that New York and Philadelphia took opposite policies in regar*I to it , and offered , in their different experience , an experimental test of those policies . The New York legislature passed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy then was to contract liabilities and prepare for resumption at the date fixed . The Philadelphia policy , in which Mr. Biddle was the leader , was to wait for things to get better without active exertions . In his letter to Adams of May is , Biddle said that his bank could have gone on without trouble , but that consideration for the rest forced him to go with them . What especially moved him was that , if the Pennsylvania banks had not suspended , Pennsylvanians would have had to do business with a better currency than the New Yorkers , which would have been unfair . Mr. Biddle knew perfectly well that the exchanges would arrange all that . He was an adept at writing plausible letters . The truth-which was // not known until four years later- was , that the capital of the bank had never been withdrawn from the stock loans ; that the chief officers of the bank were plundering it ; and that suspension was not more welcome to any institution in the country than to the great bank . The jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Mr. Biddle 's personal vanity seems to have been greatly flattered when he was called on by the New Yorkers to help them , in March . He was still the leading financier of the country . The business men could not spare him , if the government had thrown him off . There seems , also , to be some evidence that he hoped a great and universal revulsion would force the general government to re-charter his bank . The success of his post-notes in England and France was another source of gratified vanity to him . In his theory of banking he was one of those who believe that the redemption of the bank-note is effected by the merchandise . Hence banking was , for him , an art by which the banker regulated commerce through expansions and contractions of the circulation , according to the circumstances which he might observe in the market . The first effect of the opposite courses taken by New York and Philadelphia was very favorable to his views . The Southern trade was transferred from New York to Philadelphia . Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . Receiving these notes from the merchants , the bank employed them throi:igh Bevan &amp; Humphreys in buying cotton . This operation began in July , and was intended to move the cotton to Europe in order to meet the post-notes of the bank when they should become due . The firm of Biddle &amp; Humphreys was also formed and established at Liverpool , as the agent of this operation . In the extension of the transaction , cotton was bought and paid for by drafts on Bevan &amp; Humphreys of Philadelphia , which drafts were discounted by the bank . Biddle &amp; Humphreys , having sold the cotton , remitted the proceeds to Mr. Jaudon , former cashier of the bank , sent to England as its agent in July . To all this it must be added that the bank assumed the function of securing a good or fair price for cotton , for its producers . Jaudon 's instructions were to protect the interests of the bank , " and of the country at large . " If the bank had simply been a strong , sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent two or three millions to Europe , selling exchange at 112 , and would not have suspended . The rest of the story would then have been very different for all concerned . The arrival of a ship in England with *ioo , ooo specie in June sufficed to sustain American credit , and to revive American securities . When the credit of a debtor is tainted , nothing restores it like payment . The extra session of Congress met September 4 . The fourth installment of the State Deposit Fund was postponed until Januaryx , 1839 , but it was locked up in the suspended banks , and , as the former installments had been drawn from the better banks , the balance due was all in the worst banks of the country-those of the southwestern states . As they had loaned it to their customers , it was , in fact , amongst the people of those states . A law was passed to institute suit against these banks unless they paid on demand , or gave bonds to do so in three installments before July i , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie ; one was new , four had not suspended , and one had resumed . Power to call on the states for the funds " deposited " with them was taken f*rom the Secretary of the Treasury and held by Congress . Interest-bearing treasury notes were provided for one year to meet expenses , and an extension of nine months was given on duty bonds . At this session the sub-treasury system was brought forward as an administration measure . It split the party . The " Bank Democrats " ( state bank interest which joined the Jackson party in 1832 , to break down the United States Bank ) went into opposition . The advocates of the " credit system " said the sub-treasury scheme , by giving the government control of the specie in the country , would give it control of all credit . Meanwhile , Benton said that the eighty millions specie in the country was its bulwark against adversity , and the Locofocos said any one who exported specie was a British hireling ; so that there was a fine confusion of financial notions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , and the same tendency appeared here . Specie at New York was at about seven per cent . premium , but steadily declining . Prices of breadstuffs remained very high ( flour $9. oo-$9.5o at New York ) , and the stagnation of industry was complete . Migration to the West was large . On the x8th of August , the New York banks called a convention of banks to deliberate on resumption . The Philadelphia // banks frustrated the proposition by refusing . A convention met in October , but adjourned without action until April . On the 7th of April , the New York banks had assets two and one-half times their liabilities , excluding real estate , and were creditors of the Philadelphia banks for $1,200,000 . They had reduced their liabilities from $25,400,000 on January i , 1837 , to $12,900,000 on January i , 1838 , and the foreign exchanges were favorable . The bank convention met April ii , 1838 , and voted by states to resume January i , 1839 , without precluding*an earlier day . New York and Mississippi alone voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote ; the latter , because it was too early . New England joined Philadelphia and Baltimore for the later day . Mr. Biddle published another letter in which he blamed the rigor of the contraction at New York . He wanted to remain " prepared to resume but not resuming , " and looked to Congress to do the work . The exchange between New York and Philadelphia was then 454 per cent . against the latter . The south-western exchanges were growing worse . May i , the Philadelphia banks resolved to pay specie for demands of one dollar and under . The Bank of England engaged to send I , ooo , ooo in specie to support resumption , and did send */ ioo , ooo , but then receded from the undertaking . Her stock of specie was now very *large and increasing . The New York banks resumed during the first week in May , the Boston and New England banks generally at the same time . Specie was coming into New York . May 31 , Congress ' repealed the specie circular , whereupon Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted , he saw his way to resumption and would " co-operate . " The bank had , at this time , over thirteen millions loaned on " bills receivable , " that is , on securities put in the teller 's drawer as cash to replace cash taken out . After the adjournment of Congress on the ninth of July there was a much better feeling , especially on account of the defeat of the sub-treasurybill , and , on the tenth of July Governor Ritner of Pennsylvania published a proclamation requiring the bank to resume August 13 , and to pay and withdraw all notes under five dollars . On the 23d of July , a bank convention met at Philadelphia , composed of delegates from the middle states . It was agreed to resume August i The Philadelphia banks were obliged to contract very suddenly and money was very dear there . As soon as they resumed , there were demands on them from New York , exchange being against them . This caused excitement and indignation . The banks generally declared dividends as soon as they ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and the times rapidly improving . There was , however , a feverish and uncertain market for cotton . Biddle &amp; Humphreys were carrying an immense stock , and buyers and sellers differed as to prices . December io , 1838 , Biddle published another letter to Adams , in which he reviewed his policy of the last two years , and withdrew the bank from all its former public activity . He says : " It abdicates its involuntary power . " He defended the cotton speculations , saying that he had saved the great staple of our country from being sacrificed , by introducing a new competitor into the market . Here then was a buyer who had gone into the market on purpose to " bull " some one else 's property . His fate could not be very doubtful . At this very time the Liverpool market was very dull , and the spinners were curtailing their demands because the supply was under the control of speculators . It was true , as was asserted , that the crop was short , but the buyers took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break in the corner and a fall in price , they refused to buy . The speculation , no doubt , unduly depressed the price . The south-western agents of the Bank of the United States were offering advances from two to five cents above the market price to secure consignments to Biddle &amp; Humphreys , and Mr. Jaudon was paying ruinous rates for money to carry on his operations , because he had lost instead of winning confidence . During the winter , most of the southern and western banks resumed , at least nominally , but as spring approached ( 1839 ) , the ' southern exchanges again fell and many of the banks suspended again . March 29 , Biddle resigned the presidency of the bank , saying that he left it strong and prosperous . The stock fell from ii6 to 112 , but soon recovered . The money market became stringent again , influenced by fears of the South . In March , by speculative sales , and by the diminution of stock , and by the real shortness of the crop , cotton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Biddle &amp; Humphreys sold out their entire stock . The net profit was $6oo , ooo . This was regarded as a great triumph , and as a // complete vindication of Biddle 's policy . In July , 1839 , the Bank of the United States paid a semi-annual dividend of four per cent. ,  --  its last one . The success of the cotton speculation led to a plan for renewing it on a grander scale . June 6th , an unsigned circular was publish*d at New York , which proposed a scheme for advancing three-quarters of the value , at fourteen cents , on all cotton consigned to Biddle &amp; Humphreys . They were to " hold on until prices vigorously rally . " The agent , Mr. Wilder , declared that this had nothing to do with the United States Bank , so far as he knew . It was , however , a scheme of the bank . The south-western notes were falling lower and lower , and the post-notes issued in the south-west the year before were now falling due , and were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where money was up to fifteen per cent. , and the banks were curtailing . The news from England was also bad . Cotton was down two cents . The specie of the Bank of England was rapidly declining , and money was at five per cent . The arrangements from this side in 1837 had simply consisted in renewals or extensions , and as yet few payments had been made . Stocks , etc. , were sent over , but they fell upon a glutted and stringent market , and the prices declined . These securities , therefore , did not furnish means of payment , and specie shipments were found to be necessary . The Bank of the United States had prevented any shipment of specie by offering all the bills demanded at 109fr , and Mr. Jaudon had been obliged to adopt the most reckless means to meet these bills . In August he wrote to Biddle &amp; Humphreys to supply him with money at any sacrifice of cotton . " Life or death to the Bank of the United States is the issue . " The bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Jaudon 's demands , and the bank assumed the loss . In August the bank sent an agent to New York to draw all the bills he could sell on Hottingeur , at Paris ; to draw the proceeds in specie from the New York banks , and to ship it to meet the bills , the object being to force the New York banks to suspend in order that their example might again be quoted . The bank also sold its post-notes at a discount of eighteen per cent , per annum in Boston , New York , Baltimore and smaller places , and gathered up capital to meet the emergency at Philadelphia , caused by the failure of the southern remittances . The money markets in all these cities were very stringent until October . On the 9th of that month the Bank of the United States failed on drafts from New York , and on the i oth the news was received that the drafts on Hottingeur had been protested . He had given notice that he would not pay unless he was covered , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting Rothschild to take up the bills . The amount was seven million francs . The banks south and west of New York , and some of the Rhode Island banks , now suspended again . Specie at Philadelphia was at 107-107 ' 2 , United States Bank stock 70 . October is it was at 8o . Gold at New York one-fourth premium . Scarcely any New York City notes were in circulation . This suspension was the real catastrophe of the speculative period which preceded . A great and general liquidation now began . Perhaps as many as two hundred of these banks never resumed . The stagnation of industry lasted for three or four years . The public improvements , so rashly begun , were suspended or abandoned . The states were struggling with the debts contracted . Some repudiated ; some suspended the payment of interest . The New England states and New York escaped all the harsher features of this depression , and emerged from it first . In proportion as we go farther south and west , we find the distress more intense and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of time , but came gradually and imperceptibly . The credit of the Bank of the United States bore up wonderfully under the shock of its second suspension . Its friends were ready to attribute its misfortunes to conspiracies , jealousy , or any other cause but its own faults . They did not , indeed , know its internal history . It might have recovered , if it had not been ruined from within . The cotton speculations showed a loss , in the summer of 1840 , of $630,000 for the speculators , after saddling the bank with all possible charges . The legislature of Pennsylvania ordered the banks to resume January 15 , 1841 . On the first of January , 1841 , a statement of the assets of the bank was made , when it appeared that they consisted of a mass of doubtful and worthless securities . The losses to date were over five mulions , according to the report of the directors , but over seventeen millions , taking the stocks at their market value . The bank resumed January is , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state // $400,000 , agreeing to loan as much more . In twenty days the Philadelphia banks lost eleven millions in specie , of which six millions were taken from the Bank of the United States . On the 4th of February the bank failed , for the third and last time . Its final failure was said to be due to stock-jobbers . Suits were at once begun in such numbers that all hope of ever resuscitating it had to be abandoned . Its deposits , when it failed , were $i , ioo , ooo , and its notes in circulation , $2,800,000. rwenty-seven millions out of the thirty-five of its capital were held in Europe . The stock , in March , 1841 , was at 17 . A committee of the stockholders reported in April , showing the internal history of the bank for five years . This brought out six letters from Mr. Biddle , of explanation , defense , and recrimination , which are chiefly valuable for the further insight they give into the history . As to the winding-up of the bank , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the following results : Three trusts were constituted , - one for the city banks , to which the bank owed five or six millions ; one for the noteholders and depositors ; and one for the other creditors . The city banks , the noteholders , and the depositors , were ultimately paid in full . The other claims were bought up by one or two persons , who took the assets . What they made of them is not matter of history . The attempt of the Pennsylvania banks to resume in January , 1841 , had been the signal for similar attempts in the other states . The banks on the seaboard as far south as South Carolina generally resumed , and in the western and gulf states some took the same step . All were indebted to the Northeast , and were asked to pay as soon as they said they were ready to pay . Like the Philadelphia banks , they succumbed to this demand . The Virginia banks held out until April , when the suspension was once more universal sobth of New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island , Connecticut , New Jersey , North Carolina and Delaware , had debts amounting in all to nearly two hundred millions . The southern states had generally contracted these debts to found banks . The middle and western states had contracted debts for public works . In the former case the profits of the banks were expected to coverthe interest on the debt . In the latter case the works were expected to be remunerative in a short time , and the interest was provided for in the meantime by bank dividends ( on stocks owned by the state , which only constituted another debt ) , by taxes on banks and by royalties . Both schemes were plausible , and might have been successful if managed with good judgment and moderation . Under the actual circumstances they were subject to political control , the methods of which were reckless and ignorant . The consequence was that when credit collapsed and the English market no longer absorbed the state stocks with avidity , the states found themselves heavily indebted , bound to pay large interest charges , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loaned their borrowed capital to legislators and politicians and had no assets but " suspended debt . " The improvement states had become heavily indebted to their own banks , and depended on bank dividends to pay interest . The state banks all held state stocks as assets , and when these declined in value the banks became insolvent . Thus the banking system was interlocked with the state finances and with the mania for improvements unwisely planned and attempted without reference to the capital at command . The aversion to taxation was very strong , and as taxation was delayed , one state after another defaulted on its interest . The delinquent states were Pennsylvania ( which laid taxes in 1840 , but inadequate to meet the deficiency ) , Michigan ( of which the Bank of the United States held two millions in bonds not paid for when it failed ) , Mississippi ( of which the same bank held five millions in bonds , the obligation of which was disputed and never met ) , Indiana ( whose debt was one-fifth of the total valuation ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory : total amount , one hundred and eleven millions . In five years the Bank of the United States gave to Pennsylvania three millions , subscribed nearly half a million to public improvements by corporations , and loaned the state eight and a half millions . In 1857 and 1858 Pennsylvania sold out her works , which had cost thirty-five millions , for eleven millions . The bonds deposited in New York to secure circulation had a par value of $4,600,000 , but were worth only $i , 6oo , ooo on the 1st January , 1843 . As early as March , 1841 , this decline caused a panic in " Safety Fund " and " Free Bank " notes at New York . Pennsylvania now entered on another experiment , which threatened to ruin her remaining banks , as the reckless demands // qwq
