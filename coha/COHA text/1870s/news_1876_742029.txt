txt About this time the people on the seashore who go to bed to keep warm , and the stay-at-homes who have been deploring their lot , have come to the conclusion that New York is a pleasant summering-place . Two weeks ago , when the mercury was between ninety and one hundred every day , the man who was obliged to stay in Now-York during the Summer season was ready , like Jon , to curse his day and . die . To him there seemed nothing more utterly abominable and hateful than the City . The streets were like ovens ; heat was reflected from the stony walls on either side , and from the glaring pavement beneath , and was poured down from the brassy sky overhead . To cross one of the City parks , with its polished asphalt , was to cross a Saharan desert glazed with quicksilver . To sit iu a draft was to air one 's self in the blast which comes from a burning limekiln . All out-of-doors lay glittering in the flood-tide of torrid rays . The shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism bordering on madness , if there was any coolness left on the globe , and if the regions described by Arctic travelers were not the visions of a , disordered fancy . At such a time , if City people did not long with a homesick longing for the sea waves and the mountain breezes , they read the reports of hot weather at Fire Island and Mount Washington with a certain savage joy . Since they must stay in the City , it was a comfort to know that people could not sleep under blankets in the Catskills , and that the Labrador current no longer refrigerated York Harbor and Mount Desert . It was purgatory in New York . But those who , being in torment , lifted up their eyes to see their lucky comrades seeking consolation in the country , were well pleased to find that the Summer travelers were groaning and complaining where they were . It was at such a time that people laughed bitterly at the often-repeated saying that New-York was a good place to summer in , and said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , with delusive local pride , said that the Cubans were coming here with their old and sensible belief in the Summer delights of the Metropolis , the imprisoned citizen pitied the Cubans . Ho was read : to ask , " Are you also come to this place of torment 7 " And when strangers from various parts of the Republic , with the thick , ill-fitting garb that bespoke Oshkosh anil Chicago , s weltered in the omnibuses and hotels , the native sufferer looked on and wondered why these innocents were abroad . At such a time the New-Yorker 's only consolation was in thinking how hot it must be in Philadelphia . He scanned the thermometrical readings with a fiendish glee , added ten degrees to the maximum , and pictured to himself the sufferings of the confiding souls who had gone to the Centennial show . There was , at least , one place hotter than New-York . It was a satisfaction to know that sea and shore failed to yield their usual coolness ; but in the contemplation of the torrid zone of Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous man who knows that he holds both bowers and the ace . But all this is suddenly changed . The mercury has dropped to 70 ? and 750 , New York becomes a delightful watering-place , and the visitors at sea-side taverns shiver at the thought of a dip into the briny deep . Once more the optimists , who take no vacations are convinced that Summer traveling is a bore and that the pleasantest spot is here . The delights of the City market , - where all the fruits of orchard , field , and pond are freshest and in their prime , are restored to the fancy . It is better to bathe in one 's own comfortable tub than to brave the perils of the potato-bugladen surf ; and the certainties of one 's own bed and board , even though these be in a " French flat , " are preferable to the unknown horwmgof country boarding-houses and stuffy Summer hotels . So the " cool , crisp New-Yorker , " as HowELLs enviously calls him . steps out of his airy house of a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , with the serene consciousness of being iu the finest city in the world . At night he sleeps in his ample chamber , fanned by delicious breezes from the North and East Rivers , composes a charming breakfast bill of fare as he wakes to the twitter of the morning sparrows , and drops off again into a nap to dream of the unhappy wights who are kept awake by country cocks and cats , and who wake to the woes of a cold and rainy day by the sad sea waves . On the whole , the citizen is glad he stayed at home . To be sure , it is dreary looking at the same bricks and mortar year in and year out . It would be a good thing to change one 's atmosphere and surroundings , even if mosquitoes and other minor miseries came with the change . It is undeniable that the Summer journeyer is glad to go and glad to get back . It is the going , and the fatigue and worry and hot haste of the journey , which make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And nobody can tell how much more zest there is in life because of these frequent changes . He who goes away gets his change in place and scene . Perhaps he burns his nose , gets sand in his shoes , and loses his temper thrice a day . No matter , he has been shaken out of his routine , and he goes back to his city work with a feeling of elasticity which he did not have before . If his brother in town needed change , ho finds it in the thermometer .
