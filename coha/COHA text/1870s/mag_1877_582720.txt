ONE warm morning last July , H. came into my room with a map of Maine in his hand . " I have a great longing to go over some of my bachelor haunts , " he said ; " and I want you to go with me . " And with that he sketched a most attraCtive plan of camping out , with suggestions of canoes , rapids , Indians , etc. , all of which sounded very wild and delightful . " But what about the children ? " I asked , suddenly remembering those small anchors of mine . " Oh , take them along if you xvant to , " he answered , with a man 's happy obliviousness of the importance of the hundred and one little nursery arrangements that I had always hitherto thought essential to their comfort and well-being . " But if they should be ill ? " " I can doctor them well enough ; besides , they wont be ill , it will do them good . " Well , the result of it was that a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party of six including ourselves , two children , a man and a maid and a couple of dogs . Our camp equipage was very simple , as we had to take into consideration the " carries " between the lakes , where our entire kit would have to be shouldered by the guides and the men of our party ; it consIsted chiefly of a close tent for the women and children , and a shelter tent for the men , two blankets and a mackintosh sheet for each of the party , a canvas bed for the children which came apart and could be rolled up in a small package , a few compressible India rubber comforts , such as alrpillows , bath-tubs , etc. ; and besides these , each person had his or her " pack , " which contained the necessary toilet appurtenances , and such extra garments as were indispensable . We have since agreed that on another occasion we should have very light mackintosh bags , made to hold the blankets , as it is of the greatest importance that they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from our want of fore " NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP " // thought in that respect on more occasions than one . At the same time , as the blankets are indispensable in their use as seats and THE backs when in the canoes , these bags should be large enough to admit of their being comfortably spread . On an expedition of any extent one can hardly fail to meet with showers if not with steady rains , and a half hour 's xvetting may often necessitate a three hours ' drying . For myself too , I should carry a portable canvas bed , for I did not find the primitive fir boughs all my fancy painted them , although H. declared them to be stiperior to Marcotte 's best mattresses . Experience also taught us somewhat in regard to our kitchen paraphernalia ; instead of the heavy iron pot which we carried , it would be better to substitute a set of tin pails , one fitting inside of the other , and substantially made with copper bottoms ; their combined weight would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time would not be confined to a single pot ; add to these a frying-pan , a coffee-pot , and one of those compact arrangements of plates , cups , forks , knives and spoons , and the outfit is complete , so far as necessity is concerned . If the journey is an easy one , luxuries can be proportionately added , as in that case light weight would not be such an object . The staples on such an expedition are pork , flour and potatoes , tea and coffee ; any amount of tinned delicacies may be added , but it should be borne in mind that every additional pound is so much more burden . The men , of course , carried their guns and ammunition , and H. , who undertook the direction of everything , declared that my maid and myself must wear bloomers . I demurred greatly to this , but a little reasoning soon convinced me that the ordinary *valking-dress , however simply made , would be an impossi PORTAGE . bility in a primeval forest , and while trav eling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I had dark-blue flannel costumes made , somewhat stronger-minded looking than I liked , while , the children were equipped in flannel xvaists and loose knickerbockers gathered into an elastic band , so that they could be drawn down to the ankle or pushed above the knee , as the weather should be cold or warm . I give all the details , in case this should meet the eye of any of my sex meditating a similar expedition ; in which contingency , another 's experience might be useful . The men wore ordinary shooting-clothes ; and // here H. bids me say again , for the benefit of those who are thinking of roughing it , that the ordinary English knickerbockers , with stout shoes and leather gaiters that reach to the knee , and can be taken off before wading , and an extra pair of stockings , are much more comfortable on such a trip than the " high-top boots " so commonly worn in this country , which soon get water-logged and uncomfortable . Of course we carried our war-paint in our boxes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , where we left our extra luggage . After leaving Boston , our first stopping place was Bangor , where we expected to engage our guides ,  --  for which purpose , H. and one of the others went over to the Indian reservation , which is an island in the east branch of the Penobscot , opposite Oldtown , a little village near Bangor . There they found that many of the best guides were " away on the drive , " for nearly all the Indians and , it seemed to me , a large proportion of the population of Bangor are lumbermen . I remember as a child watching the Northern Maine regiments marching into Washington ,  --  tall , slender , but withal rugged-looking men they were ; and some one said , " They are lumbermen from the pine fbrests of Maine . " The sentence somehow stirred my childish imagination . I heard afterward of the dangerous life they lead ; how through all the dark winter months they live away from their families , snowbound in the heart of the great forests , felling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of neighboring streams , where they lie until winter lets go his icy grip upon the waters , and rivers swell with the rushing torrents , making nature 's high-roads , on which the forest treasures are to be borne to civilization and its uses : " When with sounds of smothered thunder , On some night of rain , Lake and river burst asunder Winter 's weakened chain , Down the wild March flood shall hear them , To the saw-mill 's wheel , Or where steam , the slave , shall tear them With his teeth of steel . " Then comes the season of danger and excitement in the life of these backwoodsmen . The ax is laid aside , and springing upon the logs as they are launched into the rush of waters with iron-bound pole , they guide the huge mass as it is swiftly hurried along . All goes well while the stream is broad , and bears its huge burden unmo4lested on its rapid course ; but soon it narrows , and just beyond the rocks and rapids that intervene , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logs now coming with increasing speed , grind and crash among the rocks , and pile upon one another in the race for the wild leap beyond . Often , at such times , they become so jammed and OUR ROUTE . // interlocked as to effect a perfect barrier to any further progress until the " driver , " as he is called , leaping from log to log , singles out those that seem by their position to be as it were the key-stone of the arch . These being once extricated and started on their course , the now loosened pile is launched forward with a force that is irresistible , and unless the bold driver has made good his escape with the dexterity and nerve that only practice can give , he has small chance for life . But this is a long digression . I left two of our party looking for guides at Oldtown . After some trouble , they finally engaged three Indians , who were well recommended , - Soccalexis , Pete , and Noel ,  --  and later in the day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides being a guide of good repute , was said to be a capital cook . The next thing to be thought of were the canoes . H. had brought with him his " Saranac boat , " a long , light , cedar craft , not unlike a canoe in shape , and well adapted to those waters ; besides this , four canoes , or birches , as the Indians call them , were engaged , and the next morning saw us en route with these - no slight addition to our party and luggage . Before noon we reached the terminus of the railroad , and there we climbed on top of a rickety old coach , putting the guides , servants , and children inside . Our canoes were piled one on top of another on an open wagon , while one of the guides hung on the outside in a precarious-looking position , to prevent their bruising one another . The dogs - Jack and Nora , a pair of red Irish setters - were wild with joy at being released from their long confinement and tore off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great state of excitement The scenery was pretty , and we enjoyed the drive over to Greenville , where we took the little steame* that makes its way once a day to Mount Kineo , an oddly shaped peninsula which extends into Moosehead Lake , and which has become somewhat of a resort . Here our final preparations were made , and early next morning we , with our camp equipage , guides , canoes , etc. , were 1ackecl into a little steam- barge , and were literally tossed to the northern shore of the lake , which on occasion can be almost as rough as the English Channel . Here of late years parties of ladies and gentlemen have not unfrequently camped out , playing at roughing it , with civilization and its comforts within easy reach . A solitary farm-house in a little cleared patch of ground redeems the wilderness from an absolute loneliness . Here we had dinner , and afterward Master Jack , a stout youngster of two and a half years , distinguished himself by pitching headlong into the duck-pond , in his eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their mamma . After he had been quite dried and comforted , we started on our first carry , a very tame affair of two miles , for there is a xvagon road leading to Penobscot River , and I dare say we might have driven over in the cart that carried our canoes , had we chosen . At the end of the road there was another farm-house , where they gave us most delicious milk , and a little further on , by the banks of the river , the guides had pitched our tent ; and were already preparing supper . It was now nearing sunset , and the mosquitoes were thick and vicious , and now , for the first time , we were introduced to the notorious black fly which THE DRIVE TO GREENVILLE. // in certain seasons is the scourge of these silently by and disappeared in the darkness . forests . We had hoped to escape them , There was some consultation between her it being then the beginning of August , party and our guides and we soon learned and in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort much ; but the mosquitoes and a wretched minute creature which the Indians call " no-see-urn , " at times annoyed us greatly . The tar-oil mixture with which we were recommended to paint our faces proved perfectly efficacious in preventing their attacks , although I think man ) T will agree with me in thinking the remedy worse than the disease . There is , however , a wash called the Sportsmen 's Comfort , procurable at any gun-shop , which is not particularly disagreeable , and does in a measure keep the little pests away . After supper the children were rolled up in their Canada cloaks , looking like little elves with the firelight dancing on their faces and peaked caps , and after saying their little prayers they went to sleep as quietly as if they had been in their own nursery at home . As we gathered around the blazing log fire , and the darkness came quickly on , and with it the realization that we were to spend the night out-of-doors , my sensations were decidedly novel . The starlit sky above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustling of the trees and grasses , sounded strange and weird . just as we were thinking of turning in for the night , our attention was attracted by something quietly gliding up the river , and stopping just below us at the foot of the bank . It proved to be a canoe , and a woman in deep mourning got out , passed that it was the funeral convoy of a lumberman who , during the early spring , had been killed in a jam of logs . His body had been hurled into a spot so dangerous that his coinrades dared not rescue it , and it was not until their return home from the drive , that his mother , a widow , heard of her loss , and how her son 's body lay still unburied on a rock in the midst of a rushing torrent in the wilderness . She was utterly destitute and penniless , but she formed the determination of recovering the remains of her son , and nothing could deter her from her purpose . Inspired by her resolution , two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance the brave and broken-hearted mother passed through the journey of hardships and danger without a murmur , and was now returning successful from her sad quest , to lay the bones of her son at peace in consecrated earth . They encamped for the night a few rods below us on the stream . The light of their fire seemed to gleam sadly through the darkness , and the ripple of the water and the faint rustling of the trees sounded stranger and more weird than ever . We made up a purse for the poor mother , which she made us the happier by accepting ; and they were gone the next morning long before we began to bestir ourselves . I think that we all felt decidedly stiff and uncomfortable when we awoke . The night had been very cold ,  --  so cold , in fact , that the water in the tea-kettle had a slight coating of ice . The children , however , were as bright and jolly as possible , and had taken no cold wl*atever ,  --  to my great relief , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have hastened back to where doctors were get-at-able . Every one had an excellent appetite for breakfast , directly after which , we embarked in our canoes and paddled down the Penobscot . There is FROM KINEO TO THR CARRY . JACK AND JILL . // qwq bark into all sorts of shapes , and floated them down the stream , or chopped up leaves and flowers to make " puddings , ' and my color-box was an unfailing re source . Two dolls had been selected from their extensive family before leaving home , - one , called " Providence , " from the brilliant reason that she came into existence in the capital of Rhode Island , and who had already been in the family for over three years ,  --  and the other rather a disreputable looking young lady , but a great favorite , named Allaleena . These dolls went through many hair-breadth escapes and frightful hardships , dangers by flood and field , but they came out of everything tri umphantly , and reached Canada , where , to the inexpressible sorrow of her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , however , reposes now in hon ored state on a shelf in the nursery , and rests on her laurels . H. took her photo graph , and she is held in great esteem by the family . I never in my life saw so many mosqui toes as there were in the place where we stopped for dinner ; it was simply impossible " PROVIDENCE . " to stay there , the air literally swarmed with A WHITE SQUAW. // them , and the shrill noise they made pained one s ears . So , hastily dividing some bread and meat , we pushed off into the stream again ; they never troubled us while in the boats , and indeed , except on occasions , we were not much annoyed by them . Before reaching our second campingground , we passed through some shallow rapids , where all the men had to take to the water and lift the canoes over the rocks and sand-bars which obstructed their progress . We women-kind , with the children , kept our places in virtue of our being " xvhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Indians we should have had to wade knee deep with the rest . Camp No. 2 we dubbed Camp O'C. in honor of one of our party ; it was a pretty spot , on a knoll overhanging the river . A deep forest lay back of us , where one of our people insisted that he saw a bear ; and perhaps he did , for the guides said that there were a great many thereabouts . One thing surprised and disappointed me in traveling through this uninhabited country , and that was the scarcity of birds ; there was something savage in the loneliness and silence of the woods . The few bird-notes that broke the stillness were moumful and monotonous . Even the wild ducks were scarce , and the partridge , which H. had promised us in plenty to vary our pork diet , persistently avoided us . Our second night under the stars was more comfortable , as we had become somewhat better accustomed to the primitive method of disposing of ourselves for the night , and the children adapted themselves to their new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to make up our minds whether to push through to Canada , in which event we would have to travel as rapidly as possible , as time and provisions both were limited , or to take it leisurely and only go part of the way . It had been our first intention to go a few days ' journey into the forest and there pitch our tent for a week or so of fishing and shooting , and the guides gave most discouraging accounts of the carries that would have to be trudged over in the event of our making the through trip , and of the dangerous rapids we w-ould have to encounter , and said that no woman had ever attempted it ; but , of course , the latter fact only added to our zeal , and we finally resolved to undertake it . I wonder now how I dared to venture with the children over those fearful rapids , but I did not then feel in the least afraid . So , instead of passing Sunday quietly in camp as I should have liked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still paddling down the Penobscot , and I do not know , on the whole , that we could have passed the day more profitably on shore . I fear the men would have been tempted to go off with their guns or fishing-rods , while to the Indians the quiet paddling was no effort , and God 's world in its undisturbed loveliness was very beautiful . Later in the day we reached the first rapids , " Rocky Rips , " as they are called . Here the guides threw aside their paddles and standing upright ROCKY RIPS. // 495 in their canoes , with their long iron-bound l ) OleS steered the fragile little barks clear of the rocks and guided their leaps down the swift descent . XVe all got rather wet , and at first I held my breath with fright , but the Indians seemed so sure of themselves , and took it all so much as a matter of course , that my uneasiness calmed itself , and I was really able to enjoy the excitement of the thing . The little canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent and really appeared to spring forward of their own volition . The guides , stoically directing their course , seemed to be controlling some strange , wild fish as it plunged and sped along . Now , in this winter weather , with the snow beating against the windows , and the slush and misery in the streets , I can shut my eyes and see the rushing river dashing through the evergreen forests ; smell the sweet and breezy fragrance of the pines , and hear the steady roar of the rapids . The guides told us that there was a rough sort of woodman 's trail leading through the woods to Chesuncook Lake , which we could take if we liked . Glad of the chance of stretching our legs , we climbed up a precipitous rocky ledge which served as a sort of gate-way , to the entrance of this primitive path ; in which we walked Indian file through the forest . The air was laden with the delicious pine fragrance , than which I know of nothing more exhilarating ; as some author says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trail was bordered with the loveliest ferns and mosses , bright scarlet berries and fantastic gray lichens ; here and there we came across a cluster of purple berries which I had never seen before , and which the Indians told us were poisonous . The red checker-berries they said were good to eat ; I tasted them , but found them insipid . I noticed , too , a great variety of grasses , some of them very beautiful . From time to time , we could catch glimpses of the river , which had now become very shallow and rocky , and constantly interrupted by rapids , whose roar we heard continually . After a good two miles ' walk , we came in sight of the lake , and far in the distance towered Katahclin with its surrounding mountains . Here we found a considerable clearing , with quite a comfortable-looking farm-house . This is a great rendezvous for lumbermen , and they said they could accommodate us for the night . We rather fancied that a roof , however humble , would be a luxury after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DEAD FOREST . // of this approach to civilization ; but we had not taken into consideration all the discomforts attendant on a woodman 's lodging , and we decidedly regretted our choice . On awakening the following morning , we found that some of our party had started long before dawn , anticipating a chance of moose , or caribou ; a forlorn hope , however , for we came across no large game during our trip , although sometimes we saw their tracks ,  --  indeed , our sportsmen had practically given up all expectation of game when we decided to go through to the St. John 's , as we were obliged to travel so rapidly that hunting was impossible ; besides , every year , now , the moose are becoming scarcer , and I dare say before long the huge , uncouth animal will become extinct . The rest of us swalloxved a hasty breakfast , and started off anew on our travels . The day was dull and gray , threatening rain . We left the lake by a little stream , turning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low meadows on either side , and covered with flags and water-lilies , white and yellow . Here we paddled against the current ; the flow , however , was sluggish , and it did not seem hard work . After several miles , the river narrowed suddenly , and became very swift . The men got out and waded through the shallow water , while the guides poled the canoes up-stream . I never saw anything prettier than this wild woodland brooklet , now very rapid , and broken into mimic falls and whirlpools ; hundreds of water-lilies and blue-flags grew around us , over which poised themselves , or darted hither and thither , myriads of dragon-. flies , looking like tiny shafts of burnished steel . The sun gleamed out now and then , and lit up the forest of larches and birchtrees , which stretched their trunks fantastically across the brook . Here we met our unsuccessful hunters , who flun* a few ducks in a disgusted fashion into the boats , and helped to lift the canoes over the shallows . It was hot work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , and watch the men struggle against the current . It was with a sense of relief that we came suddenly into Umbezooksis Lake , with its flat , sandy shore sparsely covered with reeds . The water was very shallow for half a mile , and the guides were obliged to push the canoes to such a distance from shore before they could get in , that they looked as if they were standing in the middle of the lake . The sun had now 4isappeared for good , and a soft drizzle commenced , which , before long , changed into a steady pelting . Jack and Jill were kept perfectly dry by their little mackintosh coats , which covered them from head to foot , and they seemed rather to enjoy having their faces washed in this novel fashion . It was most unpromising weather for " Mud Carry , " which , they say , is the wettest portage in the state . On landing , we made a hasty dinner of what provisions we had on hand , then scrambling up the muddy bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heads , which made them look like some strange specimens of scarab*i . They appeared to carry them without difficulty and certainly they were well sheltered from the rain . The children were slung in blankets like papooses . H. shouldered one of them and Mr. O'C. most good-naturedly took the other ; they looked very happy with UNDER THE BIG BIRCH . // their bright little faces peering out above the blankets from their sharp-pointed India rubber hoods . The trail through the shaggy-bearded forest was barely wide enough for one person to pass and seemed to be the rocky bed of a stream ; indeed it was not wide enough for us to escape without being scratched by the branches on either side . We were obliged to leap from rock to rock and from side to side to avoid the abysses of mud and water , which looked horrible enough . More than once I fell from the mossy , slippery logs and plunged kneedeep into one of those nasty holes . Every now and then a long , wet branch would come slapping into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we could hardly s&amp;e . After struggling over this worst of all the carries , until we were dead tired , we found ourselves in a little clearing which our guides informed us was just half way across . As we were evidently in for a stormy night , and the darkness was fast closing around us , it was voted to pitch the tent at once as the probabilities of going farther were strongly in favor of faring worse ; and it was well we did , for no sooner had we gathered under the friendly shelter of our tent , than the rain came down in torrents , and continued all through the night . It was certainly an inhospitable night for a sojourn on " Mud Carry . " How it did pour ! but we had managed to keep the children tolerably dry , and that to me was a great comfort . I think the only complaint we heard was a soliloquy from Jack in his hammock : " Me not comf'bl ' ; me wants to go to a hotel . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with the safe assurance that a good pull that day would result in much pleasanter camping-grounds for the following night . The heavy rain had of course increased the natural depravity of the path , and it was only after a series of most disagreeable flounderings , sinking at times to the knee in mire , that we finally reached " Mud Pond " and our canoes . This is a small sheet of water fully meriting its name , very shallow in water , but very deep in mud . How deep I do not know , but there seems to be almost a suction downward , as a hunting-knife dropped on the shore was only recovered by the guide immediately sinking in his arm above the elbow . Crossing this pond we entered a little stream that flows into Apmojenegamook VOL . XIV. - 32. or , as it is now called , Chamberlain Lake . At the mouth of this stream , before entering the lake , we encountered a mass of bare , dead trees , a curious result of the overflow caused by the dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to push our way through into the open water beyond . There was a look of weird desolation about them impossible to describe ; their branches bleached or naked , looked like spectral arms interlocked in a fantastic net-work of bone . I could not help thinking of Hans Andersen 's fairy tale of the little mermaid where those horrid " polypi " stretch out their ghastly living branches , and try to lay hold of the dear frightened little thing . Pushing and pulling our boats sometimes under and sometimes over the skeleton branches , we finally emerged from the grim floating thicket , and found ou*rselves launched in the open lake ; four miles across on the opposite shore could be distinguished a clearing called Chamberlain Farm , and thither we bent our course . This was the last human habitation we could hope to see until we should reach the Mattawankeag settlement , on the upper St. John , and we profited by that knowledge in the purchase of what bacon , sugar , etc. , they could spare us . I imagine that the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lumbermen in winter than in the harvesting of crops in summer . However , they gave us a very good dinner , after which we stowed our forage in our boats and pushed away , anxious to make some further progress while daylight lasted . We paddled a good four miles to the outlet of the lake , carefully avoiding the many snags of sunken timber which would be pretty sure to upset a colliding canoe . Here we determined to remain for the night , and pitched our tent on the shore , near the locks that stood at the head of the Alleguash River . At this place , four yearsbefore , H. had great luck with brook-trout , and the men were all very anxious to cast their flies , but the fish must have learned wisdom in the meantime , and gone to more sequestered pools , for the meager dish we had for supper was far short of our expectations . Being now well accustomed to making our toilet at dawn of day , we lost no time the following morning in packing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried a few hundred yards to the other side of the dam , and while this was being done and we we ; e prepanng to re-embark , it began to // pour in a way that rendered the chance of keeping anything dry almost hopeless . Everything in the shape of water-proof was seized upon , but as a soaking was evidently our fate , we resigned ourselves to a sitz-bath in the canoes , and continued on our way undaunted . We were now upon the Alleguash River , which flows northward through a chain of wild , lonely lakes until it empties a hundred miles beyond , into the water of the upper St. John 's . The first of these lakes , called Pongokwahem , or Heron Lake , was reached after a pull of some two hours , and our presence was proclaimed ty the barking of the foxes on shore , and the wild laugh of a loon beyond . The rain still continued to fall , but by the time we had accomplished half the distance of the lake , there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock offered inducements as a landing-place , being the only clear space we could discern along the otherwise densely wooded shore . As soon as we landed all were astir with preparations for the night ; great blazing fires were kindled on the rising ground above us and the wet clothes and ' blankets hung all around on poles to dry . Those of us not otherwise engaged bent every energy upon the kettle and the coffee-pot , with the happy satisfaction of soon spreading upon our rocky table what seemed to us a most delicious meal . We watched the loons sailing about a little distance from us , filled with curiosity at the unusual spectacle we afforded them . One of the Indians called them with a cry so like their own that , except for the direction from which we heard it , it would have been impossible to distinguish one from the other ; but they were discouraged from coming very close as some of the men had inhospitably conceived the idea of making them a target for rifle practice , and Mr. O'C. distinguished himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 yards , ..  --  a shot that any of the *reedmoor men might have been proud of . A great heap of soft fir boughs had been gathered in the tent , and on it we enjoyed a good night 's rest . We were wakened in the morning by a bright sunrise , and the promise of a lovely day ,  --  a pleasing contrast to our late experience . Breakfast over , we dropped into the boats as naturally as soldiers would fall in for drill . The air was delightfully bracing , and our little fleet danced joyously out on the clear , sparkling waters . Side by side we kept together until nearing the lake 's further end , where we divided forces in hunting for the outlet . The outlets of these lakes are sometimes very deceptive , there being several inlets along the shore equally imposing at their entrance , but which a few miles further on all end in grass and mud . Our canoe was unlucky enough to enter one of these , and after paddling several miles in the flattering belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found ourselves stuck fast in a great swamp of lily-pads , where hundreds of bull-frogs croaked their disapproval of our intrusion . This was unfortunate , as it gave us five or six miles of paddling to no purpose . However we retraced our course , and re-entering the lake we heard the shouts of the more fortunate explorers directing us to the eastward . The wind had arisen in the meanwhile and the lake was very rough ; for the first time I now felt the sensation of fear , and as our frail bark was tossed on successive waves , many of which wetted us to the skin , I realized what a mere speck we were on the great sheet of water which looked so dark and cold and deep ; I trembled with apprehension and held my little girl closer to me , while with an indescribable dread I watched the canoe which held my other darling far in the distance . However , we reached the inlet in safety and landed for dinner , and afterward a long steady pull brought us to the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall pines reminded us that we must soon be selecting our campingground ; but while the twilight lasted we floated on , making up as far as possible for the time that had been lost . Passing through some little rapids on the stream connecting Churchhill with Umsaskis Lake ,  --  and where , by the way , H. came to grief , in his ambition to paddle his own canoe , breaking his paddle and measuring his length in the bottom of the boat ,  --  we came to a halt . The guides recognized the vicinity of much more serious rapids which in the darkness would have been dangerous . The shores rose abruptly on either side , and at first we chose the left as being more accessible , and , clambering to the top , began a survey of the situation , when an army of mosquitoes , midges and punkies attacked us with a ferociousness that is altogether beyond description . They seemed to fill the air so as to render breathing impbssible without inhaling them , and we fled to the boats in indiscriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although we found it far from free of the intolerable // plagues , still it was much better , and the smoke of half a dozen rapidly kindled fires helped to drive them away . It was not an attractive place to pass the night , for the long grass was very wet , and there was but little wood for the fires ; but all discomforts were forgotten by dawn of day , and I think that the men of the party would have liked to stay longer , for the waters below were literally swarming with trout of an enormous size ; I hardly dare to say how many were landed before breakfast , but they drew them in almost as fast as they could throw a line . The rapids on which we were about to embark were found to be very strong , and the river so low that the guide thought it unsafe ; so , giving us some very dubious directions as to the course we were to follow , they ferried us across the stream and left us to make our way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promise to guide us with their shouts . It was a walk , or rather a climb , to be remembered . At times our strength nearly failed us . No woodman 's ax had ever echoed here , and on every side the fallen trunks and centuries ' decay made barriers almost impassable . However , there was nothing for it but to plunge through as best we might ; so , climbing over and under the great trunks , and sinking at times deep in the treacherous rotten logs that gave way beneath our feet , we finally reached the shore again , and waited for the canoes . H. and Mr. O'C. had each carried a child during this frightful walk and must have been completely exhausted , although they would not admit it ; but we all resolved that for the future we would brave any rapids rather than repeat such a walk . The waters were still rough enough , however , to make it very picturesque and exciting , and we made good progress until we reached Umsaskis Lake ; half-way up its shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters we had passed , there were none I think so fair as this , outviesng all its sister lakes in the perfection of its lonely loveliness . The water laps upon its fresh green shores as yet unmarred with drift and whitened logs , and all- the other debris that is sure to mark the track of man . It was with regret that we entered the narrow stream beyond , that , bordered with tall pines , suddenly closed from our view the fair scene behind us " This is the forest primevaL The murmuring pines and the hemlocks , Bearded with moss , and in garments green , indistinct in the twilight , Stand like Druids of eld , with voices sad and pro . phetic , Stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms . " Only a few more years will these stately patriarchs of the forest be left in their green solitude ; soon the woodman 's ax will wake the echoes upon the shores of the lonely lakes , singling out the giant white pine , which is ever the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the upper end of which there lived an old-time hunter , who for twenty-eight years had made these forests his solitary home , and we put forth every effort in the hope of reaching his shanty before night . Toward eight o'clock we were rewarded by the sight of a small clearing , and all eyes were strained to discover the presence of " the wild man " as we had christened him ,  --  very appropriately too , as we soon had reason to convince ourselves . The gentleman was at home , and as his attention was attracted to the approach of our canoes , he indulged in a series of gymnastics and yells that were quite appalling . This we afterward discovered was all intended as the expression of most friendly greeting . Helping to pull the boats ashore , he poured forth a stream of broken French and English that threatened to make up , in part at least , for all the years in which he had been debarred from human intercourse . He would gladly have extended to us the shelter of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and preferred our canvas covering. ; not refusing , however , a bed of hay which he furnished us , and some maple sugar for the children . Good hunting could be had from here , as our host had a favorite spot in the neighborhood , where he promised a choice of moose , caribou , deer , otter or beaver , but our time was so limited that the temptation was regretfully put away , and we were obliged to content ourselves with the hope of returning at some future day and roughing it for a month or so in this wild region . With the morning we were again eu route , the wild man gazing after us from the shore , indulging in a few parting yells and an occasional leap into the air . I afterward learned that he had improved his opportunities during our few hours stay to offer himself in matrimony to my maid , which flattering proposal , fortunately for me , was not accepted . There were no more lakes before us now , and a half hour 's paddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stretches away some fifty or sixty miles before joining the St. // John 's , and St. Francis , the first settlement to be met , is twelve miles again beyond that point . An examination of the larder revealed a most impoverished condition , and we fully realized that any loss of time would render our supply inadequate to the distance . With this rather powerful stimulant to exertion every paddle had plied morning and afternoon , with hardly any intermission , and the sun was now sinking behind some heavy clouds that were fast gathering in the west . The shores on either side were steep , and very thick with underbrush , and while looking anxiously for some spot where it would be possible to pitch our tent , one of our guides , the only one who had been through before , said that he remembered a clearing with a cabin on it which he thought could not be far beyond . The forbidding aspect of the shores and the surely coming storm boded us no good , and it was at once determined to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes , containing the two children , Mr. O'C. , H. and myself ; the others being half a mile behind . The Indian guides were well tipped , and their paddles responded vigorously as we sped on in the fading light . Mile followed mile and still no semblance could be traced of the spot described ; moreover , darkness was not destined to be the only obstacle to our progress , as the ominous sound of rapids fell upon our ears . Still we kept our course , and thanks to the keen Indian eye and steady hand , were guided safely through . Then came shallow water where both canoes and hopes were well-nigh stranded . All four men were in the water , and we were finally pushed and pulled through it , reaching again the deeper channel ; but in a darkness so profound as to render the banks almost invisible . Had there only been still water now , we might yet have reached our goal ; but the fates were dead against us , for the current was growing swifter and another stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness would have been sheer madness ; so we faced the inevitable and groped about for a landing-place . The storm was now upon us , and as we stepped out on a bank of soft oozing mud ,  --  the only place they could find to land ,  --  the heavy rain began to fall , and my heart sank within me as the full force of our extremely disagreeable situation rose before us . The other boats contained the tent , provisions , and in short the whole camp equipage , and we had left them miles behind in the vain selfflattery that the " farm " was to afford us shelter and entertainment for the night . If the darkness had overtaken them before they came to the last rapids we had passed , it would be almost impossible to reach us . We had simply nothing but the clothes we wore and two little pieces of maple sugar which we gave the children ,  --  they were delighted with everything and in the most excellent spirits . I do not know what we should have done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came greatly to the rescue . A bright fire blazed up , as if by magic , from the wet sticks and muddy bed , and with the paddles and a bit of string a frame was made over one of the canoes , which they pulled up on shore and covered with great sheets of birch-bark peeled from the trees near by , and in it Jack and Jill were put supperless to bed . But they now had at least warmth and shelter . They were very good , poor little things , and I put them to sleep , kneeling in the wet mud to rock the birch canoe , and singing " Little Jack Homer " and " Jack and Jill , " while the r*iin fell steadily and the solemn night settled down over the wilderness . The possibility of our being obliged to pass the night in this forlorn condition and entirely at the mercy of the storm , was merging rapidly into certainty , and for the first time since the start I felt my courage quite give way . It was not destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little later on we heard the shouts of the rest of the party , who had providentially determined to reach us at all hazards ; and a very hearty welcome we gave them , especially those who brought the tent and blankets . With these we managed to get through the night somehow , dwelling with pleasure upon the prospect of reaching the settlements the following day . And this we succeeded in doing , completing the remaining twenty miles upon the Alleguash , and entering triumphantly upon the St. John 's River . It was nearly sunset , and St. Francis lay twelve miles beyond ; but the river is very swift , and the current alone would carry us that distance in an hour . The rapids here were on a far grander scale than any we had passed ,  --  very swift , and much greater in the volume of the water . The frail craft shot through them like an arrow from the bow , and when I reflect now that a single miscalculation or a moment 's want of presence of mind in our guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how I ever dared to take those blessed babies through . // Of course , having gone so far , it was necessary to go farther . But I felt we had good cause that night , once more among our fellow-men , to thank the ever-watchful Providence who had safely guided us through our journey . In the following three days we paddled dyer a hundred miles down the St. John 's River , passing all too quickly through its noble scenery , ever changing in its grandeur or its beauty , and stopping for the night at the settlements that are scattered here and there along its banks . At Tobique we reached the railroad , and our trunks , which had been forwarded to us from Mount Kineo . It was with mingled delight and regret that I laid aside my wood-toggery and donned a French costume , and when Jack and Jill came into my room with their bonne - she with smart cap and ribbons and stiffly starched gown , and the children in embroidered frocks and broad sashes-I could hardly believe them to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Urwald " such a short time before . And I think that all our party felt more sorry than glad when we met at dinner in the garb of civilization , and bade good-bye to the pleasures and hardships of our forest roamings.
