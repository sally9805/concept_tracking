There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. -1 Cor. xv . 44 . WHILE in Philadelphia in May last , I witnessed some surprising occurrences in Mr. and Mrs. Holmes 's little parlor . They belong to that mysterious and somewhat suspicious class of persons known as " mediums . " As they had been quite famous in London , whence they had lately arrived , I gladly availed myself of Dr. Henry Child 's courteous offer to adniit me into a private circle of his friends , about twenty-five in number , which had been formed for the purpose of witnessing some exhibitions of their strange powers . The circle contained a goodly number of skeptics as well as of believers . The sittings were mostly held in the evening . The locus in quo was the front room of the second floor at No. 50 North Ninth street . This room had but two doors ; one opening on the landing at the head of the stairs , the other on a bedroom , which was the only other room on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . The passage into the bedroom was entirely closed by a board partition nailed across the door opening , secured above and below to the door frame by iron clamps firmly screwed into the wood . On the bedroom side this partition was found to be the front of a closet or box , some ten inches deep , standing vertically against the door opening , nailed to the floor at bottom , and the top of which was closed by boards firmly nailed in . Through both the front and rear of this upright box , from the top to near the bottom , augur holes were bored , through which one could see from one room into the other . The cabinet or sanctum in which spirits were said to clothe themselves in mortal forms , consisted of the following simple arrangement : The bedroom door was left open at an angle of 60 deg. ; on the opposite door post a second door was attached , which came out to meet it at the same angle ; and when the two doors thus met , the recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comfortably contain the medium , Mr. Holmes , seated in a chair . Whenever this little sanctum was to be used , the light was excluded from above by a triangular piece of wood laid across the tops of the two doors . This cover was lined on the inside with blackeloth , as were also the insides of the two doors . The air being thus shut out from the little closet , the necessity of the air holes through the wood partition was apparent . Through the one of these two doors which faced the spectators , at the height of some five feet from the floor , was a circular aperture or window , about ten inches in diameter , at which the faces were to be seen . A black curtain hung on the inside of it , which was drawn aside just before a face presented itself . The most searching examination of this sanctum , which was usually made by invitation just before the sitting commenced , both on the parlor and on the bedroom side of the board partition , failed to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other arrangement for the use of machinery or for deception . The first two or three evenings I attended , I made a careful examination myself , and on one occasion jointly with a professional magician , a pupil of Blitz , who told me he was perfectly satisfied that " there was no chance for any trick there . " Just before the sitting commenced , skeptics were invited to examine the bedroom , which done , the only door leading into it , that on the stair landing , was locked by Mrs. Holmes , // who retained the key , and who then took her seat in front of the sanctum , remaining there in full view during the entire sitting . The other parlor door , opening on the landing , was then locked on the inside , and the spectators were invited to draw up their chairs as close as possible to the window ; an invitation of which they always promptly availed themselves . Before Mr. Holmes entered the sanctum , skeptics were allowed to examine his person from head to foot , to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing . I myself used this permission several times , both on his entry into the cabinet and on his exit from it , and discovered nothing but very closefitting garments . Any skeptic who wished further satisfaction on this point was invited to retire with Mr. Holmes into the bedroom , and change clothes with him . On entering the cabinet he hooked the two doors together on the inside , and seated himself in the chair facing the board partition . I repeatedly opened the doors , which I always found unhooked , immediately on its being announced by raps from the inside that the exhibition of faces was over , and invariably found him thus seated , with his head bent down , and apparently just waking from a sound sleep . In answer to my inquiries he said that usually he was entranced immediately on taking his seat , and was never conscious of what took place around him till he was waked at the close of the sitting . The sitting for faces followed the dark one for " physical manifestations , " to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in the light . But the single gas burner was turned partly down ; it being found that the faces were seen more plainly in this half light ; and moreover , it was stated , a full light would be painful to the " spirits , " besides rendering their " materializations " imperfect . The first sitting I attended was on the evenir*g of May 14 . There were over twenty-five persons present , among them a fe*v ladies . A few m* inents after Mr. Holmes had entered the cabinet , the curtain was drawn aside , and the face of an elderly gentleman , with a gray beard , presented itself at the window . A Mr. W-n who was present recognized him at once as his father . Several other persons confirmed this recognition . On being asked if it was not Mr. W-n , the head nodded assent , and soon after withdrew . This face appeared repeatedly at subsequent sittings , and was invariably recognized as that of Mr. NV-n by more or less of the persons present . The next face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gray whiskers , and was recognized at once by a gentlemen present , named W-d , as his brother , to whose recognition he nodded in assent . Before withdrawing he answered several questions by nods of the bead . This face also r* appeared repeatedly at subsequent sittings . At the last but one Mr. W-d brought a photograph of his deceased brother , dressed in uniform , and taken during the war . Although the face at the window was pale even to whiteness , it was impossible not to see an exact resemblance between the two , not only in the features , but in the expression , which was peculiar . The next face was rather long , pale , and sunken . It was that of a young man with brown hair and blue eyes , the mouth and chin and top of the head covered with a neatly folded white bandage . He looked about among the spectators and then fixed his eyes on me . Questioned by Dr. Child , he answered by nods that it was to me he came to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then raised his hand and pulled down the bandage a little , disclosing a dark moustache . I still failed to recognize him , and with a sad expression he withdrew . These heads , and all those subsequently seen ( with one exception ) , were covered in a greater or less degree with a white bandage . On in- // qwq London , is sick to-day , but not very ill " ; that the next evening she - came a gain , and asked him to " write to Willie Harrison , of the London Spiritualist , ' and tell him she was here in Philadelphia , and that he , Dr. Child , had seen her twice . " Dr. C.- " Katie , I have written a letter to Mr. Harrison , as you desired . " Katie. - " I thank you for writing to him . I wish you would write to my medium and tell her to come here . Tell her I 'm here . Direct to Miss Flora " ( sic ) " E. Cook , No. 6 Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She then , at Dr. Child 's request , allowed him to handle a curl of her hair . He told us it felt precisely like fine , silky human hair . Dr. Child asked her how she liked Professor Crookes . She answered , " He 's all nonsense . He 's an old maid . He has been plaguing my medium . I do n't like him , with his wires , and strings , and lamps , and everything . He is stupid . " At the sitting of May 15 , the first face that showed itself was that of a young girl of apparently eighteen or twenty . It was as different as possible from that of Katie King , being long and oval , with blue eyes , lighter hair , and a very gentle and lovely expression . Dr. Child told me she had appeared once before , when she was recognized as Mary N- by her father and mother , two elderly Quakers , who lived in Germantown . This evening they had been obliged to return home before the sitting for faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face were bandaged , but so as to leave much Of her hair visible . She looked anxiously round the room , as if in search of some one . Dr. C.- " Mary , did thee expect to see thy father and mother this even-incr ? " Mary nodded yes . Dr. C.- " They were obliged to go home before the face-sitting began . They were very sorry to leave before seeing thee , but they will be here without fail at the next sitting . " 48 Mary beiit her head with a sad and disappointed look , and withdrew for a moment . On reappearing , she accepted with visible pleasure a large bouquet in paper from the hand of Dr. Child , thanking him with a graceful nod . She appeared once or twice again , showing the bouquet in her hand . Her face was very distinct , and it had more color than Katie King 's . But there was a rigidity in the features that contrasted strikingly with the mobility of Katie 's . At the subsequent sittings of this special circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to come and bring her flowers , of which , Mrs. N- told me , she had been always very fond . She said also , in answer to my inquiry , that she could not be mistaken as to her daughter 's identity . She added that she died two years ago , at the age of eighteen . The next face was that of a boy , rather indistinct and very much bandaged . Dr. Child recognized it as that of H. A- , wha had died very recently ; whose aunt , who was present , seemed to recognize him also . The next face , a man 's , was reeognized by several persons present . It was distinct , but rigid and white , like I ) laster . The next was a very striking one ; the head and features remarkably large , and of a dark ashen color . This person , Dr. Child said , had appeared at a previous sitting . This evening , being asked his name , he whispered very audibly , " Rammohun Roy . " He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the aperture . Next appeared a face distinct but quite colorless , which was immediately recognized by a lady who sat next to me as that of her husband , and who exclaimed , " James ! " The face nodded to her in assent , and withdrew . Then came the sprightly and attractive face of Katie King . She talked with us a long time , perhaps half an hour ; though , as before stated , continually withdrawing her face for a few moments , and presently appear- // ing again . As usual , she* repeatedly called us " stupid , " smiling mischievously , and putting up her chin whenever she said this or anything else amusinG ' . " Will you have some oranges P " asked the Doctor . " Of course I will , " she answered . The Doctor then produced six oranges , and began putting them into her hands , which she held out to receive . But all at once appeared several other pretty and delicate hands under hers , some of which evidently belonged to very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four of them ; when oranges and hands at once disappeared . Afterward Katie reappeared and handed out to Mrs. Holmes one of the oranges , and also a bouquet of palpably earthly flowers , but whence obtained no one knew . Two of us were looking at her through opera glasses . " Tell those stupid men , " she impatiently said to Dr. Child , " to put away those things they are looking thr6ugh . " The Doctor explained to her that , being nearsighted , we could not see her plainly without them , and asked if she would not consent to let us use them . " Yes , " she replied , with a good-humored toss of her head . At the request of Dr. Child and of Mrs. Holmes , she repeatedly showed us her entire arm , bare to the shoulder , putting it entirely out of the window . An involuntary murmur of admiration always greeted this exhibition ; for the arm was a perfect model for a sculptor ; cast in one of nature 's finest moulds ; gracefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh , not of marble . At the Doctor 's request she afterward allowed several of us to go up to the window to feel her hand . I placed my own , the palm up , on the lower edge of the window , and on feeling her own palm in mine I closed my hand on hers , slowly and firmly pressing it . It was a perfectly natural feminine hand , of solid flesh and blood , and of a pleasant warmth . I should here observe that Mr. Holmes , the medium , is a tall and slender man , with a long and masculine hand and fingers . In answer to a question , Katie told us she had been showing herself in London that very evening . Being asked by Dr. Child how long she was in coming hither , she answered , " Just as quick as thought . " She added , " They are killing my medium in London . I want you to write to Mr. Blackburn and tell him to send my medium here . They 'll kill her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as they are there . " At the sitting of May 16 , two or three faces appeared which were recognized at once by friends or relatives present . Then came Katie King , appearing , talking , and behaving as usual . Again she showed her arm on request , again took oranges from some of us , the little hands then appearing under hers , catching some of them , and again she allowed her hand to be taken and held by several persons present . Taking one of her ringlets in her hand , she showed it to Mrs. Holmes , saying , " That 's a good curl . " She allowed Dr. Child to handle it , who again pronounced it perfectly natural human hair . Among other things , she said to Dr. Child , " Professor Crookes is a hum buo ' . He will kill my medium if she do n't come away . Write to Mr. Blackburn , care of Willie Harrison . " In answer to questions , she said she used to go to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the spirit world over one hundred years ; that she was eighteen years old when she went there ; that her father was a pirate captain , known as " the pirate Morgan , " but whose m*eal name was King , and that this was her name . She asked Dr. Child to write to Robert Dale Owen to come and see her . After she withdrew , a man 's face passed twice very rapidly by the window , fixing its eyes , as it passed , on me . I have special reasons for believing that I know who it was ; but // as I can not speak positively I will not here enter into particulars . It was the last face seen that evening . At the sitting of May 19 , two new faces appeared . They were quite indistinct , and were not recognized . They looked anxiously round the room , as if expecting to find some friend . But the next one , which was very distinct , was recognized at once by a Mrs. M --  , who sat near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him also . Then came , for the first time , a very striking face . It was that of a man with a black beard and moustache , and with a fierce look about the eyes . It was oval in shape , with considerable color , and , excepting Katie King 's , was the most life-like and real in its appearance and movements of all that we had seen . The face was not indicative of much culture or intelligence . The head was covered by a white turban , and a white handkerchief was round his mouth . No one recognized him , and he retired . Presently we shall see who he was . Then came Katie King , as pretty , sprightly , and amusing as ever . She was presented with five oranges in succession . As usual , several of them were caught by little hands suddenly thrust out of the window . I had written my name on a blank card , which I handed to her , requesting her to write on it . In one of her reappearances a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following was written in pencil on the blank side : " Very truly , Katie King . " Some one gave her a large bouquet , and then , by request , she showed her arm out of the window , and allowed Dr. Child to handle one of her ringlets . A gentleman gave her his handkerchief . After withdrawing with it for a moment , she returned and handed it back to him tied up in knots , to resemble a doll . Some one lifted up to her a bell on the end of a cane . She stretched out her arm , took the bell , and rang it several times in our sight , then , after withdrawing for an instant , reappeared with the bell in one hand and the bouquet in the other . Dr. Child asked her if her father could not come . She answered , " He was here this evening , but you did n't know him . He was the man with dark hair and beard , a white turban on his head , and a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had written to Mr. Owen , as she requested , but had not yet heard from him . She said , " He has n't received your letter yet . " The moment the sitting was over , I asked Mr. Holmes to write the words " Very truly , Katie King " on a piece of paper . He did so *t once . On comparing it with the same words on the card , Mr. Holmes 's writing was found to be more carefully done ; but the general form of the two capital Ks was the same in both . On the other hand , " Katie " was spelled by Mr. Holmes " Katy . " The sitting of May 20 was at four o ? clock i ' . M. Dr. and Mrs. Nwere present , and the first face that appeared was the lovely one of their daughter , who nodded , to them both , and afterward kissed her hand to her mother , who had brought her a large bouquet , in the centre of which was a lily . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother on the other side ? " She nodded yes . " Will thee give he this bouquet ? " Mary made some signs not at first understood , but it soon appeared that she wished to give her only the lily . " Will thee take the lily out to give to her ? " Mary intimated that she would , and then withdrew . But in a minute or so she reappeared with the bouquet , intimating that she had not power enough to extract the lily from it , and assented to her mother 's offer to extract it for her . Mrs. N- took the bouquet from her daughter and attempted to draw out the lily ; but she tried in vain to accomplish it , and was // finally obliged to unwin.d the wire with which the bouquet was bound . Mary then took the lily and disappeared . Mrs. W-n 's father then appeared ; then a Mrs. X- , a cross-eyed person , was recognized by Mrs. Dr. Mr. N- , and by others . Then came W-d 's brother . Finally came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie King had told us was her father 's . Dr. Child asked him if he could not speak to us . He said , " Yes , sir , I am just ready for that now . " He spoke in his natural voice , which was gruff and old-sailorlike . In answer to questions , he said he was really Sir Henry Morgan , though generally known as John King . " Would he qome out into the room ? " " He would whenever the circle was just right . " Some of us expressed a wish that he would do so then ; but Dr. Child thought it would not yet be prudent , as any nervous shock among members of the circle might react injuriously on the medium . Before leaving he said , " Katie will not be here to-day ; she is engaged at a sitting in London . " In fact , it being then about five o'clock r . M. in Philadelphia , it must have been about half past ten in the evening in London ; and the sittings there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till eleven . In the evening of May 21 , John King 's was the first face to appear . In answer to questions I put , he said he was the same John King that produced the physical manifestations at Koontz 's house in Ohio some years ago , and who accompanied the Davenports ; that he died some two hundred years ago ; that he was called " Commodore Morgan " ; that he was not happy yet , " it requiring a very long time to atone for such deeds as his . " After him came the face of an elderly man , not before seen . A lady in the room exclaimed in an agitated voice , " Joseph ! " The face responded to her by nods . The lady 's fainting condition suspended the sitting for a few moments . When she revived , the face had disappeared . She afterward told me the face she saw was that of Mr. C- , her husband , who had been dead nine years . The next face was recognized by a Mr. M- , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female face was recognized by a Mr. 5- as that of his wife ; and after her the face of a girl of about fifteen , as that of his wife 's young sister . In each of these cases the face nodded in assent to the recognition . Next came a man 's face that was recognized by no one . All these faces , as usual , gave more or less the impression of figures , some of them in plaster , others in wax ; and when at last we saw the bright face of Katie King , we felt that here , at all events , was a real living human being . It was like the sun rising from a mist . A very large bouquet was handed to her ; and when she received it , several other delicate white hands appeared near her own . Twice , on request , she stretched first her left arm , then her right , entirely out of the window . Both arms were bare , the shoulders inclusive . Neatly plaited white drapery covered the small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being asked if she would come out of the cabinet , she answered , " Yes , if you 'll behave . In answer to questions , she said her father was a very bad man ; that she had been with him in this world as little as possible ; that " only the time to think of it " was required to come hither from London . Some one asked , " Are we accountable in your world for every thing wrong we do here ? " She said , " Yes , for every thing you know to be wrong . " Being told that one of the ladies present was going to London , she said she must come to see her there . One of the spectators , on this occasion only , was Squire M- , who , I was told , is the Captain Rynders of Philadelphia . Katie , on retiring , said , " You must behave well , Squire M- ; " but immediately added , as // 1874 . WAS IT KATIE KING ? if by a delicate afterthought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very respectable old gentleman from New York State . The first face seen at the sitting of May 22 was that of John King , who began talking to us at once , as usual , in sea phrases . In answer to questions , he said he was born in 1636 , and was knighted by Charles II . Then came the face of an aged female . After it withdrew , a lady asked if it was . . The answer was three raps from the cabinet ; but the face did not reappear . Then came successively the faces of Mr. W-n , and of Mr. W-d , previously recognized . After the latter had disappeared some one suggested that the two faces looked very much alike , and asked them to show themselves together . They did so , and the difference between them was plain to all . Then the face previously recognized by Mr. 5- as that of his wife seemed to look round for her husband , who was not present . Then came Mary N- 's lovely face . She took from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times , showing it , and nodding to her father and mother with a pleased expression . Finally appeared Katie King , who was greeted with the usual exclamations of surprise and admiration . She asked what we called those glasses some of us were looking through . She was told they were opera glasses . " We had no such things , " she said , " when I lived here . " An enraptured elderly gentleman who saw her for the first time told her he had fallen in love with her . She saucily replied , " You stupid ! " " Is it true , Katie , " the gentleman continued , " that you allowed Professor Crookes to embrace you ? " " Yes , " she answered , " he squeezed me . " " Will you not one day allow me the same privilege ? " She answered with amusing emphasis , " If you do , I 'll thump you . " Then , at Dr. Child 's request , she showed her arms , as before described . Being asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both arms at once , the hands clasped ; and at the same moment appeared the little hands before spoken of . She then told us of her own accord that she remembered , when a little girl , seeing the old St. Paul 's Church burned down in London . I must here record an incident that was puzzling , and even suspicious . Before Katie withdrew , she had received four oranges from Dr. Child , and one from myself ; as also a large bouquet from some one else . Immediately after the sitting , a doubting Thomas went quietly into the bedroom and picked up the five oranges on the floor , near the foot of the double board partition already described . The bouquet , however , was nowhere to be found . I ought to add that repeatedly before and after this occasion , I , as well as others , searched the bedroom , the cabinet itself , and Mr. Holmes 's person , immediately at the close of the sitting ; this was the only instance of any object being found that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next evening 's sitting Katie was asked to explain the occurrence . She said that " they did n't want the oranges , and so had left them for us . " The first face at the sitting of May 26 was that of a man , very indistinct , and unknown to all present . Next came Mary N- , who thankfully received a bouquet from Dr. Child . Mr. W-n appeared also , and was recognized by several in the circle . The next was a new face , very distinct . It was at once recognized by a lady as that of a Mr. M- , her uncle , who assented to the recognition , and threw a kiss to her . Then came John King . Being asked who the spirit was whose face was indistinctly seen at the opening of the sitting , he said it was a man named Bullock , who had made an improvement in the printing press which was used in the office of the " Ledger , " where he was employed , and where he was killed by an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed // me , met George W. Childs , and asked him if lie knew such a person in the " Ledger " office . Mr. Childs replied that he did , and confirmed the particulars stated by John Kiiig . ) Dr. Child then asked John King to speak as loud as he could ; whereupon he shouted , " Ship ahoy ! " and other sea phrases . He theii retired , saying , " My little girl wants to come ; " and then the usual buzz of admiration announced the appearance of Katie King . She showed her arms and her curls , one of which she allowed Dr. Child to handle ; and then , also at the Doctor 's request , as she had done at other sittings , turned up her face , showing us a finely turned chin and throat . " Katie , " said Dr. Child , " we have never yet seen your tongue . Wo n't you show it to us ? " " No , I wo n't , " she replied . " But , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to look at people 's tongues . " " I ai n't sick , " she replied , very em-phatically ; but after withdrawing her face for a moment or two , she reappeared and put out her tongue to the Doctor two or three times . She received an orange and three J ) ouquets from members of the circle . One of the bouquets she afterward returned . I gave her an orange to present to my departed wife . Shortly afterward she told me she had delivered it as requested . I asked if my wife was here . She answered , " Of course she is . " Some one handed her a fan ; she opened it , fanned herself with it for some time , then returned it . Once when her hands were shown , we asked for a sight of the other hands that had often appeared with hers ; and immediately those hands were seen . She was asked if we could not see her father and herself at the same time . The next moment John King 's face appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to his face , saying , " Is n't he homely ? " At the same instant John King was saying something I could not distinguish . The next sitting was late in the af ternoon of May 27 . Among those present were the Vice-President of the United States , A. J. Drexel , and George W. Childs of the " Ledger . " The first face seen was that of an elderly person ; but whether of man or woman it was bard to say , it was so indistinct . Next came John King , who told us the materializations were rendered very difficult by the intense heat and the noises in the street , which prevented a perfect entrancement of the medium ; and that Bullock had tried to show himself , but had not succeeded . Then came Mary N who was presented with a bouquet , for which she smilingly nodded her thanks . Again Mr. W-n appeared , and was recognized by acquaintances pe At last came Katie King , as bright and real as ever . She allowed the Vice-President and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request , she showed her chin and throat . The Doctor asked her if he might not see her tongue again . She at first declined , saying playfully , " I 'm better to-day ; " but after retiring for a few moments , she reappeared and complied with the request . At the sitting of May 26 , she had taken from Dr. Child a blank leaf of note paper , promising to return it with some writing of her own upon it . She now performed her promise . The page , which I was allowed to examine , was covered with writing in a neat and studied feminine hand , entirely unlike any handwriting now in vogue , and entirely unlike that of Mr. Holmes , the medium . Tl*ie writing was as follows : Flowers are not trifles , as we might know from the care God has taken of them everywhere . Not one unfinished ; not one bearing the mark of a brush or pencil . Fringing the eternal borders of mountain ranges ; growing on the pulseless head of the gray old granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear roses in their button-holes . Villains seldom train vines over their cottage doors . KATIE KING . At the sitting of May 25 , which I did not attend , Katie ( as Dr. Child in- // 1874 . ) WAS IT KATIE KING P formed me ) had asked a Mr. Y- , who was present , to let her look through his opera glass . It was a large ivory one . After amusing herself for a few moments by looking through it , she disappeared with it , saying she was going to take it to London . This afternoon she was asked to return it to Mr. Y- , who was again present . She said she had not yet done with it ; that she meant to look at Professor Crookes through it . At the sitting of May 28 , no sooner had Mr. Holmes retired behind the doors , and before we had seated ourselves , John King put his face out of the window , shouting , " All hands on deck ! " He had done the same thing once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. W-d 's brother appeared . Mr. W-d then showed me the photograph already mentioned of his brother , and which was an exact likeness of the face at the window . Then came Mary N- , and after her another young face appeared* whom a lady called " Kate , " recognizing her as a daughter who had died two years ago at the age of twenty-one . The mother was quite overcome with emotion ; especially when she went up and took her daughter 's hand . A few moments after this face had disappeared , all at once we saw Katie King at the window , surveying us through Mr. Y 's opera glass , which she returned to him through Dr. Child . Being asked if she had looked at Professor Crookes through it , she said yes . I asked her if she had heard read , just before the sitting commenced , Mr. Benjamin Coleman 's account , in the " London Spiritualist " of May 15 , of his interview with her of May 9 . She said she had . I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , most of it . " Owing to the intense heat , the sitting was then closed , Katie saying as she retired , that " she was glad to see so many skeptics here ; " adding that " her true name was Annie Morgan . " The sitting of May 29 was the last one I attended , being obliged to leave Philadelphia the next day . Katie King and her father came and talked with us as usual , and several other faces were seen , most of which were recognized . I will omit the particulars , as they would be mostly repetition . That evening , both Katie and her father intimated their willingness to come out of the cabinet whenever it should be deemed advisable ; but Dr. Child thought that the circle was not quite prepared for this , fearing some nervous shock among the spectators that might injure the medium . The facts I have related suggest some interesting questions : 1 . As to the discovery of the oranges in the bedroom , which was separated from the parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly nailed into the sides of the door and into the floor . The fact is strongly suggestive of trick . But what became of the bouquet handed to Katie King at the same sitting ? And what became of the oranges and bouquets received by the alleged spirits at the other sittings , no trace of which could be round , either in the bedroom , in the cabinet , or on Mr. Holmes 's person ? If we assume these phenomena not to have been cxtramundane , or that no extramundafle power can pass material objects through solid matter , we might legitimately infer the existence of some secret mechanical means whereby these objects were made to disappear ; but would not this assumption be a begging of the question ? 2 . Were these appearances simply Mr. Holmes himself , using a variety of masks ? In this connection the resemblance between Katie King 's writing and Mr. Holmes 's in the formation of the capital Ks seems somewhat significant . But those who have investigated this strange subject tell us there is strong testimony tending to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged spirit and the medium , causing sometimes a resemblance hetween them in their modes of action , and even in their personal appearance . But assuming there was some ingeniously hidden place of concealment for such masks behind the two doors , this would not account for the simultaneous appearance , at one time , of Mr. W-n 's father and Mr. W-d 's brother , and , at another , of Katie King and her father , both speaking at once . On these occasions , at least , Mr. Holmes must have had the assistance of another person . As to Katie King , it was physically impossible for a tall man , with a long head , long masculine arms and hands , by any mask whatever , to exhibit himself with a rather small and round female head , or with a female arm and hand much shorter than his own , to say nothing of their exquisite forms . Supposing a living young girl to be a third confederate , how could three persons stand together in so narrow a space ? How could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five persons ? and how is it that such a confederafy has remained so long undiscovered ? 3 . Were they puppets , operated by some hidden mechanism ? The complexion of most of the faces was anything but natural . Some of them , of a dead white , looked like plaster busts , and others more like wax figures than real flesh and blood . Again , in all of them ( except Katie King ) there was , more or less , a fixedness of look and immobility of features . This was even the case , in some degree , with John King while he was talking with us . Yet , if these were puppets , it is not easy to understand why they were not all made to look equally natural . And , as to Katie King , no one who saw her could he made for one moment to believe her to be a puppet . Unquestionably , if she was one , there has been no such creation since Prometheus 's time , and the exhibition of her as such would alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain it is that she was either a young girl of living flesh and blood , or else a spirit clothed in what was real flesh and blood to all the senses . 4 . Is there any reason to suppose she was not a living human being ? I answer there is . However long a living woman might remain in view , no change would be perceivable in any part of her bodily tissues . On the other hand , tissues derived from foreign elements , with which a spirit has temporarily surrounded itself , might be expected after a certain time to show signs of disorganization . Now I closely watch* ed Katie King 's countenance through an opera glass every time she appeared , and I invariably saw that , on her face being first visible , the eyes , as well as her other features , were perfectly natural in their appearance , the eyelids having all the mobility of those of a living person ; but several times , after her face had been a little longer visible than usual , the eyelids lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to prolong themselves downwards , looking like viscid masses about to roll down her cheeks ! Of this change she always seemed to become suddenly conscious , hastily withdrawing her face from the window ; at which , after a few mo* ments , it would appear again , with the eyes as natural as at first . 5 . Supposing Katie King to be a spirit , is she the identical Katie King that has been showing herself in London for the last three years to Professor Crookes and others ? Notwithstanding Prince Wittgem stein 's account of the London Katie ( " Revue Spirite " of February , 1874 ) , which , on the whole , describes very much such a person as our Philadelphia Katie , it would seem that this question must be answered in the negative . The picture taken of her in London by magnesium light , in which Dr. Gully is seen holding her hand , represents a totally different person . // There is not the slightest trace of a likeness between them . Our Katie 's nose is s'hort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long and aquiline . Our Katie looks about eighteen , and is very pretty , while the London Katie is quite plain , and might pass for thirty . Our Katie 's head has but a slight covering , while the London Katie 's is heavily bandaged . The London Katie 's hair is described as coarse , and of a light auburn . Our Katie 's is dark brown ( darker than the medium 's ) , and of a silky texture . Again , our Katie seems to have been somewhat confused about her name . At first she told us her fnther 's real name was King , though he was known as " the pirate Morgan . " Afterward she told us the reverse of this : that his real name was Morgan , and that her own name was " Annie Morgan . " At the London Katie 's farewell appearance she gave her name as " Annie Owen de Morgan ; " and th*lgh this was on the 21st of May last , nine days after our Katie King began her appearances in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whether she be " Miss de Morgan " or not , our American Katie would really seem to be the spirit of some English country girl who may have died two hundred years ago . " Her speech bewrayeth her . " " Of course , " she pronounces " of coorse " ; " nice " she calls " noice " ; " I 'll thump you " she pronounced , " I 'll thoimp you . " Her favoritQ epithet " stupid " she pronounced like the English , and not like most Americans , " stewpid . " I was telling one of the great poets of this age of her calling her father " homely . " He remarked that this was rather suspicious , " homely " in the sense of " plain " being an Amencanism . " However , " added he , " let us look at my Glossary of Shakespeare ; ' " and there , sure enough , he found cited several passages where the word is used in the same sense as with us . As directly relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three quotations : In a letter dated June 6 , from my skeptical friend Mrs. D- , she says : " Dr. Child has had the cabinet built entirely across the corner of the room , and extending up to the ceiling , and has two apertures for the faces , instead of one . " On account of the heat , the mediums predicted we should have very little materialization ; but , contrary to expectations , and perhaps owing to Mr. Owen 's ( R. Dale Owen ) presence , both openings were filled nearly all the time with heads and many hands . Katie King came , more lifelike than ever , and very sprightly ; showing us constantly both her beautiful arms , and shaking hands with Mr. Owen . " Finally , they said if we would lower the light a little , she would appear in form . Of course , we im*iiediately had the gas turned down ; and then slowly the door of the cabinet opened , and Katie stood before us , robed in white , and looking so pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but opened again , and she came furtlier out and waved her hands to us very gra6efully . " She is very short in stature , but very perfectly formed . " Once she brought to the opening two little babies in her arms , and many times came with one . They were lovely looking children . " It was a most wonderful exhibi .. tion , whatever causes produced it , material or spiritual ; and I am glad to have had the opportunity of witnessing such a scene . " Under date of June 14 , Dr. Child writes : " Katie came out and laid her hands on the heads of five of us . " In a colloquial lecture in Philadelphia on the 26th of June , Mr. Robert Dale Owen stated that , on the preceding evening , Mr. and Mrs. Holmes both sat outside of the cabinet , which he , Mr. Owen , first thoroughly examined ; that the only other person present was a lady friend of his ; that three // spirits came out from the cabinet into the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as sensible to touch as any human being in this audience . " " The first that came , " he continued , " Was an Indian spirit calling herself Sauntee , ' an Indian figure , very perfect . She had a white blanket , which , as she advanced toward us , she deliberately took off , and permitted us to handle . The second was a spirit calling himself Richard Laramjean , ' dressed according to his alleged condition in earth life , that of a sailor boy , about eighteen or nineteen years of age . " Then came Katie King herself . I hope somg of you may have a chance of seeing her ; anything I could say would give you no idea of her appearance . I can not conceive of a disembodied spirit more gentle , graceful , exhibiting a more beautiful character , material er spiritual , than she does . " Mr. Owen asked Katie , he says , if she could show herself raised into the air ; and he thus relates what follow-ed : " I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cabinet , and rise gradually from the floor until her extended hands just touched the top of the door , which is seven feet six inches high . " I saw het ' afterward appear with another spirit , equally distinct , by her side , purporting to be her father . I saw her raise her hand and place it on her father 's head ; then I saw her father step forward to the door just outside ; and then I saw the appearance of Katie King gradually fade out . " A letter from Dr. Child nflnounces that he has felt Katie King 's pulse , and found it a perfectly natural one of about seventy-two a minute-the pulse of a being that was seen by Mr. Owen not merely to disappear , but to fade from view . Finally , Mr. Owen writes to Dr. Child that Katie King asked for some paper and a pencil for a spirit that wished to write to him ; that a moment after she received them there appeared at the other aperture a human hand , not visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but selfsustained in the air , which wrote something on the paper with the pencil that had been furnished , which proved to be " Frederic W. Robertson " ; and that the next day this writing was compared with F. W. Robertson 's signature in his biography in the Philadelphia Library , and the two signatures were pronounced by experts to be identical . Such facts as are recorded in this paper must sooner or later banish the popular belief that departed mortals are mere intangible shadows- " stuff that dreams are made of . " The belief , like many others , now exploded , dates very far back . We read of pious . t*lneas : Ter conatus ibi edlo dare brachia circum ; Ter frustra comprensa manus effugic imago , Par levibus ventis , volucrique simillima somno . Will Professor Crookes ascertain from the London Katie King who her namesake in Philadelphia is ?
