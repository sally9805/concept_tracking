txt MT . GREELEY says it is very " injurious ' for Republicans to introduce the name of Gen. GRANT into the Connecticut canvass . He must hot be mentioned favorably . But it appears that there is no harm in niontioning him unfavorably . Hear . what Mr. Git ICELEY 's ally , the World , says : " But if the Liberal Republicans permit GRANT to be indorsed in Connecticut , the Cincinnati Convention will be of as little account as the Fremont Cleveland Convention was in 1864 ; and the Democratic Party will nominate CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS or Judge DAMS , and fight an independent battle . If the Liberal Republicans will defeat GRANT in Connecticut , they can select the opposition candidates and count upon zealous , united Democratic support in electing them . But if , having the Dower to turn Connecticut against GRANT , they do not choose to exert it . the Democratic Party ( whose organization will not be dissolved in any event ) will turn its back upon Cincinnati , and , as a sailor would say steer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let GRANT carry Connecticut , the Cincinnati Convention will not be worth a pinch of snuff . The Democratic Party is ready for an alliance with patriots , but not with poltroons . If Messrs . SUMNER , GREELEY , DowLEs , and our respootable friends of the Hartford Post , prefer a Grant triumph in Connecticut , we tell them plainly that the jig is up , ' " Was there over a more shameless bargain offered to Republicans I They are asked to secure a Republican defeat in Connecticut In order that they may gain the help of the Democrats in defeating Gen. GRANT . If that does not turn the scale of many votes in Connecticut we shall be much mistaken . In accordance with this bargain . Mr. GREELEY points out that Connecticut will be just as well under a Democratic State rule as under a Republican one . HUBBARD , he says , is quite as good a man as JEWELL ; Connecticut has been " mainly Republican " for years , bother State officers have often been Democratic , " and she has been well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State officers and Legislatures . " Is not this a very sly way of telling the Connecticut Republicans that they may just as well vote the Democratic ticket ? But we doubt whether they will do it .
