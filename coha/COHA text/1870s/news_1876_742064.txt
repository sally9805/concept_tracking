txt The other day that curious , anthropoid , Miss Dr. MARY WALKER , was bitten by an injudicious dog . The thoughtless person , on hearing of this incident , will , of course , feel some natural pity for the dog , but will dismiss the affair from his memory as one of little consequence . On the other hand , the truly philosophic mind finds abundant food for thought in the dog 's rasil and foolish act , and judging that act by the magnitude of its consequences , recognizes it as a bite of national importance . Au Inquiry into the probable effect upon the dog of his indulgence of an abnormal appetite opens a wide field of conjecture . The discovery of a Brooklyn physician that when a dog bites a drunkard , it is the dog and . not the man that dies , has an obvious bearing upon the case under consideration . According to this physician , no dog can lunch upon brandied human being without contracting hydrophobia , and . we may , therefore , infer by analogy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suffer some subsequent and severe physical penalty . To the lover of scientific inquiry there is something peculiarly fascinating in the effort to conjecture the probable fate of that dog . Will he go mad and evince a wild hatred of the garments appropriate to the females of our species ? Will he froth at the mouth at the sight of a well-filled clothes-line , and be goaded into fresh frenzy by a passing gleam of striped stockings ' 1 It is certainly probable that such will be the case . The biter of drunkards is inoculated with the drunkard 's characteristic form of mania , and the biter of Dr. WALKER will doubtless contract her peculiar insanity . The owner of that unfortunate dog should test him from time to time by showing him a feminine skirt . The moment he shows a desire , to worry it there will be no more room for doubt as to his condition . If he is riot promptly shot , he should be securely chained , and furnished with a bed made of several pairs of trousers . Such , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict homeopathist would prescribe , and , judging from the calming effect which trousers exorcise upon the mind of Dr. WALKER , it is quite possible that if administered in heroic doses they would cure the suffering dog . There is another aspect of the affair which is even more important than its possible influence upon the dog 's health . Dr. WALKER Was bitten , as she distinctly states , through her best Summer trousers . The fact is full of significance , and should be heeded by the reformers who demand a " garmenture of dual form " not only for their personal legs , but for the alleged logs of their more modest and less progressive sisters . Had Dr. WALKER worn the ordinary . garments of her reported sex , ' she ' would not have been bitten . It is well known to naturalists that the female skirt is a complete barrier to the attacks of hungry dogs . More than this , it is regarded by dogs in the light of a dangerous trap , and if one is accidentally caught in it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the days when woman 's glory was , in her crinoline rather than her , back hair , scores of careless ? dogs were daily swept under the billows of ? advancing skirts , and there detained . for hours , as iu a dark and fearful prison . At that period it was a frequent occurrence ' for a lady , on changing her dress after returning from a walk , to find several unhappy canine prisoners vainly beating the , steel bare of their ' prison house , and hanging frightened and wholly abject tails . Although the expansive crinoline of former days has given place to a far more restricted garment , the latter is still a safe protection against the dog who hankers after human ankles , Such a dog instinctively selects the masculine leg as the object of his attack , and knows that the trousers are only the fragile shell that conceals*the succulent and wholesome calf . It was the trousers of Dr. WALKER that tempted a reckless dog with the false promise of concealed . and edible leg . With skirts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited attack and heartlessly trifled with the feelings , of a dog who erroneously believed that every trousers leg must hold that which would satisfy his appetite . The Dress Reformers will learn from this affecting incident that they can wear a " garmenture of dual form " only at the cost of being bitten by hungry dogs . Prudence will therefore suggest that they make their " garmenture " of sheet iron . Two lengths of stove-pipe would possess the duality for which they clamor , and if some means could be invented of joining them together and fitting them with flexible joints , they would constitute a perfect protection against canine attacks . If the Reformers have not yet perfected . their ideal " garmenture , " let them at once turn their attention to sheetiron , and endeavor to adapt it to the necessities of their legs . ? As for Doctor WALKER , she will probably be satisfied with nothing less than copper trousers , securely rivetted , and polished more brightly than the capstan of a man-ofwar.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
