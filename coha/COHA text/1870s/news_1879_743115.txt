txt It is rather significant that the objection raised , some weeks ago , to the proposed Sunday trains on the Metropolitan Elevated Road , which were run for the first time yesterday , was put upon the ground of alleged unwarrantable disturbance of church services , and not upon that of desecrating the clay itself : In the time of the Puritan NowEnglanders , the bare , unwarmod church , the upright seat , the long sermon , the harsh family government , the " keeping " of the day by the most repressive observances , the prohibition of travel , and of everything not scrupulously necessary , all enforced by corporeal visitations of some sort , were fruits of a rigidity of faith which did omit charity too much in its devotion to some other virtues . The Praise-God Bare-bones of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was zealous of good works in excess ; in that day , men owned to being their brothers ' keepers as to matters of conseienee ; he who bore that name vas a type of those who not only were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved that ' , others should worship in the same . The severity of Sunday observance , even as softened since then , is still fresh in the memory of most of us , at least of the country bred . The system took no note of children 's nature , and was especially hard upon children . No playthings , no play , no noise , no out-of-doors . Instead , the long trial of " meeting , " the pain of keeping still , the catechetical crusts for tender throats , and all else which made the day a long penance , although , with strange lack of forethought , the child was taught that heaven is an eternal Sabbath . Most of this is past now , and what is left is further softened . In the city , flowers and music and fountains make the Sunday-school attractive , and " anniversary " marks its year with a white stone ; so , all religious teaching bears more than formerly upon GoD 's love and less upon His wrath . In the country , even , confinement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Walking out was then frowned upon , except that to walk to the cemetery , as tending to induce serious thoughts , was sometimes reluctantly permitted ; although , it must be said , that destination was often made excuse for sauntering elsewhere . Now , there is more latitude for doing , quietly and unobtrusively , what one pleases . What is Sunday to man ? Whether it is a periodical day for certain ceremonial observances under the Mosaic dispensation , men differ , this difference not being exclusively between Jews and not-Jews . Whether it is , in one or another degree , a day commemorative of CHRIST , men also differ , and , if they agree that it is  --  precisely such , at least they do not and can not agree upon the particular day . If it is merely typical , one thing ; if it is literal , the letter is lacking in literal exactness . But there is complete agreement about some points , as far as civilization extends . Ono is that the physical laws of our being command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seven , and that disregarding this command is not profitable . Another is , that the Christian faith , in every one of its variations and sect lines , comports with , if it does not command , such a turning from labor to meditation upon our place in the scheme of creation , from the subsistence view of one day to the broad one of all time with all men therein . The third point of agreement  --  not universal , but growing ? is , that " the greatest of all these things is charity . " We all are of one mind as touching , ( 1 ) rest ; ( 2 ) reflection , more or less a duty imposed ; ( 3 ) in part , in fact , and entirely , in doctrine , that tolerance should be universal and conscience free . Whether to attend church is a question , on its own merits , foreign to this discussion . What we shall do at home is also of no concern here . Shall rest which includes outdoor amusements be tolerated by public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday question . Ordinary labor ( mostly ) is closed ; nobody wants to open it ; but , shall everybody be suffered to spend the day as he pleases ? This question , as to city and country , respectively , is not the same question . In the country , everybody is known , and what he does is necessarily before others ' eyes . Whatever thing , though innocent in itself , one does against conscience , is thereby to him a wrong ; the Sunday stroll may therefore be a sin on part of one who has qualms about it and ' stifles them , ' but not a sin in another who has none . ? ? In the village , whoever goes out for amusement may be a disturbing sight to some , and may be a temptation to others to stifle their own scruples . " If meat make my brother to offend , ? I will eat no meat while the world stands . " And there is no necessity , for the country is always before the senses of the villager . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder , the strain on the nervous system far severer , by the heat , the terrible noise , and the peculiar stimulus of all conditions and surroundings , so that wear is undeniably more rapid . The tenement population have no other day for fresh air than Sunday . Tho facts ought to be otherwise , but we have to deal with them as they area . And when some Westfield disaster thrills us , and is seized by some zealot as a judgment upon Sabbath-breaking  --  as , though disasters on other days of the week were not equally judgments upon carelessness  --  that may be man 's version , but it may not be GoD 's intention . Until preaching and practical philanthropy can alter the conditions of life in great cities , the seventh will be the only day available for rest , and rest can not be had , for many , in religious exercises . If the Sabbath was made for man , then man must subordinate it to man . After ? ? all is said , we can not deny that when body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need must be put first , in point of time ; because it is a " perishing " body , it must be ministered to first ; the tract must stand behind the loaf  --  rest must go before instruction . Against this ' ieW it is urged that the churches , which could not now hold one-fourth the City population , could be multiplied if needed ; that mans who flock out of town nu Sunday are not shut up ' to that day ; and that thousands of railroad and other employes are thereby made to ? work . All true , but not quite conelu sive . The Sunday workers have or might have their off-day ; and , at most , the ease is - ton working that , , a hundred may rest . That many idle off who have other days , and that many do not take restful amusement , are faults which seem irremediable except by suppressing personal freedom with Sunday laws . Whether the growing recognition of Sunday as a day of rest , with religious observance of it left to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backsliding , may be left an open question . Were every public vehicle held still , and every public ) resort closed , would anybody be driven to the churches ? ? Would not , instead , the denial of certain forms of amusement open others , perhaps less innocent ? If so , the wiser course is the moderato one of trying to direct tendencies which can not be suppressed .
