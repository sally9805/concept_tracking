NEW YORK IN THE REVOLUTION . SECOND PAPER . THE importance of New York as a center of operations was early impressed upon the patriot leaders . General Charles Lee occupied the city in March , 1776 , and on the fourteenth of April Washington arrived to assume command in person . It was not expected that the British would quietly submit to this state of affairs , but the Continental commanders vigorously pushed the work of fortifying the island , and Lord Stirling , Gen. Putnam and Gen. Greene did their VOL . XI. - 3o . MRS . ROBERT MURRAY ENTERTAINING BRITISH OFFICEEZ , WHILE PUTNAM ESCAPES .

The house still stands , and is the most , interesting relic of revolutionary days that is to be found in the city . Its walls look out as of old upon the Battery , but Fort George and the intrenchments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched down to // the Hudson River , but two streets have been built out upon the beach that was then gently washed by the waves . Still its upper windows look out toward the wooded shore of Staten Island , but the tents of the British soldiery camped there in 1776 have given place to multitudinous cottages . The ceaseless roar of traffic surrounds the old house , and all guests who can pay for their entertainment are made welcome where the doors once were only opened to those who had wealth or titles or had won distinction in arms . A sign now announces that the " Washington Hotel " is conducting business in the mansion that was built by an earl , and the honest farmer and unromantic sailor may sleep under the roof that was long ago consecrated by the slumbers of titled beauty . From this house Gen. Lee issued his first proclamation of defiance to the British navy , and Washington made it his headquarters when the last British soldier had embarked at the Battery . The house known as No. i Broadway has suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected in 1750 by the Honorable Archibald Kennedy , captain in the British navy , afterward eleventh Earl of Cassilis . Judging from the brick-work , the house No. 3 Broadway , which has also survived the hands of the iconoclast , was built in conjunction with No. 1 , and had means of communication with it . In their very earliest days these houses formed one of the chief centers of New York 's best society , and grand entertainments were celebrated connectedly in both . Little did those who enjoyed their hospitality in those first peaceful days know the vicissitudes through which they were to pass . Their owners suffered the sequestration of their property through loyalty to the British King , and afterward were compelled to buy it back at exorbitant rates . It was the fortune of war . Both houses are now in the possession of the De Peyster family , whose ancestress , Ann Watts , was the wife of Captain Kennedy . When the American forces entered the city of New York , the house of so prominent a royalist as the British naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was occupied first by Lee and then by Putnam . Friends , however , treated it no better than foes . Sir Henry Clinton seized upon No. i Broadway and established his headquarters there , while Sir William Howe found a comfortable shelter in the dwelling adjoining it . Subsequently Sir Guy Carleton resided at No. i , occupying Richmond Hill as his country house . A brilliant array of officers made the entertainments of the English Commander-in-Chief exceedingly attractive in the eyes of the loyalist merchants of New York , and their wives and daughters . There gathered , on gala nights , Earls Cornwallis and Percy , Admirals Digby and Rodney , Counts Donop and Knyphausen , Generals Robertson , Erskine , Grant , and a host of younger aspirants for fame . Prince William Henry , afterward William the Fourth of England , at one time graced its halls , and was so enthralled by the beauty that flattered the royal middy that he was suddenly taken to sea by his guardian , lest he should be so imprudent as to farther entangle the erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee girl . Not a little of the romance of the Revolution clusters about these historic buildings . Here Margaret Moncrieffe , daughter of an OLD KENNEDY HOUSE ( WASHINGTON 'S HEADQUARTERS ) AND WATTS MANSION . // English'engineer of distinction , was detained as a spy , and here she saw and loved Aaron Burr , the handsome , fickle young aide-decamp on General Putnam 's staff . Though she afterward became somewhat notorious for her flirtations at the royal court , she never forgot her hero of the blue and buff . Jn her memoir , she speaks , also , of having often ascended to the cupola of the house to watch the white tents of the royal army on the Staten Island shore , and to pray for her speedy deliverance from captivity . Burr , however , never seems to have forgotten his military duties for the call of pleasure . It was he who pointed out to Putnam the way of escape for his army , after Lord Howe had occupied the east and middle roads . Neither the American commander nor any of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Aaron Burr piloted them through the woods west of Broadway to Greenwich , and thence by a road skirting the river bank to Bloomingdale . The escape was narrow but complete .. It was at No. i Broadway that Clinton and Andr6 hatched the plot which resulted in Arnold 's treason and the ignominious death of the Adjutant-General of the British army . Subsequently Arnold made his headquarters at the house adjoining , and it became the scene of one of the most daring and heroic acts of the war . After the traitor had fled to New York , the patriot officers laid a plan to kidnap him and carry him off bodily to their camp . The execution of the plot was intrusted to John Champe of Virginia , Sergeant-Major of Colonel Henry Lee 's cavalry legion . Champe deserted to the British , and was at once sent , as he had hoped , to assist Arnold in recruiting a corps of royalists and deserters . Watching the habits of the traitor , the Continental soldier soon laid his plan and communicated it to Lee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out to the river and as far up as No. 9 Broadway , where it communicated with a dark alley leading to the water 's edge . This garden was shaded by huge trees , several o* which were a hundred feet in height , and one , a madeira nut , which long survived , had lateral branches nearly as many feet in length . Under the shade of these trees it was Arnold 's habit to walk late every night-thinking bitterly , no doubt , of the dear price at which he had won a British commission and a hireling 's gold . Champe , with two accomplices , had arranged to seize the traitor on a certain night , gag and bind him , and carry him in a boat , ready at hand , to the American camp . It is said that the devil always helps his own . Whether Arnold received aid from this quarter or not , it is certain that on the day fixed for the consummation of the plot he changed his quarters , and the labor of the patriots was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , long after the independence of the struggling colonies was secured . How Benedict Arnold sank into oblivion , history has recorded . The Kennedy house has changed somewhat from its ancient appearance , though retaining all of its old features . Its walls , windows and doors have not suffered from the rage for improvement , but the cupola has disappeared , and another story has been added , to increase its accommodations as a hotel . Within its portals the antiquarian will yet find much to interest him . Its rooms still give evidence that they were planned by an aristocrat , and were intended for the profuse and elegant display of hospitality . White marble mantel-pieces , carved with frieze of acanthus , and decorated with heads crowned with curls and studded with amaranths , betoken a taste then rare in the colonies . The immense mirrors that reach from ceiling to floor are faded and shabby , but they still tell the glory of the brave men and fair women whose forms once flashed before them . Up the broad staircases , brushing the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loyalist New York in dresses of India silk , " satin petticoats , " and high-heeled shoes , and the gentlemen , elegant in attire of velvet , laced neck-cloths and silken stockings . They are WASHINGTON 'S FIRS*F HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK . // all dust and ashes now , but the mirror , which a blow of a hostile musket-stock might easily have shattered , still remains . Perhaps some of the rich men whose daily walk to business leads them in the vicinity of the old Kennedy house and its next-door neighbor , may think that it might be well to have a museum of Revolutionary antiquities in the vicinity of the Battery , and may rescue these old buildings for Centennial purposes . New York needs at least one such center . It would fitly be placed on the spot which so many famous feet have consecrated . The first headquarters of Washington in the city of New York was No. i8o Pearl street , opposite Cedar . It was the family mansion of the De Peysters , and the original contract for building it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vel ! y spacious . The center and the upper wing of the edifice were left standing until a few years ago . Built of brick , covered with stucco , having a handsome tiled roof and dormer windows , surrounded by stately trees , and looking through heavy shrubbery out upon the waters of the East River , the house was an attractive spot , even to the owner of a fine estate in Virginia . In this house the American Commander-inChief remained until summoned to meet with Congress at Philadelphia , in the latter part of May , 1776 . On his return to the city , Washington made his headquarters at the house and estate known and renowned as Richmond Hill . This mansion , reared far out of town by an opulent citizen , achieved its highest notoriety in connection with Aaron Burr , who made his residence there at thetime of his duel with Alexander Hamilton . The house was built in 1760 by Abraham Mortier , who was then Paymaster-General of the royal forces in America , and was a very wealthy gentleman . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the house , which was a roomy and substantial structure , were laid out with rare taste , and were said to compare favorably with celebrated country-seats in England . Far " out of town " as the house was in that day , it was actually situated near the present intersection of Charlton and Varick streets . A hundred years ago its nearest neighbors were the residences of Warren on the north and Lispenard toward the south-west , each of which was almost a mile distant . In the absence of its loyal owner , General Washington occupied the Richmond Hill house as his headquarters in the summer of 1776 . He was succeeded by Sir Guy Carleton , who made it a favorite rendezvous for his brother officers and the wealthier people of the city . Other noted men , among whom was Sir Grenville Temple , were domiciled here after peace had been declared with England , but with no occurrences was the stately mansion so closely identified as ( later in its existence ) with the marriage of Burr 's gifted and ill-fated daughter Theodosia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alexander Hamilton . The house ceased to be attractive to those who would otherwise have admired it as a home , and it became a hotel , whose ample garden was the scene of many a large pleasure party . When streets were cut through the estate , the building was moved to Charlton street near Varick , and served in turn as an inn , a theater , a circus , and a saloon , until the decree went forth for its demolition . Those New Yorkers who were young men thirty years ago ( it will hardly do yet to designate them as old ) will recall with eager zest the dances that were held on winter evenings in the great ball-room of the Richmond Hill mansion . There is no true son of New York that will not join in the regret of the antiquarian that time has spared so few of these old monuments of our colonial prosperity and wealth . One after another they have fallen at the touch of the street commissioner , the bidding of fashion , or the conscienceless demand for improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since the old Beekman mansion was to her as a residence , her husband having one of the landmarks of the city , and young commanded the Hessians who were taken people listened with delight to the legends prisoners at Saratoga . In glowing colors she with which their elders had invested it . depicts the beauties of farm , and garden , and greenhouse , and the interior of this elegant colonial residence . The rooms were spacious , adorned with black marble mantels bearing elaborate carvings of scroll and foliage . The fireplaces were ornamented with Dutch tiles , representing Scriptural subjects . Elijah in his chariot of fire was the story of one artist , and others had seized upon the history of the Prodigal Son and the perils of the Apostles , to impress a moral on the beholder while they delighted him with an odd exhibition of their art . True , the laws of perspective were grossly violated at times , but nothing more costly could be found in the colony , and it bore the additional merit of having been imported across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the drawingroom mantel and the Dutch tiles have been preserved in their entirety at the rooms of the Historical Society . One of the rooms was interesting as the place where Andr* passed his last night in New York . After the disastrous defeat of the American forces on Long Island , August 27th , 1776 , it became necessary that Washington should know something definite about the movements of the British forces . A council of officers decided that a spy should be dispatched to gain this information , and it Now it has disappeared , and the writer of our Centennial literature must be content with telling inquirers that it stood east of First Avenue , between Fifty-first and Fiftysecond streets . In olden time it was known by every New Yorker that its fine lawn reached down to the King 's Bridge road , and its windows looked out upon Turtle Bay . In structure it was plain , but massive , being solidly built of thick planks filled in with brick . It had two stories and a basement , and was surmounted by an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of its builder , Gerardus Beekman . He was a descendant of William Beekman , who came to New Amsterdam with Governor Peter Stuyvesant , and took a prominent part in the affairs of the colony in his day . The descendant built in 1763 this snug " bowerie " of the Beekmans at a point distant enough fromthe busy little city to lose its clamor , and yet near enough to etijoy the sight of its growth . Here , embedded in gardens , with fertile farms about it on either side , and with the river near at hand , what could a family sanctuary further desire ? A contemporary witness , Baroness Reidesel , wrote of the place in 1780 , that it left nothing for a tenant to desire . The English Governor at that time assigned it was evident that the person chosen must be not only brave , but a man of military talent and good judgment . The choice fell upon Captain Nathan Hale , of Coventry , ConBREKMAN MANSION . MAJOR ANDR* 'S ROOM , BRRRMAN MANSION . // necticut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress 's Own . " Without hesitation the young man placed his life at the disposal of his country , and went to the house of Robert Murray , on Murray Hill ( where Washington had his headquarters on the fourteenth of September ) , to receive his orders . Arrested at Huntington , Long Island , through the instrumentality of a cousin who was bound to him by many an act of kindness , he was brought to General Howe , at the Beekman House , Sept. 21 , 1776 . The British General did not stoop to the form of a court-martial , but told his captive that he would be hanged the next day , and only accorded him the privilege of writing to his mother and sisters that he was to meet a spy 's fate . Captain Cunningham , the brutal provost-marshal , refused to grant him the services of a clergyman , denied him the use of a Bible , and destroyed before his eyes the letters he had written to his relatives . Then , with the loud roll of drums they sought cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heromartyr : " I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country . " Traditions do not agree as to the place of Captain Hale 's execution . One account says that he was hanged on an apple-tree in Rutgers ' orchard , near the present intersection of East Broadway and Market street , while other living authonties used to point to an aged butternut tree standing before the Beekman House and marking the fifth mile from Whitehall , as the locality . The inhumanity exhibited by the British officers to Captain Nathan Hale stands out in striking contrast with the forbearance and generosity shown by the Americans in the case of Major John Andr6 . It was not until nine days after his capture that the British spy was hanged , and in the meantime he had been supplied with every possible comfort , and had been treated with the most distinguished consideration . The tears of those who had been his enemies in arms bedewed his grave , and their sympathies found expression in kindly letters to his mother and sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor in death . His King testified his gratitude by a handsome monument in Westminster Abbey , near the Poet 's Corner . When will New York do like honor to the brave young soldier whose sacred ashes were thrust into an unknown grave in her soil ? It is not asking too much now of a city whose people gave him no sympathy in his last hour , that somewhere Nathan Hale should be honored as was his fellow-soldier Richard Montgomery . She to whom Hale 's last thoughts of love went out was worthy of all the affection he had lavished upon her , and she never forgot him . For three-quarters of a century she toiled on , wrinkled and bent and failing , but before her unfading memory always stood Nathan Hale , with the bloom upon his cheek that was there when he spoke his last good-bye , and with the fire of patriotism still kindling his youthful figure into a glorious manhood . Years after her beloved had met a hero 's death , she yielded to the importunities of one who had long loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was married . But she never forgdt . Seventy-five years after Captain Hale had given his life to his country , she who had been betrothed to him was summoned to her rest . The messenger found her ready and glad to go , for she had been waiting patiently many a long year . Waiting , and for whom ? During the delirium of her last illness she repeatedly called to " Nathan , " and talked to him of the days when they had last been together , and with his name upon her lips she passed into eternity to meet him . The battle of Long Island , which led indirectly to the capture and execution of Nathan Hale , was the first great disaster that had befallen the patriot arms . Clinton and Howe had announced their purpose of meeting the " rebels " in the field , where no great disparity of numbers would exist , and where they would have the advantage in drill , equipments and artillery . This result was more than achieved before the close of August in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well armed , with forty cannon , landing on the lower Long Island shore , drove back into the East River five thousand Continental soldiers , killing and wounding about 550 , and taking i , i*o prisoners . It was a terrible disaster , and its consequences threatened to be appalling . Fortunately , two days afterward the Americans were enabled to take advantage of a heavy fog and cross the East River to New York without the loss of a man . Their foes slumbered all unconscious , within hearing distance of the patriot camp , waking only to find themselves cheated of their prey . As they emerged from the trenches they could see the nimble Continentals marching up from the ferry landings to the Rutgers farm , exulting beyond measure in their escape . Though the soldiers might rejoice at a temporary piece of good fortune , their // officers were not a little perplexed . It seemed evident to the most experienced of the American leaders that if the land and naval forces made a combined attack on the city of New York , the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy , their artillery was very inferior , their men were discouraged by defeat , and desertions were frequent . Here was enough almost to dishearten Washington . Sectional feeling divided the troops , insubordination prevailed largely , and greed was found in many where patriotism was expected . Men plundered alike friend and foe , and inferior officers showed an utter disregard for integrity and morality . It is not a pleasant picture to contemplate , but New York saw it all in the days that followed the defeat on Long Island . Good men grew dispirited , and wondered whether the prize in contemplation were worth the present sacrifice . As early as September 2d General Washington wrote to Congress that he would be unable to hold New York , and asked whether it would be advisable in that case to burn the city so as to prevent its affording winter quarters to the enemy . History does not tell us whether the American commander expressed an opinion on the point . It only lets us know that such men as General Greene and John Jay earnestly advised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure , as it had hope of regaining the city ; but the hope was not fulfilled until peace was declared . Meanwhile the torch of an incendiary had in part accomplished the work of destruction which patriotic New Yorkers then advised and desire*l . This point settled , the Continental army prepared to evacuate the city , and two weeks after the battle of Long Island the main body of the army , accompanied by several hundred patriot refugees , removed to the neighborhood of King 's Bridge . Putnam was left in the city with a garrison of four thousand men , having his headquarters at the Kennedy House , while Washington made his headquarters at the residence of Colonel Roger Morris . It was a strange chance that led the American General to this roof . The loyalist owner , who had deserted his home at the approach of the men in buff and blue , was Washington 's old companion in arms , and his wife was the beautiful Mary Phillipse , to whose hand it was said that Washington had once aspired . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far asunder . Colonel Morris and his wife were devoted to the royal cause , and they had fled at the approach of their enemies , to the country residence of Colonel Beverly Robinson in the Highlands . From the home of the fugitives Washington issued the orders which resulted in the brilliant skirmishes at McGowan 's Pass and Harlem Plains . The Morris mansion stands yet , unaltered amid the great change that has swept over all its surroundings , massive , elegant and imposing . Modem New York knows it best , probably , as the residence of Madame Jumel , the eccentric widow of Aaron Burr . It stands on the heights that overlook Harlem River , a little below the High Bridge , and the view from its windows is superb . There is one incident connected with Washington 's brief sojourn at the Morris mansion which deserves to be recalled from its legendary oblivion . While inspecting the works thrown up at Harlem for the protection of his army , the American commander was struck with the skill displayed in the disposition of a certain fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On making inquiry it turned out that the name of the officer in question was Alexander Hamilton , of whom General Greene had previously spoken to his superior in terms of high praise . Washington sought the acquaintance of the youth-Hamilton was then but nineteen  --  and at that time the friendship began which linked their lives together . It was about this time that Lord Howe THE ROGER MORRIS MANSION . // sought a peaceful adjustment of the difficulties between Great Britain and her colonies , proposing a conference for this purpose with a deputation from Congress . As he refused to recognize the authority of that body , and as Congress could not appoint its members to confer with the British commander in their private capacity , a committee was sent to inquire his authority for action . The committee consisted of Benlatter expressed his regret that the discussion had been fruitless , saying that it would give him great pain to make war upon those for whom he had such high personal regard . There was a spice of sarcasm in Franklin 's laughing reply : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , on their part , will endeavor to lessen the pain you may feel by taking good care of themselves . " jamin Franklin , John Adams and Edward Rutledge , and they met Lord If owe at his headquarters , on Staten Island , on the i ith of September , 1776 . It appeared , on consultation , that the only condition of peace proffered by the British was the unhesitating return of the colonies to their allegiance , and these terms the Congressional commissioners rejected with great firmness . Franklin and Howe had become intimately acquainted in London during the preceding year , and at the close of the conference the Foiled in his endeavor to pervert the patriotism of the leaders , Lord Howe immediately issued a proclamation promising his protection to all citizens who should take the oath of allegiance to the Crown . Disheartened by the disasters that had lately fallen upon the American arms , more than nine hundred of the inhabitants of New York came forward and ranged themselves under the British flag . The crisis tried the hearts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city the numerical / WASHINGTON S FAREWELL TO HIS OFFICERS . // majority was on the side of the King , but the long list of patriots comprised the names of most of the men of integrity and influence whose possessions were wholly on this side of the Atlantic . Personal interest was strong at first , but , in the end , patriotism had its triumph . Four days after the fruitless conference of the commissioners , Lord Howe made a landing on Manhattan Island and endeavored to sever the Continental army with the view of capturing its divided fragments in detail . The movement was almost a success . Washington 's army was scattered between the Battery and King 's Bridge . Two divisions of the enemy landed at Turtle and Kip 's Bays and easily drove the American militia before them , but lost the fruits of their victory by leisurely marching down the East River road to the city . The fleet on the Hudson contented itself with a cannonade of the Bloomingdale road that did little harm . Washington saw at a glance the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cannonade at Kip 's Bay , he rode down among the afflighted militiamen , and , in a paroxysm of rage at their panic , dashed his hat upon the ground and threatened the fugitives with death . Drawn from the field of battle by one of his aides , he at once sent word to Putnam to retreat to Harlem , and take measures to concentrate his entire forces on Harlem Heights . General Putnam was forced to abandon his heavy cannon and many of his stores , and , even thus , his flight was impeded by a throng of fugitives , men , women , and children , with their baggage . Guided by Aaron Burr he made a rapid march along the Hudson , happily escaping discovery until he had reached the Bloomingdale road , and finally reaching camp with a comparatively insignificant loss . The day was hot , the fugitives were fairly panting they were enraptured to find Mrs. Murray with thirst and fatigue , but Putnam on his and her beautiful daughters ready to greet foaming charger flew from one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , entreating , urging , and had once met in more peaceful days . dealing in stout objurgations until his charge " William , " said the fair Quaker matron , had passed , at night-fall , the American " will thee alight and refresh thyself at our pickets on the heights of Harlem . house ? " Neither soldier nor fugitive knew how " I thank you , Mrs. Murray , " said the narrow had been the escape of Putnam 's army that day . When Sir William Howe , accompanied by Clinton and Tryon , had landed at Kip 's Bay with the main b6dy of the British army , they struck across to the Middle Road , intending to make their camp on the heights of Inclenburg , midway between New York and Harlem . They reached the road at a point just opposite to where Putnam was stealing along , under cover of the woods that skirted the Hudson , to rejoin Washington . There was a house near by , from whose upper windows they might easily have discovered the dust created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its cupola the gleam of bayonets would have been plainly visible . The Americans were not distant , indeed , but there was another and more insidious foe near at hand . Close to the Middle Road , at a point now designated by the corporation as Fifth Avenue and Thirty-seventh street , stood the unpretentious but exceedingfy comfortable mansion of Robert Murray , a Quaker merchant of approved loyalty to the Crown , as well as of large wealth . Fortunately the shrewd merchant could not control the feelings of his household , and his wife and daughters were ardent patriots . When Lord Howe and his staff reached the edge of the Quaker 's gardens VAN CORTLANDT MANOR HOUSE , AT KING 'S BRIDGE . // pleasure-loving commander , " but I must first catch that rascally Yankee , Putnam .

Thee had better come in and dine . " The invitation was seconded by the brightest smiles of the daughters , and Howe wavered . Promising to pursue the hated Yankees after he had dined , the British commander alighted and entered the house , where the fascinations of his charming hostesses made him forget for hours the object of his expedition . Putnam meanwhile was flying up the Bloomingdale road , never daring to draw breath until he caught sight of Washington 's tents . Thacher , in his " Military Journal , " writes that it became a common saying among the American officers that Mrs. Murray had saved Putnam 's division . The Murray mansion was approached by an avenue of magnolias , spruces , elms , and Lombardy poplars , that led to a wide lawn , and wa* bordered on either side by extensive gardens . It was called " Belmont , " and is frequently spoken of by chroniclers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . During the occupation of the city by the British forces , it was crowded with scarlet coats and powdered wigs . Major Andr6 wrote of its chief attractions : " I can not pretend to do justice to the Misses Murray . ' ' Mrs. Robert Murray was a Miss Lindley , of Philadelphia , a celebrated Quaker belle , and her eldest son was Lindley Murray , the noted grammarian . Having injured his spine in early life by a gymnastic feat , it was for his comfort that Mr. Murray introduced in New York the first state coach the colonists had seen . It cost ? 15.14s. , and was looked upon as an aristocratic innovation by those who could not afford such a luxury . Hence the time-serving old merchant was moved to speak of it as " aleathern conveniency , " hoping thereby to stem the current of adverse criticism .

At Thirty-fourth street and Second Avenue stood for nearly two hundred years the Kip house , which for a long time after the British took possession of the island was used as headquarters by the officers . Not far distant were the Keteltas mansion and the Watts house , looking out upon the East River , and over to the wooded shores of Newtown creek .

Some of these old mansions yet stand , though mainly in such a state as only testifies to their past grandeur . The dining-room of the old house built in 1740 at Ninety-second street and Ninth avenue , by Colonel Thorne , from material brought from England , still bears witness that floor , ceiling and sides are of mahogany ; but it has forgotten the voices of Clinton and Hamilton , and echoes now only the music of German singing societies .

Their inns were not noted for any richness of architecture , but they abounded in the best of cheer and were solid and substantial as well within as without . One of the most noted of these hostelries was the Blue Bell tavern , which was built upon the King 's Bridgeroad , a short distance below Fort Washington . Travelers knew it well and loved its larder , which at the time when the War for Independence broke out had becomeproverbial . The old inn stands yet , remembered only by the few who partook of its hospitalities before the Boston and Albany stage-coach had disappeared and when farmers " baited " at its door .

With a more ambitious title , but with no more of comfort , the modern hotel has succeeded to its hospitality . While the Americans occupied the city of New York , they erected numerous fortifications on the shores of the island . The largest of these was Fort Washington , situated on the highest eminence on the island , above One Hundred and Eighty-first street , on the Hudson River . It was built of earth , was irregular in shape , and covered several acres . On the promontory just below it , J effery 's Hook , a strong redoubt was erected , and another was thrown up at about the same distance to the north . Remains of these works can yet be discovered by the curious tourist . Twenty-four heavy cannon , besides smaller pieces and mortars , were mounted in these fortifications .

After a desperate fight he was compelled to surrender , and the prisons of New York , already gorged with the patriots who had been captured on Long Island , were crowded to repletion with the hapless garrison of Fort Washington . General Washington , with Greene , Putnam and Mercer , watched the conflict from the roof of the Morris house . They had a narrow escape from capture , for within fifteen minutes after their departure the British troops camped upon the lawn . Great were the rejoicings of the loyalists in New York when the news came that the British army had gained undisputed possession of the entire island . In spite of the depression and loss occasioned by the great fire of September 21st , all prepared for a time of pleasure and gayety . A theater was opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthier merchants opened their houses with lavish display to their old masters . True , somebody suffered . The Dutch churches were converted into // prisons and store-houses . Wounded Hessians filled the quaint old edifice in which the Lutherans worshiped ( at the north-east corner of Frankfort and William streets ) , and the ground in the rear was furrowed with the graves of these wretched victims of a monarch 's avarice . Subsequently this edifice became a military prison , and its walls re-echoed the sighs of starving patriots . The French Huguenot church fared no better , and a similar fate befell the Brick Church and the Friends ' meeting-house . Only one of these ecclesiastical prisons remains standingthe Middle Dutch Church , on Nassau street , and it finds a companion to recall the bitter memory of its prison experience in the old Rhinelander sugar-house , on the corner of William and Duane streets , whose dingy walls and blackened beams form a fit accompaniment to the tale of British barbarities . It is vain to wish these venerable buildings a prolonged existence , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It is something , in this progressive age , to have preserved them to the dawn of our Centennial . Terrible as was the condition of those confined in the military prisons of New York , the sufferings of those imprisoned on the hulks were infinitely more horrible . Early in the war a number of unseaworthy ships were moored in the Wallabout and used for the incarceration of American captives . The most notorious of these hulks was the " Jersey , " whose evil repute has never been matched except by the Black Hole of Calcutta . Originally a sixty-four gun ship , the " Jersey " was dismantled in 1776 , and in 1780 she was sent to the Wallabout for the reception of the prisoners . With a refinement of cruelty her guard was composed of brutal Hessian soldiers . Frequently a thousand Continental soldiers were confined on board , and there they sickened , sank , and died by scores . At night the hatches were battened down , and the smothering prisoners slept in serried ranks , careless whether they woke again or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shout of their jailer : " Rebels , turn out your dead ! " History tells only in part the story of those sufferers , but some of the incidents are most pitiful . Two young men , brothers , were confined in the " Jersey . " The elder took the fever and became delirious . On the night of his death he came to his senses , spoke of his mother and begged for a little water . His brother prayed the guard on his knees for a cup of water , and then offered him a guinea for a bit of candle , that he might see his brother die . Both requests were refused . The survivor closed his brother 's eyes in the dark , and then recorded his vow : " If it please God that I regain my liberty , I 'll be a most bitter enemy . " Liberty came , he rejoined the army , and when the war ended he had eight large and one hundred and twenty-seven small notches on his rifle-stock . His brother was avenged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a train of endless woes abounds So many mischiefs in these Hulks are found , That on them all a poem to prolong Would swell too high the horrors of our songHunger and thirst to work our woe combine , And moldy bread , and flesh of rotten swine . The mangled carcass and the battered brain , The Doctor 's poison and the Captain 's cane , The Soldier 's musquet and the Steward 's debt , The evening shackle and the noon-day threat. ** The " New Hampshire Gazette " of April 26th , 1777 , says : " The enemy in New York continues to treat the American prisoners with great barbarity . Their allowance to each man for three days is one pound of beef , three wormeaten , moldy biscuits , and a quart of salt water . The meat they are obliged to eat raw , as they have not the smallest allowance of fuel . Owing to this more than savage cruelty , the prisoners die fast , and in the small space of three weeks ( during the winter ) no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , with 225 men , was put on board the Glasgow ' at THE PRISON SHIP " JERSEY . " // New York , on the 25th of December , 1777 , to be carried to Connecticut for exchange . They were on shipboard eleven days , crowded between decks , and twenty-eight of their number died through illness in that brief space of time . " It was useless to endeavor to extend a helping hand to the prisoners . Their friends were denied admission , and supplies sent to them were seized by Captain Cunningham , the provost-marshal , and applied to his own use . If the captives were sick they were not allowed to send for a doctor , nor were they admitted to a hospital , but they took their own risk of life or death , with all the chances against them . Wives who attempted to visit their husbands were subjected to insults and blows , and many a man died and made no sign to her whom he most loved , in order to spare the outrage of her feelings by British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment at the bar of history , and the facts are only recalled as witnesses to the price paid for the independence of the colonies . Whatever New York lost through the love of royalty displayed by some of her wealthier sons , was more than made up by the uncomplaining fortitude of the thousands of patriot prisoners who perished on her soil . Their sorrows have sanctified for all time the busy streets where trade holds undivided sway . Above the din of traffic the people of to-day hear the dying whisper of those who passed from the filth of a prison pen to the glory of martyrdom , with only the regret that they could not strike one more blow for freedom . The flower of the British army was quartered in New York . The streets were radiant with the red coats of the grenadiers , the plaids and plumes of the Highlanders , and the gaudy uniform of Waldeck , and were continually active with the stirring scenes of war . At first the presence of British gold seemed to bring prosperity . Local trade was brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful forays of the soldiers into the rich farming districts that had hitherto supplied the market . It was pleasant to see the wagons returning heaped up with produce which had been gathered without the formality of payment . The loyalists of the day deemed that they had done wisely in trusting to a King whose Parliament could vote inexhaustible supplies of gold for carrying on the war , rather than to dabble with the paper currency of the Continental Congress , which had so largely expanded with each successive session of that body , that its future worthlessness could readily be foreseen . But the followers of royalty reckoned without their host . There came a time when they had bitter reason to remember their error in judgment . The patriot forces began to overrun the neighboring territory and cut off supplies . In one " dry summer " beef sold for three shillings per pound ; turkeys brought half a guinea each ; oysters were held at sixteen shillings the hundred , and potatoes could not be bought for less than half a guinea per bushel . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suffered so terribly that the " New York Poor Lottery " was instituted for their benefit , and the theater was put under contribution . Sometimes , too , the cold pinched terribly . In the " hard winter " of 7 79-80 , both the East and Hudson nvers were frozen so solidly as to be traveled by teams , and cannon were dragged over the frozen bay , from Fort George to Staten Island . There was at the time such a dearth of fuel in the city that fences , sheds , and abandoned houses were torn down to supply the want of cordwood . It happened , also , that the want of provisions kept pace with the scarcity of firewood , and all but the privileged class were put on short allowance . Potatoes rose to a guinea a bushel , and oatmeal biscuits were counted out to the British troops . Yet New York at this time was not in a state of siege , nor was it threatened by an armed enemy . It was merely experiencing the truth of the patriot promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be surrendered to a king . Perhaps , however , the royalists were congratulating themselves that they were not so badly off as their enemies . They found abundant subject for ridicule in the condition of the Continental currency , and appreciated the joke much more keenly than the officers and men who received the paper tokens as payment for their services . Rivington 's " Royal Gazette " of December 22d , 1779 , says : " Monday se'night was offered for sale at the Coffee-House , a Congress bill of 70 dollars ; the first bidder offered three shillings New York currency for it , the next 6d. more , and it went on at 6d. more till 6s. 6d . The bidders began then with coppers , and came up to 75. and 3 coppers ; at last they offered farthings , and the 70 dollar bill was knocked off for eight shillings and threepence halfpenny . " It must be remembered , in this connection , that the British Government had printed and issued large quantities of counterfeit Continental currency , and thus // our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . One can not but wonder whether William the Fourth of England ever learned that a plot was laid for his abduction during his visit to New York in the spring of 1782 . The Prince was a young and reckless midshipman , given to flirtation , and to the inebriation which found vent in wrenching off door-knobs ; and it probably never occurred to him that in his person the " rebels " would find a hostage worth having . The project originated with Colonel Matthias Ogden of the Jersey line , and the intention was to surprise the Prince and his commissioned guardian , Admiral Digby , at their quarters in the city mansion of Gerardus Beekman on Hanover Square . Two officers and thirty-nine men were to aid Colonel Ogden in his enterprise . Embarking on a rainy night in whale-boats , they were to land in New York near the Beekman mansion , force the doors of the house , capture the Admiral and Prince , and convey them to their boats . The plan was approved by Washington , but it does not appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some manner , the apprehensions of the British leaders were excited for the safety of the Prince , and every precaution was taken against a surprise . Had it not been for this warning , the boldness of the plan appears likely to have insured its success . At last there came a day when New York was to be rid of the presence of a foreign foe . On the 7th of August , 1783 , Sir Guy Carleton ( Lord Dorchester ) , who was in command of the British forces , received orders to evacuate the city . Delay was made subsequently , because of the large number of Tory refugees who desired to accompany the departing Britons . The Pennsylvania " Packet " of September 4th , 1783 , says : " The most authentic accounts agree that there are yet between I 2,000 and 15,000 refugees , men , women , and children , to be embarked at New York , Long Island , and Staten Island for Nova Scotia , St. John 's and Abasco ; among them are many passengers of fortune and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " These gentlemen with royal proclivities had become so unpopular that it was thought a sea voyage would benefit their health . The newspaper already quoted had said , as early as March 4th of the same year , that if any of the Tory printers of New York continued to " use the term Rebel in their papers , a number of determined Whigs had agreed , " that the said printers should " have their ears cropt , if found in any of the thirteen United States of America after the war . " Evidently the Pennsylvania patriots were in earnest , for they closed their proclamation by saying : " This public intimation is given them to prevent their further abuse of words , and to save their ears , should any of them presume to tarry in that country , and amongst those people who have been the objects of their repeated scurrility and abuse . " This courage gradually inspired the long-repressed patriotism of the people of New York . A Barbara Frietchie was found to stand up for the flag of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of British evacuation , ordered a citizen of Murray street to haul down the American flag which waved over the roof in sight of English bayonets , his wife came to the rescue with a stout broomstick , and soon put the infamous provost-marshal to flight , with the loss of his wig . The flag triumphantly waved its adieu to Carleton , and its welcome to Washington . On the morning of November 25th , 1783 , a bright , clear , frosty day , the American army marched from King 's Bridge to the Bowery Lane , and halted at the British picket line , near the site of Cooper Institute . At one o'clock in the afternoon pickets were withdrawn , and the military and civil authorities made their formal entry into the city . General Washington and Governor Clinton , with their respective staffs , led the procession , escorted by a troop of Westchester cavalry . The military procession entered the city through Chatham street , and was composed of light dragoons , infantry , artillery , and a Massachusetts battalion , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was three o'clock when the column reached Whitehall , and General Knox took formal possession of Fort George . In the bay rode the British fleet , ready for departure , awaiting only the barges that were hurrying across the quiet waters , bringing back their defeated army . They heard the salvos of artillery and the cheers of the populace ; they saw the brilliant display of bunting , when , as if by magic , the Amencan flag waved simultaneously from a thousand windows ; there was nothing to palliate their chagrin , and little heed was paid to their departure . A young American lady , who for a year had been a resident of the city , wrote of the scenes of Evacuation Day : " The troops just leaving us were as if equipped for show , // 47 ' and , with their scarlet uniforms and burnished arms , made a brilliant display ; the troops that marched in , on the contrary , were ill-clad and weather-beaten , and made a forlorn appearance ; but then they were our troops , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had done and suffered for us , my heart and my eyes were full , and I admired and gloried in them the more because they were weather-beaten and forlorn . " The time was when New York religiously observed the memory of this event . Thirty years ago Evacuation Day was kept as a public holiday , and all the school-boys gathered exultingly abo*it the military procession with which it was celebrated , and solemnly envied the veterans who had " smelt powder " in 1812 , and to whom was accorded the privilege of raising the flag and firing the salute of thirteen guns on the Battery . Feasting and rejoicing , in public and private , followed this memorable day . Yet the general joy was pervaded by a tone of sadness , which was none the less deep because it seldom found speech . New York was soon to lose the hero who was the central figure in the festivities , and the hearts of soldiers and civilians alike were loath to part with him . On the 4th of December , at noon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is yet standing in Broad street , at the corner of Pearl , to take a final leave of their old commander . As Washington entered the room and met the saddened gaze of those who had been his companions in so many scenes of danger and hardship , he lost his habitual self-control , and with difficulty regained command of his feelings . One moment he gave to nature and to tears , and then mastered himself . Turning to the heroes from whom peace had now separated him , he said : " With a heart full of love and gratitude , I now take leave of you , most devoutly wishing that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable . " Then he added , with emotion : " I can not come to each of you to take my leave , but shall be obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand . " That stout old soldier , General Henry Knox , who had risen from a bookseller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearest to Washington , and was the first to advance and take his hand . He received a brother 's embrace from his late chief , and both of them were affected to tears . Then each came slowly forward and received the same affectionate salutation . In silence the company of officers followed their beloved chief as he passed on foot through a corps of light infantry to the ferry at Whitehall . There a barge received him , and as the oars fell into the water he turned and waved them a silent adieu . Silently they watched him pass out of sight , and then returned sadly to their homes . One other scene may properly be added to this brief record of the struggles and triumphs of old New York . There came a sunshiny day in April , 1789 , when George Washington , President-elect of the United States by the unanimous voice of the people , stood on a balcony in front of the Senate Chamber in the old Federal Hall on Wall street , to take the oath of office . An immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjoining houses . Clad in a suit of dark brown cloth of American manufacture , with hair powdered , and with white silk stockings , silver shoebuckles and steel-hilted dress sword , the hero who had led the colonies to their independence came modestly forward to take up the burdens that peace had brought . Profound silence fell upon the multitude as Washington responded solemnly to the reading of the oath of office , " I swear-so help me God . " Then , amid cheers , the display of flags , and the ringing of all the bells in the city , our first President turned to face the dutieshis countrymen had imposed upon him . In sight of those who would have made an idol of him , Washington 's first act was to seek the aid of other strength than his own . In the calm sunshine of that April afternoon , fragrant with the presence of seed-time and the promise of harvest , we leave him on his knees in Old St. Paul 's , bowed with the simplicity of a child at the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
